1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
Sire, there is no more money.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,800
We gotta get some money.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,940
That dirty purgish harker, that black whore.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,320
You people think we just improvise this stuff.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,940
From the keyboard and stuff.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,000
But no, we have to rehearse this stuff all week long.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,900
And we have to ride this bicycle treadmill that runs the electric generators that make the power spew out over the airwaves.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:31,580
Out into the invisible air where your ears pick up the rare material and strange music that this station plays.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,980
Such as the Hour of Slash.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,860
Stuck in an availability room somewhere deep beneath the surface of the earth.

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,980
The Reverend Ivan Stang, made of pure cream cheese and three pieces of toilet paper,

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,260
has rebuilt his entire personality from a foam-like mug distributed by the Church of the Subgenius through

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:53,360
the

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,560
WCSB.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,200
Welcome to the Hour of Nothing.

16
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,020
Slash.

17
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,300
Slash.

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,980
We had such a good cue there, I thought maybe you could use that.

19
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,480
No, I don't care about, I don't care about creative cues.

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
That's all you need to buy.

21
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,180
For this station!

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,000
There's only one thing that matters between birth and death, and that's donating to this station to keep it on.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,240
This station will be hauled off dead in a casket tomorrow if they can't pay their electrical bills.

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:44,760
And clones of Cowboy Dave will have to quit writing those scripts because no one will be able to pay them $75,000 a year to do this show.

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,160
It costs money to do these kinds of elaborate productions, friends.

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,820
But friends, it's not real money.

27
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,340
It's the kind of money that you...

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,360
You need to make your life twirl around like a little Twinkie stick.

29
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,160
It's the kind of money they give you in outer space.

30
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,540
The kind of money from deep, deep in the cosmos.

31
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,380
It's not paper money.

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,520
Nothing as flaccid and tricky.

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,760
Nothing as...

34
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,080
A milky, clinky silver dollars.

35
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,080
No, we're talking...

36
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,120
Psychotronic, subphonic money.

37
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,880
The kind that'll bring you a long-sleeved shirt.

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,920
This is Reverend Stang on November 10th.

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,880
So-called 2016.

40
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,960
And I feel like I've been being groped by an evil fat man for two days straight.

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,040
I'll get over the trauma easier than most people, but we don't feel real funny quite yet.

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,140
Oh, I have a funny feeling, all right, but it's not fun.

43
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,060
Anyway, this happened to be pledge drive week at WCSB in Cleveland.

44
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,900
And yet the studio phone was disabled.

45
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,020
So I had to send him this...

46
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,960
Generic pledge drive CD that I usually take to pledge drives, but don't play most of.

47
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,100
It's actually a pretty good collage of old rants with a cast of dozens

48
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,260
spending 35 years of pledge drives at two different stations.

49
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,280
But anyway, whenever it says to call the station,

50
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,980
instead go to subgenius.com and push the donate button.

51
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,040
Or do the right thing and buy the $35 membership.

52
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,820
Uh, kit.

53
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,640
Become a proper minister, finally.

54
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,260
And get into the secret good part of the internet.

55
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,440
Both links are right at the top of subgenius.com.

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,240
And you even get to see our classic TV commercial for free.

57
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,580
Sire, there is no more money.

58
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,060
We gotta get some money.

59
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,320
That dirty British architect, Black Morton.

60
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,460
They're here.

61
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,180
A minute.

62
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,420
It's showtime.

63
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,320
Time for the subgenius hour and a half.

64
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,900
The show that dare not even exist.

65
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,340
Join us now as we rocket away out of normal time into showtime.

66
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,900
It's mysterious, evil, spooky, eerie, creepy, wacky, kooky, fun.

67
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,880
It's the subgenius hour of swag.

68
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,420
And here we got brains the whole operation.

69
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,220
Faster signal goes up.

70
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,920
We're in the satellite.

71
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,740
We're bumping out all over the world.

72
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,340
Pretty fancy, huh?

73
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,660
Not too familiar with it, the satellite.

74
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,400
You're buying time.

75
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,300
Time, friends.

76
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,220
Because Mr. Moneybags, he's paying a salary.

77
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,240
A salary?

78
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,200
He throws in a hundred bucks a week and consequently I can't preach against drinking because his

79
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,420
icebox is full of beer.

80
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,540
I hope he's talking about you, my friend.

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,020
Pay us not to preach about beer.

82
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,220
I can't preach against sugar.

83
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,340
That's because I'm a man.

84
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:53,340


85
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,200
Because they all smoke.

86
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,620
For me.

87
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,580
I have to let them out for 15 minutes between Sunday school and worship service so they

88
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,380
can go out and light up a Chesterfield or something or the end of it.

89
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,360
And what kind did Jesus smoke, friends?

90
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:11,780
It's time to open your heart, close your mind, unzip your lips, and bend over because you're

91
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,280
about to receive the word of Bob.

92
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,720
And pull out that wallet, friends, because it is pledge drive time.

93
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,180
Praise Bob.

94
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,940
It's either the last pledge drive for a while.

95
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,340
Or the last hour of slack.

96
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,880
This could be your last chance, folks.

97
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,160
I thought you boys understood.

98
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,180
It's business.

99
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,220
That's all it is.

100
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,660
You still don't get it, do you, boys?

101
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,840
There ain't no countries anymore.

102
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,300
No more good guys.

103
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,980
They're running the whole show.

104
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,260
They own everything.

105
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,240
The whole damn planet.

106
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,280
They can do whatever they want.

107
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,200
What's wrong with having a good for a change?

108
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,540
And they're going to let us have a good if we just help them.

109
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,900
They're going to leave us alone.

110
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Let's make some money.

111
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,920
You can have a little bit of fun.

112
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,980
You can taste that good life, too.

113
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,200
Now, I know you want it.

114
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,340
Hell, everybody does.

115
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,720
You're going to make a million dollars.

116
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,380
Ah, yes, dear friends.

117
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,880
It is, in fact, pledge drive time.

118
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,280
And that number for you and everyone else you know to call

119
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:22,900
is...

120
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,620
In Cleveland?

121
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,280
Yes, it's 6900.

122
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,880
And you can remember that because it has a 69 in it.

123
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,160
That's a secret number.

124
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,580
It means that's like when two little rabbits get into each other's rabbit holes.

125
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,780
And friends, this station, referred to herein, hereafter as this station,

126
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,400
can, in fact, and must be reached at this station.

127
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,840
And I know you want to...

128
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,860
Make us look good.

129
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,880
I know you want to help us look good in the eyes of this station.

130
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,640
You know, it's a student station.

131
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,540
I'm not exactly a student.

132
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,740
Friends, it's so you know what you must do.

133
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,480
You must help.

134
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,880
Friends, if you are listening from Sweden, if you are listening from China,

135
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,840
if you are listening from Japan, if you are listening from Iraq,

136
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,820
send that money in to this station.

137
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,320
And put it to the name of...

138
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,500
Al.

139
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,620
Of...

140
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,680
Slack.

141
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,200
Because if...

142
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,260
You know, friends, if we don't start getting some of those calls coming in,

143
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,160
I'm going to be forced to go back to my old pledge drive tapes.

144
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,120
And, in fact, I'm going to do that right this very moment.

145
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,680
You're going to make a million dollars.

146
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,940
Dear friends, this is your dear pastor, Reverend Ivan Stang,

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,900
calling out to you from the...

148
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,800
Depths of my heart.

149
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,700
And I can see so many of you sitting there hovering by your phones, waiting.

150
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,780
Now, the phones are ringing here.

151
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,700
We're doing great.

152
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:06,060
This time, we've got all the beautiful girls, the mighty, studliest of genius ministers,

153
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,040
sitting here waiting to catch your calls.

154
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,640
They're all busy.

155
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,280
But if you get a busy signal, just call back again.

156
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,180
Because we sure ain't going to turn down a bit of your money, dear friends.

157
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,860
You know that.

158
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,040
That's one thing you can always trust a Bob.

159
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,680
Listen to those things going off in the background.

160
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,560
And, uh...

161
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,680
So, for all I know, maybe these...

162
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,240
Ah, yes.

163
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,140
Oh, we got...

164
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,440
This is one of the callers that wanted to meet Reverend Stang at a cheap motel.

165
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,620
That comes with a $200 pledge.

166
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,720
Yeah.

167
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,360
Ah, baby.

168
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,020
Sire, there is no more money.

169
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,460
We gotta get some money.

170
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,760
That dirty, purgish, hard-to-back, black, rotten...

171
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,560
Gorton, blackin', backin', hackin', mackin'...

172
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,000
Ha.

173
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:45,520
Wow.

174
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,640
Wild, wild Dave is here.

175
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,380
That...

176
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,380
Where can you get an argument like that, especially when your head is square,

177
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:52,820
you're...

178
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:52,900
You're...

179
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:52,900


180
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:52,900


181
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,000
Um, pocketbook is elongated, and yet your listening pleasure is far from orgyastic.

182
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,120
If you were, like, into physics or geometry and stuff, just for the pure radiation sickness of it,

183
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,540
you know what I mean?

184
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:10,300
Just the slamming and banging of the, um, animals as they pledge themselves to oblivion.

185
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,780
Friends, you're animals, too, just like us.

186
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,680
And you need sustenance, just like this station does.

187
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,020
This station is an animal.

188
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,600
It's a shuffling beast.

189
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,220
Uh, shuffling towards Bethlehem.

190
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,840
This monkey doesn't survive on peanuts.

191
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,980
Uh, Pennsylvania.

192
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:24,940
Yeah.

193
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,140
Huh?

194
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,280
Towards Bethlehem, PA.

195
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,900
No, this station doesn't...

196
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,060
Is not a monkey and does not survive on peanuts.

197
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,920
It will not be your big, bad bitch.

198
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,120
It must.

199
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,720
If it is to, uh...

200
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,120
What is it?

201
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:35,920
Survive.

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Survive.

203
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,980
That's right.

204
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:37,940
It's mu...

205
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,420
Like the...

206
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:38,980
For prevail.

207
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,800
Prevail.

208
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,080
To even prosper.

209
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,040
Because you could just survive like a la Island of Dr. Moreau, but you want to prosper.

210
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:46,880
Yeah.

211
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,080
I mean, you want to live it up, baby.

212
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,620
You want to be able to dial ear...

213
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,600
Any time, night or day, and go...

214
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,380
Okay, that's my...

215
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,400
That's my soul.

216
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,720
You know, that's my thing.

217
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,260
Well, you know, it could be that someday they could dial ear...

218
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:00,680
Oh, no.

219
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,280
And there'd still be a station here, but it wouldn't be what they were expecting.

220
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,500
It'd be Rush Limbaugh, the 18th version of his daily show.

221
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,060
Followed by Hannity discussing what Rush said.

222
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,300
Followed by, uh...

223
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,760
What's his name?

224
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,360
Pegwed...

225
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,780
Peg...

226
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,940
Pegleg Wooden...

227
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,660
Never mind.

228
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,820
Followed by dead silence as an EMP shuts off all electronic machines in the North American...

229
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,540
American continent.

230
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,940
As the emergency medical system transpires across all the way from the Canadian Arctic all the way down to Hexico...

231
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,080
As the whole planet shuts down, you can hear the doors slamming.

232
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,540
Are you going to let that happen, or are you going to call...

233
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,240
The door's open!

234
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,160
...the station, baby?

235
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,760
Bathby?

236
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:40,700
Baby?

237
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,980
For 15 minutes.

238
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,680
Well, I guess they're not.

239
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,620
Okay, I'm just going to go right back to, uh...

240
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:47,920
Oh, they...

241
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,560
I mean, when this show ends, if you haven't helped the station, what you know as reality...

242
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,420
Is going to come to a crashing halt!

243
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,860
You see what I mean?

244
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,020
We were playing that cheery music because we wanted to be positive.

245
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,780
But you know, frankly, friends, positive thinking can kill you.

246
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,860
Uh, look where positive thinking has gotten most of the world so far.

247
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,580
People say, Reverend Stang, he's a pessimistic booger.

248
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,120
But frankly, I'm worried that my most pessimistic predictions might turn out to have been, in the long run...

249
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,820
Idiot!

250
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,800
Idiotically optimistic.

251
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,480
And our fear tonight is that you out there taping this show will think...

252
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,240
Will think, oh, well, uh...

253
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,320
Well, they'll stay on the air, or not.

254
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,100
Whether I give, or not.

255
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:45,080
But folks, if you don't pledge, the world will literally, will literally come to an end at the end of this hour.

256
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,140
If you, and I don't mean just some of you, I mean you, the one listening right now.

257
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,520
Oh, you're laughing.

258
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,500
You're laughing.

259
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,740
It's going to collapse around your...

260
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,560
Pathetic ears.

261
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,780
But you nihilistic teenagers out there.

262
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,100
Oh, no future, man.

263
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,660
No future.

264
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:05,320
You know, that's why if the rival cult that wants these airwaves had this hour, they'd raise 10,000 bucks by now.

265
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,360
And you know what they'd do with it?

266
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,800
They'd build concentration camps for the likes of you.

267
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,420
You abnormal.

268
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,640
You, you punk.

269
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,760
You old hippie.

270
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,500
You, you humanist.

271
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,260
You subgenius.

272
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:36,180
You, you, you fy fixing drug.

273
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,560
You walking around the fire.

274
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,580
You fucking addict.

275
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:42,700
And your new LucaStagh that we're gonna start off with.

276
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,780
My son is payin', my konkretb trainings, I Yoo, go to the notca day.

277
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:43,780


278
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,480
Show him that fat, I saw you on social media.

279
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:44,480


280
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:44,620
I gotta pin it straight, right?

281
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:44,620


282
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:44,640
I hope it's not too late to be Ora

283
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:44,640


284
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,620
But's all for our holistic middle school life.

285
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,900
I just can't hold so much back on mobile hockey if you give me a paycheck that doesn't allow Tortax to figure out how to play with Sh mi say.

286
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,820
So friends, you know, the money isn't just for the hour of slack.

287
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,340
And the type of slack you're going to be getting is guilt.

288
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,460
Guilt.

289
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,320
Tonight we're going to whip us up some guilt.

290
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
And some of you are saying, oh, it's pledge time.

291
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,020
Reverend Stang's going to rant all night about money.

292
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,400
And you'd better be afraid that that's true, little Bobby, little gimme Bob out there.

293
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,740
At this level, our salesman can see the top of the ladder and is well on his way there.

294
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,480
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

295
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,820
Hey, praise Dr. Dark, who pledged $19.98.

296
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,960
$19.98?

297
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,900
No, $1,998.

298
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,920
That's a new unreasonable record.

299
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,520
How can we top that from one collared green?

300
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,620
Here's how we can top it when we get one from Australia.

301
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,800
That's who just topped it.

302
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,280
The Reverend Chang.

303
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:56,480
The Reverend Chang smoker listening by internet called all the way in from that distant climb, that wombat-ridden land.

304
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,280
That wombat.

305
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,420
You could hear kangaroos in the background.

306
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:06,780
The sheilas and the roos are all humping together and rutting on the barbie of the shrimp and all of that.

307
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:16,120
And, friend, how come it is that we're getting calls from as so far away as Australia and Cleveland?

308
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,460
And yet we haven't heard from them.

309
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:17,740
We haven't heard from you.

310
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,520
We haven't heard from you, my friend.

311
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,840
You're our only friend that we haven't heard from.

312
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,500
Is it a moonless night, friend?

313
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:30,440
Is the wildebeest crying in your left ear, making you want to go things to your mucilaginous passages you've never done?

314
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,300
Forget about that stance.

315
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,560
That stay-at-home, hate-the-ether way of thinking.

316
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,440
Get out there and pledge your numbers.

317
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,340
You've got to do something, and those numbers are.

318
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,680
No, that's...

319
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,500
Yes, yes, yes, no...

320
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,260
$6,900.

321
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:46,720
$6,900.

322
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,080
$6,900.

323
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,460
$6,900.

324
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,460


325
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,460


326
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,460


327
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,460


328
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,460


329
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,460


330
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,460


331
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,060
$6,900.

332
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,560
That's $6,900.

333
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,380
I hope you understand the significance of that pronunciation.

334
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,080
If you spell it the nuclear way.

335
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,860
Dave here has a pronounced speech impediment.

336
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,280
It's not an impediment.

337
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,560
Well, some not very well pronounced.

338
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,640
It's a high-spirited way of expressing myself.

339
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,400
Hey.

340
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,100
And you could be on the radio, too, just like us, if you could just bribe us with those pledges, friends.

341
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,180
Yes.

342
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:17,500
That's true.

343
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,000
We might even let the numbers of the, what, the evacuation numbers?

344
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,500
Have you noticed that we read your number out on the air?

345
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,720
We give your home address?

346
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,700
Well, no, not that, but your social security number.

347
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,700
Yeah, your entire church name.

348
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,120
And don't you want to talk to Princess Wee in person?

349
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,040
That's not a recording.

350
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,600
I mean, if you talk to Dave or me, we're just recordings.

351
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,580
She's real.

352
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,680
And that's...

353
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,000
And when you call her, you not only get to pledge your monies, your hard-earned scrids,

354
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,060
to a baseball cap for $25.

355
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,640
I mean, you know, people talk about local, alternative, and college radio stations

356
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,600
as if we had some hidden treasure here in Smallburg, Peppytown, USA.

357
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,520
You know?

358
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,880
But isn't it true?

359
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,980
You're it, Dave.

360
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,560
You're it.

361
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,960
Oh, no.

362
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,080
They're it.

363
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,340
Are we it?

364
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:02,680
No.

365
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,300
They're it.

366
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:10,580
The vast listeners, some of them are a little bit too heavy and need to cut down on the food a little bit, but...

367
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,060
That means you're it until you call in to this station.

368
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:30,980
The Radiothon 2005 begins on noon Sunday, November the 6th, and ends on noon Sunday, November 13th.

369
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,780
On Friday, there'll be a special opening.

370
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,540
An opening?

371
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,540
You like openings, don't you?

372
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,240
Yes, orifices everywhere.

373
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,860
Creases?

374
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,820
Dents, grooves.

375
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,980
Like the convolutions in your...

376
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,300
The dents.

377
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:05,000
How often do we recognize the importance of dents as sexual appurtenances or a sexual...

378
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,600
There is an aspect, a sexual aspect to the dent, just as there is an opposing one to the bump.

379
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:16,200
And you can learn more if you call and talk to the actual queen of all the UFOs at...

380
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,020
This station.

381
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:26,460
That's the only way for us to get your address so that we can send you the postcard that reminds you to send the check to this station.

382
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,460
Because you can do that, friend.

383
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,040
You can do that if you're listening to this show by internet three weeks from this pledge drive.

384
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:40,740
If you're listening to this show on one of our beloved other stations, such as WREK in Atlanta or beloved...

385
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,820
Any of them.

386
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,760
You can still support your...

387
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,720
Your local hour of slack station.

388
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
You say to yourself, oh, I listen on the internet.

389
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,580
I live out in Wyoming.

390
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,540
Play that post office box back in...

391
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,420
However...

392
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,380
Send it.

393
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,200
Send it.

394
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,400
You could...

395
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,260
You've got that stamp.

396
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,040
You've got that pencil.

397
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,960
You've got that MP3 of this show.

398
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,080
Write that address down.

399
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,100
This station.

400
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,300
There's only one Clevelandite who cares or knows anything.

401
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,700
All of our fans are from somewhere else.

402
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,880
That's why you, far away, have to send those trickles of surprise checks.

403
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,680
And you can always put some weird little extra clipping or statement in there.

404
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,700
A kissing mark on it.

405
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,480
Some random surrealism to confuse the nice volunteers here at the station.

406
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,880
Some that open your mail.

407
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,560
We've received some absurd objects that, you know, have no explanation.

408
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,660
So please, you know, it's better off with the stained toilet paper going,

409
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,960
than looking at something for three days and having to call in a nuclear, well...

410
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,160
Just do it.

411
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:43,740
Nuclear.

412
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,100
And remember, friends, these pledge-a-thon...

413
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,220
Friends are like radio wars.

414
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,560
They seep down into the consciousness of the average citizen and make him not want to pledge.

415
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,600
But if you want to fight back against constipation, radio broadcasting,

416
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,520
flaccid, placid, overweight, understyled, incorrect...

417
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,440
Overly easily understood.

418
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,320
Overly easily, easily, overly, overly easily understood radio.

419
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,160
Unlike this show.

420
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,500
Connect in now with...

421
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,960
Say, I'll do virtually anything.

422
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,780
And especially to piddle your exogenous zones.

423
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,740
If you'd like to taunt to the lovely princess we are...

424
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,120
Can't you taunt to her?

425
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,300
You're going to get more than an exogenous experience.

426
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,180
You're going to get an...

427
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:38,080
You're going to get an awakening that's going to thrill your sphincter and your family's collective sphincters

428
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,800
for thousands and thousands of years.

429
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,400
And I'm not exaggerating either, am I?

430
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,360
I'm...

431
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,500
No, Dave, what are you...

432
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,280
I'm probably exaggerating a little bit.

433
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,440
You can't exaggerate.

434
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:46,680
No.

435
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,840
There's no way of exaggerating the importance.

436
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,240
Look, if you pledge now $50,000, we'll send you a hoodie.

437
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,480
Now, we all know that that means it's like a really cool sweatshirt.

438
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,940
But in your sick imagination, you could probably make it seem like some hoodlum was going to come to your house,

439
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:13,080
bark down your cattle, cause cerebral damage to your grandparents, and blame it on somebody else.

440
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,840
Or kill me.

441
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,540
Or kill me.

442
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,160
Or you could kill me.

443
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,340
Or kill Bob.

444
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,580
Yeah, you could.

445
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,420
You could just do that.

446
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,360
Instead of calling this station, then just at least...

447
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,000
Look, even if you're lying, even if you're one of those hypocrites, you just want to talk to Princess Wee

448
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,760
and have her take your number down, go to a bunch of work, and have some other volunteer send you the postcard reminding you.

449
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,700
And even though you have no intention of ever actually paying, go ahead and call anyway.

450
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,300
Okay, I...

451
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:38,600
Because who knows?

452
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,440
You may decide that some...

453
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,420
Maybe suddenly you'll get a conscience.

454
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,560
Okay, Officer Sting, could you please step aside?

455
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,000
We have enough of the hard call.

456
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,020
Bob, you want to come over here and tell them what they'll get?

457
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,540
I'm afraid nobody wants to do Bob.

458
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,400
And Bob doesn't want to come over here.

459
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,080
He's just looking at us now with a weird glare, so I'm going to shut up.

460
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,980
There are people who want to do Bob, and those are the people you should really avoid.

461
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,080
I don't want to imitate him in his presence, and if he doesn't want to talk, then...

462
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,380
Okay.

463
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,740
Never he hardly ever does.

464
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,760
And when he does, it usually is some message about Mars needs women.

465
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,620
He's stuck on that Mars and women thing.

466
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,240
And he'll go back there.

467
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,120
Venus doesn't need women.

468
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,760
It's got all the women it needs.

469
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,320
Venus is practically nothing but women.

470
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,120
It is a woman.

471
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,660
So wise up, man.

472
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,760
What are you going to be?

473
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,360
Mars, a Martian, a Venusian, or an Earthman?

474
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,120
Or a blister who calls in with that pledge right now.

475
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,200
It's just a pledge.

476
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,020
It's just a promise.

477
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,640
That's all.

478
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,880
What are you going to do?

479
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,300
What are you going to do when it starts raining, and you want to be the hippest encumbrance on your whole gulf?

480
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,220
And you're just dry.

481
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,680
You're just a dried up old raisin of a person.

482
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,780
You're going to need an umbrella to keep out the sunshine once the sun goes over.

483
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,280
What more could we...

484
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,140
I mean, it all adds up.

485
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,060
It comes to that great fruition, that conclusion.

486
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,160
Everything points to that number.

487
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,560
And your pledge to that self-same number at...

488
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,800
This station.

489
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,500
The synchronicity is so vast, it endures you right as it's dropped in front of your nose.

490
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,320
Ha ha ha.

491
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,160
Six, eight, seven.

492
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,320
A million, it is.

493
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,700
A hundred.

494
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,800
Okay, I'm going to give them no more chance, and we'll just play this.

495
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,800
I'm going to call the same policeman that I was trying to get in, and go out and arrest some of these slackers.

496
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,300
And I say with a small L in the background.

497
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,100
Right, that's it.

498
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,780
The small S for slacker.

499
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,760
These aren't real slackers.

500
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,480
And have them brought down here and give me $40.

501
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:58,620
And I promised to pledge $20 for a white or black logo shirt, and then use the rest of it to buy a beer.

502
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,100
I mean, it's like you get...

503
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,440
And it's tax exempt.

504
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,200
You're tax unripe-able.

505
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,240
Just think about it.

506
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,160
You can currently...

507
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,440
Let's not get into any...

508
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,080
You can crunt.

509
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,460
You can crunt, man.

510
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,100
Don't you see, man?

511
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,120
You can crunt now.

512
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,600
These big girls, you had them those.

513
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:16,740
I'm going to go.

514
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,180
You can crunt.

515
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:17,380


516
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,040
Big girls there.

517
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,600
They knit and weave stories you can't understand.

518
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:29,040
Unfortunately, if you don't have the imagination to supply that part, at least you will have supported this station.

519
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,860
Don't be a nitwit, friends.

520
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,460
Go for it.

521
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:39,560
This station is where to send that check if you're not hearing this live, but on some insane playback later on.

522
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,580
Yeah.

523
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,920
Be a superhero, friends.

524
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,740
Be your own hero.

525
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,620
Be a hero for once.

526
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,900
Can you imagine yourself careening down the slopes in one of those knit winter hats?

527
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,640
You're cruising down those...

528
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,680
You're slaloming.

529
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,120
You're shushing.

530
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,600
You're shushing.

531
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:57,940
Yeah, that's right.

532
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,540
You're shushing.

533
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,360
And suddenly you realize...

534
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Realize...

535
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:01,800
Excuse me.

536
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:07,280
Suddenly you realize you're shushing down the cliffs of Garfield Heights.

537
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,560
You're not in New York State.

538
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,200
You're in Gotham City itself.

539
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:10,720
You're in Goth...

540
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:10,940
Yeah, right.

541
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,320
No, no, no.

542
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:11,840
You're Batman.

543
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,760
You pledged.

544
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,320
You paid.

545
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,940
You sent the money in and now you feel good.

546
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,700
You're good.

547
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,620
You're Batman.

548
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,080
I feel bad.

549
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,560
You're Batman, all right.

550
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,220
You're built for this job.

551
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,900
That's right.

552
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,860
You can see thousands of miles in the future and in the pasture.

553
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,600
You can see things others cannot see and you see in your future...

554
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,140
A $30 large...

555
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:44,240
In the year 1998, the men from Planet X shall descend on this earth.

556
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:53,100
In power and glory to lift up those dues-paying subgeniuses who went to subgenius.com and did

557
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,200
the right thing.

558
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,500
Yes, the right thing.

559
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,720
What will they be wearing?

560
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,140
Yes.

561
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,240
They reached down into that deep, deep, deep pit in their body, that dent in which they

562
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,740
found, yes, the most secret, intimate organ of their body, the wallet, and they extracted

563
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,480
it, and they pulled from it...

564
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:11,760
Gently.

565
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,440
...those dollars that they then rubbed upon themselves.

566
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,520
Yes, just gently first.

567
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:22,160
And then they blessed it against a picture of Bob, and then they put it against a picture

568
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,580
of their mom and their dad, and then they put it in the mail and sent it to the station.

569
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:38,080
That subgenius tongues might air wag and near want for extra pizza at the station staff

570
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,660
meetings.

571
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,960
Friends, when you donate to this station, you're not just helping us improve our equipment,

572
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,920
stay on the air, and make a better signal.

573
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,700
You're helping to pay for the pizza that makes the station staff meetings bearable.

574
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,080
Some of these people actually stay alive on the stale pizza that they eat after the

575
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,580
station meetings.

576
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:02,360
Don't you understand how shoestring these thumbs are and these little, these budgets

577
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,480
are that takes to bring you this great entertainment here on...

578
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,360
This station.

579
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,720
And now, this.

580
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,400
All right, I'm on it.

581
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,840
All the good ol' boys are here tonight.

582
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,340
We'd like to welcome you down to the television mission.

583
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,840
Don't forget, if all you can do is sit at home, then try to keep yourselves awake and

584
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,860
dial the phone.

585
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,140
Call in for pledges.

586
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,400
Call in for pledges, yes.

587
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:27,640
Yes.

588
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,180
Answering the phones this evening.

589
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,540
Beautiful Dr. Saifah.

590
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,920
And the best thing you can do is dial this number that you see on your screen as quickly

591
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,760
as you can with a contribution to the television mission.

592
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,340
Oh.

593
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,420
You revolting genetic accident.

594
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,980
Take your smelly shell elsewhere.

595
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,880
Yes, Dave.

596
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,960
You disgusting creature.

597
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,800
Think of it, Sting.

598
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,960
Even Fireside Theater endorses your church.

599
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,960
Sorry I had to use that word.

600
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,160
But little listeners, you may ask, is there hope?

601
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,500
Listen, you little listeners whistling in the glistening mists.

602
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,620
Listen to these inspirational words from the Book of Lies,

603
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,440
Chapter 10, Bankruptcy, Verse 10.

604
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,640
The passage runs, and I quote,

605
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,820
If you be tired or depressed, if you've got that run-down feeling,

606
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,180
remember, you're not just anybody.

607
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,320
You're special.

608
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,420
You are living proof that God does not exist.

609
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,500
Yes, you, little listener, if you're like most of the people who listen to this show,

610
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,640
are proof that no supreme being could ever exist.

611
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,740
It's a duck hunt.

612
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,420
Uh, Hanson, please, don't, don't, don't start.

613
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,200
Please, please.

614
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,720
Yeah, I'm sorry.

615
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,960
I've got to start anyway.

616
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,280
I don't want to start.

617
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:36,980
Believe me.

618
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,920
Dear friends, I'm, I've got to admit, I'm just too depressed to do a, a good show.

619
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,720
Come on!

620
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,400
Get up off that chair!

621
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,560
Follow me!

622
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,080
Now you can have something to sell.

623
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,460
We all know we're in the art of selling.

624
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,960
We create a mental and an emotional climate of unconscious selling.

625
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,360
Right in your own home.

626
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:12,840
And you could call in and you can talk to the, there's some sexy ministers on the, on the lines tonight.

627
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:19,600
Your prayer partners are here, uh, ready to receive your promise.

628
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,460
Your covenant with Bob, friends.

629
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:31,420
Why, the, uh, the evil, uh, Dr. Zaphod here picked up, he got one from Joseph Prowl for 200 bucks.

630
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,560
And I, I happen to know that that one's not a joke.

631
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,420
Now, I know that, you know, not everybody can, can...

632
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,040
uh, can give that much.

633
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,640
You know, Dr. Drummond and I once talked about, you know, who means the most to Bob?

634
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:47,980
Is it the little old lady who can, who, you know, doesn't have anything at all to her name,

635
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,980
but, but she donates a quarter, her last quarter?

636
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,080
Or does, or is Bob more impressed with the rich man who could give a million dollars,

637
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,600
but only gives 10,000?

638
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,320
We prayed on that, friends, and we realized that in Bob's eyes,

639
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,300
that rich man is the only one that's going to get to heaven,

640
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
because he paid more money.

641
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,160
So I want you to call.

642
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,520
We gotta sell you, friends.

643
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,660
We're not just gonna sit here and talk.

644
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Bob said we had to party.

645
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,280
Didn't he?

646
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,140
Didn't he?

647
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,020
He said we had to party.

648
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,800
Didn't say we could.

649
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,320
He said we had to.

650
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,340
And so, we must also sell.

651
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,540
Praise Bob and thank you.

652
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,940
Or they're destroyed.

653
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,260
When everybody sells...

654
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,560
We're all selling.

655
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,260
...for we all have something to sell.

656
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,400
Yes, everyone selling together, mighty symphony of prosperity.

657
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,400
For we all...

658
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,380
...have something to sell.

659
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,720
...have something to sell.

660
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:38,740
...have something to sell.

661
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,660
...have something to sell.

662
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,360
...have something to sell.

663
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,920
A candy-colored clown they call the Sandman

664
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,320
Tiptoes to my room every night

665
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:53,740
Every night.

666
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,980
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper

667
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,240
To whisper, dear friends.

668
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,740
Everything is just fine.

669
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,080
Everything is just fine.

670
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,960
It's just fine.

671
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,700
When we were born

672
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,200
After this life

673
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,640
We were destined

674
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,360
To make it right

675
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,600
To be determined

676
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,360
And this is our fate

677
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,980
We're singing this song

678
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,160
Singing this song

679
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,360
So you can relate

680
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,540
We are going to save the universe

681
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,200
We are going to save the universe

682
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,860
We are going to save the universe

683
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,320
We are going to save the universe

684
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,920
This time

685
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,720
This time

686
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,380
This time

687
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,380
This time

688
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,440
Friends, it looks like we might actually save the universe this time.

689
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,460
And only it's not really us saving it,

690
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,040
But these fine subgeniuses

691
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,840
Wonderful, wonderful callers who have pledged

692
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,720
These pledgers who have pledged in

693
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,060
And callers such as

694
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,060
Reverend Steve Sinek

695
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,880
The faithful, faithful subgenius

696
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,040
The one that we always depend on

697
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,240
When we miss the recordings of the show

698
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,600
He is the one who has them

699
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,380
Thank you Steve.

700
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,860
From far away in Chagrin Falls

701
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,420
From the bottom.

702
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,120
Chicken Falls.

703
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,000
Much to our chagrin that he's so far away

704
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,880
And yet he can hear the show.

705
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,300
Down in the valley there.

706
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,400
And Chris Sazekas or Sazekas

707
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,020
Sazekas.

708
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,600
Or whatever. Even here in Lakewood, Ohio.

709
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,740
So there are people locally who do care.

710
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,380
But the great Rex Ouroboros

711
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,040
Rex, thank you.

712
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,980
Is, has called in

713
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,880
To help us

714
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,900
From our bridge

715
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,840
To the brotherly sister station

716
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,700
In Champaign, Illinois.

717
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,820
Oh, praise brother Ravoporous.

718
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,560
I can hear the corks popping now.

719
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,460
He has reserved the

720
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,540
Destroy All Monsters video I'd noticed.

721
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,400
There is no blame.

722
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,500
Oh, the great David Bochner.

723
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,540
Thank you David.

724
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,560
He is the David Bochner in Toronto, Canada.

725
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,860
Isn't that nice?

726
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,180
Listeners in Toronto calling in.

727
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,460
David Bochner did not just pledge.

728
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,060
David Bochner put us on the internet

729
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,060
You might say. And kept us there

730
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,580
For a long, long time.

731
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,240
And we still can't leave.

732
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,860
Scott Points in Athens, Georgia.

733
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,320
Now what kind of a show is this?

734
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,780
Did we get calls from so far, far away?

735
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,980
It may be Athens, Ohio, no?

736
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,920
No, no, it's Athens, Georgia.

737
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,300
Oh, I wish I were in the Lamb and Cotton.

738
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,340
And he's getting the Slovenian glasses.

739
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,040
And the hour of slack triple X.

740
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,380
That's a good choice.

741
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,360
And another one.

742
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,140
Here comes the lovely Miss Wee.

743
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,280
Princess Wee brings another one.

744
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,060
Chris Turner, the Reverend Ant...

745
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,160
Oh, that's anti-chri...

746
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,560
Reverend Antichrist.

747
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,820
A turnip cannot pledge.

748
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,580
That's not quite the same as Reverend Antichr...

749
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,300
No, it's Antichrikes.

750
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:46,320
Antichr...

751
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,960
But Antichrist to Mobile, Alabama.

752
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,280
A survivor.

753
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,120
Oh, I wish I were in the Lamb and Cotton again.

754
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,760
A survivor of the...

755
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
Terror.

756
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,460
Of Hurricane Ivan.

757
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,320
Oh.

758
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,240
And Her Highness Hellnoe.

759
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,800
A lovely Lakewood, Ohio.

760
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,380
Another Lechner.

761
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,520
Her Highness Hellnoe, the creator of the Bobby Awards almost every year.

762
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,280
Did I mention John Visnavkas?

763
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,620
No, you did thank you, John.

764
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,260
Or Vinaukas.

765
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,320
But we love you, John.

766
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,500
Yes, Bob is a...

767
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,960
This is a religion of love.

768
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:32,760
So just imagine he has read them and pronounced them anonymously.

769
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,200
Too late for the anonymous ones.

770
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,040
Anyway, thank you, anonymous, again and again.

771
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,760
Thank you, all of you who were and shall ever be...

772
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,960
Mon-ton-imus.

773
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,600
Mon-ton-imus Bay.

774
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,180
You don't have to be monogamous or a baseball cap wearing,

775
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320
winter knit hat wearing,

776
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,300
No, it helps.

777
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,540
aficionado of music,

778
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,100
and diverse talk in spunky rhythms

779
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,000
of strange ideas and beautiful searches into the past.

780
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,400
of strange ideas and beautiful searches into the past.

781
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:58,400


782
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,480
Like when we go tripping down Mam-mammary Lane.

783
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,220
Like when we go tripping down Mam-mammary Lane.

784
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,740
Oh, yes.

785
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,680
There are lots of jugs.

786
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,060
I talked to a listener. There's a listener in Detroit

787
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,520
who thinks you're real smart.

788
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,280
Remember that? We met that guy.

789
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,180
We met this guy that said that he thought

790
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,020
you were real smart and he gave us all those

791
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,020
Firesign Theatre albums.

792
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,460
And that man was himself extremely big.

793
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,140
Brain damaged.

794
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,000
He gave us each copies of all

795
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,240
the Firesign Theatre albums

796
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:26,740
on CB.

797
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,560
And only 72% of mine actually worked.

798
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,160
Oh, really?

799
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,680
Yes.

800
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,640
Well, I hadn't even tried to play 72% of mine.

801
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,760
Oh, I played as many as I could.

802
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,700
Oh, yes.

803
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:40,760
Oh, we're all bojo's around this.

804
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,120
Oh, we're all bojo's around this.

805
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,480
Well, you know, the CD

806
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,420
technology is crude.

807
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,620
Mine is, yes.

808
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,020
And yours, of course, is even cruder.

809
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,860
And then there's your ears, and then there's the stuff

810
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,040
in between your two ears.

811
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,500
And there's what comes out of my mouth, which is also crude.

812
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,660
But not as crude

813
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,320
as the sweet crude

814
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,760
we're pushing, ladies and Germans.

815
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,900
We're bubbling crude.

816
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,900
If Eichmann were a vastly

817
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,880
vaster man,

818
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,020
if Adolf Hitler did all he can,

819
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,680
we still wouldn't hate

820
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,220
you as much as we hate ourselves.

821
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,240
For you not pledging...

822
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,600
What the hell?

823
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,860
As puzzling evidence once said...

824
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,720
Let's get the flop.

825
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,560
Let's frop up so we can get back to hating

826
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,380
the conspiracy instead of ourselves.

827
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,340
Yeah. Puzzling evidence.

828
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,120
I thought you said that. About frop.

829
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,920
Oh, I thought about 40 times.

830
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,100
Hapsifropipulus?

831
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,000
Well, what's...

832
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,480
They can't get any hapsopsifrop...

833
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,460
...fropsepulus if they

834
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,500
pledge to this or any other...

835
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,300
No, I wish, but

836
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,280
that's an

837
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,520
imported herb

838
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,840
that's pretty expensive

839
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,280
from Tibet. Now, Buddhist llamas

840
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,940
or is it just the alpacas?

841
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,680
Any of these different animals,

842
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,380
how do they ingest it? With their teeth?

843
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,920
No, that's not the way it works.

844
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,360
The llamas...

845
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,100
holy men

846
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,980
Tibetan llamas...

847
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,760
Well, you claim to be holy, you know...

848
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,080
The frop only grows

849
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,360
on the graves or droppings

850
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,020
of those holy men or

851
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,380
on the graves or droppings of the

852
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,700
Himalayan Yeti.

853
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,080
That's what I thought.

854
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,420
In America, that would be the

855
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,040
Sasquatch or Bigfoot or

856
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,400
the... what is it?

857
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,380
Homo Hoaxis.

858
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,740
Oh,

859
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,100
wacky, hacking man.

860
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,960
That would make no sense, dang.

861
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,580
Anyway, so if you were a Yeti and you

862
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,300
were just to randomly go out and poop in the

863
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,560
backyard, would there a Dalai Lama

864
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,000
emerge from a hapsopropsepulus bush?

865
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,480
No, but if you... that would be the only

866
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,440
place in your yard where you could grow

867
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,580
the things, the plants.

868
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,520
I know they only blossom

869
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,160
during a full moon.

870
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,520
So... It's like wolfbane.

871
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,300
Yeah. It is

872
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,540
wolfbane. It's exactly the same

873
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,180
thing. As wolf... as

874
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,600
the... the... well, not the...

875
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,580
the wolf... there are different

876
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,380
plants that are called wolf's

877
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,600
bane. So one is like... One of them is a

878
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,360
slightly poisonous thing that grows

879
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,700
in the Balkans or someplace. But that's

880
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,620
anti-lycanthropic, right? And that helps

881
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,280
psychological

882
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,040
lycanthropy.

883
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,560
But then physical lycanthropy can

884
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,080
only be

885
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,560
combated by Haba-frop-zipulops,

886
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,420
which is why when you run out of frop,

887
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,960
you turn into such a bastard.

888
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,600
I just thought you were going to

889
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,580
say, you know, if you had the original wolfbane,

890
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,600
you'd still turn into a wolf after you

891
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,920
smoked it, but you just would think that you hadn't.

892
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,700
But if you smoke real

893
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,500
Haba-frop-zipulops, you not

894
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,740
only will think you haven't turned into a wolf,

895
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,160
you won't. And...

896
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,680
Or you will, but you won't care.

897
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,360
Which is even really

898
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,600
the best, I guess. Well, we're at the deep

899
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,440
end of the pool now, and I don't know if I can

900
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,540
swim that well. I don't understand it.

901
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,580
Actually... I dived right in, and this

902
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,640
is where I'm at. I'm kind of like over my...

903
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,280
head. Or...

904
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,660
Anyway, so, none of

905
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,880
these people have pledged for Haba-frop-zol...

906
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,820
Well, never mind.

907
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,880
I'm sorry. I'm not... Oh, they might not know where to pledge.

908
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,920
Of course, they need to pledge to...

909
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,840
this station.

910
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,040
And are you too mad, Bob?

911
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,580
Someday you'll be the Bishop of

912
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,320
Tinkleberry. Yes.

913
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,580
Someday we shall bring Bob back to

914
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,680
life. We will find his

915
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,540
old pipe shanks and stems.

916
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,560
We'll scrape them out and get bits of saliva.

917
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,580
We'll retrieve the

918
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,540
DNA of the original Bob

919
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,600
before he was killed. Any of

920
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,540
those times. As part of our master

921
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,480
plan, Bob will not only live again... And Bob shall walk again!

922
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,660
...and walk the green earth. He will sell

923
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,160
again! He will sell again!

924
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,340
And you will be one of his

925
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,540
victimless crimes. You shall

926
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,520
own what he does not. You

927
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,620
shall become a part of a vast

928
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,460
invisible fortune, which grows

929
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,580
more invisible with each second.

930
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,280
Yes. Please.

931
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,360
Give us some...

932
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,840
money! Money!

933
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,480
Money! Money!

934
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,460
All right. Arms for the poor.

935
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,520
Penny for the old

936
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,240
guy. Penny for the old guy.

937
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,520
Can you spare a quarter for an old

938
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,440
altar boy, Father?

939
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,700
Can you spare a quarter

940
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,700
for an old altar boy, Father?

941
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,140
That's it. That's it. That's it.

942
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,620
Yes, friends, you too can be

943
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,520
exorcised. You can have the

944
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,560
demons of money exorcised from your

945
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,620
wallet. You can do it yourself by calling

946
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,680
this station and pledging

947
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,540
your hard-earned dollars.

948
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,600
I think at least they should pledge

949
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,520
just based on the fact that we haven't

950
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,420
conducted this pledge-a-thon like

951
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,100
this. We only do this once a year!

952
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,400
Yeah, we only do it once a year.

953
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,380
You know what it really costs to run a

954
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,520
station like WCSB? You know,

955
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,480
in fact, we're not going to play any music.

956
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,820
We're going to boy you to death.

957
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,380
We could talk with

958
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,380
NPR-type accents, public

959
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,220
television, volunteer accents. Dr. Tom Winkle

960
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,360
is here from the faculty accent

961
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,820
department. And, uh,

962
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,640
Tom, how long have you

963
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,660
been working here and why do you continue

964
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,980
to work here? Uh, continue?

965
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,440
Never mind. Oh, I've been at the Tweed

966
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,180
for 25 years now.

967
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,540
That's a nice suit

968
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,320
you're wearing. I was wearing the Tweed.

969
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,000
And I noticed the back

970
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,940
of your suit is all shiny.

971
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,220
Oh, no, that's where I peed.

972
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,480
There's all the back-slapping

973
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,440
you've been involved in at those faculty

974
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,440
luncheons. Want to get

975
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,600
something published? Publish this!

976
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,180
Oh! We need

977
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,560
money! Let's see what was on in

978
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,480
the old days when we had something to

979
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,420
think about. I've got

980
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,640
one hour to convince you how badly

981
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,520
we in the station need your support.

982
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,520
Uh, we have a

983
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,580
special, special form of slack

984
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,660
in store tonight.

985
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,260
Instead of us giving you slack

986
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,660
for once, you're going to finally

987
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,360
give some back to us.

988
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,580
Of course, some of you have been doing so all

989
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,180
along. Praise Bob.

990
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,360
But for the rest of you,

991
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,500
oh, this could be the moment of truth.

992
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,000
The moment at hand.

993
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,500
You have to love Bob.

994
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,040
He loves you, but

995
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,460
you love Bob.

996
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,800
You have to.

997
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,660
Or else what happens

998
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,720
if you don't love Bob?

999
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,760
He'll kill you.

1000
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,560
He'll Bob you out.

1001
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,160
He'll Bob you out, folks.

1002
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,340
You heard it here first.

1003
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,780
If you don't love Bob,

1004
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,720
he'll Bob you out.

1005
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,640
Oh, baby, it's sad.

1006
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,880
Only if, you know,

1007
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,640
if you love Bob,

1008
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,960
you don't pledge.

1009
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,820
Bob, lay away

1010
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,260
your reverend stans.

1011
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,360
Too many reverend stans

1012
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,400
can really make you...

1013
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,740
Dear friends, we need that money.

1014
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,180
Oh, my gosh.

1015
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,460
Let that old goat look at those phones

1016
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,060
light up.

1017
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,200
Oh, yeah.

1018
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,000
We need to do a shake it off.

1019
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,720
Shake it off.

1020
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,800
Can you imagine a world without slack?

1021
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,020
A world without the hour of slack?

1022
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,100
And even almost as bad,

1023
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,640
without this station.

1024
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,720
Because if you don't send some money

1025
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,000
by midnight tonight,

1026
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,360
you're gonna be wishing to God

1027
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,980
you had, or Bob,

1028
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,580
or somebody else.

1029
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,300
The money's no good.

1030
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,000
Just get a grip on yourself.

1031
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,040
The money will be no good

1032
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,280
following the Great Collapse,

1033
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,020
which is imminent.

1034
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,820
Yes, the time to donate is now

1035
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,460
because your money will be no good tomorrow.

1036
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,080
It's true.

1037
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,860
Just look at your money

1038
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,280
sitting there in your wallet.

1039
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,080
It wants to be used.

1040
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,260
It wants to be useful.

1041
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,540
And yet, it's just like so many pieces of paper.

1042
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,780
But if you send now,

1043
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,980
if you pledge now,

1044
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,480
if you pledge now,

1045
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,300
the money will be good.

1046
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,060
That's right, because we have

1047
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,980
a secret plan

1048
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,320
to ride out the coming collapse.

1049
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,440
Well, it's not a secret anymore,

1050
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,940
but we have ways of making the money worth something

1051
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,060
tomorrow in ways that you will not be able to do.

1052
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,340
We have ways of making the money work.

1053
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,080
We have ways of making the money work.

1054
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,220
For it is written in the scriptures,

1055
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,860
do not store up treasure on earth,

1056
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,840
for thieves may get to it.

1057
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,740
But store up treasure

1058
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,200
at this station,

1059
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,400
for no thief can touch

1060
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,420
your money there.

1061
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,780
And where your money is, so shall your heart be.

1062
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,180
And if your heart isn't in this radio station,

1063
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,700
why are you even listening?

1064
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,840
This is what I ask you.

1065
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:19,780
Hmm?

1066
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,980
It is easier for a camel to get through

1067
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,000
the needle's eye than for a rich man

1068
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,940
to make it into heaven without having

1069
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,480
divested himself of some of those riches

1070
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,820
on this station.

1071
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,940
The Saint Stymie

1072
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,800
de Bergerac

1073
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,020
Stymie de Bergerac has called in with a pledge.

1074
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,940
We praise Saint Stymie,

1075
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,720
the greatest

1076
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,960
peonman in all of

1077
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,980
the Coventry area.

1078
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,600
Consider your donation

1079
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,980
a little bit of lube, as it were.

1080
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,060
This will help you squeeze through that eye

1081
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,960
of the needle. We're not asking you

1082
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,620
for an erectile lubrication.

1083
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,660
We're not asking you for that kind of donation.

1084
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,840
You could donate your sperm any time

1085
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,820
you want, and you know what? They might

1086
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,620
give you 25 bucks if it works.

1087
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,880
And you're better off taking that 25 bucks

1088
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,680
and sending it to this station.

1089
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:08,600
And...

1090
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,800
I forgot

1091
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,780
what the hell I was talking about.

1092
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,020
Who cares? As long as we

1093
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,880
get the money and stay on the air.

1094
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,740
We're talking pennies a day.

1095
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,920
Yeah. Like the levy guys

1096
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,000
say, how much will this cost? 100,000

1097
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,060
dollar homeowner. Well, none of you own a 100,000

1098
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,880
dollar home. You own a 45 dollar car.

1099
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,860
But, if you

1100
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,920
send 15 dollars now, you may

1101
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,920
quit smoking! And we

1102
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,720
may continue to buy CDs

1103
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,880
and other... and citizens

1104
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,900
rights and other things. Call it the

1105
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,580
never say quit or

1106
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,580
never say

1107
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,040
continue. I don't know. Yeah, you could play with the idea.

1108
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,840
Never say quit package. Yeah, think of... Is that

1109
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,820
worth some money to you folks? Not only

1110
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,380
will you be listening to this station,

1111
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,980
you'll be smoking its ashtray, and

1112
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,540
shooting its clashes.

1113
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,880
This is radio you can smoke. Yeah, man.

1114
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,220
Think of it. But don't let the authorities know you're smoking this radio station.

1115
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,860
We know you've been doing that. Yeah.

1116
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,940
We got our eyes open.

1117
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,200
Heck, we used to before they sealed that window shut.

1118
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,740
Back in the day, yeah. You know, when Bob

1119
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,940
Dobbs runs out of frop for his pipe,

1120
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,980
what do you think he puts in his pipe? He puts in

1121
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,620
this station. And your

1122
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,040
soul! And you don't have to be as wealthy as

1123
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,800
Bob to support us.

1124
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,200
Oh.

1125
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,040
No, friends, as a matter of fact,

1126
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,840
a tiny little... we've been

1127
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,840
bandying about huge

1128
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,220
figures like $15, $20.

1129
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,100
Hey, $5.

1130
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,080
A $5 check or

1131
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,220
money order thrown into an envelope would make a huge

1132
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,120
difference. You'd get a thank you note. $10

1133
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,120
would make twice as much difference.

1134
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,240
Yeah. And $100,

1135
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,120
well, then... What do they

1136
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,140
get for $100? Lonesome Cowboy... For $100, Lonesome

1137
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,260
Cowboy Dave will come to your house... I will not smooch

1138
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,940
buttocks. And place upon your... No.

1139
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,220
Fundament the bestowal of his

1140
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,300
kiss. No. I am not a fundamentalist.

1141
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,040
Nor will I smooch a fundament.

1142
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,960
I may have one

1143
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,800
as a schnack, perhaps. If you want to kiss

1144
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,020
the fundament... He's not a fundy boy!

1145
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,640
Now, there was a $200

1146
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,020
cheap meetin' to Reverend Stang at a cheap

1147
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,920
motel pledge, but nobody's

1148
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,960
really taken us up on that since a long time

1149
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,880
ago in Dallas. Do you think it's the economy, or do you

1150
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,920
just think it's your disheveled appearance and

1151
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,980
the fact that you've been in the tabloids so much lately?

1152
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,760
A little bit of everything, of course. Yeah.

1153
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,020
I've done a little bit of everything. When the collab starts,

1154
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,780
everything starts working against

1155
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,840
the protean... Peak slack, man.

1156
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,040
Yeah. Was it Sata who wheeled the

1157
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,000
cliff up the hill, or was it Prometheus

1158
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,780
who liked to eat his own liver, you know?

1159
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,140
Not here! Or Wotan

1160
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,480
who kept picking his eye hole.

1161
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,980
His little scabby hole where his eye

1162
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,120
used to be. Right after Burt Lancaster

1163
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,060
or somebody shoved a

1164
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,920
big hot stick in there. Friends, it's not

1165
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,100
easy being a god. It isn't.

1166
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,940
It's a bit like juggling, actually. Some of the time.

1167
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,820
But it is easy to

1168
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,180
be the god of this station

1169
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,820
by being the

1170
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,080
friendliest, nicest pleasure to call

1171
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:51,960
it. The last minute,

1172
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,340
and get in your call,

1173
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,680
your donation to the Hour of Slack. Now,

1174
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,960
if you're really cool,

1175
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,420
you'll do it again

1176
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,280
for the next show.

1177
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,280
Think of it, comrades.

1178
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,980
As we... Where they actually let you call in if you

1179
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,040
have the nerve, or if you're...

1180
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,060
And... If you've had enough

1181
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,520
coffee. You know, a $30

1182
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,960
donation can actually get you

1183
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,880
a date with Bob.

1184
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,980
That's right. Absolutely. Not Bob Dobbs,

1185
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,900
but Bob Dolchin. No touching, no feeling, and no

1186
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,920
Tostitos at the bar. This is...

1187
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,360
strictly a pre-functional

1188
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,720
date, as they used to call it back in the days of

1189
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,920
Bob's a hooker, like you.

1190
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,860
Fondling Bibles. Bob's just

1191
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,980
another hooker, like all of us.

1192
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:33,940
He'll do it for...

1193
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,680
This may say something about him, the fact that it says

1194
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,100
quantity available unlimited.

1195
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,920
So he's willing to go out with as many of you

1196
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,680
ladies as are willing to pony up. Use your

1197
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,880
imagination, girls.

1198
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,920
Why do you think

1199
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,640
they call it...

1200
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,180
Well...

1201
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,480
Well, actually, now

1202
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,980
it's the time to say that you are in fact

1203
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,780
listening to a pledge drive on...

1204
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,860
this station.

1205
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,980
You know, you think in profusion

1206
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,100
about how little there is of this

1207
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,920
activist sort of

1208
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,460
voice in the radio nowadays.

1209
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,080
Too many people talk about their titties, their twangers,

1210
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,080
they look at their history or geology books

1211
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,020
as they get ready for

1212
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,300
the next adolescent

1213
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,780
tune. But here on...

1214
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,780
this station... You hear a plethora...

1215
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,620
Is it a plethora? A plethora.

1216
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,800
A plethora of adult entertainment,

1217
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,500
and you don't have to use your imagination

1218
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,220
to watch those boobies flounce,

1219
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,400
or those ideas come out and

1220
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,260
pink on you. You don't need a placenta.

1221
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,580
No, you don't need that savage placenta.

1222
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,780
What do you think you are, David Lynch back in the early days?

1223
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,180
F-f-f-f-f-fallin'

1224
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,260
around, checkin' things out?

1225
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,660
Nah, man. You're born again.

1226
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,460
Into the new flesh.

1227
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,540
A flesh of

1228
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:44,800
listeners.

1229
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,340
A carnal union of

1230
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,560
millions of listeners.

1231
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,420
You can't get out.

1232
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,360
You must give back.

1233
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,160
Okay!

1234
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:00,840
Action!

1235
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,480
I'll give you your hand on this.

1236
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,900
I plead you should have this. I plead you should have this.

1237
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,340
Now you can have...

1238
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,980
I plead you should have this. I plead you should have this.

1239
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,080
This amazing new symphony...

1240
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:13,580
...of prosperity.

1241
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,120
...generates in the mind of the salesman

1242
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,040
before it does in the prospect's mind.

1243
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,100
You all

1244
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,600
sell something to sell. Everyone selling

1245
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:32,900
together.

1246
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,900
You can call in tonight, set it up,

1247
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,160
you'll never have to think

1248
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,840
again. And of course, a check

1249
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,440

1250
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,860

1251
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,900

loo-joo-loo-joo band.

1267
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,740
You gon' have to spreech

1268
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,900
English, Jake.

1269
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,340
Get right with your muscle snake,

1270
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,680
snunk monkey. Quit spritzin'

1271
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,480

Elsewise your pleatin' bleeds

1275

00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,160
your neither tryin' not to.

1277
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,660
Either way, you're gettin' up on

1278
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,260
the wrong orbit for this kinda

1279
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,360
free-needin' bleedin' side

00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,480

don't you?

1287
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,440
Join gumption's with the true and

00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,480
the sea brave, and pee for

1289
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,340
your job, man, and send your jeans.

1290
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,440
Buy out the gland

1291
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,560
owners with what you earned

1292
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,860
with your skinny peelin'

1293
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,720
face of pain.

1294
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,620
This has been your enunciator.

1295
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:17,680
Thank me.

1296
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,460
Amen.

1297
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,680
Today,

1298
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,380
today,

1299
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,240
buh buh buh.

1300
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,640
Buh buh buh.

1301
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,480
I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer.

1302
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,440
Fear is the little death which brings me...

1303
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,800
Mis amigos queridos, que quiere

1304
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,500
en su vida? Ripesa grande?

1305
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,460
Buh buh buh. Buh buh buh.

1306
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,380
Buh buh buh.

1307
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:54,760
It's a buh

1308
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,620
world after all.

1309
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,560
It's a buh

1310
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,560
world after all.

1311
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,420
It's a buh

1312
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,760
world after all. It's a buh

1313
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,160
world after all.

1314
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,580
This station.

1315
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,160
This is the subgenius

1316
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,960
radio ministry

1317
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,360
hour of slack.

1318
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,560
We are full grown.

1319
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,740
We are grown up

1320
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,000
men.

1321
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,800
We are all past

1322
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,460
the age of reasoning.

1323
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,500
It is our

1324
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:26,920
mission.

1325
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,660
It is our task.

1326
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,640
It's obvious.

1327
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,300
Yet you still

1328
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:35,020
ask.

1329
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,620
We are going to save the universe.

1330
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,220
We are going to save the universe.

1331
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,380
We are going

1332
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:43,920
to save the universe.

1333
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,020
This time?

1334
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,900
Oh yes dear friends.

1335
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:50,420
That's right.

1336
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,360
We'll be saving the universe

1337
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,140
on this, this, like I say it's one chance.

1338
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,580
The swinging love corpses

1339
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,960
want you to save the universe.

1340
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,620
Robert Anton Wilson our special celebrity

1341
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,700
guest star wants us to save the universe.

1342
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,160
And the zombies for Bob here answering the phone want, they desire,

1343
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,980
they desire for you to save

1344
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,140
this universe.

1345
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,800
So you know how, you know that number.

1346
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,600
You've memorized it by now. It's been hammered into your head enough.

1347
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,580
Hello listener.

1348
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,380
I'm your guardian angel Sergio.

1349
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,720
I just stopped by to ask if you were donating

1350
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,140
to Radiothon this year.

1351
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,900
What? You're not?

1352
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,240
But don't you understand how important

1353
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,780
Radiothon is? Let me show you how things

1354
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,180
would be if no one donated to Radiothon.

1355
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,120
See that over there?

1356
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,360
That's this station.

1357
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,720
But wait. Those aren't the same DJs you know and love.

1358
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,880
Because no one donated to Radiothon

1359
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,400
this station ran out of funds.

1360
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,560
When that happened, everyone had to leave.

1361
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,700
And now the evil preppy kids have come in

1362
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,660
to turn this station into a farm club

1363
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,620
for commercial radio.

1364
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,540
And now they're doing a five hour Dave Matthews marathon.

1365
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:56,420
Stop polluting my station

1366
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,340
with those unholy sounds!

1367
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,380
And look over there.

1368
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,340
That's little Johnny Indie Rocker.

1369
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,040
But he's not an indie rocker now.

1370
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,680
Without this station he was unable to get turned

1371
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,340
on to underground rock music like

1372
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,560
The Shins or the Brian Jonestown Massacre.

1373
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,580
Instead he's been listening to Creed

1374
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,560
and Limp Bizkit because the corporate music

1375
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,440
machine has fooled him into thinking

1376
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,460
that sort of music is alternative rock.

1377
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,680
This station was never around to show him

1378
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,500
the real alternative and now he's

1379
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,480
screaming nonsense about the Nookie and

1380
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,440
listening to that ironic cover of

1381
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,160
George Michael over and over again.

1382
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,760
And look at all the blues fans.

1383
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,500
They've got the blues alright because they

1384
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,940
don't have any blues to listen to on the radio!

1385
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,560
And I could show you all the downtrodden

1386
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,540
punk metal, jazz, folk, reggae, and ethnic

1387
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,620
music fans but I think you get the point.

1388
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,020
All of radio has become a swirling vortex

1389
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:46,040
of tripe, drivel, and crap because there was

1390
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,440
no this station to redeem it.

1391
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:49,220
The corporate music machine got its way

1392
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,120
so now all there is to listen to on the radio

1393
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,440
is country, top 40, and Dave Matthews.

1394
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,380
But it doesn't have to be this way.

1395
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,440
You can still donate to Radiothon.

1396
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,400
All you have to do is call this station

1397
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,260
and a friendly operator will be ready

1398
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,140
to take your pledge.

1399
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,440
Remember, every donation is like a

1400
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,160
silver bullet in the heart of the corporate

1401
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,480
radio beast. It's your donation that will

1402
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,280
support us and keep us afloat.

1403
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,180
What's that? You'll donate?

1404
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,520
Woohoo! Go ahead and call this

1405
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,460
station right now.

1406
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,400
I don't like

1407
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,120
status, luck, prosperity

1408
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,200
by blowing them

1409
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,760
off. But don't blow off that pledge

1410
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,620
drive, friends. Bob's promises

1411
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,260
to all of you show the nature of

1412
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,560
abnormal behavior. I'm not

1413
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,640
gonna, we ain't gonna be taking no guff.

1414
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,220
This time, this time,

1415
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,700
this time you are going to pay up.

1416
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,580
You are going to call because

1417
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,500
that sweet name of Bob,

1418
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,660
and the sweet name of Bob, my friends,

1419
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,360
what, what, what,

1420
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,700
what else can you do? What else you gonna

1421
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:47,460
do with that money?

1422
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:50,860
Well, I can probably think of all kinds of things you can do with that money.

1423
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,480
I mean...

1424
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,580
Oh, yes, friends.

1425
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,460
See, if you don't call in, that's all

1426
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,600
you're gonna hear all across this

1427
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,420
nation forever.

1428
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,560
And it won't even be Elvis, probably. That's the

1429
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:03,480
shame of it all.

1430
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,420
It'd be the bald-headed Elvis

1431
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,800
from Michigan, I guess. But you're laughing.

1432
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,480
Oh, yeah, you're laughing, saying,

1433
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,660
oh, I don't care. I don't care if radioactive

1434
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,440
rain destroys all the

1435
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,860
fish and fauna and pollutes the water

1436
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,480
from me not supporting

1437
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,660
the station. Oh, I don't care if

1438
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,620
our, if firestorms

1439
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,800
kill all dormant

1440
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,200
seeds on Earth, making

1441
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,240
regeneration of plant life

1442
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,500
possible. Oh, I don't, I'd

1443
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,620
just as soon get... This state

1444
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,840
is a nation. For free,

1445
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,340
I don't have a spare $10

1446
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,220
because I'm gonna spend it on cigarettes

1447
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,060
and liquor and

1448
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,300
and false slack.

1449
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,100
Oh, yeah, I don't care

1450
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,260
if vast quantities of nitrogen

1451
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,240
oxide dramatically increase

1452
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,480
ultraviolet radiation to the point

1453
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,320
where humans and animals are blind

1454
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,460
and we can't even hear an hour

1455
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,660
of slack with our eyes.

1456
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,320
Oh, just compromise

1457
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,120
your immune system

1458
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,160
by not sending

1459
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,700
not pledging a penny or even

1460
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,840
worse, by pretending

1461
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,560
to be a subgenius and

1462
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,760
pledging but never even actually

1463
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,580
sending the check. Huh?

1464
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,400
Sick.

1465
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,820
Sick creatures out there.

1466
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,500
They don't even care.

1467
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,120
I mean, it is so ironic because

1468
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,720
some of these false preachers

1469
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,680
can raise millions and millions

1470
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,740
of dollars. No problem there. Well, I tell

1471
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,560
you what, I challenge you,

1472
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,780
Jim Swaggart. I challenge

1473
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,680
you, Jim Baker. I challenge you, Jim

1474
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,900
Swaggart. I challenge you, Oral Roberts.

1475
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,480
You see this hand here? You see this

1476
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,440
hand in front of me, Mr. Jim

1477
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,620
Baker? This is called the claw

1478
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,540
and it's got the power of dogs

1479
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,740
in it and the power above. And I challenge

1480
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,240
you to show your ugly face

1481
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,620
here at this radio station and come forward.

1482
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,560
Go ahead. Come forward with

1483
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,560
all your millions.

1484
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,420
I'm ready to have a match without

1485
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,300
rules. No rules at all.

1486
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,600
One will survive. One only.

1487
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,240
One minister will leave the match

1488
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,320
still breathing if one of you

1489
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,760
goody-goody preachers

1490
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,560
has the guts to show up.

1491
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,560
Yes. I'm sitting here drinking

1492
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,440
some Texas Select beer,

1493
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,360
friends. Beer! You hear that,

1494
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,600
Jim Swaggart? You don't drink beer, oh no,

1495
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,140
or smoke on froth because

1496
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,520
you don't know the power of these herbs.

1497
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,780
I challenge any minister do-gooder

1498
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,520
out there to show up. All of you

1499
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,340
with all your TV shows

1500
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,560
and all your bought-off politicians,

1501
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,720
your paid-off judges. Do any

1502
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,680
trick you want, but I got the claw, I got the

1503
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,420
power of Bob and the power of

1504
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,760
Texas Select and you, my friend

1505
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,380
listener, has the power to call this

1506
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:38,840
station.

1507
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,000
Do it. Do it. Do it.

1508
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,760
The times, the end

1509
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,540
times get closer and closer every

1510
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,640
minute. Imagine some guy

1511
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,500
or some gal driving around out

1512
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,580
there. They're tired of listening to the

1513
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,620
same old music on their conspiracy

1514
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,560
radio show, so they try

1515
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,240
switching channels and they come upon

1516
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,600
this. They hear these voices.

1517
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,720
Talking and they think, now what

1518
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,540
is this? A talk show? A church

1519
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,440
show? A comedy? I mean, oh my

1520
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,620
God, are these people serious? It's

1521
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,560
too developed to be a joke. Should I

1522
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,340
kill them or should I?

1523
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,380
Or should I? Or should I?

1524
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,880
Which will it be, friend?

1525
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,240
Which will it be?

1526
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,580
Kill us or pay us. Either

1527
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,960
way, call this station.

1528
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,660
It's, there's some, some have-nots

1529
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,480
out there. I know by definition many

1530
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,620
subgeniuses are have-nots in money,

1531
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,680
but they do have slack and at least, they're

1532
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,400
know what they're missing. So,

1533
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,820
you've done okay by not having money,

1534
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,840
haven't you? And so therefore, it won't

1535
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,860
hurt you a bit. Uh, it won't hurt

1536
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,820
you to have a bit less. And the

1537
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,660
money doesn't go to me, it doesn't even go to the

1538
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:46,600
Will of Dobbs, it doesn't even go to someone else.

1539
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,380
Your membership money does though.

1540
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,680
It goes to keep this station on

1541
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,760
the air without this station.

1542
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,700
You won't get the hour of slack free, you'll be

1543
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,120
like everybody else out there.

1544
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,300
Give to us

1545
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,000
something to live for.

1546
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,120
Anything.

1547
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,640
We need hope now, love.

1548
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,680
Put a rope on the son of a

1549
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,020
bitch!

1550
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,340
Okay friends on the internet, where I can

1551
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:16,540
flog our swag legally, if

1552
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,440
you want to help yourself and the

1553
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,460
Church of the Subgenius and get a

1554
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,380
pretty cool package with like 25

1555
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,640
different nifty things in it, like

1556
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,600
pins and bumper stickers, and

1557
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,580
a real preacher card, you need

1558
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:30,500
to go to subgenius.com

1559
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,220
and click to become a

1560
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:32,900
subgenius minister.

1561
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,720
You'll see photos and a list of all the

1562
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,040
stuff you get, and you really do get to

1563
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,200
go to the scrub genius forum,

1564
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,500
which is members only, and we talk

1565
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,420
in ways that people don't talk on

1566
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:46,420
Facebook. Much, much

1567
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:48,280
smarter ways, ironically enough.

1568
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,380
Isn't that funny? We also have

1569
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,140
things like t-shirts and damn near

1570
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,520
everything you can think of with Bob's face on it.

1571
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,660
That and a huge selection of

1572
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,540
other subgenius graphics

1573
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,620
on coffee mugs and so forth.

1574
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,440
And we sell several very

1575
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,440
weird DVDs

1576
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,540
and CDs of the Bob songs

1577
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,400
and old mp3

1578
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,740
stashes of this show.

1579
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:12,580
And best of all, from our main

1580
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,380
online store, you can

1581
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,200
buy the book of the

1582
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,580
subgenius, which is by far the greatest thing

1583
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:19,580
we have ever done.

1584
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,400
It's an actual Simon & Schuster book,

1585
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,420
22 bucks, in print for over

1586
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,540
30 years, and every

1587
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,420
copy that we send out is

1588
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:30,160
signed by yours truly.

1589
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,620
For that matter, your address on the

1590
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,400
puffy envelope is handwritten by me

1591
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,660
also, so it keeps

1592
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,660
my fingers nimble. That's

1593
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,100
subgenius.com.

1594
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,580
And remember, it's only

1595
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:43,280
money.
