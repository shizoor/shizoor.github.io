1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,420
Turn your knob to Bob!

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,780
Bob! Bob plays a ton of new country!

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,300
Bob's got a hot new signal!

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,640
You can listen everywhere!

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:07,820
It's Bob!

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,580
Bob! Bob plays the most new country!

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,800
Garth! Reba!

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,160
Clint! Winona!

9
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,360
I love my Bob!

10
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,900
Turn your knob to Bob! Bob!

11
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,880
Turn your knob to Bob!

12
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,520
Now, wherever you are, Bob is there!

13
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,860
So turn your knob to Bob!

14
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,200
Alright, let's do it!

15
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,700
Activate interlock!

16
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,420
Pop! Dynatherms connected!

17
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,300
Infracells up!

18
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,440
Mega thrusters are go!

19
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,060
If anyone dies, move the body to another room in the house.

20
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,620
Label the body with name and address.

21
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,020
And cover it as tightly as possible in polythene, paper, sheets or blankets.

22
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,300
What a horrible death.

23
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,220
It won't kill him.

24
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,340
It couldn't.

25
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,640
When mankind falls into conflict with nature,

26
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,880
monsters are born.

27
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,780
I'm just trying to...

28
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,860
send him home.

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,300
Hey, if you don't call it, James gonna hear no music!

30
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,020
Now you wanna all go home or what?

31
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,920
The Soul Genius!

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,840
Powerhouse!

33
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,100
What?!

34
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,280
And now the parade of manly men on the show.

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,360
There they come!

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,900
Chests outthrust, chins thrust forward, each one holding a giant manly mug of myrrh.

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,060
Hyper-caffeinated coffee.

38
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,260
Yep, to get them through the show.

39
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,760
They pour the Red Bull in their ear and off into the future they go.

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,100
Good one, don't you think?

41
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,080
I don't know about that.

42
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,300
Okay, caller, you know what?

43
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,860
This movie, is this the one that has Michael Pepe in it?

44
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,040
It's time for the pleasure saucers.

45
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,000
The six!

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,400
The six goddesses!

47
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:56,900
The six goddesses!

48
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,060
The six goddesses!

49
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,460
The six goddesses!

50
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:04,460


51
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:04,500
The six goddesses!

52
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,560
Well, that's when we took our luggage and we packed up all our worldly goods and we made our way down to the pleasure saucers.

53
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,960
Of the sex goddesses.

54
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,100
Just enough wingnuts and lugnuts.

55
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,700
And when she said, I want you to bring your battery charger, I started getting a little bit scared.

56
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,680
Yeah, they'll be there. They'll be in California. Pleasure saucers will go, although they don't like to go to California.

57
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,660
Oh, something old, something new.

58
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,680
Some pills red, some pills blue.

59
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,000
Why not both, we ask?

60
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,300
Why not both?

61
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,200
I have a cold.

62
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,520
And yet I chose to assemble a new show from new stuff and old stuff.

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,540
I hate to say it, but I kind of like the old stuff better.

64
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,280
Old people tend to say that a lot.

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,820
It's not because the new stuff by new people is bad.

66
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,380
On the contrary, it's because the new stuff by old people is...

67
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,180
just not as energetic as it used to be.

68
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,220
Wiser, perhaps, but not funnier.

69
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,940
And funny is smarter than wise, if you ask me.

70
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:16,880
Anyway, here's an example from Radio Synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland from over 1,000 years ago.

71
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,300
We had our problems, but we had smooth sailing after that.

72
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,380
And now we're here to inculcate...

73
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,280
all of you with subgenius philosophy.

74
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,700
As if they didn't get enough of that on this benighted station.

75
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,900
Well, they get it, of course, but then as soon as it enters their ears,

76
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,080
they start frittering it away, and it dissolves and etiolates

77
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,180
until finally there's nothing but a swirling mist of sophistry.

78
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,660
Because the actual subgenius doctrine, though solid and heavy,

79
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,240
is nonetheless as slippery as a pig at a greased lightning.

80
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,940
Hard to keep hold of, and difficult to retain.

81
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,940
My, my, my, smell that bacon cooking at breakfast.

82
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,580
That's some slippery dogma, but it makes for a fine repast

83
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,980
when you chop it up, smoke it, cook it.

84
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,400
Or you can hang it, and it will get a little high,

85
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,000
but it will be more delicious, and so will you be.

86
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,360
The yummy, yummy taste of the...

87
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,360


88
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
The knowledge teat.

89
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,920
Surrounded in rich creamery butter.

90
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,660
The wisdom teat.

91
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,920
I'm on a wisdom drip myself.

92
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,680
The wisdom ivy drip.

93
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,220
Must be controlled very carefully, because it's a dangerous controlled substance, actually.

94
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,360
What is the spirit of man that goeth upwards,

95
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,580
and the spirit of the beast which goeth downward to the earth?

96
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,600
And do snakes suck the udders of milk cows in the springtime?

97
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,240
These and other questions will be answered later on in our program,

98
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,960
but you're going to have to keep listening,

99
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,800
and we hope that you'll ask us questions by calling in the special call number.

100
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,400
Skis... S-835... Vafnol...

101
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,240
Same as always.

102
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,320
Questions which require an answer,

103
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,580
and now you can bring closure, as they say,

104
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,760
and receive that answer.

105
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,540
So please don't hang back or be coy or modest.

106
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,620
Simply call.

107
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,020
It's just like that number you see written on, uh,

108
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,400
inside of a bathroom stall, you know, for a good time.

109
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,680
Or the one you see on the inside of your eyelids in letters of fire.

110
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,300
It doesn't matter, as long as you actually act and call the number.

111
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,340
Don't hang back and think about how much fun it would be if you did.

112
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,900
For a good time, call J.R. Bogd-Dodds.

113
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,840
1-888-669-2323.

114
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,000
Did you say, Dogd?

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,860
Is that actually a real number?

116
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,960
Yes, that is a real number, actually.

117
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,820
As a matter of fact,

118
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,400
if you were to call that number,

119
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,520
1-888-669-2323,

120
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,120
you might wake up Jesus.

121
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,180
Yes, Jesus is at the end of that number.

122
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:03,520
Wow.

123
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,880
1-888-669-2323.

124
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,980
Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.

125
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,400
I wonder if...

126
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,640
Jesus does snooze at the end of that line.

127
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,740
Either Jesus or Magdalene would...

128
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,700
Actually, they'll probably let the message machine pick it up.

129
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,040
They'll be lying there snoring.

130
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,680
Looks like...

131
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,200
They're not gonna pick it up.

132
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,420
You probably thought this song...

133
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,820
This song was about you.

134
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,620
...was about mutated fruit flies.

135
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,940
To tell the truth,

136
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,060
because by creating mutant fruit flies...

137
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,640
That's a good song.

138
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,040
...with an impaired capacity to suck up the salt,

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,920
scientists have now identified several genes,

140
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:45,100
designer genes that contribute to this crucial sensory system in insects.

141
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,520
Hello?

142
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,280
Yeah, we're in here. We're doing the show.

143
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,680
Designer genes.

144
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,020
Yes, they're very tiny, but the insects can wear them.

145
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,940
This is a Yeti guy.

146
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,280
How do they make them that small?

147
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,880
They have assembly lines in sweatshops.

148
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,680
In foreign countries.

149
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:06,520
Tiny children with extremely good eyesight manufacture the Jordache genes for the Orthoptera,

150
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,080
Ptoloptera, and Edentia.

151
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,900
Everybody's welcome in here, all persuasions and ethnic origins.

152
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,060
...making the customized pair of designer genes for the centipede,

153
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,100
which has so many pant legs it causes an entire...

154
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,000
It takes a while to get one of those pair of...

155
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,280
...pair of pants made, I believe.

156
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,520
...something they have to concentrate on.

157
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,800
...spend a lot of time, sometimes it takes several generations to generate.

158
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,140
...start thinking seems to hang on...

159
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,200
At any rate, you see the salt...

160
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,920
No problem.

161
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,080
...has been...

162
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,600
All right.

163
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,540
...in the physical area.

164
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:51,020
Boys, I'm gonna get you.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:19,760


166
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,920
Got!

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,940
Thank you.

168
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,460
Thank you.

169
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,640
Thank you.

170
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,960
Thank you.

171
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,120
Thank you.

172
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,080
Thank you.

173
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:22,460


174
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:26,640
Thank you.

175
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:46,440
That strange piece was by Reverend Squallus Friday, a new guy, new to me anyway, he just

176
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,980
emailed me these tracks and I listened to about six of them today and they must have

177
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,780
mucked up my mind, man.

178
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,360
Before that million-year-old puzzling evidence show from KPFA Berkeley,

179
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:06,620
now back to synesthesia with Dr. Howell and host Dr. Sinister and callers.

180
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,440
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, not your step-in stone.

181
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,760
Well, it looks like they're not going to ask us any questions.

182
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,920
So how are you doing, Stang? How's your war on God going?

183
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,120
Well, pitifully, as usual, as you might expect.

184
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,920
I mean, he knows our every move, it seems.

185
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,260
Hey, they don't call on the Almighty for nothing.

186
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,920
There's fifth columnists we've got to deal with.

187
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,780
But, you know, somebody's got to do it.

188
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,080
That's right, and Rome wasn't burned in a day.

189
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,840
Fight City Hall and the Heavenly Hall.

190
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,320
They told us we were all going to go to hell.

191
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,360
What choice do we have, really, if we're going to be true to ourselves?

192
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,100
Are we just going to roll up?

193
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,920
Are we going to roll over and take it?

194
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,320
Life's unfair.

195
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,280
Does it have to be that way?

196
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,500
No, God made it that way.

197
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,220
And you, the listener, as Dr. Howell has pointed out before, are yourself the ultimate proof

198
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,660
that, in fact, actually there is no God.

199
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,820
There can never be a great Creator being.

200
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,140
Because there is an obstacle to the existence of God.

201
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,080
And that obstacle is you, the listener.

202
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,100
You are the lump lying in the road to the path of God.

203
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,100


204
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,340
The path of divine communication and understanding.

205
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,300
That self of yours must be hauled off the turnpike, wheelbarrow load by wheelbarrow load,

206
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,960
until the glittering vehicles of comprehension and evolutionary advancement may whiz by unimpeded.

207
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,060
Wow, look at him go!

208
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:45,840
But what is the use of attempting to enlighten the obdurately dull and stupid?

209
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,060
I suppose there's only a short time.

210
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:59,100
There's only a short time left where we can provide some help to those who thirst for peace in their soul.

211
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,240
Well, there's something to be said for being dull and stupid.

212
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,900
I mean, why do you think they call it sub-genius?

213
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,640
Well, Dan Quayle has said that mediocre folks deserve representation, too.

214
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,360
Ask him where we are.

215
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:09,900
Here's one.

216
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,160
Are there really only ten commandments?

217
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,500
Ha ha!

218
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,300
Oh, no.

219
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,580
There are quite more.

220
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,100
A number that were even given to Moses at the same time.

221
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,100


222
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,200
But just left off the slabs.

223
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,200
In fact, some of them actually directly contradict each other.

224
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,660
For example, there is a commandment that says,

225
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,500
Thou shalt kill.

226
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,480
Thou shalt make graven images and serve them.

227
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,520
Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

228
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,260
Yeah, I mean, pretty much everything.

229
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,160
Now, that means you kill them, right?

230
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,040
So then, thou shalt kill or thou shalt not kill.

231
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,720
You've got to make up your mind.

232
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,800
Do you have a complete list?

233
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,660
Well, is it really killing if it's a witch?

234
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,080
Thou shalt not kill.

235
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,580
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's ass.

236
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,480
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife's ass?

237
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:55,980
What is that?

238
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,060
No, no.

239
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,920
You're already getting it slightly wrong.

240
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:07,640
It's like the game of telephone, where information is passed silently between ears of people huddled at a party.

241
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:16,380
And it's the same way as God's telephone line, which has been overwhelmed by static from Satan's electromagnetic pulses.

242
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,180
Well.

243
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:23,240
Now we can't hear the divine voice in its clarity and excellence of vision and wisdom.

244
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,280
Thou shalt not wear checks with stripes.

245
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,880
Losers.

246
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,020
I think that same guy actually calls up 669 a lot.

247
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,820
Well, he's welcome to do so.

248
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,040
We want to help him and all those other poor folks.

249
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,740
Now, you know, the Church of the Subgenius is actually a church.

250
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,720
It does help people.

251
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,080
It does good work in this world.

252
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:54,220
I don't know why we face such a bristling tide of opposition when all we're attempting to do is help people.

253
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,460
We'd love to help people.

254
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,280
No good deed goes unpunished.

255
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:10,680
Well, yes, but the question is, when a solution is as clear and obvious as the pipe-smoking face of an epoptid one,

256
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,400
why do people not rush forward and seize upon it?

257
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,500
Why do they turn down something for nothing?

258
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,700
At least they're not throwing us to the lions.

259
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,620
The primary aim of modern warfare, in accordance with the principles of doublethink,

260
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,640
this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the inner party,

261
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:41,740
the primary aim of modern warfare is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living.

262
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:51,000
Ever since the end of the 19th century, the problem has been what to do with the surplus of consumption goods that have been latent in industrial society.

263
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:58,560
At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent,

264
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:04,380
and it might not have become so even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work.

265
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,720
The world of today is a bare, hungry, dilapidated place compared with the world that is today.

266
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,840
A world that existed before 1914, and still more so if compared with the imaginary future,

267
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,020
to which people of that period looked forward.

268
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,320
In the early 20th century, the vision of a future society unbelievably rich,

269
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,440
leisured, orderly and efficient,

270
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,140
a glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow white concrete

271
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,060
was part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person.

272
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,780
Science and technology were developing at a prodigious speed,

273
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,620
and it seemed natural to assume that they would go on developing.

274
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:48,300
This failed to happen, partly because of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions,

275
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,960
partly because science and technical progress depended on the empirical habit of thought,

276
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,500
which could not survive in a strictly regimented society.

277
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,540
As a whole, the world is more primitive today than it was 50 years ago.

278
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,940
Certain backward areas have advanced, and various devices,

279
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:13,040
always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage, have been developed.

280
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,820
But experiment and invention have largely stopped,

281
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,100
and the ravages of the atomic war of the 1950s have never been fully repaired.

282
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,280
Nevertheless, the dangers inherent in the machine are still there.

283
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,280
From the moment when the machine first made its appearance,

284
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,420
it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery,

285
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,380
and therefore to a great extent for human inequality,

286
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,040
had disappeared.

287
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,040
If the machine were used deliberately for that end,

288
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,760
hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations.

289
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,640
And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process,

290
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,500
by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute,

291
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,440
the machine did raise the living standards of the average human being very greatly over a period of about 50 years,

292
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,920
at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.

293
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:19,580
But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction of a hierarchical society.

294
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,360
In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat,

295
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,100
lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator,

296
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,140
and possessed a motor car or even an airplane,

297
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,520
the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared.

298
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,920
If it once became general,

299
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,240
wealth would confer no distinction.

300
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,180
It was possible to imagine a society in which wealth

301
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,820
would be evenly distributed while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste.

302
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,040
But in practice such a society could not long remain stable.

303
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,700
For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike,

304
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:06,600
the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and learn to think for themselves.

305
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,920
And once they had learned to think for themselves,

306
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:07,920


307
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:07,920


308
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:15,000
they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function and they would sweep it away.

309
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:22,760
In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.

310
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,900
To return to the agricultural past,

311
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,080
as some thinkers dreamed of doing, was not practical.

312
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,400
It conflicted with the tendency toward mechanization, which had become quasi-instinctive

313
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,920
throughout the almost the whole world.

314
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:44,520
And moreover, any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense

315
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,780
and bound to be dominated by its more advanced rivals.

316
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,020
So,

317
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:59,720
the essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labor.

318
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,800
The

319

Always in the end

Your skeleton key

330
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,520
you find will open

Unsuspecting heart

332
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,580
you work so well

333
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,860
And what have you done?

334
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,480
What have you done?

335
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,420
What have you done?

336
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,220
What have you done?

337
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,760
What have you done for the larger world?

338
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,380
Fifteen empty feet inside your bubble

339
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,580
Figure out the least that you can do

340
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,540
Everything you can do

341
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,460
Everything you can do

342
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,740
Bring your touch, taste of your trouble

343
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,020
Everyone you know, someone to use

344
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,160
And what have you done?

345
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,920
What have you done?

346
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,600
What have you done?

347
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,500
What have you done?

348
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,240
What have you done for the larger world?

349
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,680
And we're left twisting

350
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,460
in the middle of the night

351
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,760
We're all left twisting in the wind

352
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,540
We're really left twisting in the wind

353
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,280
We're all left twisting in the wind

354
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,820
We're all left twisting in the wind

355
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,400
We're're all left twisting in the wind

356
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:13,540
We're all left twisting in the wind

357
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,860
I will argue with my lesser angel

358
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,020
I will argue with my lesser angel

359
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,140
Try to hold a candle, not a grudge

360
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,820
Even though I know to err is human

361
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,860
To forgive, divine, well, not so much

362
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,080
And what have you done?

363
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,900
What have you done?

364
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:55,960
What have you done for the larger world?

365
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,200
And what have you done?

366
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,640
What have you done?

367
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,940
What have you done for the larger world?

368
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,060
And we're left twisting in the wind

369
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,500
We're left twisting in the wind

370
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,160
We're all left twisting in the wind

371
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,780
We're all left twisting in the wind

372
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,440
We're left twisting in the wind

373
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,760
We're left twisting in the wind

374
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,480
We're all left twisting in the wind

375
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,040
We're all left twisting in the wind

376
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:55,420
That was Bob Walkenhorst's monthly song, The Larger World, from his Patreon site.

377
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,580
I only use one in five of those since it's basically a subscription service.

378
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,960
Before that, I was reading from Goldstein's book,

379
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:12,480
the subversive book within the prophetic book 1984 by George Orwell.

380
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,000
And now this.

381
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,620
How many subgeniuses does it take to screw in a light bulb?

382
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,380
None. They screw in hot tubs.

383
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,500
Well, actually, there was an answer to that question.

384
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,860
It was something like 5,262.

385
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,980
5,260 to create the mass clustering compression shrinking machine

386
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,960
and two to climb inside the light bulb.

387
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,740
Ooh, yes.

388
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,060
A subgenius joke.

389
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,980
Won a prize on it.

390
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,800
On a rock station about 25 years ago.

391
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,020
You see, the rest of you guys out there, you're just not with it.

392
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,160
You don't understand the subtleties of this kind of humor.

393
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,200
It's no wonder that we lose our patience with you sometimes

394
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,620
because you just seem not to get it.

395
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,800
And it takes forever for you guys to come stumbling and halting along

396
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,120
to keep up with the rest of us.

397
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,180
Well, you got to get on the ball.

398
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,360
Step up and hurry up.

399
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,700
We're just going to leave you behind in the dust.

400
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,680
That's just the way it is.

401
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,660
This is lofty humor.

402
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,860
This is advanced, high-class humor we're doing here.

403
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,360
We're laying some high-class humor on you.

404
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,900
And you're just not picking up on it.

405
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,420
The lofty laugh in the dark.

406
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,660
The sneaker at the end of the bedpost.

407
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,440
I don't know where people think they're...

408
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,300
The chortle hidden in the basket of laundry.

409
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,100
We have them all.

410
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,860
And you've got nothing.

411
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,160
Google?

412
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:43,740
Google?

413
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,680
My pants.

414
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,240
I forgot to pull them off.

415
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,700
It's a killer.

416
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,820
Gosh, a lady.

417
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,360
206.

418
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,320
This is the number.

419
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,900
888-669-2323.

420
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,600
Call Jesus or Magdalene and...

421
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,120
And get him out of bed.

422
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,480
The hour is late.

423
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,980
The moon is...

424
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,380
The moon is down.

425
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,180
I have not heard the clocks.

426
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,300
Come upon Jesus like a thief in the night for a change.

427
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,820
And ye never know...

428
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,620
But make sure you give him a towel when you're done.

429
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,700
And ye never know when the master cometh.

430
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,860
Bob is coming, friends.

431
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,560
And by that I don't mean that Bob was somewhere else and is on his way here.

432
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,800
What I mean is Bob is coming.

433
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,020
When you come, that's Bob.

434
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,080
It's a gerund, Joko.

435
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,200
Bob is.

436
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,000
Come.

437
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,900
Yes.

438
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,100
It was only an allegory.

439
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:55,100
That grinning face all the time that you thought might represent something else

440
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,120
than what it represented.

441
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,540
That moment of coital release.

442
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,080
That moment when the DNA gets its way.

443
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,480
When the floodgates are opened.

444
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,480
And the biological imperative strides forth.

445
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,400
Man, this dirty talk is turning me on.

446
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,240
I'm getting all hot and bothered.

447
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,940
I'm gonna eat.

448
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,980
Perhaps you'd like to look at this.

449
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,140
The official Columbia University Journal of Paleontological Research, page 272.

450
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,240
Look at that spiral.

451
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,860
I've never seen amino acids do that before.

452
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,380
Well, this caused the fossiliferous prong in the case of the ramby coelacanth,

453
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:42,380
first documented by Dr. E. L. Brundage and C. R. Runciter in their reports with Abstracts, 1913.

454
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:42,380


455
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,840
The ramby coelacanth.

456
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,280
Yes, it was in quite a priapic state for many millions of years.

457
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,120
It's a hard fish to deal with, my friends.

458
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,380
Yes, the natives call it Ngobulo Ngata, which means sucker fish,

459
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,820
which is odd since there are no suckers anywhere on its body.

460
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:11,700
But perhaps they were actually referring to its place in the great chain of all things as a chump,

461
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,500
for God and nature.

462
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,200
It's a monster! It's a monster! I've seen a monster, Dr. Howell! I've seen this monster!

463
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,580
Well, you know, to them, maybe you're the monster. Did you ever think of that?

464
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,360
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

465
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:30,980
Yes, all the time. Humans were the monsters! Goddamn you all! Goddamn!

466
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,040
A moment of realization searing a hot flash across our consciousness,

467
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,400
like the kiss of a whip.

468
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:49,540
This is the realization, the moment that you fear to meet when you take that first great leap in the dark.

469
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,080
But it's all par for the course.

470
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,340
Here on the Theological Information Highway,

471
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:01,420
we will relentlessly tell you the way it is, whether you want to know that or not,

472
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,720
in the short time which has been allotted to us.

473
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,040
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

474
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:15,900
I'm in.

475
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,280
It's okay.

476
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,420
My smile is just as deep.

477
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,000
If you will see the sign, you will cry.

478
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,920
You are a child.

479
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,360
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

480
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,320
You are a child.

481
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,820
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

482
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,580
Thank you.

483
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,960
Thank you.

484
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,940
Thank you.

485
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:18,440
Thank you.

486
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,080
Thank you.

487
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,000
Thank you.

488
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,800
Thank you.

489
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,400
Thank you.

490
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,900
Thank you.

491
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,440
Thank you.

492
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,700
Thank you.

493
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,600
Thank you.

494
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,040
But I fear that, like, in my personal flack,

495
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:27,040
respect, it causes me to go against my flack.

496
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,840
Well, the skin is to a limited degree porous.

497
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,820
On the other hand, it's a very good protector

498
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,800
and keeps anything from penetrating.

499
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,340
So it's only penetrable on the micro level

500
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,620
to a certain insignificant depth.

501
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,680
So don't worry about those little holes.

502
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,760
There's plenty to worry about in this world.

503
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,300
But the skin holds us back.

504
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,960
You know, one of the most horrible things

505
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,540
the conspiracy ever did to us

506
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,160
was making it such that over a phone line

507
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,280
and a radio broadcast,

508
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,140
and, you know, words kind of get mumbled,

509
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,440
to say that, give me slack,

510
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,680
it kind of almost sounds like give me flack,

511
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,760
if you say it fast enough.

512
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
Oh, no, no, we don't want that.

513
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,620
That was a terrible thing to say.

514
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,820
The flub genius must be lax.

515
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,240
Yeah, there you go.

516
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,180
See how easy it is to misinterpret

517
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,740
these essential slacks?

518
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,900
So listen carefully,

519
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,760
and we will attempt to transmit loud and clear.

520
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,960
Yes, flax, it's good for you, man.

521
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,720
That's got all the omega-3 fatty acids you need.

522
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,520
And lanolin, sheep oil.

523
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,160
It's better for you than the competition.

524
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,540
I'll warn you of that.

525
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,980
Now, if you want to ask one more question,

526
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,400
we can squeeze you in.

527
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,180
We can squeeze you into a lot of places, man.

528
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,740
Oh, well.

529
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,400
I've been squeezed into very uncomfortable places before.

530
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,540
Yes, all right.

531
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,260
Well, thank you for that thought.

532
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,220
And how about that question?

533
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,860
I have no more questions.

534
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,540
I think that you've answered everything and nothing.

535
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,260
So you're complacent and absolutely satisfied

536
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,540
with things as they are?

537
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,600
I'm never satisfied, and I always will be.

538
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,440
Well, then, you seem to have achieved

539
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,280
the slack essence on your own,

540
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,320
and we can do nothing more for you.

541
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:10,880
Thank you.

542
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,680
That will be $30.

543
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,200
$30?

544
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,600
Yes, that's how much you'd pay.

545
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,800
You know, a couple of nights eating out,

546
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,820
and it would be gone.

547
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,980
But here, you pay for your subgenius essence.

548
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,160
That'll be with you always.

549
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,180
Believe me.

550
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,540
I have so much slack that I don't have $30.

551
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,300
It's slacked right out of my pocket.

552
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,020
Oh, well, it's unfortunate,

553
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,880
because you have set in motion

554
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,340
what we sometimes call the Omega Contingency Plan.

555
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,180
Oh, dear.

556
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,420
But if you'll send in the $30,

557
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:45,100
we can easily turn even these cruel things aside.

558
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,200
I forgot about the Omega Contingency Plan.

559
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,980
It's mentioned, though, in the official recruitment film.

560
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,260
We never should have even started

561
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,200
that whole contingency plan.

562
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,320
I know, but when they don't send $30,

563
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,920
it's like the tumblers of a lock

564
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,900
moving inexorably into position.

565
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,160
It just happens.

566
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,060
It's like the bombers that have been sent

567
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,440
to destroy the world

568
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,160
not being able to be called back

569
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,960
because of a fail-safe point.

570
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,740
Yes, certain ignorant folks

571
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,520
think that you can call those bombers back,

572
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,140
but once set in motion,

573
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,900
they will do their job.

574
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,320
I kid you not.

575
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,660
But I'm sure nobody wants to think about that

576
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,680
at this particular moment.

577
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,660
Let's talk about little leprechauns

578
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,660
hopping over the hollyhocks

579
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,400
and the expression of joy

580
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,460
on a child's face

581
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,660
when under the Christmas tree

582
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,520
on Christmas morning,

583
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,600
they look for little Debbie Toaster Oven

584
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,180
appears radiantly.

585
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,080
Who's...

586
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,440
From PR News in Washington,

587
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm...

588
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,940
...reality TV star inside the country.

589
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,680
It's also...

590
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,600
...34 foreigners outside the country.

591
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,720
President Trump has steel and aluminum imports.

592
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,640
We may...

593
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,440
...but...

594
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,980
...Facebook says it has Chinese Quebec.

595
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,760
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

596
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,480
reports today that this is PR.

597
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,080
Noah also says this is PR News.

598
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,000
Thank you, Fernanda Nandy-Lemur.

599
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,320
And now...

600
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,160
...another Squalus Friday tune,

601
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,780
or whatever these are.

602
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,380
This one entitled,

603
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,760
Beansilvress 17.

604
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,360
All his titles are like that.

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:45,900
Oh Christ.

607
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,280
Oh Christ, I'll beat you brainless.

608
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,980
Oh Christ, I'll beat you brainless.

611
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,420
Thank you.

612
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:27,300
Thank you.

613
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,680
Thank you.

614
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:56,680


615
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:14,840
Oh, here's a little reading I can do from an old children's book

616
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,300
by George Orwell called 1984.

617
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,240
It has some great rants in it,

618
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,260
and it actually has horrible sections of truth.

619
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,840
But here is O'Brien explaining to my cousin Winston Smith

620
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,780
that there really isn't a church of the subgenius.

621
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,280
You will have heard rumors of the existence of the Brotherhood.

622
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,360
No doubt.

623
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:44,560
No doubt.

624
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:44,600


625
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:44,820


626
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:44,820


627
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:44,820


628
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:44,820


629
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:44,820


630
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:44,820


631
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:44,820


632
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:44,820


633
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:44,820


634
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,020
You've formed your own picture of it.

635
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,080
You have imagined probably a huge underworld of conspirators

636
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,400
meeting secretly in cellars,

637
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,060
scribbling messages on walls,

638
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,800
recognizing one another by code words

639
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,720
or by special movements of the hand.

640
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,160
Nothing of the kind exists.

641
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,660
The members of the Brotherhood

642
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,120
have no way of recognizing each other,

643
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,600
and it's impossible for any one member

644
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,880
to be aware of the identity of more than a very few others.

645
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,720
Goldstein himself,

646
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,000
if he fell into the hands of the Thought Police,

647
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,700
could not give them a complete list of members

648
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,740
or any information that would lead them to a complete list.

649
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,920
No such list exists.

650
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,440
The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out

651
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,920
because it's not an organization in the ordinary sense.

652
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,760
Nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible.

653
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,800
You will never have anything to sustain you except the idea.

654
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,240
You will get no comradeship and no encouragement.

655
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,120
When finally you are caught,

656
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:44,820
you will be able to do anything you want to do.

657
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:44,820


658
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:44,820


659
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,620
You will get no help.

660
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,480
We never help our members.

661
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,920
At most, when it's absolutely necessary

662
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,560
that someone should be silenced,

663
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,720
we are occasionally able to smuggle a razor blade

664
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,980
into a prisoner's cell.

665
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,440
You'll have to get used to living without results

666
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,600
and without hope.

667
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,720
You will work for a while.

668
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
You will be caught.

669
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,760
You will confess, and then you will die.

670
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,640
Those are the only results that you will ever see.

671
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,400
There is no possibility

672
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,760
that any perceptual change will happen

673
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,800
within our own lives.

674
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,140
We are the dead.

675
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,840
Our only true life is in the future.

676
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,100
We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust

677
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,360
and splinters of bone.

678
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,560
But how far away that future may be,

679
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,300
there's no knowing.

680
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,380
It might be a thousand years.

681
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,100
At present, nothing is possible

682
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:38,180
except to extend the area of sanity little by little.

683
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,560
We cannot act collectively.

684
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,160
We can only spread our knowledge outwards

685
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,640
from individual to individual,

686
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,920
generation after generation.

687
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,260
In the face of the thought police,

688
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,320
there is no other way.

689
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,320
Well, of course, later on we find out

690
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,760
that even the Brotherhood is just a way to set you up,

691
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,120
to get you to confess.

692
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,880
And now let's go back in time

693
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,560
to the distorted days of February 2004,

694
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,800
to write down the most important things

695
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:14,800


696
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:14,800


697
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:14,800


698
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:14,800

00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,980
we've known about all its Israel Angela and former political leaders on our planet.

702
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,240
This place name is Table T fireplace,

703
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:20,660
the site as in in which our Buddha showed up

704
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:20,960
and the birthplace of social morality,

705
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:20,960

More money, and so on.

713
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:54,020
Oh, yes, well, it is, but there are other things I desire even more in my lopsided vision.

714
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,440
Let's say your desire happens to be more money.

715
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,400
Well, it isn't.

716
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,220
A bell is to ring.

717
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,180
A horn is to blow.

718
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,360
And money?

719
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,240
Money is to burn.

720
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,560
I kept reaching into the envelope, but...

721
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,480
Help, stop, somebody, stop him.

722
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,520
He's burning that money.

723
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,000
Stop.

724
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,980
It was like seeing myself on a screen or in a dream, like...

725
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,800
Not the things like that or anything you understand.

726
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:27,400
No one ever burns money or do the reading.

727
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,000
I sometimes wonder what happens to mine.

728
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:39,060
If you're anything like me, your typical financial transaction goes something like...

729
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,800
The secret characters were too slacked out or just too frapped out.

730
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,240
Too harried by the conspiracy to be even that organized.

731
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:55,060
It simply lets you know that you were there.

732
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:00,960
And there were weirdos like you that you couldn't even trust.

733
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:02,760
Maybe.

734
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,960
Because if the awful crap does come down...

735
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,200
Awful.

736
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:09,020
Awful.

737
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,620
Assholes will gang up to ferret out the abnormals.

738
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:11,960
And elbows.

739
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,020
Who tend to want to just fend for themselves.

740
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,440
We still have major witch hunts in this country every 20 years or so.

741
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,280
He's evil. Burn him. Burn him.

742
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,260
But what? But what if this little society...

743
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,820
This... There was a secret.

744
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,080
Goody Hawkins.

745
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,280
Because it didn't want to become a society.

746
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,020
Because of the stain of your immortal...

747
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,580
But it was real.

748
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,440
...sortation with Satan and his evil...

749
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,620
Even if most of the time it only existed as an inescapable propaganda...

750
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,960
...and odd public behavior...

751
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,040
...that always popped up in the strangest places.

752
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,960
...and then...

753
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,740
Wouldn't it have to disguise itself as a joke?

754
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:58,840
Oh, boo.

755
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,900
To even exist?

756
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:01,760
Their hands and their hair.

757
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,020
I cast a spell on the lot of you.

758
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,680
Why would you want to join anything if you don't join things?

759
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,040
If you're not a joiner.

760
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,880
If you can't join things, it's impossible for you to follow.

761
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:17,860
If all you can do is lead and yet you don't want followers, what do you do?

762
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:21,000
Well, followers don't come because you want them.

763
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,640
They just sort of come and then you have to give them useful work to do.

764
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:30,980
And yet sometimes you ignore your leadership skills for fear of mindless followers...

765
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,820
... slowing you down, robbing you of your slack...

766
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,600
...laying into your hinds...

767
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,020
...laying into your hinds...

768
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:39,020


769
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:39,020


770
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:39,020


771
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,020
...hours of fruitless labor because of the frozen ground...

772
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,040
...many hours of fruitless labor have taken place...

773
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,620
...which could have been spent on profitable endeavors...

774
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:51,080
...and effects that would advance mankind's aspirations...

775
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,600
...in his eternal journey to the stars.

776
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,920
...and others of that ill...

777
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,440
Well, if you did have a thing like that, it'd have to be pretty ambiguous, that's for sure.

778
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,600
The left hand knoweth not what the right hand doth.

779
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,400
I never quite let you get a grip on whether they were...

780
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,060
...I won't let you at times.

781
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,940
...a sick joke or if they were serious or what.

782
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,300
You have the answer.

783
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:18,960
The very fact that they raised the question first could itself be interpreted as part of the act...

784
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,760
...or a communication of this sort.

785
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,760
...if nobody wants to hear that.

786
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,560
You wouldn't be able to tell.

787
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:31,440
I can tell some things, but I am the only one who can see it in your movie theater.

788
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,120
...in my old age, I can't really...

789
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,580
It ain't that bad, I'll give you...

790
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,400
...not as black and white as it used to be.

791
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,060
There's a large gray...

792
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,080
You'd get to thinking, can this thing be for real, maybe?

793
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:44,620
Is this really something that's for real?

794
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,280
Hey, are you for real?

795
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,720
Hey, hey, is this your little church?

796
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,540
Hey, hey, are you Trekkies or something?

797
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,160
Is there really something that's going on that I just don't know about?

798
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,160
What's that guy with the pipe there, is he for real?

799
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,560
Is this supposed to be your little church?

800
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,740
Or maybe I've heard about this Bob crap somewhere and it sounded like...

801
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,380
...just a take off on...

802
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,940
God, not more Bob crap.

803
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,640
...totalitarian societies and sales gurus...

804
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,760
One of the men approached Charles Simon.

805
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,820
...and mysterious powers of luck that had something to do with the slack stuff.

806
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:18,600
Thou fools, thou art indeed whited than sepulchres.

807
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,660
Oh gosh, how could we be getting enough slack?

808
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,660
Having all appearance of rectitudes...

809
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,000
...with slack I forgot about...

810
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,020
...outwardly, but inside being teeming vessels of corruption...

811
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,000
...because of the conspiracy I didn't know about.

812
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,640
That's just so. You will not examine Bob and his doctrines...

813
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,360
...you didn't even know...

814
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,400
...then you must suffer after X-Day...

815
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,260
...while the subgeniuses are seized up...

816
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:35,920
...while the subgeniuses are seized up...

817
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,740
...in the rupture...

818
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,360
...drawn up into the air with a shout and a blow of the trumpet...

819
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,540
...to achieve sexual coagulation...

820
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,020
The conspiracy that's a self-perpetuating robot...

821
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,240
...in the pleasure spewed by the sex goddesses...

822
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,060
...human docility...

823
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:46,980
...while the kinks...

824
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,360
...is that the one you're talking about?

825
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,900
...bellowing on the heaving, buckling surface of the earth...

826
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:50,580
...old story...

827
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:55,560
...the conspiracy that, much like the song that refuses to die...

828
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,400
...the song of Bob...

829
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,800
...just keeps going and going and going...

830
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,200
...of our mass communications mediums...

831
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,780
...there's a dark and shadow side of Bob...

832
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,680
...keeps pounding along like a relentless...

833
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,620
...juggernut...

834
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,480
...flatting everything in its path...

835
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,800
...and you and all your slackful days of school...

836
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,640
...because, you know why?

837
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:12,980
...it's normal...

838
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,920
...and you'll find the true truth in this recording...

839
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,120
...and it's that normality that we must fight...

840
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,680
...the new bulletin number 125...

841
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,460
...always on the green inside...

842
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,520
...the conspiracy itself is that wave of normality...

843
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,260
...how the cataracts are out of communication...

844
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,600
...some people see it as normality...

845
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,320
...will buy you anything for it...

846
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,520
...if you've just been taught on the green inside...

847
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,520
...by the Cinema Educational Guild...

848
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,660
...now they say Bob Dobbs is just a man...

849
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:35,660


850
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:35,660


851
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,640
...and nothing could be more true...

852
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:39,660
...and still are...

853
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,900
...used to brainwash the people...

854
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,580
...he has friends up in the sky...

855
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:45,060
...he's immortal and can fly...

856
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,680
...otherwise he's just a guy like me and you...

857
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,140
...so keep on the green inside...

858
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,120
...always on the green inside...

859
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,940
...keep on the green inside of Bob...

860
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,260
...he looks playful like your dad...

861
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,380
...but don't you ever make him mad...

862
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,680
...just keep on the green inside of Bob...

863
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,620
...there's a dead arm...

864
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:05,660
...and a dead arm...

865
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,600
...in the pillow on the road...

866
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,220
...and Bob's bumper...

867
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,580
...it hit it fair and square...

868
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,780
...there's a twinkle in his eye...

869
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,740
...not a tear as he drives by...

870
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,560
...cause mean old Bob Dobbs...

871
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,540
...he just don't care...

872
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,580
...so keep on the green inside...

873
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,800
...always on the green inside...

874
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,200
...keep on the green inside of Bob...

875
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,940
...there is nothing left to fear...

876
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,040
...you'll preserve all you hold dear...

877
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,040
...when you keep on the green inside of Bob...

878
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,540
...32 jobs,

879
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:00,940
and a goddamn

880
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,860
You may not look normal, but you may act normal.

881
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,700
Okay, that's not what you do.

882
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,480
But don't be normal. Don't backslide.

883
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,660
Bob Dobbs could be back at any minute.

884
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,840
Have a good one.

885
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:19,800
On the day of reckoning, you don't want to find out you drifted over to the wrong side of the battle line without even knowing it.

886
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,960
24-7.

887
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:23,780
365.

888
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,320
Here's something I promised four shows back.

889
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:37,540
I couldn't play it then because it was to be a surprise for our buddy, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon, for his 80th birthday.

890
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:53,560
Gordon was a hitman, working for Bob Dobbs.

891
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:59,020
When pink boys needed killing, he did the dirty jobs.

892
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:04,960
The deal was made in Dobbstown on a bright and sunny day.

893
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:10,960
So he set out from Malaysia to make the normals pay.

894
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:18,620
With Dobbs as his companion, he smoked the finest frock.

895
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,540
In the fertile fields of Dobbstown, he grew the greatest crop.

896
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,940
One tiny hit of Gordon's brought the peace.

897
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:35,960
The pink boys to their knees brought subgenii to Bolivia and slack to the Portuguese.

898
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,800
Gordon the greatest renter.

899
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,840
Gordon the greatest renter.

900
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:57,300
Subgenii slack to serve Dobbs, Doug Wellman and the rest.

901
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,000
He provided for the poor.

902
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,200
He credited Bob protection.

903
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,340
Supposedly the best.

904
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,940
The conspiracy decided.

905
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,280
They wanted Bob Dobbs dead.

906
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:15,240
That son of a bitch, Doug Wellman, blew off the salesman's head.

907
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:22,020
Gordon the greatest of the renters.

908
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,800
Stagg's financial savior.

909
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,000
He co-wrote many books.

910
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:28,980
He wrote many books.

911
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:34,720
They can still hear his sexy voice talking through the night.

912
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:39,100
In the radio waves of all subgenia shows.

913
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:45,120
In the radio waves of all subgenia shows.

914
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,820
Gordon searched Tibet.

915
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,960
For the very finest frock.

916
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,220
For the very finest frock.

917
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,240
Rob sung to Coach a Bomba.

918
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,900
Shared with Sterno till he dropped.

919
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,020
He was often in the jungle.

920
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,880
With Bob Dobbs shooting rats.

921
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,760
To the doctors in the know.

922
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,900
He was also known as that.

923
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:22,800
Happy birthday G. Gordon Gordon.

924
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,880
Happy birthday G. Gordon Gordon.

925
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,920
Happy birthday G. Gordon Gordon.

926
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,840
Talking about the man.

927
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,980
Happy birthday G. Gordon Gordon.

928
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,340
The great subgenius renter.

929
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:50,200
Still recording through the night.

930
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,340
Now that he's turned 80.

931
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,280
He still keeps up the fight.

932
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,860
In Austin in New York.

933
00:55:58,860 --> 00:55:59,460
In Bolivia.

934
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,920
In Brazil.

935
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,860
And in Porto.

936
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,100
Autumn Duel.

937
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:09,900
Heard the roar of Gordon's mighty voice.

938
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,800
And loved it.

939
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:16,660
Yeah.

940
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,360
You can do incredible tricks automatically.

941
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:28,220
Hey, is there any tie between Bob's wife Connie and the conspiracy?

942
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:31,220
There's obviously a connection there.

943
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,220
You seem to have penetrated a simple analog in the allegory.

944
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,740
There's no doubt that the word con in Connie.

945
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,580
And the con in conspiracy.

946
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:43,940
All are composed of the very same letters of the alphabet.

947
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:47,540
You see it is necessary for the subgenius to embrace the conspiracy.

948
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,680
And even to have carnal relations with the conspiracies.

949
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,120
To a certain degree.

950
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:57,260
Only in the interest of avoiding it eventually.

951
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,940
And finding slack.

952
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,240
Hey, we hate to do it.

953
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,540
But carnal relations are carnal relations.

954
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:07,440
And somewhere slack has to be obtained where you find it.

955
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,160
And what about the rest of the world?

956
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:09,680
The, um.

957
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,220
I don't care.

958
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,580
We don't care about them.

959
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,680
We want them to care about themselves.

960
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,400
And then through caring about themselves they can care about us.

961
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,780
True subgeniuses.

962
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,900
Well, they have plenty of things to care about.

963
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:26,580
We know that everyone must love themselves.

964
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,800
Before they can love another person.

965
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,600
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

966
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:35,120
You know, the ones who buy lots of stuff.

967
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,560
Well, you can do that too.

968
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,520
But those are the prosumers.

969
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,340
If they buy what they want, that's the important thing.

970
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,140
You're talking about prosumers who are professional buyers.

971
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,920
Just like Homer Simpson says,

972
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,060
Donuts of the world beware, it's judgment day.

973
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:48,660
Yeah.

974
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,860
He didn't say that.

975
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,200
What do you mean he didn't?

976
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,180
Well, it says that right here in the script.

977
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,040
Are you one to challenge the script writer?

978
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:56,640
No.

979
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:57,180
No.

980
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,180
No, no, no.

981
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,140
That's been done before and those people aren't around anymore.

982
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,460
Few know what I mean.

983
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:10,440
Also, we had an anonymous message that some callers were going to come down.

984
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,720
And I guess they're here now.

985
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:16,420
We're going to interview these folks right here on the air.

986
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:21,140
Sure, when you're a big kid you could drive, you could come down to the show.

987
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:24,680
I've heard that if you have at least three shows on your hard drive,

988
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,100
your computer runs faster.

989
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:31,440
Now the ball gags are placed in 300 shows in sliding speed.

990
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:40,620
If you download it, at least three shows from Serpent X is as much harder to search as I'd like to just say quiveringbrain.com.

991
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:48,100
If you go to www.quiveringbrain.com and find the link for the Puzzling Evidence show.

992
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,360
Is that Puzzling Evidence plus P show?

993
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:52,540
Is that the one you're...

994
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:53,660
Well, they're all there.

995
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:54,980
Even the ones without P.

996
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:55,580
Oh.

997
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:57,380
I did.

998
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,100
P and Slack, same stuff.

999
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,280
It can be.

1000
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,980
I just want to know three things.

1001
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,840
P, damn, ass.

1002
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,540
What does that have to do with anything?

1003
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,600
That's what I've got to find out.

1004
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:15,060
And that's your challenge here at the last waning few minutes of the show.

1005
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,240
Rewinding the show here, getting ready for the end.

1006
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,640
I'm going to put away my stuff.

1007
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,840
No, you can't call because you've already called.

1008
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,420
Because your mom said so, end of show.

1009
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:23,640
All of your...

1010
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,320
I'm going to call right now.

1011
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:25,820
End of show.

1012
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,580
You have to hang up and call back to call.

1013
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,600
Oh, I almost forgot.

1014
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,360
Friends, the very first thing we heard on this show, Turn Your Knob to Bob, was brought

1015
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,460
to us by Reverend 47.

1016
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:41,980
Thank you, Reverend 47.

1017
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,320
Price Bob.
