Excuse me.

3
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:52,080
Yes, well now, had you been alive at 3am on the 3rd of autumn and switched on your wireless, you would have heard this.

4
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,060
It wasn't much of a program, was it?

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,840
If you had tuned in at 9 o'clock, you would have heard...

6
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,540
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

7
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:18,980
Excuse me.

8
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,980
I don't like what he's doing, Pat, I don't like it.

9
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,400
We ought to have a meeting about it.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,880
Once that record of sheep is being played, here are the remains of a goonshow washed up on a brighton beach near Croydon.

11
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,420
Yes, yes, yes.

12
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,900
And in faded writing, we see that the title is...

00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:41,780
Now, tonight's hour of slack, number 215, is going to be a real good old-fashioned black-eyed

46
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:48,540
pea-eating, Bible-thumping, hoo-ah-down in celebration of Bob's eardrums as well as the

47
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,080
New Year.

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,180
In fact, it's not really even New Year's in Texas right now as I say this, but as you

49
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,300
listen now.

50
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:02,320
Now, it isn't the New Year right now, not unless you're listening in Texas where it's

51
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,880
New Year's Eve.

52
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,160
In fact, it's always New Year's Eve for everybody except me since I'm not actually in the studio

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,520
tonight.

54
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,660
I'm at home pre-editing this show yesterday because I don't want to go into work on New

55
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,040
Year's Eve.

56
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,720
I want to party and I suggest you do too.

57
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,040
And with that in mind, for that matter, we don't even know who you are.

58
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:32,280
So instead of preaching the words, the words of Bob tonight, we're just going to play

59
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,540
music.

60
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:50,400
But not just any music, nay, but the music of noise and sound effects and like driving

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,720
head-on into a plate glass window at 90 miles an hour with Doctors for Bob turned up all

62
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,040
the way.

63
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
And you're broke, Fran.

64
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,980
Brand car stereo.

65
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,200
Okay.

66
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,800
Oh, just some party sound.

67
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,180
It's, Bob will be in there because Bob will be the pleasure and the pain that your eardrums

68
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,420
feel.

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,480
It's what you might call Dob's house music.

70
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,620
And unless you're listening in your car, I suggest that if you possibly can, listen to

71
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,020
this show.

72
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:37,600
This is a subgenius radio ministry that is designed strictly for the pleasure of starting

73
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:47,000
from the outer ear in to where the nerve centers for both ears meet a small pocket of flesh

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,080
brain tissue, which will in fact, if you use the headphones or listen on good stereo separated

75
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,020
speakers, shall be able to hear you.

76
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,740
Be ripped in pain by the music.

77
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:08,120
Because what's coming up is an ear raping tidal surge of slack full noise music.

78
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,200
And Dob's league chaos.

79
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,960
And you need the headphones for protection in case the sound waves splash too hard against

80
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,320
the inner ear.

81
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,880
Okay.

82
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,340
It's a tape edited show.

83
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,900
There's no one in the studio and you can't call us.

84
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,340
And we don't even care about your prayers.

85
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,480
We're not taking them because we're out partying.

86
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:44,340
But do not worry if the show appears to make no sense or to make no mention of Bob because

87
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,180
if it did make sense, it would not be of Bob.

88
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,640
Indeed, though this is not very explanatory hour of slack, I do think that it will nevertheless

89
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,120
be.

90
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,340
In fact, it's the first time in my life that he has become one of the most cherished by

91
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,520
our group and my e-pop JR Bob Dobs himself.

92
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:08,580
The logrin and push in and니 and Bob and the sake exciting to enjoy À large and

93
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:08,580


94
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:08,580


95
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,420
OK, then's the first time in about ten years and two przez well.

96
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,220
So there he is.

97
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:22,420
And skaloy the dirt in vardı ág 중is of Bayerol.

98
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:22,420


99
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,680
KILLER THAN GOD

100
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,300

101
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,360

102
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,340

103
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,260
KILLER THAN JESUS

104
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,640
I've been executed at once.

105
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,700
Yes sir.

106
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,880
Come along.

107
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,620
This sort of behaviour is demoralising for the ordinary soldiers and citizens who are trying to lead normal, simple, unexceptional lives.

108
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,860
Nothing's difficult enough as it is without these emotional people walking the boat.

109
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,200
Bop

110
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,080
I'm afraid, sir, you have rather a weak grasp of a reality.

111
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:14,380
Your reality, sir, is lies and balderdash, and I'm delighted to say that I have no grasp of it whatsoever!

112
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,140
The

113
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't believe you're listening.

114
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,920
Good in Jesus.

115
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,700
Good in Jesus.

116
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,060
Good in Jesus.

117
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,260
Good in Jesus.

118
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,380
Good in Jesus.

119
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,700
Good in Jesus.

120
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,340
Good in Jesus.

121
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,920
Good in Jesus.

122
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,040
They're just manipulating bigger.

123
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:33,600
Hey!

124
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,580
No one, I.

125
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,400
Hold it right here.

126
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,420
I didn't say can you,

127
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:38,720
Can you,

128
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,580
But there be,

129
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,120
I'm manipulating your eyes all the time.

130
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,320
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

131
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,240
Hey, Missy.

132
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,740
Come on. Come on, baby.

133
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,780
Come on, baby. You can do it.

134
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,060
Come on. Come on, baby.

135
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,320
Isn't that nice?

136
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,480
I'm the one who takes the fall.

137
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,060
The ACDC doll.

138
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,820
I'm the one who takes the fall.

139
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,360
The ACDC doll.

140
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,220
To the Jesus.

141
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,500
To the Jesus.

142
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,760
You got that right.

143
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,640
You got that right.

144
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,420
You got that right.

145
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,460
You got that right.

146
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,220
You got that right.

147
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,240
You got that right.

148
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,740
You got that right.

149
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,900
I don't believe you listen.

150
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,320
Alright, now look at me.

151
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,440
I said look at me, don't turn your face away.

152
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,880
I'm the looking glass you're feeling to see yourself in.

153
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,140
I'm the looking glass.

Thank you to our sponsor in walk front beauty from the last video.

Thank you to Joanna Beck from Numbers Duomo.

Thank you to today's sponsor.

00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:39,560


160
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,140
I was raised to be someone

161
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,320
All right, all right, everything!

162
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,360
Can you take a name of your senses?

163
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,640
Don't look at me..

164
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,460
Don't look at me..

165
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,980
Don't look at me..

166
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,240
Somebody's lying and it's not me

167
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,760
Somebody's lying and it's not me

168
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,000
Twisting my words

169
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,400
Somebody's lying and it's not me

170
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,380
That was

171
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,640
My life with the thrill kill cult

172
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,120
Hurry, but hurry, but hurry, but hurry

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,560
Then go insane.

184
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,340
Then go insane.

185
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,540
And eventually...

186
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,940
You're tired.

187
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,200
You're beaten down.

188
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,480
You're irritable.

189
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,920
Your mental and physical health are suffering.

190
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,680
Is there any escape?

191
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,180
Is there any escape?

192
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,940
And that was Negative Land. Thank you.

193
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,820
We must feel the inner agony.

194
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,820
We must be Peaceful.

195
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,480
We must think aboveining.

196
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:48,520
We must live a wise life.

197
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:48,920
Lord.

198
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,320
Don't be afraid.

199
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:02,620
The God of Death saith IT.

Very sporadic

220
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,260
Yes

221
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,220
Yeah

222
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:25,800
Yes

Wee-wee-wee, we're on our way.

237
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,880
We're on our way.

238
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,500
Last time, they thought we'd leave.

239
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,880
I amék.

240
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:41,380


241
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,760
Thank you.

242
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,320
Thank you.

243
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,860
Thank you.

244
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,300
Thank you.

245
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,540
Thank you.

246
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,480
That was TGT.

247
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,720
Your floor, sir.

248
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,860
Thank you.

249
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:50,840
Thank you.

250
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,200
Thank you.

251
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,040
Thank you.

252
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:25,860
Thank you.

253
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,220
Thank you.

254
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,040
Thank you.

255
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,780
Good night.

256
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:20,660


257
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:20,660


258
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,240
The men of goodwill must join together.

259
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:55,860
Men of all races and creeds and color and political persuasion.

260
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,180
And we hope you'll sing along, too.

261
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,160
We hope you'll sing along, too.

262
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,740
Remember, this is the kind of music that you can create on your own.

263
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,240
Strings are on track one.

264
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,040
The melody is on track two.

265
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,380
Synthesizer bass on track three.

266
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,220
And rhythm is on track four.

267
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,960
Men of goodwill.

268
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,340
Men of goodwill.

269
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,220
Men of goodwill.

270
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,440
Men of goodwill must join together.

271
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,880
.

272
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:57,880


273
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,980
.

274
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
.

275
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,380
.

276
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:04,400
.

277
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:04,400


278
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:04,400


279
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:04,400


280
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:04,400


281
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,120
.

282
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,160
.

283
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,160


284
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,640
.

285
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,040
.

286
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,040


287
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,220
.

288
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,900
Finally, let's see what we can do with a rich, vibrant synthesizer sound.

289
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,800
Greater than one.

290
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,280
Here's one.

291
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:33,700
One.

292
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,480
And one.

293
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:34,880
Here's one.

294
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,220
Greater than one.

295
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,980
Oh, you won't want to miss this, Arnie.

296
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,500
It reminds me of my school days in England.

297
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:40,940
You know, I don't want to miss this.

298
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,380
I'm a modern man, these days I find.

299
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,800
You have to be awfully cruel to be kind.

300
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:52,180
I'm a modern man, you will agree.

301
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,960
It's either you or me.

302
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,740
Well, time's nearly up, I think.

303
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,180
I think.

304
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,680
Okay.

305
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,900
Not late, am I?

306
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,780
Fire!

307
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,640
Ladies, I shall require your assistance.

308
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,560
Of course.

309
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,560
Anything.

310
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,900
Tell us what to do.

311
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,640
Kindly.

312
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,120
Maybe so good as to remove your knickers.

313
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,580
That's a good day, sir.

314
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,140
Amaya!

315
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,200
Yoo-hoo!

316
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,120
Love a boy!

317
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:24,720
Isinahina!

318
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,600
This way.

319
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,620
Mama!

320
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:39,220
Hmm.

321
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,500
Come!

322
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,700
Come to me now!

323
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,620
Hubba hubba hubba!

324
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,760
A lot of meat, not a one-sail!

325
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,480
Ah! I've been missed!

326
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,620
Ha ha ha!

327
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,760
Remember me, Eddie?

328
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:49,900
When I killed your mother, I talked just like Bob!

329
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:25,720
OK, I know!

330
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:25,720


331
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:25,720


332
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:25,720


333
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:25,720


334
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:30,260
Uh huh

335
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:30,420
The

336
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,620
What did you say?

337
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:40,620


338
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:44,500
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang...

339
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,140
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang...

340
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,900
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang...

341
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:53,260
Bang!

342
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,040
Well, there you are, taking you over with a good bang now and then.

343
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:12,620
Bang!

344
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:26,900
Once upon a time there was a little girl called Little Red Riding Hood.

345
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:33,460
She lived in a small village on the edge of the forest.

346
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,400
She was a little, stupid goat.

347
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,600
And her father raped her.

348
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,460
And she raped her four times a week.

349
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,400
But she was innocent and pious.

350
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,720
And she loved her parents very much.

351
00:49:51,300 --> 00:50:02,060
She had sun-dressed hair, eyes like olives, and a upper-body that was unimaginable.

352
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:09,120
Every Sunday she would go out with her grandmother.

353
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,480
She would wear

354
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:40,860
i

355
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:40,880
more

356
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:40,960
more

357
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:08,440
Oh, is it cold?

358
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:16,600
Oh, is it cold?

359
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,520
Oh, is it cold?

360
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,940
Oh, is it cold?

361
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:10,360
Oh, is it cold?

362
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:27,840
Oh, is it cold?

363
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,920
Oh, is it cold?

364
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:37,460
Oh, is it cold?

365
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:09,080
Oh, is it cold?

366
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:40,000
Oh, is it cold?

367
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,200
Oh, oh

368
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:42,920
Moon as the clouds

369
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,140
Oh, a Boom as a guiding

370
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,400
School, my master

371
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,700
Moon as the clouds

372
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,400
Uh oh

373
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,100
What if the place in my mind

374
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,440
That isn't 될 kind

375
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,740

Well, I'm sure I'm forgetting something,

00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,000
but what you've been listening to,

395
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:45,420
has been the soundtrack of Baron Munchausen, of course, Roger Rabbit.

396
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,960
And what's been tying all the little bits and pieces together

397
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,440
are the sound effects music of Negative Land,

398
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:58,780
specifically off of Negative Land, a Big Ten 8 Place album.

399
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,200
There were bits by the Gyuto Monks,

400
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,860
some Russian Cathedral liturgical songs,

401
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,300
stuff from the Plunder Phonics material from Mystery Tapes,

402
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:12,940
