1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Ah! It's on. It has begun.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,460
And...

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:16,480
And you know, friends, it's patently impossible to discuss social engineering or the automation of society,

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:23,280
the engineering of social automation systems, silent weapons, you might say,

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:33,720
on a national or worldwide scale without implying extensive objectives of social control and destruction of human life,

6
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,100
for example, slavery and genocide.

7
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,700
This show is in itself an analog declaration of intent.

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,380
Such a show must be secured from public scrutiny.

9
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,700
Otherwise, it might be recognized as a technically formal,

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,140
declaration of domestic war.

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,260
Furthermore, any person or group of persons in a position of great power

12
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:09,020
and without full knowledge and considering the public uses such knowledge and methodology for economic conquest,

13
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:18,760
it must be understood that a state of domestic warfare exists between said person or group of persons and the public.

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,260
The solution of today's...

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:32,700
problems requires an approach which is ruthlessly candid with no agonizing over religious,

16
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,160
moral, or cultural values.

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,320
You have qualified for this project because of your ability to look at human society with cold

18
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,220
objectivity

19
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,260
and yet analyze and discuss your observations and conclusions with others of similar importance.

20
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:53,260


21
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:59,880
You have qualified for this project because you have a very special intellectual capacity without a loss of discretion or humility.

22
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,340
Such virtues are exercised in your own best interest.

23
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,920
Do not deviate from fame.

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:23,140
The original purpose of operation Hour of Slack was to study the strategic and tactical problems of air and land defense with the objective of

25
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:29,020
effective use of limited military resources against domestic ...

26
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:30,500
enemies.

27
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,200
...hear or think...

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,180
What about Slack?

29
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,320
That's your key phrase.

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,500
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

31
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,040
And now...

32
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,920
The Self Genius,

33
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,160
our...

34
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:18,300
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to

35
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:28,000
be played on radio station and only in the city of should any other shows be heard from or contacted

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,200
in the course of this show the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted

37
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,900
officials in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled

38
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,460
during broadcast small animals or other children becoming exposed to the ultra-high or ultra-low

39
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,800
shocks and brain frequencies constantly scanned throughout our program should seek shelter in an

40
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,100
approved safety unit only this is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that like

41
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,200
releases but truth is not everyone gets the picture hoping your time is all time and all

42
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,920
your unpermissible truths are happy truths here's your host oh yes dear friends Reverend Ivan stang

43
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:17,660
here and yeah that little introduction for the show actually I'll I'll be straight with you at

44
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:17,760
the end of the show is actually the first of some of the documents in the book the last few

45
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,180
years or so that I got to read that wasn't really an introduction for the show that was a piece from

46
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:29,200
a top-secret document someone sent me called that's essentially the Illuminati declaration of

47
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:41,160
war upon the people of America which was apparently found in 1986 in an IBM copier that had been

48
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,560
purchased at a surplus sale it's a manual that we weren't supposed to see I suppose put together by

49
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:55,860
the Rockefellers and so forth that explains how they're going to turn us all into beggars

50
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,500
because they're easier to please.

51
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,860
I felt so good last show, but this show I feel like what Hogan's goat did.

52
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,200
You know what Hogan's goat did.

53
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,140
I'm tired.

54
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,580
I don't know why.

55
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,940
I spent the weekend with my son and I had to give him the talk about drugs.

56
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,920
And that can wear you out.

57
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,540
I guess I'm paying for the slack I had last weekend, dear friend.

58
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,120
They always try to get it out of you, wring it out of you some way or another.

59
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,440
So this show, actually, this show, it's building up to being,

60
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,500
well, actually what it is, the first five minutes of each of the 50,

61
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,560
15 new tapes that the Subgenius Foundation, the church, got in the mail last week.

62
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,660
Our little church newsletter went out.

63
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,800
And when that happens every couple of years,

64
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:04,820
why, Subgenius' ministers all over the world reach out and speak and create tapes,

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,380
wonderful, fantastic tapes in obeisance to that man, Bob,

66
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,940
that one true Bob who looms over us.

67
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,740
All times in the back of our brains and the front of our eyes.

68
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,060
Bob himself, yes, he who has come and shall go.

69
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:38,820
They are Bob Dobbs, the living avatar of slack on this Earth Farm One,

70
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,940
property of the men from Planet X.

71
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,480
They with whom only...

72
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,660
Only Bob can wheel and deal.

73
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:58,180
So, anyway, as I was saying, this show, this wonderful tonight's show,

74
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,860
is composed of me and, actually, we're going through the mail together.

75
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,460
Because I haven't heard the rest of these tapes.

76
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,380
This is just, I'd pick up a tape, go, oh, well, look here, this one's from Bleepo.

77
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,480
Let's listen to that and lay it onto the show tape.

78
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,340
And then, why?

79
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,520
Here's another tape from the all-pro cavalcade of Bob in Atlanta.

80
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,020
I wonder what they're like.

81
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,360
I'd stick that on.

82
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,100
And so, it's because we get so much mail, dear friends,

83
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,360
from those wonderful people out there who want to be famous,

84
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,220
along with J.R. Bob Dobbs riding the coattails of Bob.

85
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:41,180
And the Hour of Slack is one of those tattered coattails dragging behind

86
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,320
in the gutter and the wind.

87
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,800
And the, except for one beloved oldie, dear friends.

88
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,720
We're going to play one oldie very quickly here.

89
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,220
The Thing With No Face by Jane or Hypercleets.

90
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,520
Haven't played that in a long time.

91
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,440
And I realized why.

92
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,640
There's some young folks out there who need to know about that film, The Thing With No Face.

93
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,880
Someday I'd like to turn it into a real movie.

94
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,600
It starts off kind of slow, but is well worth the buildup, despite the fact

95
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,320
that it's recorded.

96
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,560
It's recorded in Jane or Hypercleets' bathroom on concert tape, TM,

97
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,940
and a $20 ghetto blaster.

98
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,320
I hope that's talked enough.

99
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,160
Thank you so much for being there for us.

100
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,960
Listen, man, there's a spiritual war right now going on for your soul.

101
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,540
Holy, I turn in science.

102
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,740
I step.

103
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,960
I step.

104
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:44,980


105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,680
We're going to play it now.

106
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,140
You won't want to miss the startling new horror film from Subgenius Studios.

107
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:04,360
Yes, this is a classic tale of terror to make you shiver in your boots.

108
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,440
That thing over there by the acid pool, my God, it ain't got no face.

109
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:13,740
Yeah.

110
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,300
Whoa.

111
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:14,300


112
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:14,300


113
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,100
No, you won't want to miss, Joan, that thing over there by the acid pool.

114
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,960
My God, it ain't got no face of you.

115
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,500
Hey, Frank, you know that thing we was looking at the other day?

116
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,240
You know, that thing over down there by the acid pool that pulled Joan and them in or whatever it was supposed to be?

117
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,460
Well, I was just looking at that thing the other day.

118
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,020
I just happened to notice it ain't got no face.

119
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:40,980
Ah!

120
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,300
Yes, officer, it was right over there.

121
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,780
It was over by the acid pool.

122
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,320
Frank was just telling me.

123
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,000
I just couldn't believe it.

124
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,760
I couldn't believe that there was a thing over there by the acid pool that didn't have no face.

125
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,880
They told stories about it, about how he pulled Joan in and shit like that.

126
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,740
But I didn't believe a word of it.

127
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,000
But now he's gone.

128
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,920
And they say he didn't have no face.

129
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,180
And they said...

130
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,520
Pretty weird.

131
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,300
That's about all I can say.

132
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,140
As far as not having a face.

133
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,620
Yeah, that's what people say.

134
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,980
I pretty much think it's a bunch of shit.

135
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,720
If you could give us the facts, man.

136
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,420
If you could simply try to stick to the facts.

137
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,320
I don't care.

138
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,120
I don't care.

139
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,360
I can kill all my children.

140
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,240
As long as the mother's got a face.

141
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,700
I'll take my grandmother.

142
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,300
My whole life.

143
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,360
I'll take my uncle.

144
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,440
And if he ain't got no legs, you can kill him.

145
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,200
You can get him dead.

146
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,780
As long as you don't try to tell me the murderer ain't got a face.

147
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,560
But Frank.

148
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,180
But where the fuck he's gone?

149
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,380
And if he ain't got no face.

150
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,920
And if he's not gonna tell me.

151
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,400
And if he's not gonna tell me he ain't got a face.

152
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,140
Well, it was right down there by the acid pool.

153
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,220
Uh, what acid pool are you referring to, Mr. Ferguson?

154
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,680
You know, Sims acid pool.

155
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,980
It's right down there.

156
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,100
Right down there where they saw that thing.

157
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,820
He was trying to say he didn't have a face.

158
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,960
I remember blue.

159
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,980
There were blue lights all around the room.

160
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,180
What about the face, ma'am?

161
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,260
Did you get a glimpse of the face?

162
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,240
The face?

163
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,020
Sure.

164
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,540
I saw the face.

165
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,220
It looked sort of...

166
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,120
It was long.

167
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,300
It looked sort of...

168
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,180
Like...

169
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,060
Like...

170
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,240
Well, I've got nothing to worry about.

171
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,620
I'm just gonna stay away from Simmons' acid pool and close to you, Frank.

172
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,280
But, Frank, what's this node?

173
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,760
It feels like it's made out of rubber.

174
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,820
Oh, it ain't nothing.

175
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,220
Frank, this is a mask.

176
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,860
What are you doing wearing a mask?

177
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,920
This ain't Halloween.

178
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,600
What are you...

179
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,400
What?

180
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:12,400


181
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,280
Ah!

182
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,400
What did it look like?

183
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,120
Well...

184
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,300
I can't remember.

185
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,900
A thing without no face.

186
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,400
Over by Simmons Acid Pond.

187
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,940
Yeah, my son told me that story.

188
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,640
I didn't believe that cock.

189
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,100
He's taking them pills all the time.

190
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,760
Of course, I have seen a thing without no head.

191
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,740
Now, over by Hathaway's Acid Pond.

192
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,440
But I didn't take no stock about a faceless thing over by Simmons Acid Pond.

193
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,880
Now, there's quite a few things missing bodily parts

194
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,520
if you ever want to check over by Jones Acid Pond.

195
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:13,000
I think someone saw an old man

196
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,280
with a little bit of a head.

197
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,280


198
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,600
Or maybe he had both his legs.

199
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,720
Maybe he just lost his car keys or something like that.

200
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,540
Thought you might be interested, Sheriff.

201
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,040
Caught this mess of crappie

202
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,200
down at the lake.

203
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,700
Now, this one here, as you can see,

204
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,040
it's a pretty nice-sized crappie.

205
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,280
It's perfectly formed, completely natural

206
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,020
in every way.

207
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,540
Minus its face.

208
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,940
Minus its face.

209
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,000
Minus its face.

210
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,000


211
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,720
No, you won't want to miss

212
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,100
the spine-tingling,

213
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,360
mind-numbing horror of

214
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,340
the spine-tingling, mind-numbing horror of

215
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,020
Joan, that thing over there by the acid pool.

216
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,320
Joan, that thing over there by the acid pool.

217
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,000
My God, it ain't got no face.

218
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,660
My God, it ain't got no face.

219
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,500
Rated R.

220
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,900
Corpse that no face?

221
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,040
That's a damn lie.

222
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,140
It was a lie.

223
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,840
It was a lie.

224
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:19,660
It was a lie.

225
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,780
And don't miss the startling

226
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,920
second facial feature.

227
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,140
They laughed at my face.

228
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,540
They laughed at my face.

229
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,400
Marlee, would you like to go to

230
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,820
senior prom with me?

231
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,180
I certainly can.

232
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,520
But I was just wondering,

233
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,880
why do you always wear that

234
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,080
lead mask and carry that machine around?

235
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:41,580
lead mask and carry that machine around?

236
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,940
Even when we're

237
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,520
Well, you know,

238
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,480
you've still got that

239
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,760
200-pound lead mask on.

240
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:51,180


241
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,220
It ain't nothing.

242
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,200
It ain't nothing.

243
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
It's just something I do.

244
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,020
It's just to protect the others.

245
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:01,740
It's just to protect the others.

246
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,040
Well, why don't you take it off?

247
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:04,800
Well, why don't you take it off?

248
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,960
No, well, I can't take it off.

249
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,160
But I bet you're probably cute

250
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,860
underneath that mask.

251
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,180
I bet you're, you know, pop.

252
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,280
So don't miss either of the

253
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,560
So don't miss either of the

254
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,780
startling double feature.

255
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:22,960
startling double feature.

256
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,520
Save face this weekend

257
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,560
by seeing both facial features

258
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:26,660
by seeing both facial features

259
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,780
for the price of one.

260
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,840
Joan, that thing over there

261
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,860
by the acid pool.

262
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,740
My god, it don't got no face.

263
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,400
Yeah!

264
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:36,860
Plus,

265
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,160
they laughed at my face.

266
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,740
They laughed at my face.

267
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,480
Our films are rated R.

268
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:00,560
Our films are rated R.

269
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,100
Oh, my god!

270
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,320
Your head was chopped off

271
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,120
Your head was chopped off

272
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,820
Vic Morrow

273
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,380
from a helicopter

274
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,480
played Vic Morrow

275
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,400
lost his head

276
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,600
two little nips

277
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,360
and Vic Morrow

278
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,380
went to work that day

279
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,120
on a stupid movie

280
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,060
now they're dead

281
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,360
now they're dead

282
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,700
I knew there was danger

283
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,400
in this job

284
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,560
Vic Morrow

285
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,800
cause that's what your

286
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,880
contract read

287
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,080
Vic Morrow

288
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,620
Vic Morrow

289
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,220
We'll miss ya

290
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,680
Vic Morrow

291
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,520
We hope that they find

292
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,000
We hope that they find

293
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,000


294
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,000


295
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,680
head

296
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,040
your head

297
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,620
head

298
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:08,880
head

299
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,700
head

300
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:09,900
head

301
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,900
head

302
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,760
Drill the hole

303
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,700
right into the wall

304
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,700
Drill the hole

305
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,400
into the stall

306
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,120
Load the tape

307
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,920
into the machine

308
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,780
It's my particular

309
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,740
pervert scene

310
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,520
Beeping on ladies

311
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,360
and little men

312
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,980
You won't have

313
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,260
privacy in my can

314
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,780
Hail, hail VHS

315
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,680
Technology looking

316
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,700
up your dress

317
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,480
Tape, tape

318
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,420
naked girls

319
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,520
My hidden camera's

320
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,380
out of this world

321
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,200
Maybe I'll sell them

322
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,080
at my shows

323
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,960
America's dirtiest

324
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,400
videos

325
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,660
Hey, hey you!

326
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,400
Who the hell are you

327
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,200
taking movies of me

328
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,660
in the john?

329
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,100
Huh?

330
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,140
Why, I'm Bob Saget

331
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,180
You're a pervert!

332
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,360
I'm calling the police

333
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,000
No, no, no, wait

334
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,940
Now, now, hold on, baby

335
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,040
Now, what if I said

336
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,780
I was an important

337
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,480
black filmmaker

338
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,420
like Spike Lee

339
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:30,780
Pervert!

340
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,760
You're a pervert!

341
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,340
Now, wait a minute

342
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,960
Hold on, hold on

343
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,360
little lady

344
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,460
I didn't do nothing

345
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,500
I'm a pervert

346
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:36,500


347
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:36,700
Come on, now

348
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,380
Oh, come on, now

349
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,640
If you're tired of the same old techno toys

350
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,040
have we got something for you

351
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,580
It's the fabulous Bobco Pocket Teleporter

352
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,200
No more costly car repair

353
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,860
No more ghastly gas bills

354
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,200
Sleep later in the morning

355
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,300
Get those kids to school in record time

356
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,220
Never be late for an appointment again

357
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,540
Send annoying flies, roaches and mosquitoes

358
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,200
to those who really deserve them

359
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,180
Combine a dog and a cat in the mix

360
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,800
and create an animal that'll get you booked

361
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,640
on the Letterman Show

362
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,520
Also doubles as a nifty disintegrator

363
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,640

Does the same for that nasty kitchen

365

and that vile garage full of old National Geographics

366
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,000
Move the car first, Dad

367
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,140
Uh-oh, where's the cat?

After walking back from the North Pole

374
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,660
Ha ha ha!

375
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,060
As sure as I'm the alien lovechild of Elvis and Bigfoot

376

Your teleporter will work till your kids are 80

378
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,100

Now where's that pesky poodle?

385
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,880
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

386
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:56,620
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

387
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,960
Uh-oh, a haystack

388
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:02,960


389
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:02,960


390
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:02,960


391
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:02,960


392
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:02,960


393
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:20,500
Sleephead! Quit your job! Slack off! That's right! Just remember, don't bow down, bend over.

394
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,500
Man is a feeling creature.

395
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,200
And because of it, the greatest in the universe.

396
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,840
He learned too late for himself that men have to find their own way to make their own mistakes.

397
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,260
There can't be any gift of perfection from outside ourselves.

398
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:50,340
And when men seek such perfection, they find only death, fire, loss, disillusionment.

399
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,640
In the end of everything that's gone forward,

400
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,180
men have always said,

401
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,040
men sought an end to toil and misery.

402
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,660
What can't be given, it has to be achieved.

403
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,180
There is hope.

404
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:11,660
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living slack master in this church of the subjeans.

405
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,240
Great Bob.

406
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,140
I wonder, just who is this Bob?

407
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,860
What about Bob?

408
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:23,380
Because Bob to me, Bob to me is the distance between point A and point B.

409
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,960
Is he the drug or is he the needle?

410
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,960
Bob to me.

411
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,220
Is he the bullet or is he the gun?

412
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,920
Is Bob the vein, the collapsed vein?

413
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,900
Bob is all, Bob is nothing.

414
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,560
Or is Bob the good one between your toes where it won't show?

415
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,480
Is Bob the moon that's swollen knuckles of greed?

416
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,860
Is Bob a fist clutching dollars?

417
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,520
Bob is the work on the armpit of humanity.

418
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,680
Bob is the work on the armpit of the conspiracy!

419
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,680
Bob ain't no armpit!

420
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,180
Bob ain't no armpit!

421
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,340
There you go, Bobby jean.

422
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,200
Don't getiendo ch הקtiscorsion!

423
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,900

macilado...

426
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:11,380


427
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:11,380


428
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:11,380


429
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:11,380


430
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,180
comesse PR妳 SAB,

431
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:34,260
edition radio with an easy name to remember. Bob. What he'd tempt Bob to do, he wouldn't tempt you

432
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:39,160
to do, but whatever area you need tempting, he can make it available. What in the world is wrong with

433
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:47,080
you, woman? Call me. I just see some of you right now saying, well, I don't like this kind of preaching.

434
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:54,960
Well, big deal. I know a lot of good Masons. I know some Mason men and Mason fruit jars.

435
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:02,300
You may be clutching in your hand what seems to you to be the last thing you have to hang on to,

436
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:11,460
and God says, will you give it to me? Will you let me handle it? Stay tuned. Bob will be right back.

437
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:18,320
If you go out in the woods today, you're sure of a big surprise. If you do this.

438
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:33,420
That's a female porcupine communicating. When a male porcupine responds, the phrase

439
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,800
call of the wild takes on a whole new meaning.

440
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,100
There's never been an American president named Bob.

441
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,840
You're a king.

442
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:06,820
There's never been a king named Bob, nor for that matter, a pope named Bob. For that reason, try as you might, you'll find nary a statue or an important monument anywhere raised to the praise of Bob.

443
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:13,520
But the good folks in Avon, Colorado have decided to rectify that lack of pride in Bob-ness.

444
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:22,300
They've got a bridge named Bob. Teresa Albertson is the town spokeswoman. We reached her in Bob Hall.

445
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,840
Miss Albertson, I know your first name.

446
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,140
Isn't Bob. So I'm wondering how the town came up with that name.

447
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:42,060
We had a contest in town, and we had 84 suggestions for naming the bridge. Most of the suggestions were pretty straight or historical, but one of them was Bob.

448
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:49,020
And when I released the list of suggested names to the local press here, they picked up on Bob and ran with it.

449
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,720
It was just plain Bob. It wasn't Bob something or something Bob.

450
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,860
Oh, and also...

451
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,680
It wasn't Robert. It was just Bob.

452
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,680
How many names were suggested?

453
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,640
84.

454
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:08,040
84. Were there any odd ones? Not to say that Bob is all that straight for a name, but...

455
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:14,420
No, Bob was probably the most unique. Some people recommended Nova, which is Avon spelled backwards.

456
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:14,980
Right.

457
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:22,680
We also got My Sharona from the song. I think in like the 50s or the 60s, called My Sharona.

458
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,820
My Sharona?

459
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,480
Uh-huh.

460
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,120
I don't know that one.

461
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:34,180
And let's see. Most of the others were pretty straight, like, um, oh, Avon Crossing, Avon Pass, that kind of thing.

462
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,200
Did you get Avon Lady by any chance?

463
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,220
No, we didn't.

464
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,960
Okay. But, all right, who came up with the name Bob?

465
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,000
Uh, the gentleman's name is Louis Sullivan.

466
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,980
I thought you'd say his name was Bob Sullivan or something.

467
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:54,820
No, I had someone tell me recently, people who are named Bob are so humble that a Bob would never recommend...

468
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,100
naming a bridge Bob.

469
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:05,980
Are not most bridges and roads and things in, in, uh, Avon or in, in the United States named after politicians?

470
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:16,780
Well, gosh, we have a, we have a lake and a big park named after a man here who was a rancher for a long time and eventually became a politician for a little while.

471
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,300
So, yes, I think that's a little more typical.

472
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,520
So you took the, the name went to the city council then?

473
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,280
Yes, it did.

474
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,560
And it was voted on?

475
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,080
Yes.

476
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,840
And the, and the bridge is now called Bob.

477
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,780
It passed on a vote of four to two.

478
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,040
What did the two objectors think of it?

479
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:46,360
Well, they felt that it was an awfully serious project. It's a very, very big project for the town of Avon. We're building two bridges and a new road. And, uh, they felt that a serious project deserved a serious name.

480
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,100
And they didn't think Bob was serious enough?

481
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,360
Uh, they didn't feel it was quite, quite serious enough.

482
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,540
Describe the bridge for me. Is it just like any ordinary bridge? It goes across the river?

483
00:27:54,540 --> 00:28:07,100
Well, it's across the river and it's about 50 yards long and it's four lanes wide. Um, we replaced a real old bridge that was, kind of needed to be replaced.

484
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:14,660
And we took the old bridge's frame and gave it to a local town here that really needed a new bridge. So we, we are recycling bridges here.

485
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,040
Don't tell me the old bridge was called Shirley or...

486
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,560
No, we actually hadn't gotten to the point of naming the old bridge.

487
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,520
Well, there is this thing now all across the state, Ms. Albertson. You're right.

488
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,720
You're aware of the, the name Bob has just taken off. There's, there are books about it and...

489
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,240
Why has it become such a fabulously popular name?

490
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:43,380
Uh, probably because it's so ordinary. It's funny, it seems like a funny idea to take an ordinary name like Bob, maybe Bob Smith or Bob Jones.

491
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,220
Right.

492
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:49,080
And, and then to exploit it to this point where it just becomes funny, funny, funny.

493
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,840
If you were to take a complicated name like, uh, Brandon...

494
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,120
George.

495
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:54,740
...Brandon Meyer.

496
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,480
Right.

497
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,380
Quite as interesting.

498
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,820
Yeah, that's...

499
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,480
Ha ha.

500
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,020
That's right. And of course, Bob is spelled the same way back as in forward.

501
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,680
Yes, it has a great advantage.

502
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,680
It's a very simple name.

503
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,880
You can't forget it.

504
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,660
That's right.

505
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,420
Can't be forgotten.

506
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,580
Is there going to be a ribbon cutting, uh, to open, to officially open the bridge?

507
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:24,500
We had originally discussed, uh, having the official dedication ceremony next spring, but maybe we'll do something here when the road opens up, which will be mid-November.

508
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,360
And there's going to be a plaque on the bridge saying Bob.

509
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,860
I haven't heard confirmation of whether we're going to have a plaque on the bridge or not.

510
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,620
I have a feeling everyone's going to know it's Bob and they don't need a sign.

511
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,380
Ha ha ha.

512
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,280
Ha ha ha.

513
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,320
I have a feeling everyone's going to know it's Bob and they don't need a sign.

514
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,720
Everyone's going to know it's Bob and they don't need a sign.

515
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,500
And you won't need a sign, dear friends, because you'll know it's B-B-Bob.

516
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,740
Oh, but you didn't know that you've been listening to, uh...

517
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,300
Oh, we started out with Thing With No Face by Jane or Hyperclete.

518
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,300
The Vic Morrow piece and Chuck Berry piece were by Cates and West.

519
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,540
Pocket Teleporter by Hell Pope Huey.

520
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:11,160
A subgenius barrage there using clips from, uh, William Gillespie and, uh, Nick Nolan and, uh, even Mike Cole there at WCSB in Cleveland.

521
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,260
Hi, Cleveland.

522
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,660
Uh, the Bridge Named Bob piece, uh, submitted by Reverend Dave Mitchell.

523
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,980
And, of course, the swinging love corpses heard in the background here.

524
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,280
Uh...

525
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:29,960
Uh, from their new album, You Have To Pay To Be This Way, an all-instrumental swinging love corpse album.

526
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,320
You're listening to the Subgenius Hour of Slack.

527
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:45,380
You can get more information on us and the church of the subgenius by writing to Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

528
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,220
And that means it's halfway point on show.

529
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,200
Turn over side one of show to create and destroy.

530
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,140
Again, side two of show.

531
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:16,600
Oh, I love those transitions that bring us from side one of show to side two of show.

532
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,400
Oh, yeah.

533
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,680
You don't need a sign.

534
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,180
You don't need a sign.

535
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,180


536
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,440
Bob the Bridge.

537
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,680
Oh, I got a good vibration.

538
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,220
I got a grooving soul.

539
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,960
I can have a boogie woogie.

540
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,140
The kind of thing that just makes you want to consume the demon alcohol.

541
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,140
Alexa, go something like this.

542
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,800
I don't want to get up early in the morning.

543
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,660
I want to sleep all day.

544
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,640
I don't want to ride a crowded subway.

545
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,680
I want to go by car.

546
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,920
You don't need to be serious.

547
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,980
You don't need to be a warlock.

548
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,760
You don't need to be nervous.

549
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,260
You don't need to be an A.A. man.

550
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,260
Ah, ah, ah.

551
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,620
I don't want to work a boring job.

552
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,720
I want to play all day.

553
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,520
I don't want to play the silly field.

554
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,860
I want to kick them out.

555
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,960
You don't need to be serious.

556
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,000
You don't need to be a warlock.

557
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,820
You don't need to be nervous.

558
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,240
You don't need to be an A.A. man.

559
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,300
Ah, ah, ah.

560
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,260
Ah, ah, ah.

561
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:45,760
Ah, ah, ah.

562
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,340
Ah, ah, ah.

563
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,620
Ah, ah, ah.

564
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,560
Ah, ah, ah.

565
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,200
Ah, ah, ah.

566
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,700
I'm glad we went to bed together.

567
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:08,700


568
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:08,700


569
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:08,700


570
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:08,700


571
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:08,700


572
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:08,700


573
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:08,700


574
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:08,920
Independent in the spring.

575
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:08,920


576
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:08,920


577
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:08,920


578
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:08,920


579
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:08,920


580
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,100
Ah, ah, ah.

581
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:09,440


582
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:09,480
Yeah.

583
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,540
I do not know.

584
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:11,540


585
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,600
Yes, good morning.

586
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,040
I don't want to get up early in the morning

587
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,900
I want to sleep all day

588
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,920
I don't want to ride a crowded subway

589
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,020
I want to go by surf

590
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,240
You don't need to be sales

591
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,360
You don't need to be a walrus

592
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,440
You don't need to be novice

593
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,880
You don't need to be a big man

594
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,940
Ha ha ha

595
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,020
Ha ha ha

596
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,580
Ha ha

597
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,580
Are you over 18 years of age?

598
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,860
Do you want a part in this nation's war

599
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,380
on drugs?

600
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,600
Do you like to see people urinating at close range?

601
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,060
Do you want a job?

602
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,360
Consider a career in the governor's

603
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,600
Gold and Shower Task Force.

604
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,960
The state mandatory drug testing program

605
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,480
needs motivated, self-starting inspectors

606
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,420
to verify the sanctity of the specimens.

607
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,320
And put the lid down when you're through.

608
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,140
Mrs. Rainwater's right behind you.

609
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,080
Let's go, lady. Come on.

610
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,820
It's not a job for just anybody.

611
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,580
But as an officer in the Gold and Shower Task Force,

612
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,300
you'll be where the action is.

613
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,300
Number one in the front lines

614
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,600
of the war on drugs.

615
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,260
But this door doesn't seem to latch very well.

616
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,260
That's okay. Just leave it cracked a bit.

617
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,460
This is Lieutenant Colonel Ed Stubbs.

618
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,060
Whether you're a dangerous prevert

619
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,140
or just a weekend urophiliac,

620
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,900
here's an opportunity to both satisfy your fetish

621
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,380
and serve your country.

622
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,900
See if you've got what it takes.

623
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,840
Call 1-900-555-WEWE

624
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,480
or come by the recruitment office

625
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,780
at your local public library,

626
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,620
First War Men's Room, Third Stall from Left.

627
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:23,940
The

628
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:23,940


629
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,860
The First War Men's Room

630
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,120
The First War Men's Room

631
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,500
The First War Men's Room

632
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,420
Pulse on the sleeves.

633
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,520
And a ruffle round my neck.

634
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,160
And now,

635
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,820
I need to have a pointed hat

636
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,420
with a pom-pom on top.

637
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,000
And a funny red nose.

638
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,820
And I'm a clown.

639
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,600
A funny old clown

640
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,060
dancing around.

641
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,140
Say,

642
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,320
this is just the thing.

643
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,900
I'm thinking about the future.

644
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,920
I'm thinking about the future.

645
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,580
I'm thinking about the future.

646
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,780
I'm thinking about the future.

647
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,060
I'm thinking about the future.

648
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,700
I'm thinking about the future.

649
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,760
thinking about the future

650
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,200
just a bunch of dots

651
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,960
jump up and over the wall and through the small opening as you go down to the other side

652
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,220
drop straight along the edge of the wall so you don't land in the door at the bottom

653
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:55,860
the scientist took a tiny sample they say that if this experiment works

654
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:04,380
that at the minimum the approximate learning 100 dealers in florida at the cost of taxpayers

655
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:11,980
and the government will have sales projections to do the best and the following questions

656
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,900
current history

657
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:22,380
because it's going to keep up with that age yet we're gonna get a news exclusive on you

658
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,560
with the first aluminum foil wrapper

659
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:33,840
the doctors say it's gonna take a little longer for simon's squareness to wear off until then

660
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,640
we're using him as a doorstop

661
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,460
you

662
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,760
hello friend and welcome

663
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:10,060
tonight's sermon is entitled free thought you get what you pay for

664
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,900
you

665
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,840
now the church of the subgenius

666
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,440
has always encouraged free thought friends

667
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:24,760
don't get me wrong we've always been behind free thought you know that i know that everyone knows

668
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:30,680
that it's only when you want to know what you think that we charge a donation

669
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:37,740
and that's also why the church says anything worth knowing is worth paying for

670
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,020
now you have all these so-called normals

671
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,040
these average joe blows

672
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,440
the mediocre majority

673
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,160
the folks who have to go to school to learn how to learn

674
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,460
oh yes they think they know how to think

675
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,820
because why

676
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,660
because they got a piece of paper

677
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,840
a piece of paper friends

678
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,100
that says they know how to think

679
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,540
a diploma friends

680
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
created

681
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,260
maintained

682
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,500
signed sealed and delivered by who

683
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,940
the church of the subgenius

684
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,120
is

685
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,740
and they're not just

686
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:16,740


687
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:16,740


688
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,960
oh sure they pay good money for that piece of paper too let me just

689
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,740
oh boy

690
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,780
you pay a whole lot of money for it

691
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,460
more than we would ever dream of stealing from you

692
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,680
investing for you

693
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,760
but does a conspiracy

694
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,820
teach you what you think friends

695
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,540
hell no the conspiracy teaches you what they think

696
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,520
why they're so scared

697
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,140
that someone out there might in fact trip upon the truth

698
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,300
and think a real independent thought for themselves

699
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,940
a thought thunk without the guidance of the conspiracy

700
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,100
a non-conspiracy concept

701
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,460
that they force you and everyone else

702
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,320
to go to their conspiracy training schools

703
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,520
for the most formative and most imaginative of their years

704
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,900
you're not alone

705
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,100
you're not alone

706
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,340
and they won't let you out friends

707
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,340
not until you conform to their normality

708
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:23,340
or one of their carefully selected alternative normalities

709
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,260
oh yes you know what I'm talking about

710
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,620
I'm talking about those hippies

711
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,240
those punks

712
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,460
those skinheads

713
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,440
who wouldn't become dead

714
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:33,680
think of anything

715
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,340
but the hippest punkish skinnest thoughts

716
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,160
oh sure friends

717
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,600
they think

718
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,640
they're thinking

719
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,820
they think they're rebelling

720
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:49,320
but they've only joined another branch of the conspiracy corps

721
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,860
oh they're out of the army alright

722
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,780
and they're into one of the other arms of the conspiracy octopus

723
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:02,220
oh but I disobey all the laws and everything that they tell me to do

724
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,240
friends

725
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,380
that's just reverse psychology they're using on you

726
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,480
the conspiracy is a master of reverse psychology

727
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,160
they want you to disobey them

728
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,300
just say no means just say yes

729
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,240
why do you think they call it dope

730
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,340
they want you to pacify your brain with drugs

731
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:25,780
they want you to transmit AIDS via every natural orifice

732
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,120
and every unnatural one too friends

733
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,200
it gives them something to waste your time with to avoid getting slapped

734
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,100
while simultaneously providing junk food for thought

735
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,260
to fuel their media hype

736
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,260
something for them to market

737
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,020
and then take from the market

738
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,300
and then black market

739
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,160
and then ban

740
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,340
and then regulate

741
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,080
and all the while

742
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,080
you think it's just happenstance

743
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,920
supply and demand

744
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,540
who are you foolin'

745
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,240
they do the supply and they do the demand in two

746
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,980
and you think you're so clever

747
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,940
because you cheated on last year's income tax

748
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,700
oh friends

749
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,620
so much for your free thought

750
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,720
it was worth precisely what you paid

751
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,480
nothing

752
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,820
nothing at all

753
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,620
and I bet you still don't know what the hell I'm talking about

754
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,060
oh no

755
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,040
I pity you

756
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,020
wherever you may be

757
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,420
oh how I pity you

758
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,900
and Bob pities you even more friends

759
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,240
but let us not hear of the church of the sub-genius

760
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,860
get too smug

761
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,340
too self-righteous

762
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,620
too high and mighty

763
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,600
because friends

764
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,840
we all know there's plenty of what

765
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,020
pseudo sub-genies out there

766
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,620
who just pretend to think for themselves

767
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,140
why do they come to the church friends

768
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,580
because they think

769
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,360
they think it's cool

770
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,040
they can't understand what we're talking about friends

771
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,860
it sounds like a big joke to them

772
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,680
a riddle

773
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,000
something to laugh about

774
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,720
well ha ha ha

775
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,200
that's just fine and dandy

776
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,500
we'll take your money friends

777
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,580
but we ain't touching your soul

778
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,420
hell no

779
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,620
and then again it's not like you give a lot of money anyway

780
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,980
you're afraid to know what you think

781
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:18,780
you're scared

782
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,800
you're frightened

783
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,020
there may not be anything

784
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,740
well friends

785
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,860
there's only one way to find out

786
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,740
and that's to put your money where your mind is

787
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:31,080
and if you don't get a quick prompt response in six to eight weeks

788
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,820
well friends

789
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,640
you can just assume the worst

790
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,140
tell them that address

791
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,640
and praise Bob

792
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,000
oh Bob

793
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,360
oh man

794
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,000
oh yes dear friends

795
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,720
and that address of course is

796
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,080
post office box 140306

797
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,400
Dallas Texas 75214

798
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,200
a hooo

799
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,400
kalo

800
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:07,680
hm

801
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,420
vers

802
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:08,420


803
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,700
has

804
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,440
sit

805
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:34,660
It's a provocative, charged, highly controversial topic that we tackle over the next 60 minutes.

806
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:47,540
We ask you to suspend your disbelief, those of you who are skeptical, those who are believers in this particular phenomenon.

807
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:55,700
We ask you not to overreact to the stories, the horror stories that you are about to hear.

808
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,000
We're always going to hear the United States.

809
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:05,400
The major concern for American people is still the economy, not necessarily the Middle East.

810
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:09,940
And today the government released new statistics that seem to indicate a good reason.

811
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:14,860
Everything under control has everything under control.

812
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,660
Has everything.

813
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:17,840
Everything.

814
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,100
Under control.

815
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,620
What he is like.

816
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,880
What he is like.

817
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,600
But I'm only hoping that the spirit will act through him.

818
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,880
What he is like.

819
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,080
What he is like.

820
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,340
But I'm only hoping that we all believe.

821
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,060
All believe.

822
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,700
See, we'll be sold at all because.

823
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,660
Keelbell today blamed our kill bit.

824
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,680
Keelbell today blamed our kill bit.

825
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,180
Keelbell today blamed our kill bit.

826
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,100
Keelbell today.

827
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,020
Working feverishly on the atomic bomb.

828
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,960
Working fist in an apple.

829
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,520
Second.

830
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,300
Satellite that can count the seeds in an apple.

831
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,040
Satellite that can count the seeds on the atomic bomb.

832
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,800
Working feverishly on the atomic bomb.

833
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,080
No one on the block.

834
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,480
I don't know anybody.

835
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,440
No one on the.

836
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,340
Strips of flesh had hung down his back.

837
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,540
And three lips that were caked with blood.

838
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,820
Strips of flesh had hung down his block.

839
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:12,420
This is mankind's first marvelous glimpse of a living human.

840
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,980
No one on the block.

841
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:16,420
No one on the block.

842
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,520
No one on the block.

843
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:17,520


844
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,200
No anybody.

845
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:18,740
Anybody.

846
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,020
No one on the block.

847
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:20,420
Anybody.

848
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,000
Anybody.

849
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:21,840
No one.

850
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,460
No anybody.

851
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,060
Anybody.

852
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:23,960
No anybody.

853
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:24,680
Anybody.

854
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:25,700
No anybody.

855
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:26,340
Anybody.

856
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:26,980
No.

857
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:27,300
Anybody.

858
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,620
We hatch out of its shell and reach the womb cavity.

859
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,420
Two lips that were caked with blood.

860
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,260
Just go on.

861
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:33,980
We all believe.

862
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:34,660
All believe.

863
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,120
See, we'll be sold at all.

864
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,060
Because we all believe.

865
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:37,740
All believe.

866
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,140
Uh, of course the fish is dead, but every night.

867
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:40,900
Uh, of course.

868
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,280
See, we'll be sold at all.

869
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:42,960
Our kill bit.

870
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,940
Keelbell today blamed our kill bit.

871
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:45,580
Keelbell.

872
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,380
Out of the oven.

873
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,320
Even after shaving.

874
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,820
I got out of the oven.

875
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,720
Even after shaving.

876
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,240
I got out of the oven.

877
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,680
Until she gets touched longer.

878
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,580
Roll it out.

879
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,060
Until she gets touched longer.

880
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,020
Roll it out.

881
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,560
Until she gets out of shaving.

882
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,360
I got even after shaving.

883
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,420
Oh, well.

884
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:00,980
Ahem.

885
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,620
So what?

886
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,320
In other news, uh, millions shop day and night

887
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,080
without buying a thing because they're broke.

888
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,460
Everything's dead except the computer.

889
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,020
Yes, America's recession has spawned an eerie new class

890
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:17,020
of mall zombies who do nothing but window shop from morning

891
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,640
to night and never buy a thing.

892
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,000
Well.

893
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,680
Here's one now.

894
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,960
Do you spend all your time hanging out

895
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,240
at the mall with your pals?

896
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:26,720
Mm-hmm.

897
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:27,820
Your pals, kids.

898
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,760
Do you spend four or more hours a week in shopping malls

899
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,820
without buying anything?

900
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,640
The United States is going to totally sink and sink

901
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,220
and sink it in the water from where

902
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,260
it will come up around.

903
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,940
The waters under the Earth, how mysterious they are.

904
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,560
Yep, they're just going to cover the whole US.

905
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,420
What is that spirit?

906
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,200
Huh?

907
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:46,520
Hm?

908
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,100
Spirit.

909
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:47,640
Hm?

910
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:48,200
Yeah.

911
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,980
What is the spirit of man which goeth upwards

912
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,880
and the spirit of the beast which goeth downward to the Earth?

913
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,600
Ignorance and evil.

914
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,200
Well, you seem pretty scared.

915
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,080
Well, it happens, you know.

916
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,760
Some folks don't like fire hydrants.

917
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,420
Others don't like pointy objects.

918
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,860
As for me, it's 10-pound spiders that suddenly jump in my face.

919
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,760
They're a household pest that everybody has to deal with.

920
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,480
But hey, you mentioned.

921
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,140
Not everybody.

922
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,320
You mentioned something about an ex-girlfriend?

923
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,640
Oh, yes.

924
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,980
Ex the Unknown, starring Dean Jagger.

925
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:16,180
Mm-hmm.

926
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,620
Does that mean you're a free man now?

927
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:24,500
I'm as free as anyone can be in this twisted, predetermined salon of sadness.

928
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,000
Oh, my goodness.

929
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:25,820
Wow.

930
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:26,720
Mm-hmm.

931
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,700
How do you like that, folks?

932
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,040
We always bring you the best.

933
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,280
Yeah, always the best.

934
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,080
Puzzling Evidence Gossip File.

935
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,080
Gosh and golly, gosh-a-rooty, folks.

936
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:41,060
It's the time for the Puzzling Evidence Gabbling Gobbling Gossip File.

937
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,140
OK, go ahead.

938
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:45,000
Here are all your favorites as you like to hear them.

939
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,160
Gossip a-way.

940
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:52,180
Customers, you tell us about the rituals and tribal rites of today's.

941
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,080
No, that's not what I want to hear about.

942
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,200
Well, what would you like us to go into on the show?

943
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,240
Try something else.

944
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,420
That's what they want to hear about outside, outside there, the audience.

945
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,200
I'll leave that up to you.

946
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,500
I have absolutely no opinion this morning as I am not quite awake yet.

947
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,500
You and me too, but...

948
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,800
I'm awake by the end of show.

949
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:11,560
Oh, yes.

950
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:15,400
You know, I've been listening to your show for over six years.

951
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,040
Really?

952
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:16,140
Yeah.

953
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,140


954
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,140


955
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,140


956
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,140


957
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,140


958
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,140


959
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,140


960
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,140


961
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,140


962
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,140


963
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:16,960
Over 60 years.

964
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,920
And sometimes I think that you don't appreciate your colors.

965
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,620
Oh, I would if I could, but...

966
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:30,360
Well, did you know, I, do you appreciate local music in San Francisco?

967
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,360
Local music, yeah.

968
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,120
Well...

969
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:32,900
Music or local?

970
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:37,120
The greatest guitarist, Jimi Hendrix, is playing in San Francisco soon.

971
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,600
He's the native of San Francisco.

972
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,620
It's Helios Creed.

973
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,460
Have you heard of him?

974
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:42,580
I know him.

975
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,180
You do?

976
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,140
I've shared laughs and smiles and tears with him.

977
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,140


978
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,140


979
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,140


980
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,140


981
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,140


982
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,140


983
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,140


984
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,140


985
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,140


986
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,140


987
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,140


988
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,140


989
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,700
You've shared tabs with him, haven't you?

990
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,720
I beg your pardon?

991
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,420
You've shared tabs with him.

992
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,000
I've shared laughs.

993
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,300
Oh, I thought you said tabs.

994
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:59,620
The last time I saw Helios, we were watching an old Nelson Eddy movie in his beat-up school

995
00:49:59,620 --> 00:49:59,940
bus.

996
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,920
He is the greatest guitarist alive today, I believe, personally.

997
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,000
Well, what do you know about that?

998
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:07,520
A fan.

999
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,580
Here, have a cigar and put your feet up on the end.

1000
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,320
And what are you doing with that cigar?

1001
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,000
Oh, I kind of like that.

1002
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:13,740
I wouldn't use a cigar if I were you.

1003
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,220
You don't know that.

1004
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,120
But I just, I was wondering, you know, I'm a guitarist.

1005
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,120


1006
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,920
You know, I, sometimes I just don't think you appreciate us callers.

1007
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,340
I do appreciate you.

1008
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:26,580
On the other hand, there are certain elements of caller behavior which I must frown at,

1009
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,680
if not actively discourage.

1010
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,640
Are you familiar with the sport of horse racing?

1011
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,200
Get that giant arachnid away from me.

1012
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,380
Am I familiar with what?

1013
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,380
Are you familiar with the sport of horse racing?

1014
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,620
The spore of, oh, the sport of horse racing.

1015
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,160
Well, marginally familiar with it.

1016
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,740
Do you know what binging is?

1017
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,160
Bing-ing-ing.

1018
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,140
Bing-ing.

1019
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,500
Do you know what that is?

1020
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:49,600
Bing-ing.

1021
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,880
No, what is it?

1022
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,660
Is it knobbling him?

1023
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,540
Is it knobbling him?

1024
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,960
No, it's scraping the extra skin off.

1025
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,060
That is knobbling him.

1026
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:57,760
Oh, it is?

1027
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,100
Oh, well, how do you spell that?

1028
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,220
You knobble him a little bit.

1029
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:00,860
How do you spell?

1030
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,320
Well, I would never do such things myself.

1031
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:03,900
Well, neither do I.

1032
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:04,700
I just watch.

1033
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,200
Well, you are a sick fool, Mr. I.

1034
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,880
Well, how do you, how do you spell that?

1035
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,860
What do you say?

1036
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,840
N-O-B-B-L-I-N-G.

1037
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,680
N-O-B-B-L-I-N-G.

1038
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,120
Double B.

1039
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:21,600
To interfere with a racehorse in the proud pursuit of his doom.

1040
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,840
Could you repeat that again?

1041
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,700
N-O-B-B-what?

1042
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:27,080
I am sorry if you're not keen enough to get our pearls of wisdom the first time.

1043
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,620
We don't stop and stoop by the side of the road to repeat them again.

1044
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,400
N-O-B-B.

1045
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,020
N-O-B-B.

1046
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:38,000
B-B is those tiny copper pellets that have offended many a youthful eye.

1047
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,160
And you know that I have met the most interesting people while stopping and stooping by the

1048
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:42,960
side of the road.

1049
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,180
But how do you spell it?

1050
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,660
While stooping in the woods on a snowy day.

1051
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:45,660


1052
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,260
While stooping in the woods on a snowy evening.

1053
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,320
Well, that's...

1054
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,920
Whose woods these are, I think I know.

1055
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,120
Yeah, who's stooping to what information?

1056
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,640
His house is in the village, though.

1057
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:57,940
He will not see me squatting here to make a stain upon his snow.

1058
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,160
You know Helios King?

1059
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,440
And yes, we do.

1060
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,060
But we don't need to talk about him right now.

1061
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,380
We've got 15 minutes left.

1062
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,100
Holy show!

1063
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,440
Well, what's the topic of the last part of our script, Doctor?

1064
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,660
I think coming UFO day, we'll be able to see the world.

1065
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:15,660


1066
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:15,660


1067
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:15,660


1068
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:15,660


1069
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:15,660


1070
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:15,980
It's a little bit more interesting for us, but I think I'll take a look at it.

1071
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:15,980


1072
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:15,980


1073
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:15,980


1074
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:15,980


1075
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:15,980


1076
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:15,980


1077
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:15,980


1078
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,020
I think we should talk about UFOs.

1079
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:16,920
UFOs?

1080
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:17,760
Oh!

1081
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:23,220
We should let the audience in on some of the secrets that we know here in the church.

1082
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,940
You mean about the aliens?

1083
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,760
Yes, Hal.

1084
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,880
The beautiful Poo-tees of the future.

1085
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:34,980
Of course, we have been in the arena of these space aliens before.

1086
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:40,500
Both my colleague and I have been interviewed by reputable organizations and have a pillared

1087
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:48,280
in the filmic record of UFO contactees available from do-nothing films in cassette form and

1088
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:52,660
handy compact disc crossover form.

1089
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,160
Look for it at stores everywhere.

1090
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,940
And now, our national anthem.

1091
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,020
Doug, Doug, I don't think this is working.

1092
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,560
What?

1093
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,100
Oh, it's cool.

1094
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,920
Oh, I'm sorry, I see.

1095
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,220
This is, okay, all right.

1096
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:20,440
In other news, giant spiders were reported to have lurked near the Berkeley campus in

1097
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,240
that troubled university town.

1098
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:29,420
Although local officials claim the sightings are simply a youthful prank, a hoax or indiscretion

1099
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:37,060
of impressionable youngsters, there are those who give the odd claims more than a passing

1100
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:37,700
credence.

1101
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,080
Oh, probably.

1102
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:39,540
Uh-oh.

1103
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,500
Wouldn't want to give too much credence to them subgenius reports.

1104
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,880
Although I guess it's time for me to do a subgenius report here.

1105
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:55,280
I need to let you know what you've been listening to, besides the swinging love corpses in the

1106
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:02,580
background and the hour of slack subgenius show of which all of these things have been

1107
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:02,940
a part.

1108
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:09,080
I played this very weird song that Reverend Day, the president of the New York Times,

1109
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,740
Dave Mitchell, had sent in.

1110
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:20,640
The song about slack by a Japanese group, that group is called Shonen Night.

1111
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:27,900
It's a song called Lazy Bones, although I don't think they ever used the word from the

1112
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,220
title.

1113
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:36,740
The Golden Showers Task Force was from the all-pro cavalcade for Bob in Atlanta.

1114
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,080
They seem to have quite a few.

1115
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:45,140
A few of those little commercial-type announcements, which we'll hear next week, perhaps.

1116
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:52,640
A lot of transitional media barrage-type clips and music mixes, both by William Gillespie

1117
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,740
and by Nick Nolan.

1118
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:59,940
A piece of song, Thinking About the Future, by Indian Ropeburn.

1119
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:06,120
And some weird music by an unnamed band, an unnamed cassette.

1120
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,820
I got this tape in the mail from somebody named...

1121
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,340
Sam in Austin.

1122
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:16,520
You wouldn't believe what was in that package, dear friends, but I'm not going to tell you,

1123
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,300
because Sam would get in big trouble.

1124
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:28,840
And a little bit of something called Radio Sphincter from the Dad's New Slack Show of

1125
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,920
their port towns in Maine.

1126
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:37,140
And, of course, Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence and The Callers.

1127
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,080
The Strange Callers.

1128
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,280
The Strange Callers on the KPFA Subgenius Show.

1129
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:46,020
A lot of people have been calling in tonight, been keeping Will real busy on the phone.

1130
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,420
Oh, he lied to you.

1131
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,860
He was lying.

1132
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:54,760
To find out the real information, what you really need to know, you need to just drop

1133
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:58,860
us a postcard with your address, and we'll send you the free information.

1134
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,980
But where and what are we?

1135
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,320
That's easy.

1136
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,560
Just write to...

1137
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,200
Bob.

1138
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,380
Simple enough.

1139
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,200
Should be.

1140
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:19,040
At Post Office Box 140306.

1141
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,300
In lovely Dallas, Texas.

1142
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,180
75214.

1143
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,920
Once again, that's Bob at Post Office Box 143...

1144
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,000
Wait a minute.

1145
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:29,340
One...

1146
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,160
Oh, it's the swinging love corpse music in the background.

1147
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,680
It's twisting my mind.

1148
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,980
That's Box 140306.

1149
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:38,880
Dallas.

1150
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:39,340
Texas.

1151
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:41,640
75214.

1152
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,280
Ah, yeah.

1153
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,420
Yeah.

1154
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,800
Well, you guys hurry up.

1155
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,480
Yo, lady, we're digging as fast as we can.

1156
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,820
Well, come on.

1157
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:04,840
I'm on in a minute.

1158
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,060
Oh, we hit something.

1159
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,040
Good.

1160
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:08,120
Good.

1161
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,280
Get him up here.

1162
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,060
All right.

1163
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,240
Now cue the band.

1164
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:19,760
Ladies and gentlemen, 1992 Grammy Award winner, Miss Natalie Cole and her...

1165
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:24,940
Unforgettable.

1166
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,640
Unforgettable.

1167
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:28,500
In every way.

1168
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,060
In every way.

1169
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:34,740
Unforgettable.

1170
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:36,460
Unforgettable.

1171
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,480
Dad.

1172
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:38,740
Daddy.

1173
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,020
Come on, Daddy.

1174
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:40,520
Get up.

1175
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,600
Daddy, get your bones up here.

1176
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,600
You're wrecking the song.

1177
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,780
Dad, get up.

1178
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:47,120
Daddy.

1179
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,000
Daddy, come on.

1180
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,360
Come on.

1181
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,380
Come on.

1182
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,240
Call me.

1183
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:08,020
The best way in the world for you and me...

1184
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:08,020


1185
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:08,020


1186
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,200
...to be victorious...

1187
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,040
...is to call the manager.

1188
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,480
This is Bob speaking.

1189
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:13,260


1190
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:32,220
I was so psyched out on the Booger Man, I looked everywhere for him.

1191
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,060
I was always taught as...

1192
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,900
I was always taught as a...

1193
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,000
I was always taught as a youngster...

1194
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,720
...down in Sweetwater, Alabama, that the Booger Man was gonna get me.

1195
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,000
You ever been taught that?

1196
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,360
How many have ever been taught to the Booger Man to look for?

1197
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,140
Alabama for him.

1198
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:45,640
High for him.

1199
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:46,420
University of Alabama.

1200
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,000
University of Alabama.

1201
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:48,980
Gonna get me.

1202
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:49,860
Booger Man to get you.

1203
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,080
You ever been taught that the Booger Man looked everywhere for him?

1204
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,140
Bob and the Devil.

1205
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,680
Bob and the Devil.

1206
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,080
We're in space.

1207
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,600
Now believe it.

1208
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,560
It's real.

1209
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,060
The world.

1210
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,560
Why is it real?

1211
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,940
Do you know where you are?

1212
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:18,800
Nowhere.

1213
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:19,760
Nowhere.

1214
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:21,380
BOMBER.

1215
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,480
Now the chips that one won't tell my mother,

1216
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,140
Before I was born,

1217
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,900
She said, you got a boy childs a-coming.

1218
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,160
He's gonna be a son of a gun.

1219
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,140
It's gonna make you dance

1220
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,660
Jump and shout

1221
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,080
Then the world, then the world

1222
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:44,580

I'm a hootie-cootie man

Everybody knows I'm here

1229
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,800
I got a black cat bone

01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,820
I got a mojo too, baby

1231
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,320
I got a little drama coming

1232
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,920
We're gonna jump and dance

1233
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:32,340
With you

1234
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,880
I'm gonna make you a girl

1235
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,900
