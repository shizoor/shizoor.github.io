1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
From PR News in Washington, I'm described as a person of interest.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:10,980
Meanwhile, President Trump says White House officials says Pierce Horst says Trump offered PR to gag the victims and their families.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,720
Everyone at every level of government.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,680
That's PR's suspicious reporting.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,420
The Dow is 10-24-7-24.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,860
It's unclear when President Trump plans to announce this is PR.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,920
Boys and girls, your attention please.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,600
Presenting a new exciting radio program featuring the thrilling adventures of an amazing and incredible personality.

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,520
The Self Genius.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,140
Power of Swag.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,260
Abnormal Perversion.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,400
Oh yes, dear friends, thank you Mr. Fernandez and Andy Lemur for the titles and news.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,900
And tonight, we're continuing the epic two-parter call-in show with the...

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,880
The resurrected Lonesome Cowboy Dave and myself, Reverend Stang.

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,740
But first, well friends, we survived the Texas deep freeze of 2022.

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,540
I may have saved Texas, although I'm not sure that's good.

17
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:26,340
Now, we were pretty traumatized on this exact date last year when the temperatures in north-central Texas stayed around 10 degrees Fahrenheit or colder for days.

18
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,860
And millions...

19
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,040
Millions of us, including everyone at Stang Ranch here, were without power, heat, or water for days.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,380
It was really miserable.

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:41,900
Hundreds died, mostly of stupidity, like burning furniture indoors and suffering carbon monoxide poisoning.

22
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,960
Our house's plumbing was saved because we lived in Cleveland for decades and knew to leave all the faucets running.

23
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,900
This year, friends, I was smart and spent 500 bucks on a general...

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,020
A generator.

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,080
And some space heaters.

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,240
However, I was also stupid and didn't order them soon enough.

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,360
In fact, they probably won't be here until tonight.

28
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:14,440
But the fact that I spent all that money prevented the winter storm from being so disastrous.

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:26,640
If I had not spent that 500 bucks, there would have for sure been terrible rain, sleet, and ice knocking out power stations all over the state and wrecking the infrastructure again.

30
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:40,340
By my spending that money, however, subgenius sympathetic magic kicked in, making my purchase suddenly pointless, simply by preventing much worse weather.

31
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:49,200
As Dr. Uncle Onan Canabite said, rival cults put the simp in sympathetic magic.

32
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,780
The Church of the Subgenius practices pimp-aesthetic magic.

33
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,460
Anyway, I saved millions of lives of Texans.

34
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,800
Again, whether this is actually a good thing, that's debatable.

35
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,400
Anyway, we dodged a bullet.

36
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,440
Ted Cruz...

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,320
Oh, thank you, thank you.

38
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,360
Thank you, my fellow Texans.

39
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:25,040
Ted Cruz is probably in Cancun again, but he probably also set up a life-size stand-up photo of himself next to a window in his Texas house.

40
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,160
To fool reporters.

41
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,160
Anyway, we're fine.

42
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,980
The snow and ice is melting away.

43
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:43,320
And the fact that I have this expensive 5,000-watt generator sitting on my porch should prevent my having to actually use it, maybe forever.

44
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:52,260
I have to credit Reverend Pease for the theory about the generator purchase stafing off its own necessity.

45
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,120
Another bright idea.

46
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,680
Reverend Pease had was that we should make Hour of Slack exclusively available only on Spotify.

47
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,740
Then sit back and watch heads explode.

48
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,080
Very funny, Reverend Pease.

49
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,160
The dogs and cats are all okay, as is Wee Ma Ma, age 92.

50
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:22,320
Princess Wee's getting some help since her mom is technically in hospice now and the government pays for daily nurse aides.

51
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,100
Once it knows you probably won't be needing them for much longer.

52
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,100


53
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,020
And in other news, business is terrible.

54
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:40,300
We raised the ordainment kit price for the first time in 20 years by 10 bucks, which apparently is way too much.

55
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,640
Subgenius.com.

56
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,420
But enough of this.

57
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,300
You don't want to hear any more of this.

58
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:54,980
You want to hear me read the beginning of our newly published subgenius mystery novel by Reverend Teeters LaVerge.

59
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,980
Called The Agent and Mr. Dobbs.

60
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,080
The recording is not new.

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,680
And yet here it is.

62
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,280
I have a manuscript here.

63
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:16,160
This was turned in by Reverend Teeters LaVerge of the Church of the Subgenius.

64
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,640
He's been, well, I'll just read it.

65
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,980
The title is The Agent and Mr. Dobbs.

66
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,880
And actually the manuscript is from October 1962.

67
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:40,080
But these papers were found on the body of a transient party clown in the city of Albany, New York in 1989.

68
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,700
The papers had been meticulously taped back together after an apparent attempt at shredding them.

69
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,280
Some pages are missing.

70
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,960
The party clown was determined by the county coroner to have been killed by a police officer.

71
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,280
He was killed by being force-fed copious amounts of silly putty.

72
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:11,660
Some of which still had a cartoon imprint of a pleasant yet disturbing face of a smiling man with a pipe clenched between his teeth.

73
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,100
Now here is the manuscript.

74
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,720
As I said, this is from 1962.

75
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,300
So you'll have to forgive some of the dated terminology used by the agent who wrote this.

76
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:32,620
I'm skipping over a part where he was dropped off at the Dobbs house or mansion.

77
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:43,700
The knocker on the huge oaken front door was a rather heavy, rusty iron piece in the shape of a dollar sign.

78
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,580
I banged it down thrice and awaited an answer.

79
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:54,280
Soon the door creaked open and in front of me stood the tallest colored man I have ever seen.

80
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,280


81
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,460
Even taller than Agent 541.

82
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,020
However, he had a very high, squeaky voice that resembles a certain cartoon mouse.

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,280
He asked me my business and I replied that I had an urgent appointment with Mr. Dobbs.

84
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:19,760
The man answering the door seemed fairly out of it too and replied back that the sky was pretty damn blue today.

85
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,260
Again, I had to wait a few minutes until he asked me my business.

86
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,700
But before I could answer, he was ushering me into the cavernous building.

87
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,620
Once inside, I noticed that it was rather well-appointed with both new and antique furnishings,

88
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,780
which to my eyes seemed to come from all corners of the earth and were set about in no discernible pattern.

89
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,900
There were piles of paper and stacks of money everywhere.

90
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,740
What caught my eye, though, was the incredible amount of junk laying about the place.

91
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:59,100
This Mr. Dobbs, it would seem, had a habit of collecting useless objects found by the side of the road.

92
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,840
Finally, after walking through many hallways, I was shown to a door and told to walk in.

93
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,200
But I was expected.

94
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,740
I did as told.

95
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,060
The room I entered was the most sane that I had so far seen.

96
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,580
A typical den that any well-cultured man may have in his home.

97
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,720
Mr. Dobbs was sitting in a large leather room.

98
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,680
He was wearing a leather armchair with his back to me, a billow of smoke coming up from his front.

99
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,460
I slowly walked over to him.

100
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,820
He said nothing, but with his right hand he motioned me to sit on a folding metal chair adjacent to him.

101
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,380
He seemed to be engrossed in a television program.

102
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,600
It was Leave It to Beaver, a wholesome program.

103
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,060
Suddenly he began to speak.

104
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,080
I do love this show.

105
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,600
That Ward Cleaver is one relaxed man.

106
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,740
Connie doesn't like me to watch this program.

107
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,440
She thinks it's pornographic, but that's why I like it.

108
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,580
He fell into a deep silence, intently watching a commercial and nodding his head in time with the jingle.

109
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,900
When the commercial ended, he turned to me and asked,

110
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,940
What can I do for you, young agent?

111
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,240
I noticed then that even though the upper half of his body was clad in a dark suit with white shirt and dark tie,

112
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,180
the bottom half of his body was clad only in wingtip shoes.

113
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,960
I thought that was very disturbing and put me off for a moment,

114
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,340
but I'd been warned by my handlers that this Mr. Dobbs had many tricks up his sleeve,

115
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,320
and I took this as his way of making a person uncomfortable.

116
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,640
I regained my composure and told him,

117
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,660
Mr. Dobbs, the agency I work for has a request for you.

118
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,520
When suddenly Mr. Dobbs got up out of his chair and walked over to a well-appointed wet bar

119
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,160
and poured a tumbler full of what he claimed was the finest scotch,

120
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,700
saying it was from Malaysia or Canada.

121
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,500
My memory begins to get hazy here.

122
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,860
It was not scotch at all. It smelled like grape,

123
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,220
but tasted for the life of me like gasoline.

124
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,840
He bade me to drink.

125
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,860
Knowing that he's an important partner, I tried to force down a sip.

126
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,220
Then Mr. Dobbs did the strangest thing.

127
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,520
He started to do what I believe is called a hula dance,

128
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,560
yet he was humming some tango to himself.

129
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,620
Even though I was warned,

130
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,180
I can't abide a half-naked man dancing in front of me.

131
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,740
Yet I was transfixed.

132
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,980
I know now that I must have been drugged.

133
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,120
He danced for a while, too close to me for my waning comfort.

134
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,720
My heart beat faster,

135
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,640
and the rank smoke from his pipe seemed to make my head swim and my vision fade.

136
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,720
I thought I was about to faint when my heart nearly burst

137
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,700
as I felt a pair of hands starting to massage me.

138
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:59,660
I looked up to see a beautiful blonde with a perfect perm smiling down on me.

139
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,660
I took this to be his wife, Connie.

140
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,680
She said,

141
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,480
Don't fret. Bob likes to dance on Fridays.

142
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,100
She continued,

143
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,300
Now, now, dearie, we mustn't mess with our company.

144
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,720
Mr. Dobbs ignored her and continued his lewd dance.

145
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,700
Connie bade me to ask Bob what questions I may need to ask.

146
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,880
I started out by getting straight to the point,

147
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,620
reminding him of the troubles with Cuba.

148
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,540
Mr. Dobbs then did the queerest thing I'd seen him do yet.

149
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,680
He ran over to a big wooden box on the bar,

150
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,700
opened it, and pulled out a huge novelty cigar.

151
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,360
He then proceeded to insert said huge novelty cigar up his...

152
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,800
...neither port.

153
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,640
The cigar spontaneously ignited,

154
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,680
and Mr. Dobbs blew smoke rings out of his ear.

155
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:57,340
Surely this was an illusion or a hallucination from my drugged state.

156
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,580
I found myself mesmerized by Mr. Dobbs' antics.

157
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,480
Connie's back rub and the scotch I found myself taking a liking to.

158
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,800
Connie's hands reached down to my lap

159
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,640
as I watched Mr. Dobbs preach about economics and Cuba and war

160
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,800
and how it all tied together,

161
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,420
all the while bent over with a huge cigar puffing away in his...

162
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,680
...netherworld.

163
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,300
And that is the last I remember of that evening.

164
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,020
The ensuing lie detector tests and truth serums have borne that out.

165
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,820
I awoke the next morning, late, I believe,

166
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,780
with a cool breeze fluttering through pastel pink curtains.

167
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,380
I had the worst hangover I'd ever experienced.

168
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,940
I cannot fully describe the sensation.

169
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,800
It was somewhere between getting a root canal and the high of three martinis.

170
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,680
I was startled to notice that Connie was still alive,

171
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,220
and that Connie Dobbs was nude lying next to me.

172
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,200
I tried getting up but soon regretted it by the dizziness it caused,

173
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,360
and worst of all, I saw what was laying next to Connie.

174
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,380
All I saw was its shoulders and a cheap bouffant wig on its head.

175
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,700
Its skin was grey.

176
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,820
I don't mean sickly human grey.

177
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,420
I mean grey as grey can be.

178
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,900
Its body shape was all out of whack too.

179
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,760
Then I had fleeting memories of a wild sexual encounter with Mrs. Dobbs

180
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,560
and something else.

181
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,500
I remember having intercourse with orifices that were not human.

182
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,160
I must have shuddered, for Connie rolled over and picked up a glass of some clear liquid

183
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,980
off the nightstand and two tablets.

184
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,240
She demanded I take them, for they would make me feel better.

185
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,780
I inspected the tablets, and though they resembled your basic aspirin,

186
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:48,720
they were had embossed on them the word PILS spelled P-I-L-S.

187
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,440
Afraid of being drugged again, I tried to hide them in my cheek,

188
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,880
but when I drank the liquid, they just slid down my throat.

189
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,940
Within minutes, reality started to fade and some sort of orgy began.

190
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,600
The last thing I remember was Mr. Dobbs, dressed as a clown,

191
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,460
with no pants on of course, attempting to take my virginity.

192
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,640
I still have nightmares about this, but as they say, my country, right or wrong.

193
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,820
Weeks passed that I have little memory of.

194
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,740
I know nothing.

195
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,960
I know this only because of the date in which I was retrieved by the agency.

196
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,720
The Dobbses and their minions kept me pretty well...

197
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,360
fropped up, as they called it.

198
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,400
The next event that I have any clear memory of was of taking a ridiculously long elevator ride

199
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,800
deep into the earth at the Bobco Mining and Soylent Green Consortium in Wyoming.

200
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,040
We must have been on that elevator for three hours.

201
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,000
One of Dobbs' minions took my watch during the orgy and refused to give it back,

202
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,320
saying,

203
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,040
Bob doesn't pay enough and he had to get some stuff for a weekend party

204
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,620
he and the Kennedys were having with one Dr. Oswald.

205
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,760
When we finally alighted from the elevator, to my surprise,

206
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,000
we were not in some mine shaft as I expected,

207
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,060
but in a huge vaulted warehouse full of novelty goods

208
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:15,160
that were being stacked and sorted by strange short men shrouded in sack rags.

209
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,000
Bob claimed that they were ex-Nazis, scientists,

210
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,600
working on some, quote,

211
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,340
super-duper extra-secret, unquote,

212
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,900
project for the government.

213
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,480
I could clearly see that they were not men at all,

214
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,840
but slaves of some unknown species.

215
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,860
By this time, I had found it to my better judgment

216
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,740
not to doubt Mr. Dobbs, at least not out loud.

217
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,040
We took a golf cart type of vehicle down a long, winding corridor.

218
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,220
Mr. Dobbs not once paid any attention to where he was driving.

219
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,560
He decided to, at that time, ramble on and on

220
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,800
about some mysterious substance he called slack,

221
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,760
all the while puffing insanely on his pipe,

222
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,020
the bowl of which soon glowed a bright red.

223
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,740
During this journey, we ran over three of Bob's slave men

224
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,440
and nearly hit countless others.

225
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,220
Mr. Dobbs was oblivious to each, quote,

226
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,380
accident.

227
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,240
I put that in quotes for each one of the slaves we ran over,

228
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,480
I happened to notice had been pointing a weapon of some sort at Mr. Dobbs

229
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,200
right before his eyes.

230
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,940
And this happened before he mindlessly ran over them.

231
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,400
This mysterious Mr. Dobbs may have some sort of

232
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,760
second sight or is just incredibly lucky.

233
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,940
As you'll see, I believe it has more to do with luck

234
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,180
and some sort of strange time control powers

235
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,520
than with anything else.

236
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,580
Mr. Dobbs' underground office was a horror.

237
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,860
I can barely describe it.

238
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,980
It was a total mess and stank of the tobacco

239
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,360
that he constantly smoked.

240
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,960
In fact, I never saw Mr. Dobbs

241
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,580
without that infernal pipe clenched between his teeth.

242
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,040
It was only after a few minutes of adjusting to the stench and the mess of the office

243
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,440
that I saw something that horrified me.

244
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,260
The place had several severed human heads strewn haphazardly all over.

245
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,180
Now, I've seen some terrible sights in my life,

246
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,240
and I suspect that if I'm on the Dobbs case, I will see worse.

247
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,740
But what made me gasp was that the heads were not of random humans,

248
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,100
but of public figures that we would all recognize.

249
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,420
I saw the heads of, and this section was carefully cut out of the original report,

250
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,540
and one was actually singing.

251
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,460
It begged me in the tenor to please kill me.

252
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,120
Surprisingly, in the state I had been in, I did not faint.

253
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,920
Instead, with all the smoke from Bob's special tobacco mix, I started to laugh.

254
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
This got Bob all worked up.

255
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,540
He started to jump around inanely and laugh.

256
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,880
He then proceeded to use one of the heads, not the singing one,

257
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,740
and then he started to sing in a most foul manner.

258
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,320
Bob bade me sit down on a chair that was stacked high with papers.

259
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,700
I looked at the stack and back at Bob, wondering what he expected me to do.

260
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,080
By this time, I'd begun to get in the spirit of the situation

261
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,780
and laughingly knocked the stack of papers on the floor.

262
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,920
Mr. Dobbs didn't seem to mind.

263
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
In fact, he stared down at the mess I made and said,

264
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,660
thanks, picked up a sheet of paper saying he'd been looking for this contract for quite some time.

265
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,000
The glyphs.

266
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,080
The glyphs on the sheet were of no known human alphabet that I have ever encountered.

267
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,860
For some reason, this worried me and reminded me of the slaves I saw working for Bob

268
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,060
and that dreadful night with Mrs. Dobbs and that strange gray creature.

269
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,280
I did not have much time to consider the implications,

270
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,120
for Mr. Dobbs wadded up the paper, tossed it in a corner, and told me to follow him.

271
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:42,360
This time, we did not take the vehicle, but instead walked down dark and dank corridors,

272
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,380
which had a gradual downslope.

273
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,040
Being without a timepiece, I cannot estimate the amount of time we walked, but it seemed like hours.

274
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:57,480
Here, I must admit, my perceptions of time had been warped by constant exposure to Bob's tobacco.

275
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,760
Mr. Dobbs finally guided me to our final destination.

276
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,900
What I saw in that final circle of hell I cannot, I will not reveal.

277
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,800
Through all the pressure that the Agency could bear against me, a loyal, true blue agent and American,

278
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,980
I found it in our best interest to see if we could find a way to get out of this mess.

279
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:14,980


280
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:14,980


281
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,560
I found it in our best interest to keep something secret, even from the boss, the man in the dress.

282
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,540
I do this for the good of our nation and out of fear,

283
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:30,820
for what Mr. Dobbs revealed to me was so horrific, so humorous, so bizarre, so unchristian,

284
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,500
so baffling and dangerous, that I hyperventilated through the inane laughter

285
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,440
that was my only defense lest I totally lose my mind.

286
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,660
The last thing I remembered that day was Mr. Dobbs dancing around my prostrate body.

287
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,840
He was prancing.

288
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,220
Really.

289
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,120
And mimicking my insane laughter with his own even crazier chortles.

290
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,660
He spoke no words.

291
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,880
He just laughed.

292
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,460
But his laughter seemed to speak volumes to my inner mind.

293
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,660
I laughed.

294
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,120
I wept.

295
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,820
I urinated in my undergarments, for Mr. Dobbs had somehow relieved me of my slacks.

296
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,420
When?

297
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,740
I do not recall.

298
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:10,680
And friends, at this point, I, Reverend Stang, must cease reading from the document,

299
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,920
The Agent and Mr. Dobbs, brought to us by Reverend T.

300
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,980
Peter LaVerge.

301
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,740
I've gotten a little ways into Part 2, and it goes all the way up to Part 6 so far.

302
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:26,620
However, I have a piece of music here that I think will be extremely pertinent to the

303
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,260
subject matter.

304
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,320
This is Reverend Angry Larry.

305
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,320
You know I live a life of danger for the FBI.

306
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,980
Keeping tabs on our names and on the news.

307
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:44,980


308
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,740
I'm the land on the sea and the sky!

309
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:58,040
And every single night, before I go to bed I get down on my knees and say, Bob, I'm a

310
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,280
secret agent man.

311
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,860
Secret agent man.

312
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,800
Secret agent man.

313
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:13,080
They give me a number, but they take away my name.

314
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,960
I'm a secret agent man.

315
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:14,960


316
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:14,960


317
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:14,960


318
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:14,960


319
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,480
I got one hell of a job to perform for the U.S. of A.

320
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,720
Got the responsibility of our nation's top security.

321
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:39,680
But every night and day, I salute the flag and say, Thank you, Connie, because I'm a

322
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
secret agent man.

323
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,000
Secret agent man.

324
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,360
Secret agent man.

325
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:44,960
Secret agent man.

326
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:55,040
They've given me a number, but they take away my name.

327
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,620
But every night and day, I salute the flag and say, Thank you, Connie, because I'm a secret

328
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:00,620


329
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:00,620


330
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:00,620


331
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,760
You know they got me doin' this, doin' that, a little bit of somethin' else.

332
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:11,080
Fightin' cavities of evil, safeguarding America's health.

333
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,940
But I didn't have any money, and now I've got to do what they told me to do.

334
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,820
Afternoon pass

335
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,180
I don't get up off my ass

336
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,440
Thank you Stan

337
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,920
Cause I'm a secret agent man

From up with them

00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,620
Sorry I didn't mean to break the flow

373
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,380
So to speak

374
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,660

376
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,460
Was echoing through this big hollow

00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,280
Castle earlier today

378
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,660

Cranked up

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,260
Boy she likes to crank up her rock and roll

385
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,400
And if the door's open

386
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
You can hear it everywhere

387
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,300
I peeked in and saw Barbara Streisand

388
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,500

The costumes

392
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,020
Oh I would love to make love to her nose

393
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,360
But that's up into your nose

394
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,280
Well is this your nose?

395
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:44,840
Oh this yes

396
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,380

That's what we should do

400
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,800
We should cut to fire sign theater

401
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,940
Turn this FM off here

402
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,000

Leave it on for a minute

408
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,580
What has happened to your nose?

409
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,920
I've just returned from Rome

410
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,320

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,060
When you're not anywhere at all?

425
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:48,460
I think I'll give this old baby a spin on the freeway

426
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,340
Wrong way

00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,120
Daddy, I've lost the Lincoln box.

470
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,400
That's all right.

471
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,500
I've got an erector set.

472
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,280
Show off.

473
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,660
Throw a towel over it.

474
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,120
Do some push-ups, Pablo.

475
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,940
It'll go away.

476
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,420
Hey, what are you guys doing in my car?

477
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,320
The fox trot.

478
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,700
You can have the next dance.

479
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,200
But throw him the fox.

480
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,900
This animal is sick.

481
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,980
Yes, it is a catchy little number.

482
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,240
Uh-oh, I think he's caught it.

483
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,960
Doctor, give him something for his car.

484
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,160
All right, all right.

485
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,180
Here's a quarter.

486
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:41,720
Oh.

487
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,700
That's not much.

488
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,700
Not much of a car.

489
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,080
I need a gas station.

490
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,680
Did I pass one?

491
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,500
No, no, but the fox did.

492
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,800
Squeeze him right there.

493
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,060
Maybe he'll pass another one.

494
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,300
No, no.

495
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:53,760
Gasoline.

496
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,240
Oh, my boy, if it's drugs you want,

497
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,920
the old doctor can help you out.

498
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,660
Right this way.

499
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,820
Hey, get your hands off me.

500
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,680
I don't want to leave.

501
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,320
Then roll up your arm and bend over.

502
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,020
Do you want regular or premium?

503
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,560
Oh, this is ridiculous.

504
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,420
You guys are nothing but a pack of cards.

505
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,200
Drink me.

506
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,840
Drink me.

507
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,360
Drink me.

508
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,420
Must be some way out of this.

509
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,860
I'll change the air.

510
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,540
That's what I'll do.

511
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:15,820
Let's see.

512
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,980
What have I got left on the climate control?

513
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,220
Uh, dust storm?

514
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:20,980
No.

515
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,160
Tibetan wilderness?

516
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,100
Land of the pharaohs.

517
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,720
Land of the pharaohs.

518
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,620
That sounds great.

519
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,620
All right, all right.

520
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,940
Here we are in the land of the pharaohs.

521
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,600
Oh, no.

522
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,340
Well, we'll need to take a break.

523
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:40,340


524
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:40,340


525
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,140
We'll talk with the natives.

526
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,300
Does anyone here know a little Egyptian?

527
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,920
Bill, Bill, come on.

528
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,820
You're good at languages.

529
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,780
Yes, come on, Bill.

530
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,540
Yes, yes, yes, indeed.

531
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,260
Yes, yes, yes.

532
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:48,620
That was it.

533
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,080
What?

534
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,280
Yes, indeed.

535
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:50,840
Yes, indeed.

536
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,260
Yes, a little Egyptian.

537
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,800
Yes, a little Egyptian.

538
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,100
Yes, everybody knows I'm mad.

539
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,760
Served my every need.

540
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,440
Did a grand job on my ankles, too.

541
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,000
Now, hold it right there.

542
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,080
Glad to.

543
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,240
Now, I think I'll hold it over here.

544
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,480
Oh, boy, it's nice out, isn't it?

545
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,980
Yes, I think you ought to leave it out.

546
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,880
Hey, hey, hey, look, fellas.

547
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,900
Fun's fun, okay.

548
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,700
But look, I gotta find a place to stay.

549
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,880
It's gonna be night soon.

550
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,140
I'm tired.

551
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,980
What's the matter with that dude?

552
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,460
I'm lost.

553
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,020
And I wanna go to bed.

554
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,500
Oh, my bony boy.

555
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,540
In the Estonian mountains,

556
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,040
we used to go to sleep

557
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,700
leaning up against a windfall.

558
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,500
I was but a mere prat then.

559
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,900
I'll never forget the time a snake

560
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,020
slithered into my wife.

561
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,160
I wasn't but knee-high

562
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,620
to a merry grasshopper then.

563
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,340
Oh, no, no, look, that's all very interesting.

564
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,000
But the sun is going down.

565
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,780
Oh, no, no, you're all confused.

566
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,840
The horizon is moving up.

567
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,300
Hey, listen, come on, you guys.

568
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,380
Help me, please.

569
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,180
I know, I know.

570
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,960
Let's stand him on his head.

571
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,940
Here you go.

572
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,700
Hey, hey, hey, put me down.

573
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,380
Relax, relax.

574
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,020
Easy, boy.

575
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:53,820
Ah, you see?

576
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,520
Now it's morning.

577
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,920
Oh, he's no fun.

578
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,160
He fell right over.

579
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,600
Hey, won't somebody please help me?

580
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,620
Easy, easy, my lad.

581
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,340
At times of dexterity like this,

582
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,320
my wee native compendium,

583
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,260
Mohamit,

584
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,600
used to pray to the divinitize.

585
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,820
His little brown froggy body

586
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,440
equivorate my loins,

587
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,360
chanting a stream of ancient Egyptian holograms.

588
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,320
What?

589
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,920
Diaphragms.

590
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,740
No, no, no, no.

591
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,160
Hieroglyphs, that's it.

592
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,160
Do you remember any?

593
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,840
Will they help?

594
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,560
Anything at all?

595
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,080
Yes, of course, of course.

596
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,620
Let's see.

597
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,280
It was a jackal-headed woman

598
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,400
with her eyes kimbo,

599
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,060
a king sitting sideways on his throne,

600
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,840
a drip with gold,

601
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,340
chippet nose uplifted,

602
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,300
and a dachshund.

603
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,940
All engraven on the pyramids of massy size,

604
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,880
with the body of a lion,

605
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,680
paws that refreshes,

606
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,380
a tail told by an idiot,

607
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,900
and the head of a fox.

608
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,200
The pyramid is opening.

609
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:54,980
Which one?

610
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,320
The one with the ever-widening hole in it.

611
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,180
I'm saved.

612
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,520
I'm going in.

613
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,240
No, don't do that, son.

614
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,280
It's dark and dirty in there.

615
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,380
Oh, but mom.

616
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,520
It's full of bees and spiders.

617
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,060
You might poke your eye out

618
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,880
when your father comes home.

619
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,540
I'm going in, mom.

620
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,420
There's a vacancy.

621
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,220
Good evening, sir.

622
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,400
Welcome to the only nice motel in town.

623
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,900
How long will you be with us?

624
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,120
Just for tonight.

625
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,660
Very well, sir.

626
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,760
You'll find it's very clean here.

627
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,640
Just fill out this card.

628
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,220
Oh, thanks.

629
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,180
Oh, look, it's dirty.

630
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,240
Somebody's already used it.

631
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,960
There's a name on it.

632
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,880
That's all right.

633
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,560
Well, I couldn't get you to believe

634
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,220
my name is Mr. and Mrs. Johns,

635
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,120
could I?

636
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,020
Well, of course you could.

637
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,220
It's nice to have you with us,

638
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,540
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

639
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,500
Run.

640
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,560
Hey, aren't you Mr. and Mrs. John Smiths?

641
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,180
From any town in the USA?

642
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:54,700
Hello.

643
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,880
I'm Joe, boy, and this here's Ed.

644
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,800
Hey, I'm not really Mr. and Mrs. John Smith.

645
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,900
Well, that's okay.

646
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,120
I'm not Joe.

647
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,440
And he's not Ed.

648
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,920
Hey, fella, how about bending a couple

649
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,000
in the doodah room?

650
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:09,860
Yes, sir.

651
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,060
To catch my meaning,

652
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,540
if you get my drift.

653
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,160
Thanks, fellas, but I'm kind of tired.

654
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,700
Hey, desk clerk, can I have my key, please?

655
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,400
Sure.

656
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,020
What about G7?

657
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,100
Get it, Jimmy.

658
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,260
I can tell by the pound you're tied.

659
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,280
You're an American.

660
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,320
Well, so am I.

661
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,020
Hi, bub.

662
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,320
Howdy.

663
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,180
How do you do?

664
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,460
And while we're on the subject...

665
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,500
And while we're on the subject...

666
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,440
And while we're on the subject...

667
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,280
Yo, wazoo!

668
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,860
What's that all about?

669
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,980
What's it all about,

670
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,000
Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Smith

671
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,620
from any town USA?

672
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:39,660
Well,

673
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,940
it's about this long...

674
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,600
And about that wide...

675
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,520
And it's about this country...

676
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,040
About which we're singing about.

677
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,880
I was born

678
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,480
an American.

679
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,020
I was raised

680
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,700
an American.

681
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,780
And I'll die

682
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,920
an American

683
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,500
in America

684
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,520
with our

685
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:07,860
meaning.

686
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,640
The end.

687
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,380
The end.

688
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,620
The end.

689
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,360
The end.

690
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:16,780
The end.

691
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:16,780


692
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:16,780


693
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,720
Oh, that was hilarious, wasn't it?

694
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,500
You like that transition I did?

695
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,240
Fire Sign Theater,

696
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,040
they're the greatest.

697
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,380
They were so much better

698
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,500
than anybody else

699
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,340
until, of course,

700
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,320
until we came along.

701
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,040
Is there any kind of

702
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,420
gaseous energy escaping

703
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,860
from your house right now,

704
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,340
you know?

705
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,620
Huh? What? Say that? What?

706
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,180
Oh, the gas is erupting

707
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,000
from your nostrils.

708
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,300
I mean,

709
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,840
you just sound like

710
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,940
you're making so much fun

711
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,340
that you can hardly hold it in.

712
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,120
That's Princess Wee,

713
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:52,560
not me.

714
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:53,980
Oh, okay.

715
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,420
Remember, she's the Robin Givens

716
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,600
to my Howard Stern.

717
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,320
She excuses my excesses

718
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,920
with her gay laughter.

719
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,960
Yeah, but Robin Givens

720
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,880
used to carry a gun,

721
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,160
a shotgun.

722
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:09,980
And if...

723
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,820
It's starting.

724
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,260
Well, she's...

725
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:13,960
Wah, wah, wah.

726
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,260
Hey, we figured out

727
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,480
where that wah, wah, wah,

728
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,040
what inspired that noise

729
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,040
in the score

730
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,540
of The Good, Bad, and the Ugly

731
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,900
by Ennio Morricone.

732
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,400
It's Coyote.

733
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,260
In the movie,

734
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,300
which I was watching last night,

735
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,440
it starts with these bad guys

736
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,320
in a really run-down

737
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,800
train station or something,

738
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,200
and they're about to go in

739
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,920
and kill Duco.

740
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,080
And there's a coyote,

741
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,140
a lone coyote going,

742
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,880
wah, wah, wah.

743
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,720
Mm-hmm.

744
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,100
And it suddenly comes

745
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,320
to the title music,

746
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,960
and that's the noise.

747
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,060
Wah, wah, wah.

748
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,320
Wah, wah, wah.

749
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,320
Ah!

750
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,140
Ah!

751
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,660
Ah!

752
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,520
Ah!

753
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:02,600
Ah!

754
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,020
Ah!

755
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,360
Ah!

756
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:09,420


757
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,680
Ah!

758
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,640
Ah!

759
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,020
Wah, wah, wah.

760
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:22,680
Blondie?

761
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,920
Don't die, Blondie.

762
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:25,960
Don't die.

763
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,400
I'm your friend.

764
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,740
Please don't die.

765
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,160
Please.

766
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,120
I'm your friend.

767
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,300
Come on, baby.

768
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,280
Come on.

769
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,040
Blondie?

770
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,720
I'll help you.

771
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,760
I'll help you.

772
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,760
Don't move.

773
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,520
I'll be right back.

774
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,300
Okay?

775
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,080
Did you notice those scenes before?

776
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,680
No, no.

777
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,600
When I was watching the movie, I heard the coyote.

778
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,620
When I was a kid, I didn't even know what a coyote sounded like.

779
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,500
I grew up in the city.

780
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,480
Out here, you can't escape them.

781
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:52,880
No.

782
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,360
And this is kind of like the Wild West.

783
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,940
It's definitely coyote country.

784
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,980
Until you get to the highway, then it's just goddamn suburbs.

785
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,260
Pinkland, normal town.

786
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,200
Out here, we've got a horse.

787
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,980
It ain't much of a horse.

788
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
It's a real old horse.

789
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,860
But there actually is a horse here.

790
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,200
He's a good-looking horse.

791
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,420
And a whole bunch of goats.

792
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,300
Yeah.

793
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,700
Oh, massive goats.

794
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,920
Good goats.

795
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,740
Goats are fun, too.

796
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,160
So mighty.

797
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,200
Great goats.

798
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,660
I am goat.

799
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,060
Well, once upon a time, we all were, you know.

800
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:36,760
We all came from Mammy Goat's uterus, or Chicken Pie, whatever it's called.

801
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,600
Mammy's Chicken Pie?

802
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,100
We all came from Mammy's Chicken Pie?

803
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,640
Yeah, the goat.

804
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,620
The goat woman.

805
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,120
Who looked a little bit like Adolf Hitler in her younger days.

806
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,660
And was constantly warned away from the rest of the kids.

807
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,320
Oh, you're quoting that famous Doctors for Wotan song,

808
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,140
Louie Louie, Are You a Girl or a Goat Woman?

809
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,700
Yeah.

810
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,740
I should cut to that, except that it's really horrible.

811
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,140
Louie Louie!

812
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,480
Louie Louie, Are You a Girl or a Goat Woman?

813
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,520
Louie Louie!

814
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,220
Louie Louie, Are You a Girl or a Goat Woman?

815
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,620
Louie Louie!

816
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,500
I didn't know.

817
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,160
I didn't know.

818
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,540
I wanted to say better.

819
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,740
But the science said she, the goat woman.

820
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,980
And I did it.

821
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,220
I tied my fencing rope and I saw her and there she was.

822
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,900
Oh, the rug!

823
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,340
And the most beautiful of all.

824
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,940
She left behind on the stage as she danced.

825
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,880
Tiny pellets.

826
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,400
Garth pellets.

827
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,460
And I knew she was the girl for me.

828
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,060
Louie, Louie.

829
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,480
I am a girl.

830
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,100
I am a girl.

831
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,360
Oh, my.

832
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,660
No, no, no, no.

833
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,000
No.

834
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,420
Well, that's why I played for that reason itself.

835
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,800
I'll just re-record it.

836
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,000
Louie, Louie.

837
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,220
Louie.

838
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,960
Uh-uh.

839
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,700
Uh-uh.

840
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:38,900
Uh-uh.

841
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,820
Are you a girl or a goat woman?

842
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,860
Uh-uh.

843
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,740
Uh-uh-uh.

844
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,640
And then I saw her at the carnival in the freak show.

845
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:53,700
She was so beautiful on her hooves and her beautiful goat woman breastage.

846
00:39:53,860 --> 00:40:00,200
And I looked back in the dressing room and there were little tiny pellets and droppings of it when I fell in love.

847
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,820
Now you're talking.

848
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,500
Louie, are you a girl or a goat woman?

849
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,000
Nah.

850
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:07,900
Nah.

851
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,300
Man, that's it.

852
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,980
That's just a 100 proof.

853
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:11,820
Yeah.

854
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:17,800
Now, that was the cover of Louie, Louie, Are You a Girl or a Goat Woman by Pooh Water Towel.

855
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,660
The original was Doctors's for Wotan.

856
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:27,540
Princess, we and I are Pooh Water Towel once every three years when we record a song.

857
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,040
We've got to record Buddy.

858
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:29,580
Yes.

859
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,160
The rock opera.

860
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,360
We do.

861
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,760
The doc, the doc, the prop rock.

862
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,760
Dog opera.

863
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,780
Well, here we are.

864
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,660
The rock opera.

865
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,080
Sitting here with the microphones, we should do it.

866
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,660
You know what?

867
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:48,520
I even have that karaoke cut of Tommy ready to go.

868
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,140
All right.

869
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,400
We cut it down to 17 minutes instead of an hour and a half.

870
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,440
It's based on Tommy, of course, the rock opera.

871
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,780
But it's Buddy.

872
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,780
Buddy, can you hear me?

873
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,700
And so on.

874
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,260
Buddy, can you hear me?

875
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,800
That was back when Buddy escaped.

876
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:06,720
I'm a different dog now.

877
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,840
He's a different dog now.

878
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,600
Hey, man.

879
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,920
That's a different dog, man.

880
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,620
Stay away from him.

881
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:12,940
Like me.

882
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,400
He's a different dog now, man.

883
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,340
Yeah.

884
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,260
Yeah.

885
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,300
Yeah, you got me wrong.

886
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,240
I'm a different dog now.

887
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:18,860
You got me wrong.

888
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,720
I didn't do it.

889
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:19,840
See?

890
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,280
Old Bob will sell just about anything to just about anybody.

891
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,240
What's he sold you today?

892
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,980
So, there's a great quote.

893
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,220
I wish I had come up with it.

894
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:32,560
I wish I had come up with it.

895
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,980
That it's easier to act your way into a new way.

896
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,500
Than to think your way into a new way of acting.

897
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,700
So, how important the external is to changing the internal.

898
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:53,300
It wasn't possible to measure happiness or to compare happiness across individuals.

899
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:59,220
We would look basically at consumer preferences.

900
00:41:59,940 --> 00:41:59,980
Yeah.

901
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,220
Yeah.

902
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,180
Yeah.

903
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,480
Yeah.

904
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:03,560
Yeah.

905
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:03,920
Yeah.

906
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:04,500


907
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:04,540


908
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,000


909
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,000


910
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,060
Yeah.

911
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,060


912
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,600
Yeah.

913
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:05,860
Yeah.

914
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:05,940


915
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:05,940


916
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:05,940


917
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:05,940


918
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:05,940


919
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:05,940


920
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:05,940


921
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:05,940


922
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:05,940


923
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:05,940


924
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:21,820
So, we would certainly go back into different ways.

925
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,380
You know, we would—

926
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,660
Well, we had our first apocalyptic experiment withそこにほったか nicみがいた

927
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:29,980
So, what they tried to do—

928
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,500
And so, wherever you look, you realize that you have the technology all this time.

929
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:32,500


930
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,580
And people have been using this và drives for that whole long time.

931
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,500
And now, they're screwed.

932
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:35,780


933
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:35,980


934
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:42,180
views on them partly cloudy skies with a high near 22 some lingering light snow flurries still in the

935
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,680
air partly cloudy tonight with a low of 12.

936
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:53,520
are you suffering from information overload

937
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,960
um

938
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,940
All right.

939
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,860
All right, it's all over.

940
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,500
We're all happy now.

941
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,580
We're so happy.

942
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,040
We all love each other.

943
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:05,500
There's evidence that human connection also modulates or can affect one's autonomic nervous system.

944
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:10,540
Human beings must be in the loop before someone is killed by a drone.

945
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,520
But it's in the machine.

946
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,260
My replica.

947
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,380
And it doesn't need people.

948
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,480
It's me, your computer.

949
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,580
I can't turn it off.

950
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,900
We need to talk.

951
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:20,640
I can't put it away.

952
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,340
It's in me.

953
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:21,860
It's computer.

954
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,280
Together.

955
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:22,940
You're me.

956
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,000
Don't get freaked out.

957
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,740
Don't get freaked out.

958
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,140
Destroy.

959
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,460
It can decide by itself whether or not it kills somebody.

960
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,020
Huh?

961
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,640
I don't see a good reason to believe that we would survive.

962
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,300
Don't get freaked out.

963
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,040
Don't get freaked out.

964
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,780
Don't get freaked out.

965
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,500
Don't get freaked out.

966
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:39,720
Yeah.

967
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,900
Don't get freaked out.

968
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,140
Don't get freaked out.

969
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:42,860
Don't get freaked out.

970
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,500
Don't get freaked out.

971
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:43,560
Okay, yeah.

972
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,980
I still think it would be fun to talk to a robot.

973
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,440
There was all kinds of experimentation and fun going on there.

974
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,600
All kinds of experimentation and fun.

975
00:44:54,180 --> 00:45:00,260
The answer to why is my brain like this is because your brain is like this.

976
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,720
And that's all there is to it.

977
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,600
There is no more.

978
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,100
Bummer.

979
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,900
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.

980
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,720
This is not a rerun.

981
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,100
Not a rerun.

982
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,400
It's bye.

983
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,800
It's bye.

984
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,860
Oh, well, in my paper, it's bye.

985
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,920
It's bye.

986
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,820
It's bye.

987
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,020
Alert.

988
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:36,660
Alert.

989
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,360
Alert.

990
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,740
Greetings, Bob.

991
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,300
Hello.

992
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:40,420
This is Bob.

993
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,680
I'm out of the moment.

994
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,400
If you leave your name and your telephone number, I will call you back.

995
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,940
You know, I waited for somebody to say Bob.

996
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,940
You know, I waited for somebody to say Bob.

997
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,540
You're fired.

998
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,300
I got the power.

999
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,880
I got the treasure.

1000
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,820
And you have a flight to catch.

1001
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:04,500
Huh?

1002
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:08,700
No.

1003
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,520
Closer to me.

1004
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,420
Long live the king.

1005
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:25,340
You shall not pass.

1006
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,160
That's it.

1007
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,560
No more Mr. Knife Guy.

1008
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,260
This is what life is like.

1009
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,220
At a...

1010
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,800
At a bottom line...

1011
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:39,620
level, you know, and I'm not going to make you cut through a lot of other stuff to get

1012
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,680
through it. Here's what it is. There's no gimmick about that. It's straightforward.

1013
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,520
It's strong and it's elemental.

1014
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:57,700
This wouldn't be a great way to do that on Earth, but it's really a very efficient way

1015
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,520
to do it.

1016
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,380
Well, when? Right now?

1017
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,480
Now? Go ahead.

1018
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,980
No, no. What are you waiting for? If not now, when? If not us, who?

1019
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,660
No, neither one of those two are all right right now.

1020
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,040
I have to go lay down in the toilet for a while.

1021
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:23,200
Well, Dave, it has been an hour and one minute

1022
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,420
of show.

1023
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,440
Yeah.

1024
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:33,260
I'll probably chop it up into two shows.

1025
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:33,820
Oh.

1026
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,680
You handsome dog.

1027
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,160
Yeti, say something.

1028
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,480
He does. He does talk.

1029
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,620
He does.

1030
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,300
No, that's not him. That's her doing it.

1031
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,580
No, I'm trying to get him to do it.

1032
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,220
I had a dog.

1033
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:54,780
That's how he talks, though.

1034
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:55,800
White?

1035
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,540
I'm just saying I had a dog who saved a kid from drowning.

1036
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,600
You did?

1037
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,120
Yes, he did.

1038
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,960
He jumped right in. They got me out, all right.

1039
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,840
And then the dog got in there and got the kid.

1040
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,780
And the kid put his arms around the dog's neck and swam him in.

1041
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,820
And the dog shook.

1042
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,100
And everybody that was watching the horrible event applauded and went, yeah.

1043
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,160
Was this when you were a small kid?

1044
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,880
No, this is when I was a 20-some-year-old kid.

1045
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,960
And thought I was the world's greatest athlete

1046
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,360
and would go running far, far, far away.

1047
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,140
And I was running far with my dog.

1048
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,920
And we came upon a place in the river that there was a, what's it called?

1049
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,360
Oh, I forget what they call that.

1050
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,600
A water.

1051
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,840
When the water sucks back up under and pulls you down.

1052
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,440
You get about five feet away from the dam.

1053
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,180
And then it pulls you back under.

1054
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,100
The undertow.

1055
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:57,600
The undertow.

1056
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:58,420
An undertow.

1057
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,260
And I was there for a much longer time.

1058
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,220
And the EMS people had to come.

1059
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,440
And dig me out.

1060
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,020
But my dog did save a kid's life.

1061
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,880
The kid was going, please, mister, help us.

1062
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,160
Please help us.

1063
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,720
And you didn't do anything.

1064
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,460
But the dog understood what the kid was saying.

1065
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,860
Well, kind of, yeah.

1066
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,000
Yeah, I thought, oh, we're so much smarter than dogs.

1067
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,540
Recently, on a training film,

1068
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,840
I saw a dog deliver, what's it called?

1069
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,640
Chest smackers.

1070
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:36,940
Chest smackers.

1071
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,360
Chest smackers.

1072
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:37,360


1073
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:37,360


1074
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:37,360


1075
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:37,360


1076
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:37,360


1077
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:37,360


1078
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:37,360


1079
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,480
Now, see, doesn't Dave say,

1080
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,720
ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff?

1081
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:39,800
Just that?

1082
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,220
A little bit.

1083
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:42,340
Yeah.

1084
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,720
That's when I can't hear.

1085
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:44,900
I can't understand him.

1086
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,640
I can hear him.

1087
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,240
But it doesn't.

1088
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:47,900
How about this way?

1089
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,260
I moved it like a microsecond to the left.

1090
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,420
There you go.

1091
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:52,960
Is that okay now?

1092
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:53,600
Yeah.

1093
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,060
Okay, well.

1094
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,100
I usually talk pointing my mouth just slightly to the side of the microphone.

1095
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,800
phone. That's what I have to do.

1096
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,720
So it's not popping the peas like

1097
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,360
a bunch of puds and

1098
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,180
puddlies.

1099
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,780
You wouldn't believe what that looks like on

1100
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,440
the waveform.

1101
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,820
It knocks everything else down because I've got

1102
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,800
an automatic volume limiter on here

1103
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,340
and the peas

1104
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,800
just make everything drop out for a second.

1105
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,840
I've seen

1106
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,080
what the plosives do.

1107
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,720
Plosives are a pain.

1108
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,240
Poppity peas.

1109
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,000
Peas.

1110
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,100
Oh,

1111
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,020
we just wrecked

1112
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:37,320
that recording

1113
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,060
and that song about

1114
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:39,680
pee-pees.

1115
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:41,580
Whatever.

1116
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,380
At least Reverend Peas will be proud.

1117
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,180
He'll go, oh, I see you finally mentioned me.

1118
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:47,880
It's about time.

1119
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,500
He will say that.

1120
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,760
As if it wasn't about time to begin with.

1121
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:53,080
You know?

1122
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,480
It's about time.

1123
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,140
It's about space.

1124
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,240
It's about two minutes.

1125
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,120
Craziest place.

1126
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:02,880
Starring Ruth Buzzy

1127
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,660
who lives over

1128
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,840
to Stephenville now.

1129
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,980
Believe it or not, Ruth Buzzy lives in

1130
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,200
Stephenville, Texas. Not far from here.

1131
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,040
Goodness. That's right down the street.

1132
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,660
Oh, she's my babe.

1133
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,800
Who else? Bob Denver

1134
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,100
and Chuck McCann. Now, why can

1135
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,940
I remember who was in that horrible

1136
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,300
crappy kids show

1137
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,160
and I can't remember

1138
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,000
your W-2 form?

1139
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,000
Mmm.

1140
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,180
Mmm.

1141
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:33,160
Oh.

1142
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,340
What?

1143
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,500
I think we all know.

1144
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,580
I think we do know. We know exactly

1145
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,660
why. Let's just not

1146
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,100
dwell on it. Let's not focus on that.

1147
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,540
Friends, you've been listening to the Hour

1148
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,540
of Slack here on radio station

1149
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,700
insert station here

1150
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,300
in the

1151
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,340
beautiful city of Bill

1152
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,380
Kate's voice should say the town.

1153
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,040
And that is

1154
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,100
that's all folks.

1155
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,180
Says

1156
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,840
Porky Pig. Some non-stutterer.

1157
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,120
I'll speak

1158
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,240
to you once again soon.

1159
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,380
I hope so.

1160
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,940
I hope so. I really

1161
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,140
hope so. I hope so too.

1162
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,060
I hope the

1163
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,140
snow melts someday there, Dave.

1164
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,760
That would be helpful

1165
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,040
in recovering my senses

1166
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,260
and my other stuff like that.

1167
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:24,820
Yeah.

1168
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,040
Yeah. Me too.

1169
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,480
Okay, man.

1170
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,100
Okay.

1171
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,200
Okay, man.

1172
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,400
Okay, woman.

1173
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,360
Okay.

1174
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:35,740
Okay. All right.

1175
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:36,800
Jesus.

1176
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,000
Enough.

1177
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,320
I bust her.

1178
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,100
Okay. I'm going to hang up.

1179
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,060
Oh, he hung up. See, he does that.

1180
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,400
Oh, look what Julian from

1181
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,740
Trailer Park Boys is saying

1182
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,260
to me on a message. I get notifications

1183
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,480
from Julian of Trailer Park Boys.

1184
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,280
Hey, dummy. The

1185
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,140
mobile is ready. Hurry up and

1186
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:56,820
get your ****.

1187
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,120
That's what it says. And he's right.

1188
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:01,980
Oh, well,

1189
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,000
should I turn the sound on for the

1190
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,200
Trailer Park Boys game? It's the same

1191
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,760
as their TV theme. Here.

1192
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:09,460

00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,020
Baby,

1220
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,940
it's the arriving life.

1221
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,240
You know Lollipop.

1222
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:56,120


1223
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,060
Thank you.

1224
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,660
Thank you.

00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,300
Thank you.
