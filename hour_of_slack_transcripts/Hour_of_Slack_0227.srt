1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,220
What is it about the human psyche that enjoys being scared?

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:15,600
Animals flee from frightening situations, but humans pay to relish them.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,880
Freddy films go from endless sequels to television series,

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,500
while Stephen King books become bestsellers overnight.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:35,200
But of all the media available, only one utilizes the very atmosphere most creatures automatically fear.

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,560
Total darkness.

7
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,880
That medium is radio.

8
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,940
And if you think Freddy or Stephen King are scary,

9
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,860
you ain't heard nothing yet.

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,660
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

11
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,840
So long, folks!

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,460
Isn't it funny how something can seem big or old or slow

13
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,180
until something else comes along that's bigger or older or slower?

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,720
There's a big name for that.

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,460
We call it the subgenius powerhouse.

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,160
What?

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,840
The subgenius powerhouse.

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:28,840


19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,960
But if that's old, what does that make Grandpa?

20
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,660
Incredibly huge, with incredible desires for love and vengeance.

21
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,140
From beyond space, it came.

22
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,660
An unspeakable terror so horrible, no man who saw it lived to tell another.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,720
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

24
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,760
Now, Judge Barker, it's time for my revenge.

25
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,480
For all those months I spent in prison, I've been a coward.

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,580
And I'm not in jail because of you.

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,200
No, no, that gun.

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,500
Stay where you are, Judge, and don't move.

29
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,100
This gun is absolutely silent.

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,520
It merely shoots a tiny needle of my own special design.

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,360
This special poison on this needle will stretch your lips in death

32
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,080
into the famous trademark of the subgenius powerhouse.

33
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,760
What?

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,360
Ha ha ha ha ha.

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,080
That's right, Judge.

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,560
Beg me, please.

37
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,600
Now, this is what I want you all to do.

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,800
If you got faults, defects, or shortcomings, you know, like arthritis, rheumatism, or migraines,

39
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,420
whatever part of your body it is, I want you to lay it on your radio.

40
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,000
Let the vibes flow through.

41
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,640
Funk not only moves, it can remove.

42
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,560
Dig?

43
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,740
The desired effect is what you get when you improve your interplanetary funkmanship.

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,340
Sir Lollipop Man.

45
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,940
Chocolate-coated, freaking habit form.

46
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,960
Doing it to you in 3D.

47
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,040
So groovy that I dig me.

48
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,780
Once upon a time called now.

49
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,600
Somebody say, is there funk after death?

50
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,420
I say it's 7-up.

51
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:05,560
Yeah.

52
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,500
Key Funk!

53
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,100
Bop!

54
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,140
Bop-bop.

55
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,680
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop.

56
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,620
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop.

57
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,240
Ha!

58
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,300
Yes, dear friends, welcome to one more hour of slack.

59
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,340
You never know when it's going to be your last.

60
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,360
I swear I never thought I'd make it to this far in the week.

61
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,960
Last week I mentioned I'd been up working till midnight every night.

62
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,620
This week it's more like 2 in the morning.

63
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,820
The life of a film cutter, friends.

64
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,840
Oh, actually it's glamorous and high paying.

65
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:55,360
By the way, before I go any deeper into the show, those of you who pledged your $60, and

66
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:03,880
hoped to get a subgenius videotape, arise in the mail.

67
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,940
Well you will pretty soon.

68
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,000
Let me explain what we've done here.

69
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:18,400
Rather than try to make home dupes of them, as we had been planning with Will O'Dobbs'

70
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:18,940
decks.

71
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,460
Bob said no.

72
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,280
He said to go ahead and spend lots and lots of money and have them done more professionally.

73
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,960
And we should be getting those in about a week.

74
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,500
And we will mail them out to those of you who have actually sent in your pledged checks.

75
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,320
And that was actually most of you.

76
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:39,940
Praise Bob.

77
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:46,360
You know, it's amazing that the subgenius listening audience is one of the more honest

78
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:54,080
audience groups among the various KNOA and categories of shows.

79
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,620
It sure doesn't make sense.

80
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,840
But the fact that it doesn't make sense is what sort of makes it make sense.

81
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,360
Same thing goes for the church newsletter.

82
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,000
We're just about to mail it.

83
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,740
As a matter of fact, Will O'Dobbs and I will probably be up for the rest of the night doing that.

84
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,840
But if you need information about the show.

85
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,620
Or how to get more slack.

86
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,440
Or how to know that man J.R. Bob Dobbs a little better.

87
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,440
That mighty salesman.

88
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,800
That living avatar of slack.

89
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,060
Why, you can call the station here.

90
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:48,820
And tonight's show, actually, we've got, seeing as how all I've been doing is trying to get

91
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,860
the magazine and the videotape.

92
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,820
I just don't know.

93
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,740
I just blew off doing the show.

94
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,520
I started putting this show together at 7 o'clock.

95
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:05,740
Fortunately, puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell, Gary Gbrogfran, Erp, and others started putting

96
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,420
it together months ago in Berkeley for the KPFA broadcast out there.

97
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:20,200
So I've got a whole lot of new wondrous show that dare not speak its punchline coming up.

98
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:27,520
As well as some brand new Father Joe, some mighty, mighty inspirational preaching from Father Joe Mama.

99
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,580
Two sermons here.

100
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:36,460
Time Share Religion and Bob's Reign of Terror.

101
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,360
Oh, yes.

102
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,700
The Harvest.

103
00:06:41,700 --> 00:07:11,700


104
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,880
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

105
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,820
I knew that somebody was stealing out of that case.

106
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,440
That's why last night I rigged up this alarm.

107
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,800
If anybody touches that door without pushing the hidden button, the alarm goes off.

108
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,400
Tom, I'm disappointed to know that you're the one who has been stealing from me.

109
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,460
But honest, Mr. Carson, it wasn't me.

110
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,540
I caught you.

111
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,660
I know, but it wasn't me.

112
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,280
This is the first time.

113
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,140
We caught them, and it was us.

114
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,680
And yes, we did.

115
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,280
It's the Puzzling Evidence Show here on the air with our background sound effects people.

116
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,500
Let's resume show, eh?

117
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,960
They caught little Timmy.

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,600
They caught him.

119
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,200
They caught that child.

120
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,320
And they burned his little britches off.

121
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:53,540
That's right.

122
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,540
They caught him because he didn't stand tall for what he believed in.

123
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,840
And then little Jimmy became an astronaut and sailed high over everybody.

124
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,600
There he goes, circling around our planet at an incredible rate of speed.

125
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:05,840


126
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,120
A weak thumb of this collar.

127
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,600
Ah, wee!

128
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,660
Ah, wee!

129
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,240
Ah, ah.

130
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,240


131
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,960
Out of the...

132
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:14,900
Ah!

133
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,900
Oh, that is my favorite song for sure.

134
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,880
Oh, we're out of that Belfast battle zone.

135
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:32,500
Slave driver drove his tank into his reserved parking spot and stepped out looking like

136
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,000
Margaret Thatcher.

137
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,280
The war was on.

138
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,800
Ah.

139
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,660
The keys on the typewriter had sharpened.

140
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:49,520
points that kept sticking into our fingers. The dictating equipment started asking us questions,

141
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:58,660
and our beepers sent electric shocks just through our body like a cattle prod. Out in the warehouse,

142
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:06,940
the trucks kept banging into the docks, not even thinking about stopping. Oh, our frail bodies

143
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:16,100
were strapped to the chairs, and our chairs were chained to the desks. Our pleas for justice

144
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:28,900
were ignored, and the end seemed near. But we busted our Margaret Thatcher slave driver's

145
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:36,380
little bitty book. We've judged out of their brick fortress. The streets are our

146
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:46,020
hours because it's Friday! Friday! Friday!

147
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,440
Friday!

148
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,900
Come on, Billy. Who cares if it's Friday? Just have one little hot dog, that's all.

149
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,300
Now, what's the matter?

150
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,060
What's the matter?

151
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,540
Oh, the telemetry's coming in now.

152
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,000
Um, readings are coming off the, uh, start here.

153
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,880
A mighty hot dog is our lord.

154
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,360
Start?

155
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,080
Steaming hot dog.

156
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,660
Oh, he's not.

157
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,260
A mighty slice of Hong Kong-style...

158
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:16,040
As painful as the burning embers from Bob's pipe poured over the loins at the moment of ecstasy.

159
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,460
So...

160
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,160
Oh, that's very painful when you do that right in my ears. I wish you wouldn't do that.

161
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,000
It really hurts.

162
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,060
Hey, uh, is Gary there?

163
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:24,900
No.

164
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,900
Oh, okay.

165
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,780
Your microphone really must be strong.

166
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,900
If he was there, I would ask him if he had heard the new oink-a-boink-a, uh...

167
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,140
Who lives where?

168
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,140
Oh, what do you, uh, what do you mean?

169
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,640
By interjecting all these...

170
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,320
I'm trying to get a bead on what you're saying, son, so I can...

171
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,680
Well, it's clear as the azure sky of deepest summer. What are you talking about?

172
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:50,320
Well, it may be clear to you where you are, but it's not always possible to hear you clearly through the phantasmagoric bulbarage of...

173
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,980
Well, why do you always turn the collars down, huh? Why do you always talk over the collars and turn them down?

174
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:00,340
Because I can't always hear the collars. And, of course, you've got to keep the show constantly gibbering, squeaking, and babbling.

175
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,060
Oh, okay, here we go.

176
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,100
Oh, the elevator. The service elevator. It started. Somebody's in the building. It must be that maniac.

177
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,260
I'm just going to clean up this collar. The fragments here left him on the floor.

178
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,500
Do you realize that if Nelson Mangelt... I can't even say his name right now.

179
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,360
He's out there in the desert digging in the gold, gold ground.

180
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,720
That's right. He's free now, but if he had actually committed a real crime, he'd still be in jail.

181
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,600
Oh, I don't know about that.

182
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,300
So I suggest we trick him into trying to steal a candy bar.

183
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,680
You mean like, like from Mr. What's-His-Name's store?

184
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,280
Yeah.

185
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,280
Uh, Billy, Billy.

186
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,620
Why did you think you could steal from Mr. Gunderson's store?

187
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,260
Hey, uh...

188
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,740
Billy and Nelson Mandela were in the candy store.

189
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,940
Oh, I caught you.

190
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,020
No, come on, let's just say it.

191
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,880
Tell it to the judge.

192
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,420
Tell it to the judge.

193
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,120
Now, and you know what he told that judge. Yes, you know.

194
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,760
You know, but we can't say it on the air because of FCC standards and practices.

195
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,260
Federal Communications Commission Regulation Number 976304-D.

196
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,880
Which state?

197
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,760
The State Tribunal and his Partyedenaras.

198
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:06,760


199
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:06,760


200
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,980
Anyone who uses a bad word on the radio has to rum the gauntlet of Iroquois Warriors

201
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,040
right after the show.

202
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,420
And here they are now.

203
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,920
The cultured sci fi, Iroquois Warriors, you warm up by playing a little classical piano

204
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,280
R Beethoику.

205
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,460
before sticking horrid, poisoned sticks into your flesh.

206
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,240
Chris gee, this is和.

207
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,380
Yeah, I do it all the time. It's a way of staying awake and keeping abreast of time.

208
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,620
You'd have to stick a stick in me to get me to listen to this show.

209
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,680
Well, some people like it, like this caller here,

210
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,980
who's trying to reach us from the Piero del Fuego.

211
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,100
Hello, you're on the air.

212
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,880
And so little Johnny Valjean was knocked off to prison

213
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,200
to spend 19 years twirling in the hot sun in back-breaking agony.

214
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,880
Well, it was good for him.

215
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,440
It gave him moral character exercise.

216
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,940
That's what made this country great.

217
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,320
What's the point?

218
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,620
The point?

219
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,060
Well, it's those needles sticking out of your flesh, you foolish person.

220
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,520
I always do that.

221
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,060
It's my Cenobite heritage.

222
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,620
Cenobite, eh?

223
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,520
Yes, we're Cenobites from Pinheadville, hell.

224
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,680
You see, these pins give us an incredible amount of agony,

225
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,260
and they're stuck in every decisive place to create never-ending waves of pain.

226
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,740
Stop needling us and get to the point.

227
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,240
Well, that is the point.

228
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,280
Oh, look what happened.

229
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,800
He got too near the reactor core.

230
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,720
These callers don't even know how to approach the subgenius show.

231
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,040
A little flea.

232
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,440
Flaming fleck of phlegm in the dying, entropic superstructure of the cosmos.

233
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,340
Oh, you mean this closet here?

234
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,800
Whoa, that's a good one, Gary.

235
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,580
Now I suggest you close that monster closet

236
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,420
before we're attacked by unthinkable things that might come easing out at any time.

237
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,800
Oh, here they come, slithering.

238
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,320
Get back!

239
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,240
Oh, no, it's the tambourine people.

240
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,960
And the march of the things now is...

241
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,120
Now, this is a beautiful float.

242
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,880
It's the Thing Society, and those are the Thingettes,

243
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,620
and they're beautiful.

244
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,880
Beautiful, abbreviated uniforms, waving and winking at the crowd now.

245
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,380
And they're throwing what appears to be candy of some kind,

246
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,520
because look at those kids go to scoop it up.

247
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,640
Those are candied Thing Baby eggs, Hal.

248
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,540
Have one.

249
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,680
Oh, thanks.

250
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,020
You sure you don't want it yourself?

251
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,500
No, no, I had one.

252
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,860
Well, I'll try it.

253
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,520
Just one is enough to...

254
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,180
Oh, it's pretty good.

255
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,340
It's kind of like, yeah, peanut butter,

256
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,460
and a little bit like mummy dust.

257
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,560
Yeah, but wait till you try to go wee-wee.

258
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,720
It'll smell bad.

259
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,760
It's like ale and white.

260
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,500
It's my mouth.

261
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,780
It's like, oh, powerful candy.

262
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,240
Mummy dust.

263
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,020
He could tell right away.

264
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,900
Oh, powerful candy.

265
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,120
Oh, powerful mummy dust.

266
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,860
And so Hal shrank down to a little three-inch radio personality.

267
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,920
It hurts.

268
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,440
Don't worry, we'll get it back before the end of the show.

269
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,120
It's all in the radio wrist here.

270
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,240
Guys, get these spiders out of here.

271
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,900
Oh, it's just a 10-pound cooking spider from where he sees it.

272
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:54,800
Hey.

273
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,740
Okay, let's drive the show around real fast.

274
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,360
Please help me.

275
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,560
Help me.

276
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,040
I'm sorry.

277
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,280
Help me, please.

278
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,880
We've got the anecdote here in the trunk.

279
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,020
Come on, that's Drag Race.

280
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,920
Oh, and that must be an elephant's trunk.

281
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,560
Cool, cool.

282
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,780
It was like being a hell's angel

283
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,520
When I sang this song for the first time

284
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,200
I go up to my home

285
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,260
With my little girl

286
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,560
That I made for a singer

287
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,240
This is the swinging love corpses, dear friend.

288
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,080
Oh, Electron

289
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,680
We're there

290
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,300
And that was when we didn't wear any underwear

291
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,540
We thought it was cool

292
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,980
To be hanging free in the breeze

293
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,680
And me and Electron would go riding

294
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,820
With the hell's angel

295
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,120
On the weekend

296
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,080
Oh, my God.

297
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,600
Oh, my God.

298
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,600


299
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,600


300
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,600


301
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,600


302
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,600


303
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,600


304
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,600


305
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,600


306
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,600


307
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,600


308
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,600


309
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,600


310
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,600


311
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,520
Fundamental love is hard to get away from

312
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:02,520


313
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,420
And we went to the Academy

314
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,920
To study philosophy and get associate in psychology

315
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,200
As well as the heart poetry

316
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,100
And the tradition of unifying vision

317
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,440
Our school for the hills

318
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,020
A thorn Number just about Sinnesse

319
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,180
An orangutan

320
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,440
Goodatoal

321
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:18,580
Cake

322
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,560
Like ahales

323
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,520
Goodatoal

324
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,140
Like a laptops

325
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,660
M Global

326
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:23,820
Ah.

327
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,220
and the pro-pig-toy-oim-together.

328
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,640
Oh, you know my name, I'm...

329
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,640
I'm...

330
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,680
wiping my mouth and lighting a cigarette

331
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,520
while picking up a new teach-me.

332
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,620
It's over the hill with Angel on the weekend.

333
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,380
We're reading together on over-flow skid row.

334
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,080
I've got the noise and drama from this,

335
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,740
and it's a little bit like translation, so...

336
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,980
The voice of the news,

337
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,980
it's electric,

338
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,020
electric,

339
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,560
electric,

340
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,280
despite the static.

341
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,740
The voice of the news,

342
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,040
it's electric,

343
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:56,880
electric,

344
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,240
despite the static.

345
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,880
The voice of the news,

346
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,300


347
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:00,500
electric,

348
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,040
electric,

349
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,100
despite the static.

350
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,920
But he was a Hell's Angel on the weekend.

351
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,480
He had a ring in his hair,

352
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,100
and a bald in his clothes,

353
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,820
and he peed on his clothes,

354
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,200
and his sister's hose,

355
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,580
while she was wearing them.

356
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,100
He cared no,

357
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,740
because he was a Hell's Angel on the weekend.

358
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,220
I remember those times

359
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,780
when I used to ride with my pal, Electron.

360
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,460
Because we're

361
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,920
Hell's Angels on the weekend.

362
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,020
And Electron,

363
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,920
Electron really sucks around the hour.

364
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,980
Me and Kathy went out together.

365
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,980
With Johnny and Electron.

366
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,220
We was riding fast.

367
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,460
By the way, my name is Pro-Dot.

368
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,100
Electron,

369
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,080
remember the hands called Kevin.

370
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,160
We'll see you tomorrow.

371
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,820
A weird song there, dear friends.

372
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,720
Dr. Philodrummon and the swinging love corpses.

373
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,740
Yeah, it's not that funny.

374
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,100
It was a dark time

375
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,480
in the history of the Empire.

376
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,000
The Renubium space pirates

377
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,960
had attacked the peaceful moon of Organda 1,

378
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,600
and the space spitters

379
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,580
were circling the planet,

380
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,260
ready to drop mushroom bombs to see what happened.

381
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,780
They were trying to subjugate

382
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,000
the populace of four-armed teddy bears

383
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,680
with big friendly eyes.

384
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,540
Let's join the princess and her stupid companion,

385
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,440
the robot rodent, Ratface,

386
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,440
as they decant out of their silver tubes

387
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,580
for another adventure.

388
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,000
Our possible guests,

389
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,540
two nice girls.

390
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,480
Two nice girls?

391
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,840
So where, where, where, where are the girls?

392
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,180
And so, birth control is here,

393
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,460
out here in the high Pacific.

394
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,740
Look, they put a drawing by me

395
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,160
in the start of the list of people.

396
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,780
The drawing of everybody.

397
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,160
Here in a little stark fist of whatever.

398
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,960
I know a certain stang said I was in the issue,

399
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,380
but I've looked and looked and I'm nowhere in it

400
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,900
except for this one tiny little drippy drawing.

401
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,120
Oh, that's not true, Dr. Howell.

402
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,840
Or maybe it is, I can't remember.

403
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,840
Maybe it was the stuff we haven't printed yet.

404
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,280
But it don't matter none,

405
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,740
because Father Joe Mama's gonna tell you

406
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,820
exactly what's going on.

407
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,380
I know you.

408
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,600
What?

409
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,360
It depends again on breaking the records over radio.

410
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,300
No kidding.

411
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,260
Rock music, Blairs!

412
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,020
Not for long.

413
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,200
Hello, friends, and welcome.

414
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,440
You know, there comes a time in everyone's life

415
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,000
when they have to ask themselves this simple question.

416
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,380
Why?

417
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,320
Why?

418
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,200
Why?

419
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,740
Now, most religions will answer that question

420
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,440
with another question, why not?

421
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,680
But we at the Church of the Subgenius believe

422
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,920
you deserve a better answer to your lifelong quest

423
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,100
than just the same question turned around

424
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,360
and thrown in your face.

425
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,360
We just so happen to believe your pursuit of truth

426
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,860
is relevant, is worthwhile, and is important.

427
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,880
Granted, we don't pretend to know all the answers,

428
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,120
but we damn sure plan to find out.

429
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,040
In the meantime, we promise to help you search for the truth

430
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,900
without fear of the consequences.

431
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,560
Why?

432
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,420
Because we like it.

433
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:21,600
Because we like you.

434
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,600
And because if you're like us, you'll like us.

435
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,860
Because we're not afraid to consider our own validity.

436
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,240
We're not scared to look in the mirror, see what we saw,

437
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,280
take out the saw, cut the mirror in half,

438
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,260
two-ass make a hole, climb in the hole,

439
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,600
and pull it in on after us.

440
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,280
Because we're not frightened by our own inner selves.

441
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,920
Nor are we worried that we're not going to measure up to our own standards.

442
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,580
Hell, we are the standard by which everyone else is measured.

443
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,240
We're the bastards in the class by ourselves

444
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,360
who constantly throw off the curve,

445
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,680
why should we worry?

446
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,200
We're not afraid of the answers,

447
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,020
because we're the only ones who can prove whether the answers are right or wrong.

448
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,160
We encourage doubt and disbelievers.

449
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,000
We don't burn heretics, we herald them.

450
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,400
That's why we're the first church to pay taxes.

451
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,720
We want to be examined by the IRS.

452
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,240
Now how many churches do you know want that?

453
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,180
Not a one, because they're all chickens.

454
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,040
They've all got something to hide.

455
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,660
Not us.

456
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,780
Here at the Church of the Subgenius,

457
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,740
the better you look, the closer we look.

458
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,820
That's why we're also the first and only church to offer timeshare religion.

459
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,360
That's right, timeshare religion.

460
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,020
You try it, you like it, you buy it.

461
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,680
Why do we take that chance, you ask?

462
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,060
Because religion is too important to lead the chance.

463
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,720
Like when, where, and by whom you were born.

464
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:49,240
Because let's face it, that's what determines the religious destiny of 99% of the people on this planet.

465
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,960
If you're born in a Moslem village by Moslem parents, you're gonna be Moslem.

466
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,920
If you're born in a Hindu village by Hindu parents, you're gonna be Hindu.

467
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,000
So supernaturally, if you're born in a voodoo village by voodoo parents, who do you do?

468
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,340
Voodoo, of course.

469
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,460
It's that simple, sad to say.

470
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:11,100
You need a carton of salvation, you go to the nearest convenience store.

471
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,620
But don't you think that when your soul is on the line for all eternity,

472
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,220
it's worth your while to show up?

473
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,860
After all, they can't all have the best deal now.

474
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,200
And they know it.

475
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,420
That's why they get so nervous when someone starts asking questions.

476
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,480
Do you know what most religions do to you when you start asking questions?

477
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,200
Why, they kill you, of course.

478
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,540
Because death destroys the comparison shopper.

479
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,560
Execution eliminates the educated.

480
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,780
And when those intelligent but trouble-making few slowly burn away at the stake,

481
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,820
not only do they stop asking questions, but so does everyone else.

482
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:54,400
And yet, after centuries of purges, the subgenius gene still survives.

483
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,300
We've released our seed everywhere and we're still growing.

484
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,600
While every other religion has enjoyed a blood fest and slaughtered its less than enthusiastic membership,

485
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:11,200
the Church of the Subgenius stands alone as the only church never to have hurt its own or anyone else's followers.

486
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,060
Granted, we may have assassinated our own leader, but we were just beating the conspiracy to the punch.

487
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:20,500
The fact remains that you're safe with us, and our record proves it.

488
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,700
Try us. Take Bob for a test drive.

489
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,920
There's no obligation and no salesman will call, because you're calling him.

490
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:35,600
Afterwards, you can try any other religion you want, and if you're not completely satisfied, we'll return your soul in full.

491
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,780
Do you know any other religion that makes that offer?

492
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,320
No siree! Most of them try to make you feel guilty just for thinking about it.

493
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,040
Or if you do leave, they'll send you straight to hell or make you drink sex.

494
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,440
Or if you can't be yourself or even survive a Holy Grail government, or if you simply don't care for being an idol,

495
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,800
ask them to return your soul and see what happens.

496
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,880
If you're lucky, they'll only laugh at you, but not Bob.

497
00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:01,280
No siree, Bob will laugh with you, all the way to the bank, because he knows, he knows you'll be back.

498
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,480
That's how he can go and afford to give you a triple your money back guarantee.

499
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:13,260
If you're not completely satisfied for any reason, triple your money, double your damnation, and all of your soul and slack back!

500
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,840
back. So go ahead,

501
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,080
compare. You'll see

502
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,220
why Bob's best and why the smart

503
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,100
subgenius shopper says, if you

504
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,900
buy it but it's broken, take it back.

505
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,180
Jack, herein is the word of

506
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,760
Bob. Praise Bob.

507
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,200
Amen. Oh, thank you so

508
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,280
much, Father Joe Mama out of

509

Yep. This is the kind of thing

00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,180
he plays. Raise your hand and recite after

512
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,400
me. Raise your hand and recite after me.

00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,460
uh yeah see you there mom

613
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:07,800
i guess i i think not a bit not a bit no it influenced me it kept me awake through long

614
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:14,240
and fitful nights of slumberless torture well maybe maybe that we should all quit the church

615
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,180
of reedies caller you'll see it'll be all right and then like a horrible light blasting and

616
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:26,040
burning my brain the caller now what about it well what have you got to say for yourself

617
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,140
the one listener here on the air and the one person

618
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,620
more people in the studio than are actually listening to the show we hope

619
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:37,740
you

620
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,420
know i don't that might we know that's not true unfortunately on the other hand when

621
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:46,820
are we would we be lucky if we're broadcasting now there's only a few people listening but

622
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,960
we're actually broadcasting we can use the secret information find out how many people

623
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,420
they don't understand it's many more than you care to hurt us hell but they're so they're

624
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:01,120
so blocked in there they want to see us well why don't you open our minds how why don't

625
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,540
you open our third nostril and i'll make one more attempt here grab those example of synchronicity

626
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,780
in action you think you're going to be able to see us you're going to be able to see us

627
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:07,800
always

628
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,840
this is now whatever time it is so early in the morning but in fact it's weeks later

629
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,660
it's in texas and it's at three o'clock in the afternoon when a huge crowd is hearing this show

630
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,880
hearing your meaningless utterances actually it's nine o'clock at night well that's where it goes

631
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,340
you know a scary thing happened to me today i was just entering my apartment and a guy like a

632
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:37,760
process server stepped up to me and said are you real name and i said uh why yes and he said well i have nothing to say this intended as aметhe или المکةور في يوضح الر strokesم الم plötzlich آ我不 أنت ثم أنت

633
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:37,760

636
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:37,760


637
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:37,760


638
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:37,760


639
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:37,760


640
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:44,340
have a little something for you from wolf realty and he handed me a little white envelope oh so

641
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:49,240
you don't find this interesting well i won't tell you the punchline but if you see a shopping cart

642
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,760
going down the street full of plastic dinosaurs followed by a rather sad and shabby looking chap

643
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:01,160
then you'll know who that person is true story that uh i exaggerated it was a 20 buck rent increase

644
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:06,480
that was the ball yeah yeah yeah yeah but you have to pay the whole 20 don't you because no i don't

645
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:12,500
in fact we don't even have to pay that because a weird rebate has been uh levied by the department

646
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:18,780
of demonology and infernal complications there they go now demolishing that old tax structure

647
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:24,500
to make way for the new revised reagan revolution income tax this is amazing yes i've got them all

648
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,500
confused here on the show now they're ruling around the rent is raised sticking right out and

649
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:35,080
the apron has been raised to be more but the rebate almost covers it and after that it's

650
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,240
every 20

651
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,380
20 years and still though i mean it was like being hurt by a processor you know that was a scary

652
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:48,440
moment he said are you here yeah yeah sure i'm and he said well i have something when it's called

653
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,440
thank the goddesses you have returned two weeks without subgenius is too much to ask

654
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,040
you understand it's like the process what would you like this week and now for today's reading

655
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:06,060
just as the extreme of pain meets sensual pleasure and the extreme of perversion borders

656
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:15,280
on mystical energy so too the extreme of banality allows us to catch a glimpse of the sublime

657
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,680
but i don't know anything about zontar

658
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:29,720
and i'm not going to tell you what the step beyond the church of the subgenius might be

659
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,840
hang on a second because i don't know and you don't know

660
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,220
and even though i'm not going to tell you what the subgenius is i'm not going to tell you what the subgenius is

661
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:46,100
but this this might tell you something that might help you decide for yourself

662
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:54,780
that piece of paper just might be the thing that saves your life in the next war

663
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:06,160
that piece of paper that piece of paper just might be the thing that you need

664
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,460

669
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,860
from the way it

00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,420

Yeah, I'm going to have to give that number again.

679
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,740
I have to.

680
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,260
Bob said it.

681
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,940
Actually, the way it goes,

682
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,460
Bob sold it.

683
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,400
I smoked it.

684
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,380
That settles it.

685
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,600
Babe,

686
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,300
you can write to Bob

687
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:09,040
at Box 140306

688
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,340

690
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,800
And as I said,

691
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,400
it's just,

692
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,560
oh, the world is too much with me lately, dear friends.

693
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,680
And I've been working,

694
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,160
working too hard.

695
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,640
I think you can hear it probably in my voice.

696
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:31,880
But,

697
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,540
I could.

698
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,720
I always bring,

699
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,640
when I come to the show,

700
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,120
I always bring these reading materials

701
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,000
in case none of the tape decks

702
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,960
and none of the record players work.

703
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,720
I always bring something to read.

704
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,100
I've got something here

705
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,220
that I could read

706
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,280
about violence in the 14th century

707
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,380
in Europe.

708
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,160
Violence as it was seen by my ancestors.

709
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:01,500


710
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
And, well, heck,

711
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,960
I wasn't going to read it,

712
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,220
but I've just decided I will.

713
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,540
Then I can slack off.

714
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,340
This is from

715
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,120
Barbara Tuckman's book,

716
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,440
A Distant Mirror

717
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,020
of the Calamitous 14th Century.

718
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,740
And it was,

719
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,680
In England,

720
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,540
coroner's rolls showed manslaughter

721
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,380
far ahead of accident

722
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,500
as cause of death.

723
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,960
And more often than not,

724
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,160
the offender escaped punishment

725
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,120
by obtaining,

726
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,500
benefit of clergy

727
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,140
through bribes

728
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,560
or the right connections.

729
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,900
Just like nowadays.

730
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,860
If life was filled with bodily harm,

731
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,740
literature reflected it.

732
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,040
One of Latour's,

733
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,260
Latour Landry,

734
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,140
this is my Tom Landry's ancestor.

735
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,120
One of Latour Landry's cautionary tales

736
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,100
for his daughters

737
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,200
tells of a lady who ran off with a monk

738
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,260
and upon being found in bed with him

739
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,100
by her brothers,

740
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,520
they,

741
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:00,980
quote,

742
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,800
took a knife

743
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,620
and cut away the monk's stones

744
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,040
and threw them in the lady's face

745
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,820
and made her eat them

746
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,280
and afterwards tied both monk and lady

747
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,200
in a sack with heavy rocks

748
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,820
and cast them into a river

749
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,980
and drowned them.

750
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,780
I don't know how they would cut away

751
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,980
his lucky crystal.

752
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,640
Violence was official

753
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,880
as well as individual.

754
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,180
Torture was authorized by the church

755
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,780
and regularly used to uncover heresy

756
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,220
by the Inquisition.

757
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,340
The tortures and punishments of civil justice

758
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,840
customarily cut off hands and ears,

759
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,100
racked,

760
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,820
burned,

761
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,020
flayed,

762
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,100
and pulled apart people's bodies.

763
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,740
In everyday life,

764
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,060
passers-by saw some criminal

765
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,800
flogged with a knotted rope

766
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,260
or chained upright in an iron collar.

767
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,000
They passed corpses hanging on the gibbet

768
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,700
and decapitated heads.

769
00:35:59,900 --> 00:35:59,940
And,

770
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,280
quartered bodies impaled on stakes

771
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,300
on the city walls.

772
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,900
In every church,

773
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,320
they saw pictures of saints

774
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,600
undergoing varieties

775
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,380
of atrocious martyrdom

776
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,420
by arrows,

777
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:11,960
spears,

778
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,600
fire,

779
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,060
cut-off breasts,

780
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,780
usually dripping blood.

781
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,540
The crucifixion

782
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,320
with its nails,

783
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,040
spears,

784
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,960
thorns,

785
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,580
whips,

786
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,580
and more dripping blood

787
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,660
was inescapable.

788
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,380
Blood and cruelty

789
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,800
were ubiquitous in Christian art.

790
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,500
Indeed,

791
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,780
essential to it,

792
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,460
for Christ became Redeemer

793
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,400
and the saints sanctified

794
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,080
only through suffering violence

795
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,220
at the hands of their fellow men.

796
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,200
And, of course,

797
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,280
you old-time subgeniuses

798
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,220
know that we've certainly

799
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,600
learned from that example

800
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,800
and picked up some of their wonderful hints,

801
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,800
such as what I'm doing right now.

802
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,620
In village games,

803
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,800
players with hands tied behind them

804
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,200
competed to kill a cat

805
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,480
nailed to a pole.

806
00:36:59,500 --> 00:36:59,840
They were forced to jump off a post

807
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,120
by battering it to death

808
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,460
with their heads,

809
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,140
at the risk of cheeks ripped open

810
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,360
or eyes scratched out

811
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,480
by the frantic animal's claws.

812
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,580
Trumpets enhanced the excitement.

813
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,220
Or, a pig enclosed in a wide pen

814
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,120
was chased by men with clubs

815
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,380
to the laughter of spectators

816
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,760
as he ran squealing from the blows

817
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,980
until beaten lifeless.

818
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,360
Accustomed in their own lives

819
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,480
to physical hardship,

820
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:29,480


821
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:29,480


822
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,580
medieval men and women

823
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,500
were not necessarily repelled

824
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,380
by the spectacle of pain,

825
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,120
but rather enjoyed it.

826
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,780
The citizens of Mons bought,

827
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,540
bought a condemned criminal

828
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,840
from a neighboring town

829
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,600
so that they should have the pleasure

830
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,700
of seeing him quartered.

831
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,220
It may be that the untender

832
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,500
medieval infancy produced adults

833
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,580
who valued others

834
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,320
no more than they had been

835
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,460
being valued by the people.

836
00:37:59,460 --> 00:37:59,460


837
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,540
They valued in their own formative years.

838
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,260
And you know, times just haven't changed

839
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,600
all that much, have they dear friends?

840
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,760
And I think Father Joe Mama

841
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,280
has something to say about that.

842
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:10,700
Uh huh.

843
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,940
Hello friends, and welcome.

844
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,880
The sermon tonight is entitled

845
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,460
Bob's Reign of Terror.

846
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,160
And it is called Bob's Reign of Terror

847
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,240
for a very good reason.

848
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,440
For the first time in a long time

849
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,240
I've been talking about this

850
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,660
because there's a storm a-coming.

851
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,800
A storm bigger than a million

852
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,540
hurricane mobs put together.

853
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,820
The clouds have been forming for years.

854
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,880
Vapor from a sea of wrath

855
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,900
created by years of tears.

856
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,800
Years of tears of sorrow.

857
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,040
Years of tears of anger.

858
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,920
Years of tears of frustration

859
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,560
at the human race.

860
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,240
And when I say human race,

861
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,240
I'm not just talking about thy neighbor.

862
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,800
I'm talking about you.

863
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,940
Yes, you and your neighbor.

864
00:38:59,460 --> 00:38:59,720
And the storm of genius

865
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,220
is not good enough that you

866
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,500
read the bauble every night.

867
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,240
It's not good enough that you donate

868
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,300
your piddly little cheap Charlie love offering.

869
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,360
Bob demands the same respect

870
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,000
from everyone on your block.

871
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,020
That means you, your neighbor,

872
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,800
and your neighbor's neighbor.

873
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,220
And it's your job to convert them.

874
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,040
Cause there's a storm a-coming friends.

875
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,700
Now since the central message of Bob is slack

876
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,400
I'm not gonna remind you that you're running out of time.

877
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,600
You know it.

878
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:31,900
Bob knows it and the exes who at this very moment traveling towards the earth at the speed of light know it and when they arrive

879
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:36,140
Friends and they start their whole scale death and demolition derby

880
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,640
They're not gonna have time to separate single homes from the rest of the block

881
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:46,180
You better play it safe and save your whole damn town or state or country or better yet planet

882
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:51,940
Bob said the meat shall inherit the burnout remains of a radioactive earth now if you're meek

883
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:57,280
You better be ready for your inheritance cuz there's a storm of coming friends. Are you meek?

884
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,700
Oh, are you unique?

885
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,740
Give yourself the simple test friends

886
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:04,100
When was the last time you spoke Bob's word to a stranger?

887
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,700
When was the last time you witnessed on to Bob when was the last time you embarrassed yourself for Bob? Oh, he's heard them all

888
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:15,300
He's heard all those excuses before you were too busy. You forgot you were scared

889
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:21,920
Well, maybe just maybe Bob will give the same excuse come next day. Perhaps just perhaps he'll be too busy

890
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:28,440
To save you from the killdozers or maybe he'll forget about you when the automated soul suckers come cruising down your street

891
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:34,900
Then again, he might just be too scared to admit to those anorexic aliens that you and he not only look the same

892
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:42,300
But taste the same especially when skewered and grilled over an open flame with onions peppers and just a touch of lime

893
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,380
Oh, yes friends

894
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:48,760
You better stick out your neck for Bob if you want him to stick out his neck for you cuz there's a storm

895
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,360
Coming friends. I ask you again

896
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,900
When was the last time you turned to a stranger said I know the secret of slack

897
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,480
Let me share it with you

898
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:04,780
When was the last time you risked your oh so important conspiracy image and tried to save another conspiracy dupe from internal death?

899
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:12,720
Damnation and never-ending torture Bob gave his life so that you could live not once but twice and maybe even thrice

900
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,120
That's better than any other leading brand. Is it asking too much for you to sacrifice just a little bit of slack back?

901
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,860
I think not because there's a story

902
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:28,480
I'm a coming friends if we could all just convert ten fellow humanoids and they in turn could convert ten more

903
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,720
We could pass on Bob's message the world over and saving in time

904
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,660
And who can deny the goodness of Bob's word who once haven't heard about salvation?

905
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:44,000
Bob's love Bob's second chance could possibly turn their back on Bob slack

906
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,860
You can make a difference, but you must start now because there's a storm coming friends the excess are coming

907
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:58,200
The comes are coming Bob's Ark was space for two of each couple is it coming from another space sooner than you think

908
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,700
Do you have a reservation?

909
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:07,020
Does your neighbor have his and whatever? What are this puny polluted planet? It wasn't such a bad place

910
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,360
Wasn't it just filling with wrong crowd?

911
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,100
Will it be spared or shall it be purged by fire?

912
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:20,640
Ravaged by radiation and drowned in a flood of fallout all of the above all from above all at the same time

913
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:20,940
Yes

914
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,920
They can't

915
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:28,180
Do it they have the technology and the sense of humor to make it happen the excess can make it rain fire

916
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:35,540
And then when nothing is left by the smoldering ash of a planet that once was Bob's tears will come pouring down

917
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:40,820
To stay about the dying embers and return the earth to its primeval state

918
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:50,760
But wait there in the mud was that a movement could it be the beginning of a new subgenius strain

919
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,220
The start of an evolutionary process that might once again result in a superior race of mutants

920
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:02,020
ones that are a little more appreciative of Bob and his overlords ones that could stop the pinks and

921
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:08,680
normals from over infesting the planet until the utter and total sterilization became the only sane alternative

922
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,060
Must it come to this dear friends?

923
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:19,420
Or can we nip it in the bud if we can we must and if we trust we shall but we must trust now

924
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,400
Because there's a

925
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:28,680
Storm coming I can feel the wind brothers and sisters and once that wind starts blowing only one power can break wind like that

926
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:34,040
Bob Dobbs we played on to you. Give us a second chance

927
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:40,900
Let us go forth and spread your word. Let us go forth and testify and witness and

928
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,580
Bob I'm in

929
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:44,760
and

930
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:45,600
praise

931
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,940
father Joe mama wonderful wonderful

932
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:57,300
I'd say as far as I'm concerned the greatest current acting subgenius preacher

933
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,300
Yes, indeed dear friends, what

934
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:09,020
Is there any escape from the North?

935
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:20,800
Oh God

936
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:20,800


937
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,680
Our

938
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:22,700
Father

939
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,640
Speaking

940
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,460
well

941
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,300
there's

942
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,460
their

943
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:34,660
They're

944
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:34,960
as

945
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,260
r

946
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:35,760
far

947
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,160
from

948
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:37,340
any

949
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:37,340


950
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:37,340


951
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,360
It is

952
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:38,560
they

953
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:38,560


954
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,180
weren't

955
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,060
done

956
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:40,220
thinking

957
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,980
Annabelle there is a correctional

958
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,380

959
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,900
when they were just a cartoon company.

960
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,760
Back when the pioneers drove their Conestoga scooters

961
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,540
from fish to grass.

962
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,820
And they set out in the desert

963
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,460
at the ship of the desert, see?

964
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,340
By wagon chains and prospectors

965
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,360
hallucinating on weird alkaloids.

966
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,780
I had a barbarian's apron.

967
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,900
I seen the good ones and the bad ones.

968
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,900
Hey, ever been bit by a dead bee?

969
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,120
I wonder if there's really froth in these rocks.

970
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,020
Well, we're ready to find out.

971
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:22,600
Let's smoke them.

972
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,060
Oh, you're really stoned on these rocks.

973
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,820
Yeah, we're really rocking out on these stones.

974
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,520
They're magic!

975
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,600
Wow, it made the collar disappear.

976
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,100
Somebody help him, please.

977
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,100
Oh, that's better.

978
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,600
That's the first microsecond of explosion before you're born.

979
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,360
Yes, from nanosecond to nanosecond, the show continues.

980
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:50,360
Now, there's...

981
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,080
There's a listener that has never heard this show,

982
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,000
about to tune the station, the KPFA.

983
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,540
I'm afraid that's past name.

984
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,680
What side of ourselves are we to present to this person?

985
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,620
Let's present the rear end of the show,

986
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,560
the backside of the brain, as we call it.

987
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,300
The two divided cerebral hemispheres,

988
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,940
the buttocks area of the brain...

989
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:07,560
Not the honey brain!

990
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,000
...or the corpus gluteus,

991
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:13,500
is the area devoted to thoughts of strange confusions...

992
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,360
That's the Freedy's brain.

993
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:14,880
...and misdirections.

994
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:15,860
Not the Freedy brain!

995
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,580
Here we see is the source of all error,

996
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:20,000
superstition, credulity, and fanaticism.

997
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,160
And this is, coincidentally enough,

998
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,200
the subgenius show area of the brain.

999
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:24,840
The APFA.

1000
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,180
Oh, no!

1001
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,680
844-425.

1002
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,400
Yeah, that's it, 844-425.

1003
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,440
But if you're listening to K-O-N-N-O-N...

1004
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:30,680
She'd have...

1005
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1006
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:32,740
This is getting out of control.

1007
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,360
No wonder woman there should call in every week

1008
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,620
and have a column of her own here on the show.

1009
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,000
She could just call in with her poetry.

1010
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,980
Yeah, and we could have a marshmallow roast,

1011
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,080
and a weenie roast,

1012
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,840
and a rough roast,

1013
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,020
and a rib roast.

1014
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,520
Yeah, so consider yourself a permanent guest here on The Wire.

1015
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,180
On the celebrity roast channel.

1016
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,340
Oh, there's Hong Kong style.

1017
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:50,340


1018
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:50,340


1019
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,420
What about Baby Napfeline?

1020
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,380
That's going to be a real problem.

1021
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,220
Baby Napfeline, you know,

1022
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,580
I was kind of afraid he'd be lurking outside the show

1023
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,040
when Earp was trying to get in,

1024
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,840
and, well, you know what might happen.

1025
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,120
I hear a pounding at the door.

1026
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,500
I think it was Camphlagus Flambigia.

1027
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,180
I run down the stairs,

1028
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,940
and instead of Camphlagus Flambigia,

1029
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,140
it would be Baby Napfeline.

1030
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,400
Oh, phew, phew.

1031
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,040
It wasn't anybody.

1032
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:11,620
Okay, here we go.

1033
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:12,920
All right, here we go.

1034
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:13,380
That was a close one.

1035
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,560
Don't even talk about it.

1036
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,480
I would mess around.

1037
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,740
Oh, there he is.

1038
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,760
Oh, baby, that's it.

1039
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:18,720
I'm just hallucinating.

1040
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,400
It couldn't be.

1041
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,180
Baby, don't get a little cigarette near that car.

1042
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,720
Nurse, bring me another martini.

1043
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,140
I'll just put the window down.

1044
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,320
Let's just make a comic about it.

1045
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:25,920
Yeah, that's it.

1046
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,100
That's what all the other famous sun babies do.

1047
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,200
They make comics out of stuff.

1048
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,380
There's no one on the wing.

1049
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,020
There's no Baby Napfeline out there.

1050
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,040
Oh, no, it's not you, caller.

1051
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:34,660
Yes, don't put it.

1052
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,840
I heard Tetra hijacked.

1053
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,520
Oh, look, he just put it into the sketch.

1054
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,840
Oh, no, no, it's the captain of the plane.

1055
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,900
You see, he's experiencing the motorway.

1056
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,580
I've been here before.

1057
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,240
It'll really happen.

1058
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:45,540
It's real.

1059
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,160
What page are you on, Hal?

1060
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,380
Well, can you talk about it?

1061
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,000
I'm on that Yogi Bear.

1062
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,780
Yogi Bear?

1063
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,380
Oh, I see.

1064
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,080
Okay, I'm caught up with you guys.

1065
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:54,280
Go ahead.

1066
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:57,820
Look out!

1067
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,640
Shooting a drug.

1068
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,420
And the average bird.

1069
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,020
We're going to start a club up for us.

1070
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,540
Lonely subgenius men.

1071
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,740
It's called the Geek Patrol.

1072
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,880
And anyone who wants to join can send a self-addressed staffed envelope to us here at KPFA.

1073
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,720
And we will send you the instructions on exactly what to do.

1074
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:19,880
You're a hondrel.

1075
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,440
Here they come.

1076
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,100
Insert tab A and slot B.

1077
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,560
See, it's easy.

1078
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,780
That's the paper cutout method of sexual reproduction.

1079
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,840
I got a hondrel by the handle.

1080
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,860
And it's true.

1081
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,300
I got Jesus by the tail.

1082
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:34,980
Whee!

1083
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,560
It's scary.

1084
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,000
Jesus' tail is one of those scary things, man.

1085
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,720
I'm losing weight and looking rather pale.

1086
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,560
It's plain to see that I've got Jesus by the tail.

1087
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,140
Ew.

1088
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,740
Well, let him go.

1089
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,260
He's cute.

1090
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:48,920
He looks like...

1091
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,960
Jesus looks like a little brine shrimp, pal.

1092
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,140
I didn't know Jesus could be naked.

1093
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,260
Look, I'm improvising.

1094
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,360
Stop being so critical.

1095
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,500
I'm trying to take off on this little brine shrimp.

1096
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:57,700
Oh, it's a little puppet.

1097
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,400
Oh, I see, I see.

1098
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,280
It's briny.

1099
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,020
Oh, I see.

1100
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,620
We call him Briny Jesus, the savior of the deep.

1101
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:04,760
That's right.

1102
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,400
Even though he's only tiny and about to be eaten by the nearest fish...

1103
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:15,060
Here in these tidy tide pools, the Jesus brine shrimp propagates in unusual numbers,

1104
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,240
only to be gobbled up by the ferocious devil fish.

1105
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,040
Uh-oh.

1106
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:19,880
The bottom of the pond.

1107
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,180
Anything to do with it?

1108
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,940
Well, because it's their world.

1109
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,720
Don't you know that nine out of ten major American industrial figures...

1110
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,300
I don't want to hear it.

1111
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:27,880
I don't want to hear it.

1112
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,420
I don't want to hear it.

1113
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:29,440
Okay.

1114
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,440
After all, these industrial figures are debatable.

1115
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,720
And they are assemblable, like those over five years of age.

1116
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,400
And there goes one right now.

1117
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:44,100
That person hung up on us faster than he could have gotten on KGO.

1118
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:45,140
So...

1119
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:46,980
They probably...

1120
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,900
Do you ever listen to KGO?

1121
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:48,900


1122
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:48,900


1123
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:48,900


1124
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:48,900


1125
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:48,900


1126
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:48,900


1127
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,080
Do you ever listen to KGO at this time of night?

1128
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,680
They've got this really kind of nasty English super liberal guy on.

1129
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,460
The new thing.

1130
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,500
Super liberal?

1131
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:00,760
Oh, he's ultra liberal, but he's like real nasty, though.

1132
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,940
It's like, you stupid, jerky, conservative...

1133
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,340
Very patronizing right, isn't he?

1134
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:08,160
No, no.

1135
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,520
Let's not offend the callers.

1136
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,400
So you could be listening to him right now.

1137
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:11,900
Or us.

1138
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,100
Hello, caller.

1139
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:13,600
Hi, Bob.

1140
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,220
Oh, no.

1141
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,460
Worst he could have done.

1142
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,080
Yeah.

1143
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,880
Oh, I've offended all your callers.

1144
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,780
I'll see.

1145
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,380
There are no other callers.

1146
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,620
So you've only offended yourself.

1147
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,580
You've offended the other callers.

1148
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,740
Calling from the bottom of the cow.

1149
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,820
Offensive elevator now.

1150
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,180
We'll lower you into the offensive pit.

1151
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,360
Now into the puddle of effluvians we will go here.

1152
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:34,420
Puddling effluvians is made possible by a grant from the Motorhead Corporation.

1153
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,180
Who are the Chubby Corporation?

1154
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,580
Anger, envy, and gluttony.

1155
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,040
We are.

1156
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:39,780
Who's calling us?

1157
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,760
Now you're the Chubby Corporation.

1158
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,800
Let's go over that again.

1159
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,440
You say you saw some sort of hamster?

1160
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,180
Let's go over that again with a lawnmower.

1161
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,740
Well, I don't mind.

1162
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:54,800
I'm using the lawnmower to chew my way through this sludge of uncertainty to the truth, the bone of the truth.

1163
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,220
You know, they say the closer to the bone, the sweeter the meat.

1164
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,380
And soon you'll be seeing the marrow of the matter.

1165
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:03,660
Oh, oh, oh.

1166
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,840
Oh, my God.

1167
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,520
It figures.

1168
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:10,900
Those guys on that show, they're always trying to surprise me.

1169
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,460
Now what do I do?

1170
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,400
Five minutes left.

1171
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,420
Well, I could do like some subgenius shows.

1172
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,580
It's like three records.

1173
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,120
It's like three records at once.

1174
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,040
And the music here.

1175
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:21,480
Let's see.

1176
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,960
And a Vietnamese cassette.

1177
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,680
Wow, man.

1178
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,120
This is like slack.

1179
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,040
It's creative.

1180
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,020
Cool.

1181
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,420
Actually, that isn't bad.

1182
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,660
It's not very good either.

1183
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,120
Oh, that's better.

1184
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,940
I'm going to go ahead and give that box number one more time.

1185
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,540
I know you really want me to.

1186
00:51:48,640 --> 00:52:05,460
I know that almost all of you just can't get enough of that subgenius post office box number 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

1187
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:15,400
Dear friends, 75214 for free information on how much the rest of the information will actually cost you.

1188
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,920
And it's a bummer.

1189
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:17,240
I'm going to go ahead and get it.

1190
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:37,520
But we do have to roll or crawl or flop hideously flopping out of here like Lovecraft monsters to make way for upcoming show, Kathy's Potluck.

1191
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:41,520
And why you never know what she's going to be playing.

1192
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,500
But I predict.

1193
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,720
Your own weight will be controlled by.

1194
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,340
A vending machine for 10 cents worth of radaric rays.

1195
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,620
I predict.

1196
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,060
Embalming by radar where the body is turned to indestructible stone.

1197
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:02,000
The body will be placed in a fiberglass casket which does not corrode, rot or burn.

1198
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:09,600
Your great, great, great, great grandchildren will be able to look upon your countenance and see how handsome you really were.

1199
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,300
However, I predict.

1200
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:16,700
If you wish a sacred cremation, your ashes can be placed in a small warhead missile.

1201
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:23,560
And fired into outer space where you would essentially and eternally continue your journey.

1202
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:37,760
I predict within 10 years you will live in a push button world and you will even have a maid controlled by automation who is never sick, always cleans perfectly and never misplaces anything.

1203
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:45,200
Always on time, never talks back, never gets fresh with your husband and will love your children.

1204
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,120
Yeah.

1205
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:51,760
Well, yeah, that was Rosie from the Jetsons, as Kathy just said here.

1206
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,980
And we don't see two minutes.

1207
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,120
No, it's not long enough to play a song.

1208
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:04,700
The song I was going to play was one of the there's only one or two good songs off the new Oingo Boingo album.

1209
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,540
What a disappointment, man.

1210
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,440
It's like every their first album only had one bad song.

1211
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,220
Second album had two bad songs.

1212
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,620
Third album had three bad songs.

1213
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,300
And that's gotten to the point now.

1214
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:15,960
It's like the.

1215
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:16,900
Ninth album.

1216
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,680
And they're almost all bad songs.

1217
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,020
I'm really, really disappointed.

1218
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:29,960
And it comes at a time when we found out that that our hero, our erstwhile hero, Mr.

1219
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:30,560
Mr.

1220
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:36,040
Elfman was actually admired subgenius, but was, well, too busy to write back.

1221
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:45,360
And, well, friends, as some of you may know by now, that does happen, although not necessarily coming with fame and fortune.

1222
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:51,020
In fact, it generally tends to come with infamy and extreme poverty.

1223
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,180
Thank you.

1224
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,520
I noticed in all the comics.

1225
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,880
Oh, well, no, that the lawnmower had ran over a toad.

1226
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,440
You see that?

1227
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,980
Oh, that explains it.

1228
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,120
Yeah.

1229
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:04,700
Well, that's a reprint of all the previous former life in a toad.

1230
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,060
The power.

1231
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,500
I always ask him, hey, would you rather be famous, happy or me?

1232
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,880
The latest incident of a rash of law.

1233
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,820
He wants to be me.

1234
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:13,800
Yeah.

1235
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,260
Well, if that lawnmower gives you a rash.

1236
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,220
Just get rid of it, son.

1237
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:21,520
Get a nice girl somewhere, you know, and go to a Christian youth meetings and, you know, you might meet somebody.

1238
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,280
Or use the Wilkinson sword lawnmower.

1239
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,740
It works a little better.

1240
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:28,540
I see.

1241
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,100
Oh, I see.

1242
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:31,720
Very quick.

1243
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,100
It does feel a little icy in the morning.

1244
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:42,420
The handle sticks to your skin before you rev up the motor and start running over those green lawns, bellowing out subgenius silt at the top of your lungs.

1245
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,240
That's how hyperclinians got stuck.

1246
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:45,420
I got it.

1247
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:45,960
Ouch.

1248
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,920
It was the original lawn boy of the airwaves.

1249
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,800
Yes, puzzling.

1250
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,240
Maybe you better clean a little dust ball off the needle of that evidentiometer.

1251
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:01,940
You see, it all started back when we decided to bring the Bay Area a show that it needed.

1252
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,800
A show called...

1253
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,420
Fruit Loop.

1254
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:05,760
No, no, no.

1255
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,560
That's a different show.

1256
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,100
A show called the whatever it is now.

1257
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,180
Oh, the Galingi Hour.

1258
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,100
Yeah, right.

1259
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,560
Well, we thought that the public was ready for Galingi and his friends.

1260
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,040
His...

1261
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,920
Little dog, his girlfriend, his kindly old lovable uncle.

1262
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,040
Nobody knew what to do.

1263
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,280
And, you know, get their microphones turned on.

1264
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:28,820
And now, look, incredible spin-offs, cartoon shows, the Broadway musicals still running, the movie.

1265
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,540
It is amazing.

1266
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:36,220
The clubhouses, the franchises, the restaurants, all from the one inspiration of Teenage Mutant Ninja Galingis.

1267
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,520
Yeah, amazing.

1268
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,120
Teenage Unwed Mutant Turtles.

1269
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:40,800
Yeah.

1270
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,120
I can't say it.

1271
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:43,720
Teenage Unwed Pregnant Mutant Turtles.

1272
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,960
Yeah, you just did.

1273
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:45,900
And look what happened.

1274
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:46,260
There it is.

1275
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,640
You weaken our reality that way.

1276
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,120
And look, even the callers are responding.

1277
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,760
You've hit someone's sore spot all right, mister.

1278
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,100
I sure hope so.

1279
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:54,540
I hope you're happy.

1280
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,380
I poked at him long enough with this stick.

1281
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,600
Yeah, hit his tennis elbow, his funny bone.

1282
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,200
Listen to that pained laughter.

1283
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,480
I hear the toad croaking at the bottom of the sound well.

1284
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,380
It's still connected.

1285
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,940
We've got a problem here on the air.

1286
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:13,700
The toad, the power mower cough, chewed and clipped at the leg with a kind of hobbling hop has got to the gall.

1287
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:22,740
And there that chopped up toad cries his heart out.

1288
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,300
How many cries?

1289
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,700
Because there's a lot of toad there.

1290
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,100
Does it croak, grunt, or roll?

1291
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:32,920
The rare original heart blood flows flat on the earth when you hide.

1292
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,840
I used to have some flowing, flat toad here.

1293
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,280
The wrench kept my anus, Barry.

1294
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,480
Oh, that's the same old.

1295
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,060
Aunt Bertha always did that.

1296
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,680
Till his batrachian eye turns towards the sun.

1297
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,000
It's a mystic monotone.
