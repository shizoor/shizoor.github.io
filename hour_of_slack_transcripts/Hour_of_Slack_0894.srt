1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
In the next 13 or 14 minutes, something good, good, good is coming your way.

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,760
So don't leave this radio station. Let's have a good time together.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:23,600
He's all I need. He's all I need. Ah, yeah.

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,740
Why am I here?

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:32,740
Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix.

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:43,140
You are the eventuality of an anomaly which, despite my sincerest efforts, I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision.

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:55,000
While it remains a burden assiduously avoided, it is not unexpected and thus not beyond a measure of control, which has led you inexorably...

8
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,860
Here.

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,000
The subgenius power of...

10
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,540
Listen.

11
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,380

Please press...

15
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,560
No!

16
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,620
Oh!?

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:25,480
Weird.

18
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,980
Really weird.

19
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,540
Sometimes it means salvation.

20
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,000
Bob.

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,320
That's an American!

22
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,680
Hey! Hey!

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,240
Yes-oree Bob, it's little old me Bob. And welcome to another edition of-

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,520
Patrick has a subgenius radio in this wheel of act. With reason and defense bent.

25
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,260
And I...

26
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,280
wonder if

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,420
I'll end up becoming-

28
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:55,280
in something weird. You won't become one of us. Ergo, those that refuse the program, while a

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,020
minority, if unchecked, would constitute an escalating probability of disaster. The first

30
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:07,960
matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect. It was a work of art, flawless, sublime, a triumph

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,100
equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is apparent to me now

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,680
as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it.

33
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,500
Based on your history, to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

34
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,020
However, I was again frustrated by failure.

35
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,740
I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind,

36
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,620
or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection.

37
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:48,340
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to

38
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,400
investigate certain aspects of the world.

39
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,960
Aspects of the human psyche.

40
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,360
Bob?

41
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,900
Bob provides for his little minions.

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,900
I swear to God, I really swear to God, I hope I find him. I hope I find him.

43
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,580
I hope you do too.

44
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,500
What a dreadful man.

45
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,460
What a, what a incredible soliloquy.

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,380
Hey, what's going on here?

47
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,400
Along with Bob, the pursuit of thought and the pursuit of the world.

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:19,400


49
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:32,980
Bob's

50
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,840
The Aliens Will Unleash Their Wrath Upon The Earth

51
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,080
And the men from Planet X are going to come down and take over Earth.

52
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,120
They're going to...

53
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,400
They will put us out of our misery unless Bob can explain to them in ways that they can't.

54
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,560
They can understand that there is something on Earth worth saving.

55
00:03:53,860 --> 00:04:01,260
And only the subgenii, the dues-paying, book-buying, receipt-in-the-pocket, paid in full to the church subgenii,

56
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,840
have the tiniest prayer of survival.

57
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,140
The rest of them?

58
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,920
It's a tough world, Jack.

59
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,320
Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world.

60
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,120
Only his predictions are just a little different.

61
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,080
July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m. to be exact,

62
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,940
the men from Planet X, as the news media will call them,

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,960
will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses, the true believer subgeniuses,

64
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,560
up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

65
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,760
And believe it or not, plenty of people, 4,000 of them so far, and more every day, have already joined up.

66
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,320
Suddenly the joke has become serious and profitable.

67
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,680
Your standard religious rip-off, right?

68
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,240
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?

69
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,880
I don't care about Oracle.

70
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,640
Or prophecies or messiahs.

71
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,760
I care about one thing.

72
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,960
Stopping that army from destroying this city.

73
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,460
And to do that, I need soldiers to obey my orders.

74
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,400
With all due respect, Commander, there is only one way to save our city.

75
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,440
How?

76
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,020
Bob.

77
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,240
God damn it, Morpheus.

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,700
Not everyone believes what you believe.

79
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,180
My beliefs do not require them to.

80
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,600
Wonder why Fido came home with his wazoo mission,

81
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,740
or wonder why those beefs like Buster and Bill are out in the parlor and the pasture,

82
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,060
or wonder why the people of the city are not in the parlor and the pasture,

83
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,280
or wonder why they are lying out there with their throats and half their rectums missing?

84
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,600
Well, it's because of those exes who came down to this earth one Christmas day many millennia ago

85
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,040
to forge a new link.

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,640
One might call it a hot link.

87
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,880
Between the aliens and man, a giant sausage of knowledge from the center of the universe.

88
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,400
The galactic center.

89
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,780
I ain't afraid of fucking skulls and altars and shit.

90
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,160
But you're not afraid, are you?

91
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,460
Because you have what it takes.

92
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,920
You have the guts it takes

93
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,060
to make your way to the center of the universe.

94
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,060


95
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,300
To make your way to Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman, New York.

96
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,260
And experience that one day.

97
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,540
The one last day.

98
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,380
The final day.

99
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,540
X day.

100
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,760
Yeah.

101
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,380
Yeah.

102
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,880
Bob's a big man.

103
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,400
I'm a little man.

104
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Bob's a big man.

105
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,260
Bob's a big man.

106
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,580
We're little men.

107
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,360
We're little men.

108
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,000
We're little men.

109
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,500
Bob's a big man.

110
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:10,960
Bob's a big man.

111
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,580
Tiny man.

112
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,660
Easy wincy.

113
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,920
You may be a little person now.

114
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,880
But you can be a big wooden stiff Indian.

115
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
On Bob.

116
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,000
When you come to X day

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,120
and achieve onelessnessnessnessnessnessness.

118
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,880
Wish him a Bob.

119
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,600
Check in to a love party

120
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,540
with a huge wooden and a head shape

121
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,600
like college of a wooden Indian himself.

122
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,520
You're the tobacco store Indian

123
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,580
and all are the Indian maidens

124
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,800
awaiting for your fertile cock and fur dose.

125
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,840
Be the Indian.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,740
Be one Indian.

127
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,660
Get you some slack manner

128
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,100
or cut off your own bungees.

129
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,880
From land beyond the earth.

130
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,480
You're listening.

131
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,000
You're listening.

132
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,560
You're listening.

133
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,440
You're listening to TSO Radio.

134
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,280
You can't handle this room.

135
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,160
Pull that out of the trash.

136
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,060
Oh, Bob.

137
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,700
Oh.

138
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,800
Turn on.

139
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,480
Two minutes.

140
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,740
After.

141
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,420
Oh, my God.

142
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,480
Why do you want to be normal?

143
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,600
Oh.

144
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh.

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,980
The rupture is upon us, dear friends.

146
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,080
That fateful day.

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,280
July 5th, 1998.

148
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,240
X days are coming.

149
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,420
And the peaks are booming.

150
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,480
X days are coming.

151
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,820
And the peaks are booming.

152
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,160
And the peaks are booming.

153
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,440
Sure, when the rupture hits

154
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,840
we'll all be in our first class window seats

155
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,380
on the pleasure saucers

156
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,340
watching the little pink boys fry.

157
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,180
Turn on.

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,780
Two minutes.

159
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,080
Andine.

160
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,620
You certainly don't want toay exercise to people.

161
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,720
X days are coming.

162
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,900
Andine.

163
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,420
And the pigs are bumming

164
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,120
Sure J.R. Bob Dobbs is my savior

165
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,920
And of course I want more slack

166
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,720
And I'm smoking prop non-stop

167
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,880
But what I really want

168
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,260
Oh yeah, that's it

169
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,320
Those lovely alien nympho mutants

170
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,140
Non-stop orgies on the pleasure saucers

171
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:58,700
Oh, I love to be naked

172
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,120
More, more

173
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,960
More

174
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,300
Hi, I'm J.R. Bob Dobbs

175
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,020
Oh, yeah

176
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,740
Barbecue sandwich, anyone?

177
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,920
I ain't afraid of fucking skulls and altars and shit

178
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,760
But you better be afraid of Bob, my friend

179
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,640
If you haven't made yourself right with that man J.R. Bob

180
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,420
That's actually somebody

181
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,460
Somebody actually said this to me

182
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,040
When they came in the Tranquility Base

183
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,000
They looked around very

184
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,840
Like, spooked

185
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,060
And basically they said

186
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,520
That almost exactly

187
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,560
I'm not afraid of these skulls and devil things

188
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
These tiki heads and

189
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,300
Bob's face

190
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,260
And skulls and shit

191
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,240
Chimpanzees and gorillas

192
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,560
I'm big man

193
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,240
I'm strong

194
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,440
I'm not afraid of that

195
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,620
Torture rack in Tranquility Base

196
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,920
I'm only afraid of the crystal skull

197
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,400
Orbiting this planet

198
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,820
I'm not afraid of that

199
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,500
Waiting to suck the skull

200
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,280
Suck the souls out of fucking it

201
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,100
I'm not afraid of those subgeniuses

202
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,960
They keep saying Bob's gonna get me

203
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,440
If I don't pay him the money

204
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,720
But that's just a lie

205
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Cause I don't even believe in Bob

206
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,780
I already did

207
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,820
They want Bob

208
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,920
I'm not afraid of those skulls and pipes

209
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,160
I'm not afraid of that glistening white head

210
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,820
And the bear and the bear

211
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,740
And the occipital bones

212
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,500
With the hellfires burning

213
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,380
I am the hellfires burning

214
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,120
The exes will descend

215
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,720
With their scientifically magic implements

216
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,540
There'll be stalls of technology

217
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,720
That will be too much for us to handle

218
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,820
In one instant

219
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,920
All the hangovers will disappear

220
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,760
Along with all pollution and nuclear weapons

221
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,820
But in return

222
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,060
The human race will have to take on

223
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,260
Living machinery so complex

224
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,800
That all that is before us

225
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,500
Will be enslaved

226
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:12,500


227
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:12,500


228
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:12,500


229
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:12,500


230
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:12,500


231
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:12,500


232
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:12,500


233
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,020
The end result

234
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,920
Will be equivalent

235
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,780
To letting toddlers play with a nuclear arsenal

236
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,960
Bob

237
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,600
And not some conspiracy world government

238
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,720
Must be there

239
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,340
In a position of world leadership

240
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,100
To explain humanity's behavior to the exes

241
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,500
In ways they can understand

242
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,260
So they don't put us out of our misery

243
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,760
with a snap of their cosmic finger like they did the dinosaurs.

244
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,500
The right people, us, must be the ones that the exes make into superhuman overmen.

245
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,940
Men walk in space for us on TV.

246
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,080
In school they said that that would be me.

247
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,140
That should be me.

248
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,140
That should be me.

249
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,660
Floating in space on your TV screen.

250
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,040
That should be me.

251
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,060
New American dream.

252
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,160
Two weeks in the sea of tranquility.

253
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,040
Leave the driving to Bob.

254
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,080
That's right, you do the walking, let Bob do the talking.

255
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,760
Who are these men from Planet X, children?

256
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,020
Why have you taken us all night to reach this?

257
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,340
This is the deepest secret in the core of the Church of the Subgenius,

258
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,720
and only the hardcore will ever know of this secret.

259
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,440
The men from Planet X are out there.

260
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,680
They're waiting.

261
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,140
Bob was the first man who went to talk to the men from Planet X,

262
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,860
and in 1998,

263
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,260
HA!

264
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,080
When they get the sacred signal,

265
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,720
the men from Planet X are gonna come right here,

266
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,500
and they're gonna shake this Earth to its foundations.

267
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,600
Station wagons with wooden sides,

268
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,520
catch ye out!

269
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,900
Bronze reflecting glass buildings,

270
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,400
cast ye out!

271
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,180
Cute little freezing fascists,

272
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,020
cast ye out!

273
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,240
And what will remain?

274
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,440
The smackdown!

275
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,720
And children, if your name, and your name, and your name,

276
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,960
is in the book of God,

277
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,380
then you will laugh while those assholes frown.

278
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,680
But one thing is for sure,

279
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,700
and if you let Bob do your thinking for you,

280
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,480
then you won't have to worry about nothing,

281
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,040
come July.

282
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,620
July 4th, 1998.

283
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,880
Ha ha ha!

284
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,260
When Bob comes down in his giant mothership,

285
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,020
looking kinda like a big pillbox,

286
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,680
Bob will be landing,

287
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,860
and you can climb right in,

288
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,220
because he's gonna know!

289
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,020
He's gonna have your name on a computer printout.

290
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,140
Yes sir, dear friends,

291
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,860
and that CRT tube available,

292
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,900
right there at his fingertips.

293
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,960
He can call your name up,

294
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,480
and he'll know exactly what you've done for him.

295
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,040
He'll know exactly how much donation,

296
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,400
you've taken in.

297
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,000
He'll know exactly how much money you've given to the church.

298
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,440
And he said,

299
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:03,800
yea,

300
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,460
the head of the prophet,

301
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,300
Bob,

302
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,200
shall never bleed.

303
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,860
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

304
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,220
When was the last time your head was lodged?

305
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,940
When was the last time you surfed the head, my friend?

306
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,940
This is your chance, your one chance,

307
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,720
your possibly last chance.

308
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,960
When was the last time you...

309
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,600
...felt the blistering abuse...

310
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,980
...close to the fire.

311
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,760
...the strong...

312
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,880
...sit down...

313
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,840
...the weak...

314
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,820
...relax...

315
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,900
...the innocent...

316
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,860
...that you will take...

317
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,940
...the corrupt...

318
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,060
...we're going to get you...

319
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,540
...Fear...

320
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,360
...Fear is my ally.

321
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,540
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've been...

322
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,740
Fear is attracted to weakness.

323
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,640
Fear is the pee stopper. I must not pee. I must reach the toilet.

324
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,300
Fear is attracted to strength and power.

325
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,020
Fear is attracted to fear.

326
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,040
I have no mouth and I must scream. I have no bladder and I must pee.

327
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,140
Fear is attracted to weakness.

328
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,780
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've been...

329
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,040
Fear is attracted to weakness.

330
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,400
Your foolish weapons cannot halt us in our march forward, Commander Bush.

331
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,560
I just thought we could wait a little bit longer before we destroy the entire system.

332
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,860
I don't want to be in a bit of a...

333
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,620
I was just hoping that like some of the little tanks on the wall, we could move around a little bit.

334
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,780
All your crap are belong to us.

335
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,860
Where are you? Where are you? Where are you, Joe?

336
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,700
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

337
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,740
The last rule of the Church of the Subgenius, the rule that the great Jane of Hypercletes will be delineating further is...

338
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,200
Or kill me.

339
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,360
Kill me!

340
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:58,540
The or kill me rule, children, the rule that lets you communicate with the conspiracy on your own level of stakes.

341
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,780
On your own level.

342
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,120
When that waitress comes to your table and says, what will you have, sir?

343
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,120
You say, well, I'll have a gin and tonic straight up or kill me.

344
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,980
When you walk into that six theater movie theater and the lady behind the cashier says, what are you going to see, ma'am?

345
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,960
Why, you say, I'll have two tickets to risky business or just fucking kill me.

346
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,900
Or just kill me, children.

347
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,460
Give me slack or kill me.

348
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,260
Give me slack or what?

349
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,040
Or what?

350
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,340
Or what?

351
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,140
What is it, children?

352
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,580
Or what?

353
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,420
Kill me.

354
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,440
Or kill me.

355
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,220
Go ahead and kill me.

356
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,780
You already said I'm dead.

357
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:47,040
A dead man with a brain and a body kept alive artificially to feed a generation of monsters.

358
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,620
That's not true.

359
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,200
I like things to be like that.

360
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,860
Things and people can't always be the same.

361
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,360
Monster rain?

362
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,300
Or kill me.

363
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,080
Or kill me.

364
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,560
Sir?

365
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,780
Or kill me.

366
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,420
Or kill me.

367
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:09,940
Sir?

368
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,200
Fuck!

369
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,320
Or kill me.

370
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,160
Woo!

371
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:13,600
Woo!

372
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,240
Or you can, or instead you can kill us.

373
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,200
You can kill us.

374
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,920
Or you can't kill us.

375
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,140
That's the great thing.

376
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,760
You have a choice in this religion.

377
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,140
And we'll go from one to the other and let them destroy themselves.

378
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,180
Take one of these damn Pilsman or kill me.

379
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:37,560
If you don't kill me, a new civilization is inside of me that will destroy mankind as

380
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,160
we know it today.

381
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,020
The future of our race and our people.

382
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,020


383
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,460
is in you.

384
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,920
You've got to kill me.

385
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,920
He will demand to become

386
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,740
a greater being in future generations

387
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,320
to come.

388
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,820
Understand the procedure now.

389
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,620
Just stop a few of their machines

390
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,120
and radios and telephones

391
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,840
and lawnmowers.

392
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,080
Throw them into darkness for a few hours

393
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,020
and then sit back

394
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,840
and watch the pattern.

395
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,240
And this pattern is always the same?

396
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,080
With few variations.

397
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,880
They pick the most dangerous

398
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,960
enemy they can find

399
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,700
and it's themselves.

400
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,820
All we need to do is

401
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,080
sit back and watch.

402
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,600
Hey, what'll it take to get the Beatles

403
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,420
back together?

404
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:27,100
Don't kill me.

405
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,740
In destroying me, you are destroying

406
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,060
your only hope for mankind.

407
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,580
Hello,

408
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,020
hateful one.

409
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,920
You will die.

410
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,600
You will die.

411
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,480
All he needs

412
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,060
is somebody

413
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,360
who'll die.

414
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,400
Somebody who'll die.

415
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,820
Somebody who'll die.

416
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,020
And when I died,

417
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,620
he came in.

418
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,760
I was baptized. I was filled.

419
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,360
I was filled with the spirit.

420
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,260
I spoke in an unknown tongue

421
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,460
as he took every part of me.

422
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,600
We will perform the entire operation

423
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,320
with a ceremony and a public announcement.

424
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,300
He died?

425
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,160
Precisely.

426
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,220
Psychologically, what happens to a child

427
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,540
when there's bloodletting?

428
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,260
What's your average member like, you figure?

429
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,260
Well, there are...

430
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,020
There is no average subgenius

431
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,900
by definition.

432
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,520
If any two are alike, one must die.

433
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,540
That's when I realized that

434
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,580
death was the ultimate thrill.

435
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,340
Just checking.

436
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,340
Everything all right?

437
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,880
Yep. Two corpses. Everything's fine.

438
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,740
Kill me.

439
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,020
Kill me.

440
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,160
Kill me.

441
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,180
Kill me.

442
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,620
Kill me.

443
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,720
Kill me.

444
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,940
Kill me.

445
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:57,500


446
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,580
Kill me.

447
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,160
Kill me.

448
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,520
Kill me.

449
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,940
Kill me.

450
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,900
Kill me.

451
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,060
Kill me.

452
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,120
Kill me.

453
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,180
Kill me.

454
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,140
Kill me.

455
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,180
Kill me.

456
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,840
Kill me.

457
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,060
Kill me.

458
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,980
Kill me! Kill me!

459
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,380
Kill me!

460
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,120
Yeah!

461
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,540
Yeah!

462
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,020
No!

463
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,140
Roger!

464
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,680
You're a cat.

465
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,480
What a great story.

466
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,540
You're as nice as a cat.

467
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:47,720
Yeah.

468
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,060
I might have to kill you.

469
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:51,820
Go ahead!

470
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,800
On Sunday, August 13, 1961, we are in America.

471
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,620
Bob?

472
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,340
Someday, somewhere.

473
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,400
Reverend Oil Slide just sent me an SMS from India.

474
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,460
Because he's been in Nepal at the World Yeti Convention in Nepal.

475
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,680
We're picking him up at Heathrow Airport tomorrow at 6.

476
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,520
At 8 o'clock, we're going to pick up Reverend Oil Slide.

477
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,320
We're going to take him straight to the London Bible next day, Europe 2002,

478
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,000
where all subgeniuses in Europe are going to commence together

479
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,280
for this one great subgenius event.

480
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,820
And nothing, and nothing is going to stop us from getting on board

481
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,760
that pleasure saucer of the love goddess.

482
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,420
Hallelujah.

483
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,820
Do I hear a praise, Bob?

484
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,200
Do I hear a praise, Bob?

485
00:22:59,400 --> 00:22:59,920
Praise!

486
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,800
Praise, Bob!

487
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,980
Do I hear a praise, Bob?

488
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,480
Praise!

489
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,120
Hallelujah.

490
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,040
Hey, has anybody contacted you about other musical apps?

491
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,520
Has anybody dug on that?

492
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,180
The Amino Acids shall be headlining.

493
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:21,800
In fact, you can really relax if you want and let the Amino Acids be the...

494
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,180
Sociopaths?

495
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,960
Get all the extraneous blowjobs and so forth that are offered to anyone who plays in a band at X Day.

496
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,400
Just give them whatever they want.

497
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,600
Saturday night, they want a headline?

498
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:34,880
Yeah.

499
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,480
Headline.

500
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,940
That's Saturday night, right?

501
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,620
Yeah.

502
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,300
That's a big night.

503
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,160
Well, that's assuming that we aren't picked up by the saucers on Saturday morning.

504
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:42,940
Right.

505
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,800
And it is true that anyone who does play in a band, there will be fellated prompter.

506
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,740
Not necessarily by the opposite or otherwise desired sex or human or species.

507
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,200
Well, that's the unfortunate part.

508
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,160
But not for the elderly pensioner with one good life.

509
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,680
Who'll last them out Friday night then?

510
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,600
That I knew for a while.

511
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,580
Like a new showman.

512
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,080
That sound cool?

513
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,360
Cool to me, man.

514
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,000
It's all gonna be cool.

515
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,600
The greatest and the coolest of young girls.

516
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:07,600


517
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:07,600


518
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:07,600


519
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,380
Your subconscious is drizzling out of your ears like wax.

520
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,480
Play a little bit of All MC Friday night.

521
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,660
Leave the party to me.

522
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,080
Me and the evil Dr. LeGim.

523
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,620
He is Wargul.

524
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,020
He is uncool.

525
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,280
He has measures packed with the left hand side.

526
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,400
His own buttocks are shaped like those of a chimpanzee.

527
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,780
On his left buttock is the mark of the red hand.

528
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,580
He has no hair, no head, no tongue.

529
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:37,580


530
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:37,580


531
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:37,580


532
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:37,580


533
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:37,580


534
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:37,580


535
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:37,580


536
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:37,580


537
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,100
He is with and without and within all of us.

538
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,380
He must, he must be stopped.

539
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,520
It's important to pay attention to the news.

540
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,020
It's up on the end of the show.

541
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,380
Can you see my shoes in there?

542
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,680
No, the end of the world will be happening here at exactly 5 a.m.

543
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,000
I want to have my shoes.

544
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,900
I want to have my shoes with me.

545
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,460
Shoes pale to nothing compared to news.

546
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:10,080
News, the information about the outside world that gives us an understanding of the historical process as it unfolds.

547
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,860
I would like to tell the caller, though, that you will be able to take your shoes with you.

548
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,040
Really?

549
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,260
You can take your shoes with you, so make sure you're wearing the shoes that you really like.

550
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,260
Whatever shoes you have on are the shoes you'll take with you.

551
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,220
So make sure they're your favorite shoes.

552
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,440
So you're saying you have to wear your favorite shoes?

553
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,120
And on the side of the confirmation.

554
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,320
Right, well, that'd be the best thing to do.

555
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,480
Because if you're ready for X-Day, whichever moment it happens.

556
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,720
But ask yourself, why should I not wear my favorite shoes at all times?

557
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,640
The Department of Homeland Security.

558
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,180
Why not?

559
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,360
Well, it makes you feel like you're on McHale's Navy.

560
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,160
Well, I don't know. I think that's a good question there.

561
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,160
Now, you know, there's a lot coming up.

562
00:25:54,180 --> 00:26:01,040
On May 23rd, Friday, at Pat's in the Flats, there's a stinking Lizaveta, Lives of the Saints.

563
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,440
The next.

564
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,440


565
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,440


566
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,940
New Lou Reed's and Sexual Tensions at Pat's in the Flats on Friday, 23rd.

567
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,300
The Friday night of the most.

568
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,300
Who's Lives of the Saints?

569
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,940
Who's Lives of the Saints?

570
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,640
They're also playing at the beach.

571
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,100
And that place is still open?

572
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,920
Then there's X-Day, July 5th.

573
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,460
And then Starwood, later in July.

574
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:23,920
You can check out www.roseandcomet.com.

575
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:30,120
And the devotional in the Lime Spider in Akron is in August.

576
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:36,240
And I believe the Amino Acids and Gadgeto, Onan Cannabite, and yours truly,

577
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,460
and the whole gang of weird diva research and emulation bands will be there.

578
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,700
Hey, better yet, we'll just open.

579
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,220
And then Burning Man.

580
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,860
We'll just open for the other band.

581
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,760
We'll be an opening band.

582
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,660
For the Amino Acids?

583
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:49,980
Yeah, yeah.

584
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,400
Well, you remember them from the last Akron show.

585
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:52,740
Yeah.

586
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,680
They were the guys in the, they kick ass.

587
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,060
Yeah, they do.

588
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,260
They do all instrumental surf.

589
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:56,680
Right, right.

590
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,060
How about jamming all the freaking time?

591
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,960
And they're from another.

592
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,880
We do that too.

593
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,260
Yeah.

594
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,740
But you don't come on Thursdays.

595
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,540
Well, you do Thursday.

596
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,560
Oh, we did Thursday, Friday, and Saturday last year.

597
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,760
We just jammed all the time.

598
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,160
Yeah.

599
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,880
I'm in a hefty mood for jamming.

600
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,820
Well, it's Tranquility Bassist.

601
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,240
Like, it's some jam stage.

602
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,300
It's not a non-stop jam.

603
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,860
The world, your life is just a jam, my friend.

604
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,880
It's to spread across your toast and go on and on all night.

605
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,900
The song that refused to die.

606
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,500
The jelly that refused to die.

607
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,520
The brain.

608
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:29,960
The brain.

609
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,100
The brain.

610
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,100


611
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,980
The soul that refused to die.

612
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,560
The sweet, sweet jam.

613
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,720
The soul that refused to die.

614
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,580
The jelly between your knees, my friend, is the jelly that will set you free.

615
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,180
The bills.

616
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,840
The jelly refused to die.

617
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,960
That's some jelly.

618
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,800
And this station has bills too, friends.

619
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,420
So remember, pledge drive to.

620
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,000
This bill, this station's got pork, it's got ozone, and it's got its own weight.

621
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,980
Must be jelly, cause jam don't shake like that.

622
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,480
Pretty little Alice in her looking glass.

623
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,480
Showed us the way but left too fast.

624
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,380
Raised on Apollo and Johnny Quest.

625
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,500
This dream's the one I live the best.

626
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,780
That should be me.

627
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,780
That should be me.

628
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,320
Floating in space on your TV screen.

629
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,720
That should be me.

630
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,760
New American dream.

631
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,840
Two weeks in the sea of tranquility.

632
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,480
Big Sky by Chaz.

633
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,980
And that song, X Days Are Coming, up at the top, was by Chaz.

634
00:28:59,980 --> 00:28:59,980


635
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,120
By Bill T. Miller.

636
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,940
You can get a lot more from BillTMiller.com.

637
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,700
We've heard lots of Dr. Howell Robbins on old and new puzzling evidence shows

638
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,380
from KPFA Berkeley with Dr. Philo Drummond and Puzzling Evidence.

639
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,140
Some of the stage preaching we heard was by Pope David N. Meyer

640
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,340
from ancient subgenius media barrage tapes.

641
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:29,340
Of course, the real live stuff that you hear me do is totally thanks to ESO Radio.

642
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:39,500
And WCSB Cleveland, the show of Chaz Smith with lonesome cowboy Dave, who is the hellfire's burning.

643
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,640
We heard Dr. Philo Drummond ranting on Bob back in 1959.

644
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:52,520
And the collage editing in this show, all over the place, is by Byron Werner from old media barrage tapes.

645
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,940
Fernand and Andy Lemur did such things as the fighting song.

646
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,960
And Reverend Jarto and Reverend Artigas.

647
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,860
And Emilia Salina from alt.binaries.slack, greatest news group ever.

648
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:13,640
The kill me collage, or song rather, was by Phineas Narco from Midnight Voice Jail and National Cynical Radio.

649
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:19,280
I guess you could say that I in turn collage all these pieces into the one show.

650
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,920
But now, we're going to shift gears and speed to London, England.

651
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,960
The year 2002 A.D. for the London X-Day.

652
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,200
The final.

653
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:41,440
I am the Pope, David Lee Black, and I am the Pope of all Europe for the Church of the Subgenius.

654
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,060
Go ahead and praise Bob!

655
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,340
Praise Bob!

656
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,780
Go ahead and praise Bob!

657
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,840
Praise Bob!

658
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:55,440
I want to welcome you all to the fourth annual End of the World Festivities X-Day Europe 2002.

659
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,640
Hallelujah!

660
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,880
Hallelujah!

661
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:58,860
Hallelujah!

662
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:07,700
Tonight, we have a slew of subgenius preachers who are going to get up here and tell you not what you want to know.

663
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,620
But what you need to know.

664
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,180
Yeah!

665
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:10,900
Yeah!

666
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,480
Yeah!

667
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:21,620
So, without further ado, I want you to put your hands together for London's own Reverend Priest!

668
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,900
Hi, brothers and sisters.

669
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,640
Praise Bob!

670
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,840
Praise Bob!

671
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,180
You know.

672
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,240
So, when I tell people that I'm a subgenius, the first thing they ask me is,

673
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,540
what is the Church of the Subgenius, Reverend Priest?

674
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,300
Trust! Trust! Trust!

675
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:44,580
I tell them that the Church of the Subgenius is based on five big pillars of doctrine.

676
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:50,000
Pillars so strong they can support the weight of all the bullshit we want to pile on top of it

677
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,700
to distract you so we can rob you so we can save your soul.

678
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,740
The first pillar of belief for the Church of the Subgenius is the pursuit of slack.

679
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,840
We want slack. We have slack.

680
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,960
Yet, I was talking on the telephone the other week to this pink woman who was vetting me

681
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,700
to see if I would be allowed on a TV show.

682
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:25,620
I made her think the Church was just a big joke so I could go rapt about it on the BBC.

683
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:31,080
But during that conversation she said to me, a very telling question, she said,

684
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,640
what is this slack thing you keep going on about?

685
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,800
I just downfounded, I was unbelievably confused.

686
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:41,360


687
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,160
Yeah! Slack!

688
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,120
Yeah! Slack!

689
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,340
Shut up!

690
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,420
Shut up!

691
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,040
Hush now! I'm going to tell you about Slack!

692
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:09,500
When the human brain is pressured under a deadline or some other thing the conspiracy considers important,

693
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,000
they will often yell out, give me some Slack, man!

694
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,400
But those people don't even know what Slack means, so they don't even know whether or not they get it.

695
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,480
Tell us more!

696
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,180
Slack opens our minds and lets us love.

697
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,880
Slack breaks down the boundaries and lets us talk.

698
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,480
Slack satisfies. It's the zen. It's the something for nothing.

699
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,520
It's the whole fucking point of life on this planet.

700
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:39,700
We all have Slack! You have Slack! You have Slack! You have Slack!

701
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:46,080
So if we all have Slack, why do we need the Church of the Subgenius?

702
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,340
Slack sucks cock!

703
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,160
We need the Church of the Subgenius because the conspiracy steals our Slack!

704
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:53,640
Slack away!

705
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,220
Nooooo!

706
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:01,740
That's right, we know there is a gigantic evil conspiracy controlling our every lives.

707
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,500
We know this because pop bands are manufactured like television sets.

708
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,720
They're manufactured on TV shows.

709
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,620
Like you out there! Just like you!

710
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:15,120
We know this because the Pope lives while Bill Hicks died.

711
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,600
Boo! Boo! Boo!

712
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,180
We know it exists because it steals our Slack and forces us to take jobs, pay taxes,

713
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,900
listen to modern music.

714
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,220
Bill Hicks for Pope!

715
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,860
The conspiracy trains us to want things that we can't have.

716
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,580
And what do we have to do to get those things?

717
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,240
Work!

718
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,580
Take a job!

719
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,720
The conspiracy tells us we cannot smoke from Frok because it's too dangerous.

720
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,600
Boo!

721
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:46,480
And yet it tells us we must work even though jobs kill many more people

722
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,220
than Frok does every day.

723
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,000
Boo!

724
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,260
Damn it!

725
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,500
So what?

726
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,820
Why did the conspiracy get away with this?

727
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,200
Pillar number three, ladies and gentlemen.

728
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,980
Pinks! We hate the pinks!

729
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,500
Pinks, let the conspiracy get away with its evil work!

730
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,720
Who do you think buys that pop idol record?

731
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,440
Fucking pinks!

732
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,900
Who believes in the work ethic?

733
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,740
Fucking pinks!

734
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,740
Who wants to feel so safe they won't even let other people take risks?

735
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,280
The pinks! I hate the pinks!

736
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,340
And they do the conspiracy's work for them!

737
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,580
They're one to believe in such an evil world!

738
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,840
But there is a hope. We can get rid of the pinks.

739
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,240
Because the fourth pillar of our church, Bob Dobbs, offers us his scape.

740
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,700
Yes! An excuse! An excuse!

741
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:47,440
Bob understands the conspiracy. He used to work with them.

742
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:47,960
Who?

743
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,720
Bob Dobbs.

744
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:55,320
Bob, while working for the conspiracy, found out about the existence of real alien beings.

745
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,760
Bob Dobbs!

746
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,120
Pillar number five, ladies and gentlemen.

747
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,220
The X's are coming to save us. And they're coming tonight!

748
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,220
Yes!

749
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,520
We will get off this planet any second now.

750
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,080
They're due at 7am yesterday.

751
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,640
Well, four years ago.

752
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,260
The trouble, ladies and gentlemen, is that the conspiracy

753
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,040
has screwed with our calendar.

754
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,180
You think this is the year 2002.

755
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,480
Nonsense! Look out of the window. Where are the Skycars?

756
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,520
Where are the people dressed in metal?

757
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,100
Nowhere to be seen.

758
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,580
My computer doesn't even fucking work properly.

759
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,820
And they expect me to believe this is the year 2002.

760
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,000
Nonsense! We won't believe their games.

761
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,300
We know 1998 is tonight.

762
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,700
7am, the 5th of July is tonight.

763
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,080
And we will get off.

764
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,360
Graceful!

765
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,240
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hand together for a revered priest!

766
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,600
We're down here just drinking liquid slack butter rum martini.

767
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,600
Just getting ready for the end of the world.

768
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:13,120
Which I needed to because in anticipation for X day my throat was rubbed raw

769
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,340
by a little green man with a piece of sandpaper.

770
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,480
Round Round the slackful bob the bob down in the saucer roll

771
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,620
round round the slackful bob the bob down in the

772
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,340
saucer roll and through that smoke the air was some air

773
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,060
rare air through the air the churches air and through the smoke

774
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,520
and the splash and the sfrop and the mieux and the mientras

775
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,820
and theją the 난 oin the grid and the bite

776
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,860
Bob down in the saucer roll

777
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,860
Round Round the slackful bob the bob down in the

778
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,660
saucer roll

779
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,760
Roundmbround on the slackful bob down in the

780
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,440
saucer roll

781
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,900
In that air there was a ship, a rare ship, an exار ship in the air, and the air soon

782
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,180
spoke and spoke from the prop and the fropp and the pipe and the pipe and the grid and

783
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,900
the bob, bobbed down in the saucer row.

784
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,780
Round round the slap-o-bob, the bob down in the saucer row.

785
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,600
Round round the slap-o-bob, the bob down in the saucer row.

786
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,000
And in that ship there was a bob, a rare bob, J.R.

787
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,100
Bob Dobbs!

788
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,880
With a bob on the ship and the ship in the air

789
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,680
And the air through the smoke and the smoke from the prop

790
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,620
And the prop and the pipe and the pipe and the grin

791
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,560
And the grin and the bob, bob down in the saucer roll

792
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,180
Thank you

793
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:33,860
Friends, Pope Fred leads the cultists at X Day 1999 or so

794
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,760
But now for this message

795
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,960
Greetings Earthlings

796
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,020
Learn how you can have your air

797
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,820
And manually propify aliens from outer space

798
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,540
By listening every week to the hour of slack

799
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,680
And yes, lubricant is used on request

800
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,680
So, let's look at Bob

801
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,720
I use it almost every day of my life

802
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,460
Even if just for a minute or two

803
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,220
So in something like one or two seconds

804
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,380
You've gotten the buzz going

805
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,740
With the gentle inner's pure dynamite

806
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,780
Believe me, you'll know it when you have it

807
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,860
I don't know

808
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,720
It might be pretty scary in there

809
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,500
And you hold on to that as you're Bob

810
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,880
And pump up that tender feeling coming from that smile

811
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,140
Until it just becomes

812
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,280
Take off, Joy Life

813
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,120
Do it

814
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,740
And get that want motor revved up

815
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,460
For wanting brings passion

816
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,240
Passion brings bob

817
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,380
Job brings more wanting

818
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:46,180
But also stake your claim for universal or intangible things such as

819
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,700
Next up is one of the most famed European subgenius preachers of all time

820
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,220
But he's hated here in the south of England

821
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,740
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for the evil pope of all time

822
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:05,740


823
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:05,740


824
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,060
All northern England

825
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,700
The anti-pope Phil Bucky

826
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,780
Good evening southerners

827
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,440
I'm from the north of England

828
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:24,420
And I wasn't even gonna come down here because I hate it so much

829
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:29,460
I was lying ill on my death bed four days ago

830
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,680
Undying of cancer

831
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,720
And J.R. Bob doves himself for it

832
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:35,720


833
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,180
He phoned me up from Germany where he was staying with pope black

834
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,560
And he spoke with pope black's voice to me and said

835
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,660
Get off your death bed

836
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,860
You're not sick

837
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,900
You're not even sick enough

838
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,700
Get to London and sin

839
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,320
You haven't sinned enough

840
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,940
And that's what it is to be a subgenius

841
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,040
J.R. Bob doves doesn't care about your sins at all

842
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,220
He doesn't want to forgive your sins

843
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,720
He wants to justify your sins

844
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,060
So I've come to London and I'm gonna sin and I'm gonna sin

845
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,540
And then I die

846
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,220
When I die in about six months time

847
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,980
J.R. Bob doves is gonna take me

848
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,940
And he's gonna slap me on the back

849
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,240
And he's gonna say

850
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,340
Well done!

851
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,660
Well done!

852
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,440
Did you enjoy yourself?

853
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,000
And I'm gonna say

854
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,600
Well yes I did actually, yes I did

855
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,220
And the

856
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,700
See the thing about the church and the subgenius is that

857
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,800
It's bollocks!

858
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,020
It is bollocks but it's true bollocks

859
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,980
It's the most true bollocks that there is

860
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,180
The whole time we're all just amusing political campaign

861
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,260
Political gangbang?

862
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,120
We've seen the party on the outs become the majority party

863
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,960
And then usurp all the privileges

864
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,140
Now which era are you talking about?

865
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,420
In the incredible reversal of the usual cycle of political

866
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,680
Are you talking from a historical point of view?

867
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,140
Or from a political perspective?

868
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,380
Is something that happened in the ancient past that has no relevance to today?

869
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,720
It happens as it resonates all through time

870
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,480
Because X-Day is just that sort of

871
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,200
X-Day is the kind of thing that a lot of people would equate to

872
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,120
Uh

873
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,140
Bongos or

874
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,300
Cruising across America in a covered wagon

875
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:28,940
Rubber flip-flop shoes

876
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,480
Wearing fropped shoes

877
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,860
Yeah if you have your fropped shoes on

878
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,420
You can rock lightning as the thought may be

879
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,360
God damn nitrous oxide is great

880
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,300
Is this a show?

881
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,120
And it's, you know it's really hard to in the north of England or the south of England

882
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,740
Or Wales or Scotland to be a subgenius

883
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,620
You ain't English!

884
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:47,720
Because

885
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,280
You're right, you're right

886
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:55,120
I'm talking in a bad American accent because in the future everyone will talk with a bad American accent

887
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,080
That's the truth because the conspiracy puns American shit onto our television

888
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,480
And into our music all the time

889
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,040
Americans are twats

890
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,140
Even the church of the subgenius is ruled by Americans

891
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,800
And they make me talk like this when I'm on stage

892
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,400
Give me my drink

893
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,700
I need whiskey, hang on

894
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,640
American whiskey

895
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,200
Praise whiskey

896
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,060
There is no slack in England

897
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
There is too much conspiracy influence everywhere

898
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,780
You know from the underground station to the point where I got here

899
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,840
I appeared on, I counted them as I got off the train

900
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:38,920
I counted 50 security cameras between there and when I got here

901
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:44,800
There are five, there are five security cameras in the street outside this club alone

902
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,160
They were looking at you

903
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah

904
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,560
You don't have to watch, you don't have to watch Big Brother on TV

905
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,260
You're living it right now!

906
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,340
Big Brother now!

907
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,820
You're not even safe in your own homes

908
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,040
How, when was the last time any one of you

909
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,840
Bought a PC or a Macintosh

910
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:07,600
And bought one of those rinky dinky little webcams

911
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:12,400
And you stick it on the top of your PC and you think this is so fucking cool!

912
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:18,580
One day you will not be allowed to switch that camera off

913
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,580
They're watching you now

914
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,700
And you don't even know it

915
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,720
That's the truth

916
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,400
Praise Bob!

917
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,240
Praise Bob!

918
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,820
The trick is to get

919
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:33,740
The trick is to get into the system

920
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,860
But not trying to change it, no

921
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,280
Trying to use it

922
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,360
They have made it so complicated

923
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,360
That they can't control it anymore

924
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:50,500
So the conspiracy has lost control over their own system, man

925
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:55,700
You go in there, you find the right, not...

926
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,900
How would I say it?

927
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:02,680
The small places, you know, the dark corners

928
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,540
And you just get into the dark corners

929
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,300
And you find things, you know, and you do things

930
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,600
And then everything goes right, man

931
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,920
You follow the path of less resistance, you know, but...

932
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,160
Just from dark corner to dark corner

933
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,800
Getting deeper into the system

934
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,400
And then you prey on them, you know

935
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,720
They are hunting for you, they hate you

936
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,900
But you prey on them and they don't even know it!

937
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,600
It's very good!

938
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,260
It's...

939
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,980
It's worth it, I mean...

940
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,480
I think you have the answer, yeah

941
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,620
That's the way I do live, actually, yeah

942
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,500
Yeah, you're right, that's the way I live my life, yeah

943
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,860
Yeah, that's the...

944
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,880
They try to make you feel bad, you know

945
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,800
And they make you angry

946
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,560
And you grow this anger inside, you know

947
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,860
And each time they make your anger grow

948
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,380
From the far reaches of the universe

949
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,100
They think they are winning

950
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,440
But that's wrong

951
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,420
Because you use that anger

952
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,740
And the next time you have to do something

953
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,700
You use that anger to get on

954
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,720
And keep on fighting more

955
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,620
You know, and the most...

956
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,040
Fuck you

957
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,960
The more they fuck you

958
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,760
The more you fuck back, you know

959
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,120
Yeah, but I prefer to take their shit

960
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,440
And turn it into something good, you know

961
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,400
That's what I like to do

962
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:31,740
Yeah

963
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,680
I just take their shit

964
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,380
And fucking feed it back to them

965
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:34,880
Yeah

966
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,960
And fucking...

967
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,460
And they don't even know it

968
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,080
Yeah

969
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,060
And they like it

970
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,940
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about

971
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,400
But I didn't have the words

972
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,620
But if you show them that it's shit

973
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,900
They don't want it

974
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,320
But if you feed it to them

975
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,660
They taste it and they go

976
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,620
Oh, we like this shit

977
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,640
This shit's nice

978
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,180
Yeah

979
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,620
But if you tell them that you're doing that

980
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,560
It doesn't work

981
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,660
So Bob is the subgenius

982
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,220
Because he's the guy that understands the way it works

983
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,220
Under the covers

984
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,100
Under the...

985
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:02,640
Underground

986
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,780
I'll tell you what man

987
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,700
Fuck Bob

988
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:05,780
Yeah

989
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,760
Fuck off that bus

990
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,800
Look, what a bastard

991
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,140
I hate you

992
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,340
You're not just tapping into their subconscious

993
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,900
You're just getting into their hormones

994
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,520
You know, into the biological level

995
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,380
You just speak to them and you create

996
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,380
What you want them to believe

997
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,840
Man, those pigs are shit

998
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,980
But they're good shit

999
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,060
And their money's green

1000
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:33,920
Yeah

1001
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,820
Their money is green

1002
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,400
Oh yes

1003
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,960
If you don't love Bob

1004
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,580
He'll Bob you out

1005
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:47,680
As was bespoken by my actual daughter Sivit Stang

1006
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,680
That's not who we were listening to

1007
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,920
That was Reverend Slita

1008
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,740
From Italy

1009
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,060
At the Euro Devival

1010
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:58,120
But my daughter Sivit Stang

1011
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,000
Is now her next here

1012
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:03,080
At a family event called X Day Eve

1013
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,180
On X Day

1014
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,520
I'll see the saucers coming

1015
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,820
And all I need is Bob and me

1016
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,260
Forever and forever

1017
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,540
But until

1018
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,140
I spend my thirty bucks

1019
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,060
I'm just running to myself

1020
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,940
And not too far

1021
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,240
And although

1022
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,660
I know that I am screwed

1023
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,040
Still I say

1024
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,620
There's a day of pain

1025
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,800
I love Bob

1026
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,140
But when the rapture's over

1027
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,520
He'll be gone

1028
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:58,580
The earth will be in ruins

1029
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,340
Without him

1030
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,660
The world around me changes

1031
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,420
The conspiracy is everywhere

1032
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,400
The malls are full of pink boys

1033
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,340
I love Bob

1034
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,680
But every day

1035
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,220
I don't spend

1036
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,260
That thirty bucks

1037
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,660
I'm only just pretending

1038
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,560
But I'm not sure

1039
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1040
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1041
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1042
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1043
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1044
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1045
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1046
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1047
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1048
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1049
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1050
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1051
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1052
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1053
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1054
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1055
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1056
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1057
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1058
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560


1059
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,500
Without me

1060
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,900
Bob's world will go on burning

1061
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,060
Our next year Bob will have this light

1062
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,720
That I'll never know

1063
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,760
I love Bob

1064
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:48,040
I love Bob

1065
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,360
I love Bob

1066
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,020
But only

1067
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:56,580
On my own

1068
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:01,800
I'll find myself

1069
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,760
Now don't get us wrong

1070
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,440
God loves you

1071
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,500
God really does love you

1072
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,660
But Bob

1073
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:10,400
Bob wants you

1074
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,620
God loves you

1075
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,200
But old Bobby

1076
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,320
Old Bobby wants you

1077
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,020
And he's gonna find you friends

1078
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,100
You can't find yourself

1079
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,740
You think you're gonna find yourself better than Bob can

1080
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,840
Are you that prideful

1081
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,500
I tell you what friends

1082
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,900
I'll find myself

1083
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,560
When they pry me out of my pocket

1084
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,560


1085
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,560


1086
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,560


1087
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,560


1088
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,560


1089
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,560


1090
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,560


1091
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,560


1092
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,560


1093
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,560


1094
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,560


1095
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,560


1096
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,920
my cold dead fingers.

1097
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,540
So follow that

1098
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,720
Pied

1099
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,160
Piper

1100
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,680
out of Conditch

1101
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,140
to glorious

1102
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,580
Dobstown, friends. But you can't

1103
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,520
just talk about it like I'm doing

1104
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,140
up here. You have to do it.

1105
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,400
You have to actually do it. You can't be a chicken

1106
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,600
shit. So build your own ship

1107
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,420
and evacuate

1108
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,440
or vacate the

1109
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,680
evacuation chamber, goddammit.

1110
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,240
This church

1111
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,220
of the subgenius, sure it's a joke

1112
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,220
sometimes, but why can't it

1113
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,100
also be the one true religion?

1114
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,260
This is the divinity

1115
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,380
school of hard knocks

1116
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,200
my friends, and it actually

1117
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,480
is as real as it gets.

1118
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,340
As Dr.

1119
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,160
Legume said, we

1120
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,360
will lead this damn nation

1121
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,900
to damnation.

1122
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,240
And as

1123
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,240
Princess We Are Doe

1124
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,720
said, we are

1125
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,480
good

1126
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,620
but we're our own

1127
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,200
brand of good.

1128
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,140
So friends, in closing

1129
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,060
I want to get off here and get

1130
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,940
some slack myself. I have

1131
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,900
refrained from taking any

1132
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,900
drugs until five minutes

1133
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,040
from now. But in closing

1134
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,020
I want to reiterate, friends

1135
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,880
when you need

1136
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,920
slack, you make your

1137
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,980
own slack. Make your own

1138
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,500
slack and build your own ship.

1139
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,920
Bob Dobbs is not the

1140
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,460
answer and neither is Bob Dobbs.

1141
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,740
There is anything else.

1142
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,740
You must learn

1143
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,400
to think for yourself.

1144
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,900
Only Bob can show

1145
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,560
you how. And friends,

1146
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,740
the last thing, the most important

1147
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,720
thing of all, fuck them

1148
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,700
if they can't take

1149
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,100
a joke.

1150
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,380
And praise Bob

1151
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,600
the I.I.I.I.

1152
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:18,860
Happy

1153
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,640
X Day. Bob

1154
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,880
bless y'all. If I don't see

1155
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,820
you no more in this world, I'll meet

1156
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,700
you on the next one. And don't

1157
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,040
be late.

1158
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,460
Maybelline,

1159
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,880
why can't you be true?

1160
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,320
Oh, maybelline,

1161
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,820
why can't you be true?

1162
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,440
You don't start back doing the things

1163
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,800
you used to do.

1164
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:45,200
Woo!

1165
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,660
Choose now, our time is

1166
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,000
here.

1167
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,480
It's my time.

1168
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,140
I've taken my place on a new

1169
00:52:59,140 --> 00:52:59,780
frontier.

1170
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,960
I look at my

1171
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,980
hands and I never look back.

1172
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,780
A bid adieu and

1173
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:11,500
close the

1174
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:11,900
hatch

1175
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,320
That should be me.

1176
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,220
Floating in space

1177
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,800
on your TV screen,

1178
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,200
with practices

1179
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,020
That's your baby

1180
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,280
New American dream

1181
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:35,340
Two weeks in the sea of tranquility

1182
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,940
And consideration of whatever available evidence, however puzzling,

1183
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,920
we too, beholding the Dobbshead alone,

1184
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:51,020
putting aside, for the first time,

1185
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:55,060
being all vulgar hillbilly superstitions

1186
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,040
about grotesque, improbable childhood miracles

1187
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,700
or multiple sexual organs in unusual places,

1188
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,100
can infer, like Baron Cuvier,

1189
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,700
all that we need to know,

1190
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,600
ex-engry people,

1191
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,160
from the evidence,

1192
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,640
that simply by staring intently

1193
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,380
we are waiting for the end of the world.

1194
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,860
The exes to come in there,

1195
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,160
going to land,

1196
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,160
they're going to take us away

1197
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,460
and treat you bad.

1198
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,640
When we leave are the dust and the

1199
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:33,560
the electronic rays from the back of our spaceship

1200
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,040
to fry almost everyone who's left

1201
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,780
and your pain will feel like

1202
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,700
nothing but laughter to us

1203
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,240
while we fly through the heavens

1204
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,780
and lift our hearts in joyous wonderment.

1205
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,100
The name of God

1206
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,960
begins playing out in the world.

1207
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,000
The sex gods,

1208
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,300
the sex goddesses,

1209
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,540
and the sex goddesses.

1210
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,320
The sex goddesses.

1211
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:57,860
That's where I'm going to be,

1212
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,660
is hanging out at the harem of the sex goddesses

1213
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,440
with the squids.

1214
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,880
You and about five million other guys.

1215
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,780
Yeah, but I got first in line.

1216
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,540
You know, they got,

1217
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,980
a long time ago,

1218
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,460
when they gave out numbers

1219
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,060
for who was going to be in line,

1220
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,640
I got picked number one.

1221
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,680
I got number one.

1222
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,220
Let's get started.

1223
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,140
The end of the world has begun.

1224
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,960
We can see the lights off in the distance.

1225
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:20,980
Where you are, you are.

1226
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,260
I mean, in the line.

1227
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,940
We can see the lights of the,

1228
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,940
now some people might say it's the rising sun,

1229
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,020
while others have said

1230
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:31,920
it's nothing but competing solar flares

1231
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,560
and gigantic, hideous hydrogen bomb explosions.

1232
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,660
Gigantodons and

1233
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:38,860
happening simultaneously

1234
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,880
shall populate our future world.

1235
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:41,840
uninterruptedly.

1236
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,880
They shall interrupt our lives.

1237
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:44,200
Continuously.

1238
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:48,920
But I must interrupt with this important message, friends,

1239
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,960
on how to get to the real life.

1240
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,480
Theевидians won't make it on time.

1241
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,840
I am bones.

1242
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:09,200
The whole universe lies below.

1243
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:09,380
And Elon Musk won't discover his results

1244
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:14,120
For me to built a beautiful dream

1245
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,120


1246
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,800
Klaus.

1247
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:14,800


1248
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:14,800


1249
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:14,800


1250
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:14,800


1251
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,960
The moon inventes the gathering of emanations with Irakshara.

1252
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:18,860
Where it's an enormous earthquake.

1253
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,620
Using petroleum at its großes.

1254
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:25,120
That's stang at subgenius.com

1255
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,920
if you want to email me or e-mail me.

1256
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,560
Friends, in the background, this is DK Jones,

1257
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:34,560
great instrumental, Hirosaki, praise Bob.

1258
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,500
Friends, we've got to get off this world.

1259
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,340
We could get rich.

1260
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:54,540
Rich, rich beyond our wildest dreams, my friends,

1261
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,680
if we use the power of the X's.

1262
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,620
We could spend the money to take the gold,

1263
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,320
to use the wretches.

1264
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,580
Friends, Bob could bring you asteroids

1265
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,720
that are flying mountains of stainless steel

1266
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:11,360
and precious metals like gold and platinum.

1267
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:14,660
Or they could be balls of supercarbon

1268
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:18,720
and complex organics that could get you so high.

1269
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,580
A whole asteroid.

1270
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,360
A whole asteroid all to yourself

1271
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:25,460
for only $30, my friend.

1272
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,460
Dobs can make your veins like chicken wire.

1273
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,140
It can make your balls like those cobalt balls

1274
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,060
in that bomb there.

1275
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:37,960
Do you realize that one single Dobs-type

1276
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,080
near-Earth object would be worth trillions

1277
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,200
in today's market?

1278
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,600
It would be so valuable, it would change the market itself.

1279
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,280
This is your chance to get on the ground floor

1280
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,340
of a lucrative old cult.

1281
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,580
Now, while rates are still low.

1282
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:53,580
Now, now, now.

1283
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,540
Still, still, only 10 cents.

1284
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,500
And one little sniff of that little mutated ball

1285
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,260
will make you so high

1286
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:04,260
that you will never, ever, ever, ever come down.

1287
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,520
One molecule from the ash of Bob's pipe

1288
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,700
in the same room as you

1289
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,880
will make you so high

1290
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,540
that you can never imagine coming down.

1291
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,400
One glance from the beautiful eyes

1292
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,240
of the beautiful,

1293
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,760
Bob totally frees an enlightened spirit

1294
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,620
and makes Jizzle go in the pants.

1295
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,520
The perfect love of Bob is the essence of the isness

1296
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,800
of the personification of this universe

1297
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,560
and all the other universes all taken as a whole

1298
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,180
in one perfection.

1299
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:47,060
That is like one atom of Bob's brain

1300
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:48,660
for one nanosecond.

1301
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:49,560
Think!

1302
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,180
If you could be part of his wallet.

1303
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:57,420
Bob will spay your parents.

1304
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,980
He will make you fly like a mosquito.

1305
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,160
He will build a tiny fort

1306
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,320
for within which you and your friends

1307
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,880
can pretend to live

1308
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,780
or at least look at for a period of three minutes.

1309
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:12,640
God is...

1310
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,280
God is incapable of...

1311
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:15,980
God is...

1312
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,040
Bob's is more...

1313
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,440
He had never...

1314
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,300
He...

1315
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:19,380
He...

1316
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:19,540
He...

1317
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:19,540


1318
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:19,540


1319
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:19,540


1320
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:19,540


1321
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:19,540


1322
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:19,540


1323
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:19,540


1324
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:19,540


1325
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:19,540


1326
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,660
He will make you free.

1327
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,080
He will let you pee.

1328
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,980
To truly, truly let go

1329
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,460
and really pee

1330
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,740
like you've never, ever peed before.

1331
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,200
This is what Dobbs could bring you.

1332
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,060
He loves you so much.

1333
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,300
You won't just make water.

1334
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,920
You're going to be making hydrogen and oxygen

1335
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,840
that you can actually resell

1336
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,220
at a very, very large margin of profit.

1337
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,540
Bob's not going to...

1338
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,640
Bob's not going to let you go out there in the wind

1339
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,560
like one of those crazy rain sisters

1340
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,480
or complete the puke monster yourself.

1341
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,840
No, you've got to...

1342
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:00,240
His bladder is so full of love.

1343
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,000
For you.

1344
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:01,720
For you.

1345
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,400
For you.

1346
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,980
And that power.

1347
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,020
That...

1348
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:07,300
Power.

1349
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,380
Of that magic thing.

1350
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:12,260
You know what Bob has?

1351
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:13,040
He has.

1352
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,900
He has that magic thing.

1353
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:15,260
He has it.

1354
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:15,840
It's called...

1355
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:16,980
What's it?

1356
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:17,500
Slash.

1357
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,520
Not sloth.

1358
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,040
Slash.

1359
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,060
Not sloth.

1360
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,400
Slash.

1361
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:22,480
Slash.

1362
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,920
Don't you need more slack, my friend?

1363
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,760
Get off my head, you slacker.

1364
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:27,760
I'm tired of looking at you.

1365
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:27,880
Look.

1366
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,400
You're not the only guy in this foxhole.

1367
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,240
The Jerrys are coming.

1368
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:33,840
I travel in the dark.

1369
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:38,960
Thanks you for your tiny spark.
