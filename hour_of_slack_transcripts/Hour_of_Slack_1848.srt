1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,100
1, 2, 3, 4

2
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,140
I look mad

3
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,100
I look flat

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,580
And that's the evening go

5
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,900
Sunday morning, are you feeling the hope?

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,580
You're hurt all over and you're moving so well

7
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,380
People, here's something that you should know

8
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,040
Tune us in on the radio, die

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,980
We can't wait to see you again

10
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,640
We got charisma, we got style

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,320
Well, people, we'll make you feel better for a while

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,960
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

14
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,220
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

15
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,980
Family doctor says you're just fine

16
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,380
But you feel so down all the time

17
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, people, you don't have to worry

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,320
Just drop us a line

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,340
Send your money in

20
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,220
On the double

21
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,520
Don't worry, it's deductible

22
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,160
Well, people, you can forget your sins

23
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,760
Forget your troubles

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,740
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

25
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,920
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,340
If you're feeling lonely and confused

27
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,140
And you don't know what you're to do

28
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,860
And there's no candle left to burn

29
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,320
And you don't know which way to go

30
00:01:59,340 --> 00:01:59,600
There's no time

31
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,260
We can help you out

32
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,220
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

33
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,320
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

34
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,980
Put your hands on the radio

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,180
Sunday morning and you're feeling low

36
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,680
You're hurt all over and you're moving slow

37
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,840
Well, people, here's something that you should know

38
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,540
Tuning in on the radio dive

39
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,140
We got charisma, we got style

40
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,720
Well, people, we'll make you feel better for a while

41
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,360
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

42
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,320
Put your hands on the radio

43
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,600
Put your hands on the radio

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,820
Put your hands on the radio

45
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,920
Put your hands on the radio

46
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:28,400
That song by the Pink Boys was the first real song composed for the Church of the Subgenius

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,240
long before we had any actual radio shows.

48
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,880
The lead singer, songwriter, and rhythm guitarist for the Pink Boys

49
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:43,700
was my late and former best friend since high school, Monty Dooge,

50
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,320
also known as Deacon Lamont Duveau, also known as Dr. X,

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,560
which name is right next to Philo's and mine under Bob's name in the Book of the Subgenius.

52
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,480
Because Monty was originally part of the team,

53
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,380
when it was just the...

54
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,420
the three of us in 1978, 79.

55
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,700
Sadly, he got disgusted with the church and me for numerous reasons,

56
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,420
most of them sordid on his part.

57
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:16,000
I refused to indulge in some of his really, really bad habits with him,

58
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,640
and also the church got much more famous quicker than his band did.

59
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,380
In fact, he dissolved the band after less than a year.

60
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,200
He was so angry at the record business,

61
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,420
for not recognizing his genius,

62
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,820
which he really had, but hey, you know,

63
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,280
it's not what you know.

64
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,860
Anyway, he was originally an extremely funny and talented guy

65
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,420
and wrote great songs.

66
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,460
He died of alcohol poisoning at age 39, long ago.

67
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,380
I may have been the only friend of his who told him that was going to happen,

68
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,980
which probably proves I was indeed his best friend.

69
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,180
Anyway, he had a daughter.

70
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,880
He had a father that he didn't know about and this woman only recently learned

71
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,340
the name of her biological father, Monty,

72
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,800
and the only references to him all led back to me and the church.

73
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,760
This week I spent some time assembling all my recordings and home movies of Monty for her.

74
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,780
And I thought, it's high time we did a Monty Duge Doctor X special.

75
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,020
So I collected some of the better recordings of a few of the Pink Boys songs

76
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,380
and also the only known type of him doing subgenres,

77
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:35,300
Genius Preacher shtick, which all ended up in our Media Barrage No. 4 cassette tape from 1980,

78
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,500
one of the ones that was never released as a CD.

79
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,280
So this show is mostly the middle of Media Barrage No. 4,

80
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,560
with Pink Boy's songs also interspersed appropriately.

81
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,620
Here is the song Pink Boy, recorded live.

99
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,480
The problem in America today is humanism.

100
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:56,960
Humanism, as Pastor mentioned, is when we become like God, to replace God, and we dethrone God.

101
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,900
We begin to live for ourselves and become lovers of ourselves more than lovers of God.

102
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,460
Oh, Bob, oh, Bob, oh, Bob, give me food, give me money, give me food, give me everything, Bob.

103
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:17,340
Oh, Bob, give me some food, give me some money, give me some food, give me some clothes, give me pills, give me some food, give me some clothes, give me some pills, give me some calls.

104
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,820
Oh, papaditos, oh, papaditos, oh, papaditos.

105
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:30,040
As shown in this diagram, the surface is actually the roof of a 150-story apartment building which encompasses the earth.

106
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,860
The future's treasures are housed in countless numbers in each of these identical levels,

107
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,820
which contain the five types of reality to be found.

108
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,960
The corridors, work areas, metroplexes, holograms, and of course the units for eunuchs,

109
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,540
which these content people call home.

110
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,000
Humans need not worry about getting lost on the way to their units.

111
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,160
They end up at a different unit each night, but it still looks just like home.

112
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,880
All are cleverly designed exactly alike.

113
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,020
Well, you guys need something with the timer.

114
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,460
How cool would that be?

115
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,060
In a final, the real condition is to keep me cool.

116
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,640
Yes, barbecue, but I'll heat it cool.

117
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,200
Some would you cool with a jacket on too?

118
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,880
Just can't decide what I want to do.

119
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,060
Hey, hey, I've got an apartment complex.

120
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,320
Here at the apartment complex.

121
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,380
I've got an apartment complex.

122
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,920
Here at the apartment complex.

123
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,540
Now!

124
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,180
I've got an apartment complex.

125
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,680
Here at the apartment complex.

126
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,360
I've got an apartment complex.

127
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,140
Here at the apartment complex.

128
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,880
Now!

129
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,560
Oh, I know you like to live in the complex and mail it.

130
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,280
Tell your brother it's so easy to see.

131
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,660
The part of life is such a curse of rage.

132
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,920
Well, you could make it here on the middle of the range.

133
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:43,960
Ooh!

134
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,380
Ooh!

135
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,500
Ooh!

136
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:45,820
Ooh!

139
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,060
Ooh!

140
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,180
Ooh!

141
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:53,260


142
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:53,780
Ooh!

143
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,260


144
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,660
Ooh!

145
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,020
Ooh!

146
00:11:59,840 --> 00:11:59,840


147
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:00,260


148
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:00,960


149
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:01,600
Ooh!

150
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,160
Ooh!

151
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,160


152
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,840

153
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,440
Ooh!

154
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,440


155
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,440

159
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,460
ooh!

160
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:07,460


161
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:07,460


162
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:07,520
Ooh!

00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:07,520


164
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:07,520

00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:07,520


173
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:07,620
Ooh!

174
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:07,620


175
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:07,620


176
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:07,620


177
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:07,620

Ooh!

191
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,200
Hey!

192
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,160
Ooh!

193
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,480
Ooh!

194
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,700
galera

195
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,280
My friends come over and they think it's so fine

196
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,980
But they don't know that none of it is mine

197
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,320
No furniture, no color TV

198
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,980
None of my belongings belong to me

199
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,720
Police, I'm left to retreat, I cut my flag

200
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,460
Cause I owe it to some man I made through the bank

201
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,880
Hey, hey

202
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,400
I've got an apartment complex

203
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,080
Here at the apartment complex

204
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,840
I've got an apartment complex

205
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,080
Here at the apartment complex

206
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,000
I've got an apartment complex

207
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,620
Here at the apartment complex

208
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,340
I've got an apartment complex

209
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,060
Here at the apartment complex

210
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,500
Oh!

211
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,160
Each human shares his spacious total living unit

212
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,060
With a different life

213
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,440
With a different life

214
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,300
And each individual%.

215
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,620
The apartment complex Bueno

216
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,260
A study is done all night

217
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:19,360
And forget the

218
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,520
The apartment complex

219
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,100
I said I fell asleep

220
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:34,240
시 years after this accident!

221
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,880
I rest saya pe Français à la fois

222
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,340
I don't think at all

223
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,880
I'm watching the TV

224
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,820
And it makes a fool out of me

225
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,280
Watching the TV

226
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,140
And I don't have to worry about me

227
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,820
When I'm watching the TV

228
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,220
I tune in as soon as I get home

229
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,440
I grab myself a beer

230
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,340
The signal's always right online

231
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,440
The picture's sharp and clear

232
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,460
I don't really care what song I'm gonna watch

233
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,540
I'm gonna watch it anyway

234
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,880
Some people think that I'm not too good

235
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,980
I don't care what they say

236
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,460
I'm watching the TV

237
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,440
And it makes a fool out of me

238
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,880
Watching the TV

239
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,800
I don't have to worry about me

240
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,380
When I'm watching the TV

241
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,380
And I don't have to worry about me

242
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,180
Look, there's an old bogart movie

243
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,700
A thriller in black and white

244
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,440
Well, I don't care about tomorrow, girl

245
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
I'm gonna stay up half the night

246
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,060
I'm watching the TV

247
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,020
And it makes a fool out of me

248
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,560
Watching the TV

249
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,560
And I don't have to worry about me

250
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,060
When I'm watching the TV

251
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,780
I tune in as soon as I get home

252
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,020
I'm gonna get on the cable on a cable

253
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,140
10 channels and a video

254
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,440
And that's not enough for a dollar a night

255
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,160
It's out

256
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,160
Ladies and gentlemen, please, your best friend

257
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,900
Oh, Larry, I'm watching chips, you know

258
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,920
It's all in the family

259
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,260
Sorry, girl, I can't go out, you know

260
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,920
I gotta watch a little movie

261
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,520
It's on the TV

262
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,460
And it makes a fool out of me

263
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,040
Watching the TV

264
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,780
Watching the TV

265
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,040
And I don't have to worry about me

266
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,660
When I'm watching the TV

267
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,660
And it makes the fool out of me

268
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,200
Watching the TV

269
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,140
And I don't have to worry about me

270
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,720
Watching the TV

271
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,420
Watching the TV

272
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,220
I'm watching the TV

273
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,840
Watching the TV

274
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,780
Watching

275
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,620
I'm watching, watching, watching, watching

276
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,820
Watching, watching, watching, watching

277
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,780
Watching, watching, watching, watching, watching, watching, watching, watching, watching, watching, watching, watching my face

278
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:06,780


279
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,940
Watch TV!

280
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,800
The TV variety show has been declared an endangered species of any waste material.

281
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,920
Also sold separately, Nerf hoop, Nerf ball, and Super Nerf.

282
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:05,760
And I have chosen you, Mr. Beale, to preach this evangel.

283
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,140
Why me?

284
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,300
Because you're on television, dummy.

285
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,540
He's a blank.

286
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,500
Waiting for the final finished face to be stamped onto it.

287
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,640
But whose face?

288
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:34,240
In a concurrent life, you share a spiritual bond with...

289
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,020
Your mental eye.

290
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,640
Yeah, your mental eye.

291
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,720
As we term it in our complicated cult jargon,

292
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,680
is permanently enjoined to certain fictional characters.

293
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,880
Or characters that are real on Earth, too.

294
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,520
The parallel Earth that operates alongside of ours.

295
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,100
I see.

296
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,880
We are quite certain that you are qualified to do the good of the world.

297
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,460
We're getting as qualified as we can right now.

298
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,860
Oh, what?

299
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,180
Hello? Are you there?

300
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,920
Are you okay?

301
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,740
There's something wrong with the machine.

302
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,700
There's something wrong with my TV.

303
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,560
What happened to my TV?

304
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,980
My TV broke again.

305
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,200
Oh, my TV.

306
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,680
When you have a TV set in your home,

307
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,900
you're in for a lot of surprise-filled evenings.

308
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,280
And a lot of expense.

309
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,800
But if...

310
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,340
Weren't you and I talking about smell-o-vision one time?

311
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,380
When they had smell-o-vision?

312
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,040
Yeah, they used to have...

313
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,300
I mean, some guy was passionate about that.

314
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,600
Ah!

315
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,620
Then they had a hawk...

316
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:37,940
Hocko-vision?

317
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,160
Hocko-vision.

318
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,180
Yeah, or liquid-vision was what it was.

319
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,280
Like whenever any liquid thing was going on.

320
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,180
A flood scene.

321
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,720
Yeah.

322
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,540
Water would splash out of the screen.

323
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,100
But the nearest thing they could get to...

324
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,240
You know, even if a bad guy would spit, you know...

325
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,260
Yeah, or a waterfall or rain or anything like that.

326
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:53,500
Yeah.

327
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,600
But the nearest thing they could get to it were these real crude little squirt guns

328
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,740
mounted on either side of the TV set.

329
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,280
Yeah.

330
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,340
And whenever it would happen, it would just kind of squirt a little stream out of it.

331
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,740
Well, when they did it in theaters, they had...

332
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,260
I mean, they had to completely...

333
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,600
A little weak piss stream.

334
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,980
Instead of giving you, you know, glasses or something, special glasses,

335
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,840
they gave you a whole rubber suit.

336
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,360
And there were a lot of lawsuits when that happened because of the, you know,

337
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,300
electrocution.

338
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,060
All this water running through theaters.

339
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,220
You got people sitting there and electric lights next to them,

340
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,340
killing them and stuff.

341
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,120
Them were lean years.

342
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,820
But, you know, anything to draw the audience is a way for the TV.

343
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,640
The only way you could make a buck in the movie,

344
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,240
is let's do...

345
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,160
Have a new gimmick.

346
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,080
A new gimmick, yeah.

347
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,060
Some, you know, like...

348
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,820
Man, she was cute, man.

349
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,080
Huh?

350
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,180
That 360 degree movie film they had.

351
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,420
And I believe if we ever cease to pray and cease to seek God,

352
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,920
God will destroy this country.

353
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,220
And I believe I'm going to live to see cities in America,

354
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,040
cities in this nation literally instantly destroyed.

355
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,740
I believe I'll see it soon.

356
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,220
You can keep your eyes on some West Coast cities.

357
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,040
And you watch.

358
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,480
I'll guarantee you when the majority of our population

359
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,240
begins to turn their back on God

360
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,480
and begins to try to tell us that a perverted lifestyle is a normal lifestyle

361
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,320
and they have no time or tolerance for God,

362
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,860
focus your attention and you watch

363
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,920
because I promise you God will not continue

364
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:33,340
to leave that city, that people, without judgment.

365
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,440
But Zord knows that within...

366
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,160
within five years, the United States, as we know it, will cease to exist.

367
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,600
Friends.

368
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,820
And we'll all be, you know, scrounging for our livings.

369
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,120
Um...

370
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,300
You out in the country, thousands, millions will die.

371
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,640
Probably the Russians will come in and take over.

372
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,380
And... and what will be left?

373
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,200
And... and probably the... the subgenius of our nation will have to go underground at that point.

374
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,780
Oh, yes, indeed. We know that it will.

375
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,480
We know that we will... we are on the upswing now that... that soon Bob will have thousands,

376
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,020
thousands of followers.

377
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,240
And many of them will be false followers but... but... uh...

378
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,560
but it's all part of the plan.

379
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,100
And... and of course, then, the things, the secrets will come out and... and the... uh...

380
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:23,120
some of the... the stories about the... the young girls and what was done to them by some of the special hierarchy members.

381
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,160
And... and I won't mention who but I think many of you know who were talking about.

382
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,080
Uh... will... these... these scandalous things will be brought out by the conspiracy.

383
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,640
Yes, but Bob... Bob plans it this way. Not just Bob, but...

384
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,460
the... the... the... spiritual things. But, for all those who are following this... uh... will continue with their lives. Ok.

385
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,900
the entities you know the special the people that run the luck plane and they aren't people but

386
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,760
anyway i'm i'm getting off i'm getting in the spirit you know it's like bob's gonna bob's gonna

387
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,540
let it all go underground and only the the true subgenius this is the way we'll know

388
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:56,640
it's like it's like a brand the ones that stay and cleave into bob he can tell whether you're

389
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,660
still thinking you can be talking can you can be you can be serving a conspiracy in your daily life

390
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:09,560
but in your spiritual life if you're serving bob he's going to know and which um bob mentioned in

391
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:16,620
the communication not very long ago one of his memos praise deacon i can i can get off in the

392
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:23,560
spirit and get all lost he can do he knows bob i mean to him it's this is i mean you just witness

393
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:29,560
how how how the how the deacon can talk of of knowing bob like like he was just a friend like

394
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,640
an ordinary friend i'm sorry mr uh deacon

395
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:38,240
go ahead and deacon do you know deacon devoe that's right well you know we especially these

396
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,020
special sounds that we add in here they're they'll uh you'll hear these sounds later friends yes

397
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:50,380
but um but bob mentioned in a memo which he he sent um one of his many of course

398
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,460
that and the one thing that bob cannot afford himself

399
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,440
and uh the subgenius foundation of course needs to provide and and i'm all for it i think

400
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:08,840
it would be a wonderful thing for bob is the uh command jet for the end times which would be just

401
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,620
like presidential command jet um which the president would get into in the event of a

402
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:22,600
nuclear war and um he says communications links to all the armed forces etc well bob's bob's plane

403
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:30,000
would have exactly the same thing um but would also be equipped with with every kind of radio

404
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,460
it's got it's got

405
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:39,060
the override tv transmitter so that the subgeniuses who survive the end times can still

406
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,340
hear from bob and the rest of the subgenius ministry that's right the entire subgenius

407
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:50,640
ministry will be in this plane um and friends on the end times i mean you can be carrying that

408
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,160
subgenius minister's card with you but if that envy is what counts on that card if you're not

409
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,320
really part of the power of bob then then i tell you that the end times you're going to be

410
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:31,640
having a have it be their favorite因为

411
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:31,640


412
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:31,640


413
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:31,640


414
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,720
stop them missiles right in the middle of the air or he can let them fall where he pleases

415
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,620
and and bob doesn't even need to direct them because because they're being directed by

416
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,360
forces that well i won't say they're bigger than bob but

417
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:55,060
they they work in the same way that bob works very important after the holocaust for um

418
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:05,720
for the subgeniuses that remain to obtain inspiration from bob the right people have

419
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:12,640
got to be there when when the angelic host descends yes and we and we're telling you that

420
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,420
date right now remember that date is july 5th 7 o'clock in the morning 1998. i have some figures

421
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:25,040
here on um on the cost of of the plane um looks looks like 42 million dollars

422
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:31,560
million dollars for the plane equipped the way it should be 42 million dollars friends they spend

423
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:37,140
they spend 42 million dollars just on the on the on the on the movie stars for one movie

424
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:43,240
and uh looking at our charts here i see that oh this is the first time that that we've mentioned

425
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:49,920
this to the actual public but uh just from word of mouth since we had this memo from bob we've

426
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,040
already raised seven million dollars towards the plane so um that only leaves sort of a

427
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,040


428
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,600
$35 million to go and of course when this when this tape gets out when this radio ministry

429
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:05,740
goes out to all of the subgenius all the thousands of ministers all over the world in different

430
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:11,440
languages plays on the 248 radio stations around the globe then i'm sure it will be no time

431
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,740
whatsoever that we uh that we get the other 35 million dollars and the command plane will be

432
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,860
ready for the end times and friends we want you to know that i mean bob's got his plane up there he's

433
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,040
got one plane up there that he bought with his own money he could MIKE threatening, Battallo killed the next president, Hunter Sednaиш, вт 9-11-16

434
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,660
He could spend that $42 million with, he could write that check to mine.

435
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,740
He wouldn't feel it.

436
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,200
I mean, he wouldn't even have to write it down.

437
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,800
He can't bounce a check.

438
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,920
Bob can't bounce no check.

439
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,520
There's no such thing as bounce back on Bob.

440
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,600
But you see, it's not, that's what we're saying here.

441
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,580
It's not just the dollars.

442
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:50,620
It's the power from you that you communicate to Bob.

443
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,820
You bridge it to Bob.

444
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:56,060
And it comes back a thousandfold, a million, billion, jillion fold, friends.

445
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,900
I mean, that power's going to come back, and he's going to be up in that plane,

446
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,820
and he's going to hold that button down at the right time

447
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:07,300
when the special message comes through to him.

448
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,120
And you're going to be protected.

449
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,180
You're going to be in a little bubble of your Bob self and your Bob gland

450
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,720
and all the tribulation money that comes real to you.

451
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,700
And it'll hold up the big barrier while you watch those around,

452
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,220
that you never did love and care for because they hurt you.

453
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,420
And they made all the nice people, the nice guys and the nice girls and the wise guys,

454
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,560
they made them come in last in the races that they made.

455
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,640
They made them come in last.

456
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,640
And now, friends, you're going to be the last ones.

457
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,520
That's right, you're going to be the last ones, but you're going to be laughing.

458
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,180
You're going to be the last laughers left to laugh at all the frying and flesh

459
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:50,560
and spitting up of blood and all the people rolling around

460
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,800
and they'll be calling for their jobs.

461
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,780
And the demon Jesus and no friends of fighting Jesus is going to be standing by you

462
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,220
and he's going to be fighting off them radiation rays for you.

463
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:05,260
He's going to surround you and the special friends of the fighting Jesus

464
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,640
and all of Bob's friends.

465
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,920
And we'll be up in that plane with Bob, too, and we'll be thinking of you, friends.

466
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,660
We'll be thinking all you ...

467
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:20,560
... people that we know are going to be there at the end times when 1998 comes

468
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,800
and the angels sing.

469
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:27,800
host comes down, we're going to be the ones that stand up and say hello and come on in.

470
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:34,120
Of course, we should explain the reason why Bob cannot just outright buy the plane himself

471
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,360
is because the federal government has tied up all of Bob's money.

472
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,060
They won't let him release it on the economy.

473
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,720
And the reason for that being that it would cure all the economic problems that we have

474
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,240
at the moment.

475
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,580
That's right, and friends, and you know they don't want that to happen.

476
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,760
If they wanted that to happen, there'd have been different people up there running for president.

477
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,560
That's right.

478
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,160
It would have been Deacon Duvaux, it would have been Dr. Drummond, it would have been

479
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:09,900
even somebody small and nothing like the tiny children and they'd be president now if it

480
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,160
wasn't for what the conspiracy wants to happen to our money and your money and they want

481
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,140
your money to be meaningless because they want that mark on your head, they want it

482
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,960
on your hand, they want it implanted where you can't see it.

483
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,540
But that.

484
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,000
And the way that the Reagan points at you and it knows whether you got the credits of

485
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,120
government special credits and yeah, Bob is going to be working around that.

486
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:35,440
The federal government has impounded or put a freeze on all of all of Bob's assets in

487
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,440
the banks and his gold reserves and silver holdings.

488
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,280
Just like just like the Iranian money.

489
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:48,840
Of course, they have no reason to do this to Bob except for the fact that they're trying

490
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,600
to keep down the public.

491
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,780
They don't want the economy.

492
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,800
They want the economic problems solved.

493
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,320
Well, it's it's almost like an honor what they're doing to Bob.

494
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:02,060
It shows what a threat he is to their their dirty system and dirty system control from

495
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:07,500
from God knows where overseas under the sea, over the atmosphere.

496
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,800
We have a commercial coming up that we need to go to.

497
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,340
That's right.

498
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,060
I'm afraid our time is running out and we thank you for the donation.

499
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,340
We're going to do a prayer right quick.

500
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:20,520
Oh, Bob and the fighting Jesus, we're talking to you now and we can feel coming through

501
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:20,940
in the spirit.

502
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:28,160
And we know there's a lot of a lot of special laid up members and people with genetic things

503
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
that are all different.

504
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,160
And and they're they're needing to feel the power of you.

505
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,840
And they got some of them got tumors, some of them got cancers and some of them got got

506
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,700
got things in their brain that won't go out.

507
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,940
And some of them see little bitty men everywhere that they don't think are real.

508
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,820
But we know they're real and we want you to make them feel right with all of this.

509
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,500
And we really have to go now.

510
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,680
But if everyone will stay tuned, we have the break.

511
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:50,920
And we'll be right back.

512
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,240
And then we come back for the second hour of the show, which goes out to many different

513
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,900
cities.

514
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,160
They pick up on the second hour.

515
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,780
So so just stay tuned.

516
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,800
And then, Bob, you're hearing us.

517
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,040
Jesus.

518
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,020
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

519
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,220
And fighting Jesus, Bob and killing them, Bob and more than dead people.

520
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,200
And it'll be OK because you remember where I remember where Bob is.

521
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:10,880
That's your.

522
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,320
Oh, my God.

523
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:13,400
Oh, my God.

524
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,580
Oh, my God.

525
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,380
Oh, my God.

526
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,600
Oh, my God.

527
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:16,760
Oh, my God.

528
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:16,880
Oh, my God.

529
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:16,900
Oh, my God.

530
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,200
Oh, my God.

531
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:34,760
Oh, my gosh.

532
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:34,760


533
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:34,780
No, I'm I don't know where my happened.

534
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:34,780


535
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,200
So a little bit.

536
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:36,900
Okay.

537
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:36,900


538
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,920
So like this is a nosebleed, right?

539
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:40,920


540
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:40,920


541
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:40,920


542
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,060
I'll take mine and go back.

543
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,060


544
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,060


545
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,060


546
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,060


547
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,060


548
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,060


549
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,060


550
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,140
And I got better.

551
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,000
And how, everybody, who need not be mine?

552
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:44,520


553
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,140
Is ready, but we're going to try.

554
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:46,680
Oh.

555
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:56,240
I love to feel the blood that Bob makes me pump through my brain because the drugs and oh Bob, I like it.

556
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,560
What if somebody isn't really good with throat noises? Will you still take their money?

557
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,800
We do not require proof of subgeniusness at all.

558
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:10,940
We often find that we're able to, once they join up, we're able to get them off to one of our subgenius retreats,

559
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:16,380
change their diet, start feeding them propaganda, repeating the same thing over and over again until they forget who they are.

560
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,000
And start responding only to our dogma.

561
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,540
But it's all real. It's really real. It was really, really real at the time we were there.

562
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:32,180
The communications are wide open. We can hear everything coming down that pike, coming our way.

563
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,740
And we like to be on the radio and talk to all the boys and girls that are all out there.

564
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,740
We're letters and keep them cards and letters coming, girls.

565
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,440
And send pictures of yourselves, if you know what I mean.

566
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,140
Because we need more girls.

567
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:52,960
And bring your rich fathers and we'll convince them that we're not really that weird and we can get some money

568
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,120
and really make him a lot more money because we're a modern mystical business family.

569
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,420
Marvelous. The smell of success is never too sweet.

570
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,780
We can help you out.

571
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,680
I think we're being sold a bill, a big bill of goods.

572
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,040
And it's just astounding.

573
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,700
Well, when you're young, they told you at school all that crap off about the golden rule.

574
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,400
Trying to make you such a good little different, didn't they know?

575
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,220
The night sky's never when you're running so hard over.

576
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,720
You never take a dare when you roll the wire and never see some fair.

577
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:43,240
I say, don't say that's good enough for this night sky, I wasn't thinking Sly Guy.

578
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,660
I was thinking Sly Guy, I wasn't thinking Sly Guy, I wasn't thinking Sly Guy...

579
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:46,660


580
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:46,660


581
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:46,660


582
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:46,660


583
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,540
I was saying it last, last, last, last, last, last.

584
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,540
Well, you take your flowers and you tell them that you love her.

585
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,840
And she says you're gonna call her.

586
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,880
She doesn't even bother.

587
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,200
And you sit around and wonder what the hell you did wrong.

588
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,540
It really doesn't matter.

589
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,980
Chris is off with another man.

590
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,260
You try and you try to make it all right.

591
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,580
She just says you're not her type.

592
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,180
But boy, you should have learned a long time ago.

593
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,460
You love that woman never that hard.

594
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,720
So what's the night, guys?

595
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,740
Guys, I was seeing this.

596
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,260
Guys, I was seeing this.

597
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,680
Guys, I was seeing this.

598
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,420
Last, last, last, last, last, last, last.

599
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:11,320
Well, preach and preach yourself

600
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,620
You gotta be good

601
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,840
And follow our rules

602
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,000
Like we said you should

603
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,340
And you try and you try

604
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,580
To be an honest man

605
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,740
But they'll stab you in the back

606
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,200
And you'll change

607
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,040
It's a fake hand

608
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,240
It feels like crime

609
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,460
It feels so evil

610
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,740
And it's so cheap

611
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,900
And it's so mean

612
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,340
And they didn't tell you

613
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,380
That the last one can

614
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,740
All they want

615
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,960
Are hard-earned kids

616
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,020
And nice guys

617
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,600
Always finish nice guys

618
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,120
Always finish nice guys

619
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,360
Always finish nice

620
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,180
Nice guys

621
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,800
Always finish nice guys

622
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,980
Always finish nice guys

623
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,320
Always finish nice guys

624
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,300
Always finish nice

625
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,200
Thanks man

626
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,920
Thanks margot

627
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,340
Thanks

628
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,020
Thanks

629
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,040
Thanks

630
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,060
Thanks

631
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,080
Thanks

632
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,100
Yeah

633
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,040
Yeah

634
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,140
Yeah

635
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:25,140


636
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:25,140


637
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:25,580
Yeah

638
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:25,580


639
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,040
Yeah

640
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,040


641
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,040


642
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,080
Yeah

643
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,100
Yeah

644
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,100


645
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:27,460
Yeah

646
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:27,580
Yeah

647
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:27,600
Yeah

648
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:27,600


649
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:27,600


650
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:27,640
Yeah

651
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:27,640


652
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:27,640


653
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:27,640


654
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:27,640


655
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:27,640


656
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:27,640


657
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:27,640


658
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:27,640


659
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:27,660
True

660
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,220
on their tape machine so they can take that dollar bill out of their pocket and hold it

661
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,760
by one end above the machine that they're listening on, whether it be the radio or the

662
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,200
tape recorder.

663
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:04,060
Hold it there on one end with two hands, right, one grasp on each corner, and hold it above

664
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:09,420
the machine, and you'll notice that it bends down and points towards the radio.

665
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:17,220
It will point down towards the center of that machine, right, where the real power is meeting

666
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,400
the wires, and it's all coming together.

667
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:26,420
It's coming out of the reality of the physical world and turning into the spirit world, and

668
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,160
there's a bridge there, and Bob can help you make that bridge to where the physical world

669
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,640
don't no longer mean nothing to you, and that dollar bill won't mean nothing to you, and

670
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,700
friend, I'm telling you that in five years, that dollar bill ain't going to mean nothing

671
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,400
in the world.

672
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,120
In the spirit world, the physical world, or the mental world to anybody.

673
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,380
It doesn't mean anything now.

674
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,700
It means very little.

675
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,900
It can mean a bottle of beer for some lost individual.

676
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,960
It can mean a cigarette or two.

677
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:56,440
It can mean enough gas to get you back home from the gas station, sure, but I tell you

678
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,620
what, when that tribulation money starts coming down, you're going to find out that those

679
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:07,420
little green pieces of paper made by the clones in Washington, the people that aren't people,

680
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,400
they're making that stuff, and it ain't going to happen.

681
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,100
It's going to be worth nothing.

682
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,140
You can't sleep on it.

683
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,560
You can't burn fires with it.

684
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,840
You can't stay warm with that.

685
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,200
You have to have too much of it, but I tell you what you don't need too much of, and that's

686
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,560
the word of Bob.

687
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:25,140
Yeah, what's all this kind of stuff that y'all are talking about?

688
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:33,180
Is it the new way of people's lifestyle, or is it something from the past that y'all

689
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,100
have been bringing up?

690
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,420
Well, we try to...

691
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,920
Our sources are really numerous.

692
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:47,420
Bob, our guru, has read an awful lot of cheap paperback books, cheap sci-fi stories.

693
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,500
He's written a few of them.

694
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,540
He has written a few.

695
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:55,700
He's got a new book out called Sleeping for Fitness, by the way, and he pretty much tries

696
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,300
to wrap up anything we read.

697
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,140
He applies a subgenius-like meaning to it.

698
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,180
It's really easier than you would think.

699
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,400
No matter how obscure a subject matter is, it seems...

700
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:13,660
It seems to fit right into the cult somehow or another, with only slight changes.

701
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,480
Oh, that's in the same category, then, as, like, the pet rock that you used to go buy

702
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,280
in that department store and all, right?

703
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:20,780
That's right.

704
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,760
That pet rock thing was the closest thing we've seen yet to the perfect money-making

705
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,660
formula, and we're trying to duplicate that same sort of thing.

706
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,700
Ah, huh.

707
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,480
Well, that's pretty neat.

708
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,640
I wish you a lot of luck.

709
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,500
Thanks a lot.

710
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,220
We're getting rich.

711
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,120
We'll see you next time.

712
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:39,400
Bye.

713
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,400


714
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,400


715
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,400


716
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,400


717
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,400


718
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,400


719
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,400


720
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,400


721
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,400


722
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,400


723
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,040
Bye.

724
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,160
Bye.

725
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,580
...spokesman for the church insists they came in under the cover name of United Churches

726
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:53,900
of Florida only after they had been repeatedly harassed when they tried to set up shop in

727
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,100
the open in other cities.

728
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,320
Bob's got...

729
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,240
Bob's got all the special...

730
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,920
The special medicines and the herbs and the...

731
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,080
And for every, uh...

732
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,940
And the sanctified pills and...

733
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,760
For every pamphlet order that...

734
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,120
Which we get, we, uh...

735
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,660
We distribute four pamphlets for free.

736
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,700
That's right.

737
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,660
Many of these pamphlets go to the people in Haiti.

738
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,460
You know that in Haiti there's children starving

739
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,860
and there's a false prophet running things down there.

740
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,220
Some of these pamphlets go to lost...

741
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,500
The Cuban airdrops.

742
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,880
That's right, the false Cubans.

743
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:32,100
And they fly over Cuba and drop thousands of pamphlets.

744
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,720
And they go to the homosexuals, friends.

745
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,640
Oh, use me, Jesus, use me.

746
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,700
Before the Antichrist, the mark of the beast takes over.

747
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,600
Save that soul close to hell.

748
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,000
Fail believers with the Holy Ghost and fire.

749
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,680
That one is sick.

750
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,160
I command that blindness, deafness, sugar, diabetes,

751
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,140
high blood pressure, stroke, cancer, arthritis, hemorrhoids,

752
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,420
every disease to come out, body, gut, the pits, whip, lung, jeez, the stain.

753
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,740
I say in the name of Jesus Christ, rise up and walk.

754
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,380
God put money in that empty purse.

755
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,520
Don't ever let them be broke again.

756
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,400
That one again, my ministry today, God, I'm going to command on Isaiah 45.

757
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,960
11, give it back to them.

758
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,340
104, bless their home, their bench, their farms, their cattle.

759
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,780
Everything they're having, let it take a touch, let it be blessed.

760
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,400
I felt the warmth of Jesus.

761
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,680
I want to heal the soul, Lord, yes, I'm healed.

762
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,820
Oh, yes.

763
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,800
You know you're healed.

764
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,680
Oh, I better, I feel better.

765
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,860
Yes, Jesus.

766
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,880
Oh, Lord.

767
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,680
And everywhere I spread my seed, I know I'm leaving a little bit of that gland of Bob,

768
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,160
that gland that we all carry.

769
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,560
And you can bring out.

770
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,520
That gland, the more of these special little Bibles and little translations we have

771
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,840
that are the only translation.

772
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,960
And they'll bring out that Bob gland in you that will make success come your way.

773
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,280
It will change the way the luck plane works for you.

774
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:59,080
I mean, the way the patterns and the special formulas and the way it all works in the universe,

775
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,380
the way it's all put together in a special mathematical way by who knows what all.

776
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,960
And no one can decode it, but we can sure.

777
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,360
Make it work our way if we just cleave to Bob,

778
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,580
cleave to the words of Bob and the foundation that's trying to help Bob and his ministers.

779
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,500
You cannot help Bob without helping the ministers of Bob.

780
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,100
Woo-hoo-hoo! Praise the Lord!

781
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,260
It feels all right.

782
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:28,920
Oh, yes.

783
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,900
Put your hands up. Praise the Lord.

784
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,420
A bottle of anointing oil from overseas.

785
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,040
There's no charge.

786
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,440
And it's sacred.

787
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,500
I don't feel like making any charge, but it'd be worth a lot to you.

788
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,400
Anoint your doorposts that no plague can come your dwelling.

789
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,560
This is for protection, and this is for prevention.

790
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,280
So ask right now.

791
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,660
The oil represents the Holy Spirit.

792
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,920
And I want you to keep this bottle of oil.

793
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,120
It's anointing oil.

794
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,000
Anoint yourself when you need a ministry.

795
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,760
Anoint your loved ones when that needs to be healed.

796
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,540
So I'm not going to take up a lot of time, but you'll need it.

797
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,540
And alas, it's for Jesus.

798
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:07,860
And the Lord has come.

799
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,860
A bottle of olive oil.

800
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,120
Anointing oil from overseas.

801
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,200
Friends, it's not just...

802
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,920
You can be holding that dollar bill.

803
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,800
You can be holding the radio.

804
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,920
You can be feeling the power.

805
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,980
But that's just a tip of the iceberg to what it feels like when you put that dollar in an envelope.

806
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,560
And you put your address on one corner.

807
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,640
And you put that special address, the sacred box number.

808
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,360
Here it comes again.

809
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,200
Have you got a pencil?

810
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,020
It's the Subgenius Foundation or Church of the Subgenius.

811
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:34,900
Or just say Bob.

812
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,200
Just say anything.

813
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,620
And right there.

814
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,100
And you put that check to the Subgenius Foundation.

815
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,680
And that address is P.O. Box.

816
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,220
807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

817
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,680
I mean, Bob has been moving in Dallas for a long time.

818
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,460
He's helped our ministry here.

819
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,600
And he's spreading it out.

820
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,700
It started in Texas.

821
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,980
That's where it first went public.

822
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,860
He's been with all the politicians.

823
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,160
And the crooked politicians, too.

824
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,200
And the honest politicians.

825
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,000
And all of them.

826
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:16,940
And I noticed, speaking of the Chrysler Corporation, which Bob has been working with, trying to pull them out and help them get out of their debt.

827
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:22,220
Hallelujah for Bob and all the workers that are employed by the Chrysler Corporation.

828
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:27,220
They make Chryslers and Dodges and Plymouths.

829
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,540
And I believe Bob just left now that Chrysler is just about back on their feet again.

830
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,600
Of course, Bob was instrumental.

831
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,500
And if you've seen Frank Sinatra.

832
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:44,160
And all the celebrities that are now doing commercials for Chrysler Corporation.

833
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,420
Bob was instrumental in getting all of those people to come and do commercials for the Chrysler Corporation.

834
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:56,200
He also arranged the federal loan money to the Chrysler Corporation to keep their head above water.

835
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:03,500
I think it's really admirable that there are so many people employed, still employed, these days.

836
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,920
And we're making a wonderful American product.

837
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,220
Oh, Bob.

838
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,040
Thank you for this message.

839
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:07,900
Thank you.

840
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,220
The American people can drive an American-built car.

841
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:17,240
And Bob was so instrumental in helping work towards that.

842
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:23,740
Oh, friends, I ask you, what is America if it's not the very spirit of Bob?

843
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,980
America at its best.

844
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:31,000
When America is standing on its feet, you're seeing Bob work miracles in the whole country.

845
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,240
He's working it through the big men behind the big oak desks.

846
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,200
That's right.

847
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,580
He's the one man working on that plant.

848
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,600
And he's bringing it all together.

849
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,740
I mean, he's changing.

850
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,580
America is not going to get pushed around anymore.

851
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,200
So that we do not lose our republic.

852
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:48,520
You remember, friends, if we lose our republic, the whole world goes down the tube.

853
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:52,240
Because where will the good people come from if they don't come from America?

854
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:22,180
They'll work for America.

855
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,460
Within our country.

856
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,540
Everything is wonderful here.

857
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:25,540


858
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:25,560
And every day we celebrate what we do with the freedom we hold.

859
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,300
And that means helping people andtheir children versus what's northwest.

860
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:27,440
Women are the king of our society.

861
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:27,460
Pop권 will fight for America.

862
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:27,460


863
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:30,420
Iraq will Rubne has been brought into power into the hands of the Christians.

864
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,280
And the essentials costs for America.

865
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,260
guerra medal Juan Carlos errara

866
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,960
The crowd's cheering for me

867
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,000
I wanna be a football hero

868
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,920
I want to be on the cover team

869
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,520
All my friends will be talking about it

870
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,020
I'd be a star if there's no doubt about it

871
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,880
With my life such a drag

872
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,220
I wanna be a football hero

873
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,060
So man

874
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,440
Well I'd be so highly respected

875
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,300
For my football play abilities

876
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,880
I'd give autographs and interviews

877
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,740
And those stories in the newspaper about me

878
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,420
There's commercials on the television

879
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,220
With running through albums

880
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,620
It's like O.J. Simpson

881
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:22,640
Oh I wanna be a football hero

882
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,040
I wanna be a football hero

883
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,040


884
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,720
I wanna hear the crowd cheering for me

885
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,720
I wanna be a football hero

886
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,640
I want to be on the cover team

887
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,340
All my friends will be talking about it

888
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,800
I'd be a star if there's no doubt about it

889
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,820
With my life such a drag

890
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:41,000
I wanna be a football hero

891
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,040
So man

892
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,520
The sound of the crowd is so enticing

893
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,800
Oh the thrill of it all would be so exciting

894
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,760
To see it live

895
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,900
Life's been so boring lately

896
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,200
The days gone by and they're all just the same

897
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,500
I go to work and I come home

898
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:21,780
I go to work and I come home

899
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:21,920
I go to work and I come home

900
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,180
It's just another faceless dream

901
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,440
Life could be much more intriguing

902
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,480
If I could just make it in the big leagues

903
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,520
Oh I

904
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,080
Wanna be a football hero

905
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,160
I wanna hear the crowd cheering for me

906
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,360
I wanna be a football hero

907
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,160
I want to be on the cover team

908
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,820
All my friends will be talking about it

909
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,320
I'd be a star if there's no doubt about it

910
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,040
With my life such a drag

911
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,520
I wanna be a football hero

912
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,420
Oh the thrill of it all would be so exciting

913
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,040
Yeah

914
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,600
Thank you.

915
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,440
Thank you.

916
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:21,780
Thank you.

917
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,040
Really great songs.

918
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:58,640
But it did sound, he did sound like he was trying to sound like Elvis Costello.

919
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:07,660
And right about the time that the subgenius pamphlets were getting attention from our heroes, like Robert Crumb,

920
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:13,340
the Pink Boys got a response from Ralph Records to their demo album.

921
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,760
And that's the Residence Records label, right?

922
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,760
Yeah, yeah.

923
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,320
Ralph Records was the cool, and they said, we listen to your tape and it's really good,

924
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,100
but don't you feel you owe an explanation to Elvis Costello?

925
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:31,580
And the other, the guitar player and the drummer laughed their asses off, thought it was hilarious.

926
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:41,800
But Monty was so offended by that, that he broke up the band and swore he would deny the world his greatness.

927
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,620
On account of what this, what's her name at Ralph Records had said.

928
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:49,620
Well, you know, if I can say it, if they can't take a joke, you know what we do to them in the church.

929
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:49,840
Well, that's the thing.

930
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,720
I mean, exactly.

931
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,040
Exactly.

932
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,520
You've got to have a bit of a thicker skin.

933
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,500
I know.

934
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,420
To get into the goddamn music business.

935
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,120
Give me a break.

936
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:58,180
Right?

937
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:58,680
Come on.

938
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,620
That's shark territory.

939
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:01,920
Well, there are all these.

940
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,960
It's like getting a dick sucking to get off on next day, man.

941
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,020
Jesus.

942
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,360
All these trigger issues.

943
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,760
By the way, you've seen Trigger's stuffed self, haven't you?

944
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:10,600
And the Roy Rogers.

945
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,800
What is the Trigger sign, by the way?

946
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,600
You never did.

947
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:19,300
Well, he had taxidermist prepare his beloved mount, Trigger.

948
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:20,580
You knew?

949
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:20,820
Yeah.

950
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:22,600
Roy Rogers and Trigger.

951
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:30,060
The Pink Boys did some great covers like Paint It Black, Glad All Over, and Love Potion No. 9.

952
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:38,780
As far as I know, the only recordings of those songs were made by me in Dallas clubs and parties using a boom box that would record on cassettes.

953
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:43,900
But among the ones that are recorded okay, I have a favorite.

954
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:44,960
Here it is.

955
00:52:50,720 --> 00:53:20,700
Love Potion No. 9.

956
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:37,820
Love Potion No. 9.

957
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,040
Love Potion No. 9.

958
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:31,940
Love Potion No. 9.

959
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:37,580
Love Potion No. 9.

960
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:49,900
Love Potion No. 9.

961
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,820
He can take away Algorithm

962
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:13,460
Secret fulfilment

963
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:17,700
Ladies and gentlemen, they're killing me right now.

964
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,920
I'm taking away your heart.

965
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,280
Lying on the river one day.

966
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,680
Lay down a bomb in your family's neck and feet.

967
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,400
Well, don't let the robbers slip.

968
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,540
Well, kids can't pursue me, Sidney.

969
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:47,540
I'll tell you a little to see the money.

970
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,360
A secret.

971
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:55,360
And you and I, and you and I,

972
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,280
they're killing me right now.

973
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,500
I'm taking away your heart.

974
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,600
They're killing me right now.

975
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,080
I'm taking away your heart.

976
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,460
I'm taking away your heart.

977
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,920
I'm taking away your heart.

978
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:41,820
I'm taking away your heart.

979
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,660
I'm taking away your heart.

980
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,380
I'm taking away your heart.

981
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,100
I'm taking away your heart.

982
00:58:42,260 --> 00:59:04,500
Out into the

983
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:22,440
Thank you, Monty Doge and the Pink Boys.

984
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:28,660
Sorry how it all turned out, but at least there's still subgenius.com.

985
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,120
Praise Bob.

986
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:35,020
Oh, and this music in the background is Cyber Chump.

987
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,780
Cyber Chump.

988
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,120
Again, subgenius.com.

989
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,100
Praise Bob.
