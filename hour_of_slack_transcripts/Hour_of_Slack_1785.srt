1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
Well, I think it's about time now.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,780
We tipped her, we tipped her, we tipped her...

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,480
He's looking at his watch.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,480
We dipped her with the prairie...

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,700
Dip the prairie squid, did you say?

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,120
I'm ready for some of that.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,280
I'll dip a prairie squid.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,500
Oh, it's that other tape. That's what it is.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,900
Chocolate-covered prairie squid, did you say?

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,740
Yeah, yeah, and that's a recipe that we probably don't want to put in.

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,560
Man!

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,280
Did I just wreck your computer there?

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,720
Oh!

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,700
I just stepped on his guitar, folks. It's been a long day.

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,960
Let's try going to the phone.

16
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,820
What a clumsy ox. You're going to pay for that.

17
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,680
Every cent should be calculated and taken against your account.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,080
I hope you're satisfied.

19
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,420
What do you have to say for yourself?

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,540
I hope you're...

21
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,020
Sense.

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,780
Well, with the surviving populace clinging tenaciously to useless routines

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,340
in hopes of retaining that one last tiny vestige of sanity,

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,420
you know, the least necessary and most superfluous aspects of society,

25
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:22,880
such as bureaucracy and red tape, will remain in place down to the final possible moment.

26
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:23,980
Mm-hmm.

27
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:32,280
And the deorgasm, popped-out, depleted mankind-ordnance of the de-unruptured subgeniuses

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,460
will be left to handle the machinery of state or snakehood.

29
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,640
Shane, look out!

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,540
The subgenius powerhouse.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,400
What?!

32
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:23,980


33
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:53,980


34
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:23,980


35
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:53,980


36
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:23,980


37
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,240
I'm tired of that cosmic version.

38
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,020
I'm tired of that cosmic stuff.

39
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,920
I am, too.

40
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,300
I'm into the just down-to-earth bacon and eggs, meat and potatoes...

41
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,060
Rubbing sandpaper all over your nipples and your chest and your...

42
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,480
Yeah, good old... good old-time prairie-squid-loving...

43
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,440
Coffee and lemon pie.

44
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,940
That's oil and oil.

45
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,700
Sure.

46
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,660
Oil?

47
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,500
Yeah.

48
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,540
I just forgot.

49
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,140
You know, coke buh... peanuts and Coca-Cola of old days.

50
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,940
Goobers and chomping on your... chomping on yourself.

51
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:54,540
Yeah.

52
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,540
I'm sick of plastic cards.

53
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:05,140
I'm sick of pulling up behind gas stations and punching into, like, little concrete monoliths

54
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,580
and having pieces in Unix...

55
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,200
Yeah, me too.

56
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,260
Yeah, I'm sick of it.

57
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,960
I hate that stuff.

58
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,540
I hate that stuff, and I hate when people pull up behind you in some monstrous vehicle

59
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,560
that was never meant to be, fueled by beings which may or may not have existed based on

60
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,960
someone's own Freudian preclusion.

61
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,120
Shit.

62
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,680
Or some Velikovsky nightmare.

63
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,540
When the whole time we could be space-traveling billionaires.

64
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,000
We could be eating fried chicken in the park.

65
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,700
Yeah.

66
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,560
We could be...

67
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,540
That burns me up, man.

68
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,200
What does?

69
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,920
What you just said.

70
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,500
I can't...

71
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,380
All those dwarfs in the trucks and everything.

72
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,280
Yeah, all the dwarfs in the trucks and the times that...

73
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,360
Hey, you guys sound like idiots.

74
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,080
They're too loud.

75
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,660
We've already...

76
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,920
Yeah, I'm fine.

77
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,520
I don't know what's happening.

78
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:05,540


79
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:05,540


80
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,100
I'll give you my attire to help you stop seem to know what's on your mind.

81
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,480
Okay.

82
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,480


83
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,480


84
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,640
Not again.

85
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:09,640


86
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:09,640


87
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:09,640


88
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:09,640


89
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,220
We head to the point.

90
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,300
Nope.

91
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,540
We'll do it in a minute.

92
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,600
So, look, dude, you don't have any tools.

93
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,120
You don't have

94
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,120


95
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,160
I don't.

96
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,980
He's the true Yeti, son.

97
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,320
Put that thing down.

98
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,000
Put that thing down.

99
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,480
Yeah, it's not funny, man.

100
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,520
Put the gun down, Dave.

101
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,320
It's not loaded, is it?

102
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,420
It's not a real gun.

103
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,460
Look, see, it's a liquor made thing.

104
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,100
That's okay.

105
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,500
Just put it down, Dave.

106
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,160
No, no.

107
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,520
Just come over here and try a chew on it.

108
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,560
It's got lemonade inside of it.

109
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,300
Okay, look.

110
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,240
Awesome, baby.

111
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,860
Just give it a little try.

112
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,660
It's wax, man.

113
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,000
It's made of wax and you bite it and it's got lemonade inside of it.

114
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,620
Right, right, Dave.

115
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,240
That's right.

116
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,940
Do you want some wine?

117
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,720
Would you like some lemonade stuff?

118
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,520
Ma'am?

119
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,580
It's kind of scary.

120
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,280
Just give it to me.

121
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,380
Just give me the keys to the truck.

122
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,200
Huh?

123
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,260
Just give me the keys to the truck.

124
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,780
I'm a guy.

125
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,780
I've been driving so long, I...

126
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,680
What?

127
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,100
It's okay.

128
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,300
There, thanks.

129
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,540
Fits very good.

130
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,040
Now, Princess, we will escort you to your hive chamber.

131
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,280
Do I have to go in there?

132
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:37,980
For reprogramming.

133
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,440
I have to go in the hive thing again?

134
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,660
Just put on these shackles.

135
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,520
But I can't remember all this stuff.

136
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,640
I go in there and I get...

137
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,720
All right.

138
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,080
Be careful, Wally.

139
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,780
I'm going to clamp them on.

140
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,420
Okay.

141
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,720
Oh, my feet.

142
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,340
Do I have to wear these things?

143
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,100
I can't stand that sound.

144
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,360
What's with the guns back there?

145
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,160
Yep, his gun still works.

146
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,680
Too bad about his mind.

147
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,860
It was said that Don Carlos, when he discovered the Emerald Tablet,

148
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,920
had devised a plan where...

149
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,120
All the priests within the immediate vicinity

150
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,540
would come to make out its veracity

151
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,980
to check and to go through various biblical sources

152
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,820
and see if it indeed did indicate

153
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,460
some sort of apocalypse coming in the year 1998.

154
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,460
Eh...

155
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,960
Nostradamus said that from the sky

156
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,640
would come the great king of Jacare,

157
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,240
or could it be...

158
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,020
Perhaps...

159
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,120
Perhaps pronounced Jokery,

160
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,300
or could we stretch it that far?

161
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:51,980
It was...

162
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,200
He predicted Hitler,

163
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,860
though he spelled it Hister.

164
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,720
But yet he said in 1999,

165
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,660
from the sky would come the great king.

166
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,900
Edgar Cayce said that 1998 would be that time.

167
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,500
Would be Jacques O'Dour's time to come back from...

168
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,100
And Jacques Cousteau said that it would be

169
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,540
seven o'clock in the morning on July 5th.

170
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,380
Wearing pampers out on a broad Jamaican sea,

171
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,420
staring scurvy...

172
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:17,660
People used to watch television.

173
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,020
They'd make peanut butter jelly sandwiches

174
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,660
and leave other people alone.

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,660
That's Jacques Cousteau right now.

176
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,680
I thought that was the meteor magnate.

177
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,780
Or the meteor man.

178
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,360
Is that the weather man?

179
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,700
That's Peppy in the background.

180
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,440
I'm home again.

181
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm dreaming.

182
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,700
I think it's...

183
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,320
It's Peppy.

184
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:33,580
Listen.

185
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,700
Wake up, Dave.

186
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,300
Peppy.

187
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,520
Wake up, Dave.

188
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,440
I stepped on Peppy.

189
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,040
It'll be okay.

190
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,180
It'll be okay.

191
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,120
It's just a dream, Dave.

192
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,580
I never had no dog named Peppy.

193
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,900
Your friends are still here.

194
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,240
For me, the Tin Woodsman.

195
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,120
Tin Lizzy.

196
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,660
Yeah.

197
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,180
You're much fatter now.

198
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,040
The Cowardly Lion.

199
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,100
Oh, the Cowardly.

200
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,580
Yes.

201
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:55,920
Yes.

202
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,500
It was only a dream.

203
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,420
That horrible, boring world of trucks and sidewalks.

204
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,000
And sausages.

205
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,440
It was just a terrible dream.

206
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
And banel onions.

207
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,080
You've been here in Oz all along.

208
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:07,920
Oh, it's my...

209
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,140
These flakes on my mouth.

210
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,700
It's so dry.

211
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,180
It's...

212
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,360
I've been here all along?

213
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,680
Yeah, you were just...

214
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,600
You got knocked out.

215
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,780
Well, how the hell did I get knocked out?

216
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,000
When they dropped that house...

217
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,640
What was on your head?

218
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,640
Oh, I thought it was...

219
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,040
When I was arguing with that bitch.

220
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,660
You know what I mean.

221
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,320
Yeah.

222
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,880
Thank God we're safe.

223
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,400
I don't know what his...

224
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,800
Don't I?

225
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,060
Don't I?

226
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,200
What his problem was.

227
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,000
You know, what the hell.

228
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,700
She was giving me some stuff, so I might as well...

229
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,340
Oh, there.

230
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,340
Here it goes again.

231
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,840
Am I in there?

232
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,520
Boy, I...

233
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,620
I think something's missing here now.

234
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,180
This looks like a little teeny tiny room.

235
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,340
Now, how the hell did I get in here?

236
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,860
We've been orbiting the whole time, Dave.

237
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,000
You're still in a little tuna can in space, remember?

238
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,220
It's gonna be another nine months before we get on all the way over to Jupiter.

239
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,660
Yeah, but when do they hatch?

240
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,620
Do we get to get out before they hatch, or we gotta wait?

241
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,080
Oh, you'll know when they're hatching.

242
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,500
I thought I'd be in some kind of hibernation chamber or something.

243
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:14,380
Well, but most people wake up for the last few seconds of their life as the thing is bursting their chest open.

244
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,040
Well, what the hell are we doing this for, then?

245
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,780
Well, you signed up.

246
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,460
You signed up.

247
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,420
The contract is in the computer.

248
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,240
Well, I...

249
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,660
You thought the corporation was a great idea.

250
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,200
You said we should all climb into the little capsule, and we'd get paid.

251
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,780
By the time we got to Jupiter, we'd be paid a million bucks each, and sure enough, we will.

252
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,520
It's just that it's our estate that gets it.

253
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,320
Yeah, but it's just...

254
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,200
Because you didn't read the fine print, Dave, and now we're all stuck here with you.

255
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,880
For another nine months.

256
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,300
What?

257
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,320
Huh.

258
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,340
I never...

259
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:50,480
Yeah.

260
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,060
I was never capable of reading the fine print.

261
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,620
I just...

262
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,820
And you just keep having these dreams and going off into fantasy land, thinking you're back on Earth doing radio shows.

263
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,180
We have to keep nursing that.

264
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,580
And every time I have a dream, how come one of you guys changes?

265
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:13,500
Like, I dreamed my wife was attacking me with a car, and next thing I know, out there I was out in the side room, and some Russian was talking to me, and a woman was attacking me with a car.

266
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,160
Somehow I think you guys were involved in this.

267
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,120
Yeah, and what are you keeping back there?

268
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,440
What's in that big box anyway?

269
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,980
That's our space hyena.

270
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,760
Well, what's the...

271
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,580
Rover.

272
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,100
And it's...

273
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,760
And the...

274
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,620
The scorpion rooster creature that we picked up on Mars.

275
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,660
Well, how come we don't get to lick at him?

276
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,900
You can lick him.

277
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,240
You can lick him any time you want.

278
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,020
Remember what happened last time you licked him, though?

279
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,520
What, the eye socket thing?

280
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,120
Yeah.

281
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,100
Well...

282
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,860
It wasn't easy getting that scorpion rooster barb out of your mouth.

283
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:47,860


284
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,380
I thought you said that was another dream.

285
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,220
Give me a mirror.

286
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,340
I want to see if there's anything wrong with my eye socket, man.

287
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,120
Let me look in the monitor.

288
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,100
You can't look at your own eye, Dave.

289
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,080
Yes, you can.

290
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,440
If I look in the monitor, I can look at my own eye.

291
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,520
I'm not listening to you right now.

292
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,620
What the hell?

293
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,840
I have no eyes in there.

294
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,740
Why don't you calm down and take a stress pill, Dave?

295
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,740
I don't see what difference that's going to make.

296
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,920
Now, I'm looking in there, and I'm not...

297
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,000
Am I hallucinating or something?

298
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,280
I have absolutely no eyeballs in my socket.

299
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,840
Now, this isn't what happened in the eye socket.

300
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,660
And before, usually just like ripped out a chunk of the side of my face.

301
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,540
You can't see your own eyes, Dave.

302
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,100
You can't run from your own legs.

303
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,100
Jayner told you that a long, long time ago.

304
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,920
Yeah, but you can't talk to your own voice.

305
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,440
You can't smell your own nose.

306
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,900
You can't swallow your own throat.

307
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:44,120
If they pull one eye out, just before the optic nerve severs,

308
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,740
that one eye just for one second can look at the other.

309
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:47,820
That's true.

310
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,080
If you carefully...

311
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,840
Is that not so?

312
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,260
That's true.

313
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,520
If you pull it out, and we did this with Jayner.

314
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,160
We pull it out just enough and turn it around.

315
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,940
You have to be very careful turning it.

316
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,760
One eye can actually be seeing the other eye.

317
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,960
But that's not really the point.

318
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,360
The point is, say a one eye, you can't see your own eye with that eye that's seeing.

319
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:14,340
You can see your other eye, but you can't see your eye that is doing the seeing.

320
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,980
You can only see the other eye.

321
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,480
You can look in the mirror, but that doesn't count either.

322
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,440
This is all mere metaphysical...

323
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,580
You can't digest your own stomach, Dave.

324
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,860
Juggling and juxtaposition.

325
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,320
And you can't hide from Bob, because he's stupider than you.

326
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,860
I can't believe that.

327
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,920
No, it's true.

328
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,160
That's the miracle of it.

329
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,740
That's the beautiful thing.

330
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,160
That's why Bob hates you.

331
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,940
I'll be whipped by a miracle whip.

332
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,660
It's kind of dangerous to believe that, Bob.

333
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,640
I didn't want to believe that.

334
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,300
I didn't want to...

335
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:42,860
Careful with that.

336
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,480
You could turn into a frog or something.

337
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,020
You never know by saying those kind of things.

338
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,860
You've got to keep it...

339
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,780
You're entitled to your own opinion and all that.

340
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,760
See, he's talking about the convicts, too.

341
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,740
See, he knows.

342
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,900
He knows.

343
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,020
I was talking about...

344
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,400
Well, when they hurled those convicts at Jupiter, I think that's the kind of thing that'll keep people...

345
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,960
But it will turn into a frog.

346
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,880
It'll teach them a lesson.

347
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,180
When the plutonium lands there?

348
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,820
Well, it's more of a discouragement for criminals.

349
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,480
You know, if they see their...

350
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,060
See, you kill somebody.

351
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,820
You propel them into Jupiter.

352
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,460
Carrying plutonium on your back is...

353
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,920
I think it's a cruel way to execute criminals.

354
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:33,180
I know, but don't you think it's cruel, we, to have people ejaculate into space with plutonium on their backs to ignite a third sun in our solar system just because they might have maybe murdered somebody?

355
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:39,300
Well, yeah, I think that O.J. guy, they ought to shoot him into Jupiter because he's guilty.

356
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,600
I saw it on TV.

357
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,660
Yeah.

358
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,040
I saw B.Y. go.

359
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,040


360
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,140
I saw B.Y. get drunk one time.

361
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,960
Then T.M. got drunk, too.

362
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,440
And then I saw Z.B. got so damn drunk, he shot his old woman.

363
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,120
And then X.M. got drunk, too.

364
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,960
Papa Booey. Papa Booey.

365
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,280
Wow.

366
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,020
Where'd they come up with that?

367
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,760
Sinking like a pop worker into mountains of glass.

368
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,060
Rearranging your furniture like a knife on pork.

369
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,880
We are in search of...

370
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,200
...a man.

371
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,220


372
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,300
At the sound of the falling tree.

373
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,260
And it's midnight.

374
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,120
The witching hour.

375
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:28,860
The witching hour.

376
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:34,720
When some geniuses and lonesome daves come crawling out from under their...

377
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:34,740
The witching hour.

378
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:40,860
...moldering, rotting logs and their damp stools, biting down on the dead bodies of the dead.

379
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:40,860


380
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:40,860


381
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:40,860


382
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,720
Bugs and slapping each other with their long, sticky tongues.

383
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,360
All moist and sleepy.

384
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,800
Midnight.

385
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,680
Midnight.

386
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,780
When those who should not be on the streets are the streets.

387
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,020
It's red light, man.

388
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,300
You idiot.

389
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,620
You almost ran it.

390
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,520
Captain Anvil spit.

391
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,620
Do you have a quarter?

392
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,340
Do you have like a 50 cents or a dollar?

393
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,820
To wash a windshield?

394
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,220
Yeah, can I give you a minute?

395
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,960
Look at this, uh...

396
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,220
Hey, man, I'm like an alcoholic.

397
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,840
I'm really hurt for...

398
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,660
I don't know.

399
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,480
...like a quarter bear.

400
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,980
Can you give me a dollar?

401
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,540
I got it on the right because it's about five and a half years ago and that's why my arms

402
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,860
all bent up like this.

403
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,480
But if I had a quarter, see, then I could probably take it.

404
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,580
It could do this balancing act.

405
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,480
All the best drunks are named Bob.

406
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,800
Bob could take a leak right through your head.

407
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,800


408
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,800


409
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,800


410
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,800


411
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,800


412
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,800


413
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,800


414
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,800


415
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,800


416
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,800


417
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,800


418
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,080
I'm gonna put a leak on it.

419
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,100
I'm gonna put a leak right on that.

420
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,100


421
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
It's gonna come out of this thing and it's gonna be right there on the third rail.

422
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,200
Some guy went over there after Bob took a leak on the third rail and tried to put his

423
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,140
tongue on it and, uh, he went right there and some Bobby, they called the guy, like

424
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,320
a Bobby type, um, you know, and he was...

425
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,920
He had all the claws on and everything.

426
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
He stuck his mouth on it.

427
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,400
I'm gonna be just like Bob.

428
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,880
I'm gonna stick his tongue in my mouth and I'm gonna go commune with aliens.

429
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,520
You know?

430
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:09,800
I'm gonna be a little ape, baby.

431
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:09,800


432
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,660
I hope they just aren't wrong.

433
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm gonna play on that third rail.

434
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:14,620
Huh?

435
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,080
I'm gonna go lay in front of the bus

436
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,160
like I seen Bob do that one time.

437
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,580
Why can't I commune with aliens?

438
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,440
That's the part that's like Bob.

439
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,920
They're figuring out just how we gave our secrets all away.

440
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,580
And Congress has appointed a committee, so they said,

441
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,720
to find out who's American and who's a low-down red.

442
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,460
They called him up to Washington to speak for Uncle Sam.

443
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,060
But when they asked him what they are, they shit up like a clam.

444
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,420
I wish they'd take and put me on the witness stand today.

445
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,060
I'd shout so loud old Stalin could hear me all the way.

446
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,560
I'm no communist.

447
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,580
I'll tell you that right now.

448
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,020
I believe a man should own his own house in Warrentown.

449
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,580
I like in private ownership.

450
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,300
I won't be left alone.

451
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,900
Let the government run its business and let me run my own.

452
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,640
Yes, Bob Dobbs is no communist.

453
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,920
He'd sell you the shirt off your back.

454
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,120
I'm not sure.

455
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,460
So, come with me.

456
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,900
Be proud and honest here with me.

457
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,400
Instead of taking bribes and dressing up their wives in vain.

458
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,880
The taxes keep on going up of that very little town.

459
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,180
But still they just can't take it in as fast as they dish it out.

460
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,680
Our national debt is monster-sized and going every day.

461
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,140
Our children's children still unborn are gonna have to pay.

462
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,900
Our dollar used to be the soundest money on the planet.

463
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:11,080
But now people believe us by one good dollar's worth.

464
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,900
Unless we stop inflation and take care of what's in our pockets.

465
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,940
We promise to make it right and never fire a shot.

466
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,760
At the sound of the falling tree.

467
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,100
Can you tell me a story before I go to bed?

468
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,640
Yes, I can, dear.

469
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,160
I'll tell you a story about the shrinking intellect.

470
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,020
It's about a whole town full of people whose brains got smaller

471
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,300
at one time.

472
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,720
Well, it actually took about five years.

473
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,360
I don't know what started this.

474
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,460
I don't know where it began.

475
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,960
But it reached such a sorry state that people would walk up and down

476
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,240
from one edge of the town to the other, burbling inanities to each other

477
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,580
and sniveling off people they didn't quite dig.

478
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,920
And then, pretty soon, big hunks of their teeth fell out

479
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,340
because the decay had seeped down from their brain area all the way into their mouths.

480
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,340
And next thing you know, the tongues was a-wiggling and they were in pain.

481
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,200
That's right.

482
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,080
They were in some heavy, dark pain.

483
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,660
But the tongues kept a-wagging.

484
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,740
The brain was dead.

485
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,880
The brain had actually atrophied into a piece of lumpage.

486
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,380
Say what?

487
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,900
Another prophetic vision brought to you by WCSB Cleveland.

488
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,840
You'll think it's weird.

489
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,360
Man, I'm glad I got that one on tight.

490
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,660
Now, I heard once that Bob was the queen of sailors,

491
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,220
that Bob actually was a hermaphrodetic, was hermaphrodetic.

492
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:43,180
Oh, Bob has, you know, they say that God has, is everything.

493
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,500
Yes.

494
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,080
Yeah, Bob has already been everything else.

495
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,860
Well, I think it's, you know, when we invited you to come on Gay People's Alliance tonight,

496
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,620
we thought maybe we would talk a little bit about how Bob was androgynous,

497
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,000
and as, then is Bob is God, you know, is that what you're trying to say?

498
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,220
Well, androgynous isn't really the word for it.

499
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,720
It's more like he's all man and all woman all the time, all together.

500
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,480
Well, that's a combo I'd like to be or I have in myself.

501
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,560
He's too much of everything.

502
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,780
Too much, too much.

503
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,160
It's never not enough.

504
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:14,740
Mo Bob.

505
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,460
So, how long will you be in town, and what's with the groovy shirt?

506
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,740
I think that's just beautiful.

507
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,920
That's a beautiful shirt.

508
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,860
It looks like Curly Howard, isn't it?

509
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,580
Yes, it's a Curly Howard, Andy Warhol, Curly Howard.

510
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,500
Oh, I loved Andy Warhol so much.

511
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,660
And yes, he did Curly just before.

512
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,480
Yes, the tragic woman, the tragic woman with him.

513
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:44,060
What was her name, Edie Shrimpton or something, I forget, or Shrimp Pocket, or, but I remember.

514
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:44,580
She was wonderful.

515
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,260
I have a lot of her things.

516
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,020
Now, again, this Bob guy, you're going to be in the Newkirk Mall tomorrow night, riding the ponies,

517
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,440
and you'll be endorsing your Bob or whatever it is.

518
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,940
Oh, I'll be endorsing your Bob, Dave.

519
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,140
Well, we're on the air right now, so.

520
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,500
We'll talk about it later.

521
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,160
We're going to break away.

522
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,920
This is really making me uncomfortable trying to talk this way.

523
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,920
I don't know.

524
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,620
I just, you know, like, I mean, sometimes I can at a party, you know.

525
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,340
If I'm dressed up, if I have the wig and the dress and everything, sure.

526
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,840
But, you know, I'm sitting here with the headphones, and it just, you know.

527
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,340
I know.

528
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,220
It feels, if I'm not wearing a pair of high heels and stockings, I just can't do it.

529
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,720
That's the way I feel, you know.

530
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,000
No, no, you got to be in the mood.

531
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,480
It's more than the mood.

532
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,920
You got to have a certain feeling when you say wig.

533
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,960
Yes, I guess it's just that certain genre that fits sometimes and sometimes it just

534
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,860
doesn't fit.

535
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,280
Yes.

536
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,560
Bill knows.

537
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:37,560


538
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:37,720
Bill.

539
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,200
I mean, Bill's all dressed up.

540
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,140
He's looking good, Bill.

541
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,880
He's looking just like the Princess Wee-Ah-Dow from Queen of All the UFOs.

542
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,320
It's my best costume.

543
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,720
Do you also do Liza Minnellian?

544
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,920
And what's the other one's name?

545
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,480
Did you do?

546
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,760
Yes, I have the Liza wig and the lashes, yes.

547
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,900
And the Connie mask.

548
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,240
And the Merkin.

549
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,740
Yes, oh, well, every woman should have a Merkin that makes her feel just like Connie.

550
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,480
Prescripture's 917.

551
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,100
That is in Prescripture's 917.

552
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,660
There's even a picture in this new subgenius book, Revelation X, of which I have the first

553
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,080
11, most of it, all laid out here.

554
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,440
It looks like you have most of it imprinted on your forehead in a micro-

555
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:29,280
I have it, well, just behind my forehead here in the chapter 4, Mondo Connie, the Gossip

556
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,440
According to Connie Dobbs.

557
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,560
Look at this picture, folks.

558
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,200
Oh, I, I, let's just, let's get like Fiorello LaGuardia.

559
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,940
Take, now describe the three pictures you see on this page.

560
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,000
It looks like a tantric Shiva woman with a million tiny small arms looking at a bald-headed

561
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,680
Mohawk woman and struck by a hammer.

562
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,260
Am I wrong?

563
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:51,140
Well, but the bald-headed Mohawk woman, that's not a Mohawk, that's the Merkin on top of

564
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,560
her head.

565
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:51,780


566
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,500
That makes her feel just like Connie.

567
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,800
And anyone can, can they snap a Merkin on, like, perhaps like a teasy little toupee you'd

568
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,420
wear out to the mall or something on a Sunday?

569
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,740
Or is it, is a Merkin something that's a weed?

570
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,220
If they can just bust free from their chains of inhibition, if they can throw away their

571
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:12,660
wallets and purses, slap that Merkin on top of their head and that underwear around their

572
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:17,760
brow, and just parade through the streets, just flaunt your abnormality.

573
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,420
That sounds like a point of carmination.

574
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,500
Take that hammer and nail that thing right through that organ.

575
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,820
Nail it, nail that sucker, nail it to the table, man.

576
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,440
Ow!

577
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,080
Just show the normals what for.

578
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:28,520
Woo!

579
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,040
That's a point of carmination I think should be mentioned over and over again.

580
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,260
Nail your organs to the floor.

581
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,160
But what exactly is a Merkin?

582
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:41,580
It's not a weave, it's not an implant, it's not Rogaine or some sort of topical solution.

583
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,820
No, a Merkin is a sort of a wig.

584
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,280
It's a, in the Middle Ages, women were often...

585
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,920
Similar to a codpiece.

586
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,200
There were many skin diseases, of course, we didn't have the miracles of modern medicine

587
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:54,960
that we have now.

588
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,500
And women sometimes became bald-headed just like Merkins.

589
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:05,740
And sometimes they became bald-headed in like their armpits, shall we say.

590
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,580
And a Merkin might, for instance, be used as an armpit hair.

591
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,920
Because in those days, of course...

592
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,100
Or perhaps any other part of the body where a hairy part might be needed, right?

593
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,980
You could slap a Merkin perhaps...

594
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,680
Like a forehead in your case.

595
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,600
Oh yeah, yeah.

596
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,460
Or a palm.

597
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,740
I could slap a Merkin in my forehead.

598
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,020
Or a palm, yes, exactly.

599
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,480
But there's a patient...

600
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,140
Is the paste have anything to do with what happens afterwards?

601
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,200
This is not really just a cosmetic Merkin.

602
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,400
This is actually a medicinal, I guess...

603
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,900
Frank Sinatra has to wear one.

604
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,660
I have that at Confidential.

605
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,760
He's got the medicinal blue.

606
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,300
He's got the ice blue Merkin.

607
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,200
Yeah, you can't even tell when he's singing.

608
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,420
No, the ice blue Merkin is doing the song.

609
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,360
And he's just dancing in step.

610
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,000
It's just the bag that's singing.

611
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,580
Well, it's just like with Bob.

612
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,960
It's the pipe that's talking.

613
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,540
It ain't Bob.

614
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,380
He, you know, the pipe is...

615
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,580
Well, I shouldn't say that.

616
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,000
Bob is talking, but the pipe is directing what Bob says.

617
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,640
It's the amplifier.

618
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,580
I mean, it's good.

619
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,720
It's Bob's not doing...

620
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,680
It's not like the pipe is some evil entity that controls Bob.

621
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,000
It's that it amplifies Bob's already powerful slack force.

622
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,340
Is there anything left of the original J.R. Bob's...

623
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,680
Bob Dobbs left?

624
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,580
If indeed the pipe is actually doing the magnificence...

625
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:31,750
The utterances which come out of his foul trap are enough to make you...

626
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:40,830
Well, the autopsy showed that the brain matter was still present, but was interlaced with tendrils of an unknown...

627
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,670
Of an...

628
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,670
And the pipe, they couldn't get the pipe out of his mouth.

629
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,050
Bob had...

630
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:51,350
By the way, the autopsy, Dave, showed that Bob only had one beer.

631
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,270
How many did you have, man?

632
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,090
I didn't have...

633
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:54,930
Just think about that.

634
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:55,670
Jeez.

635
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,310
Was he killed by one beer?

636
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,370
Or was...

637
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,990
Or was it the beer that was talking?

638
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,570
I have what?

639
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:05,790
You have two.

640
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,850
Some people have moles.

641
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,130
But I don't care to discourage about it.

642
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,550
And I don't want to be...

643
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,370
I lost one.

644
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,470
Moles are beauty marks anyway.

645
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,650
Yes, he said with a wan smile.

646
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:23,810
I thought they were like ferrets, the magic-esque creature that crawls from holes.

647
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,350
The magic mongoose.

648
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:25,650
I thought they were like...

649
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,090
Yeah, the merkin was a mighty ferret.

650
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:28,690
No.

651
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:35,970
In the Middle Ages, during the bubonic plague, didn't they put place of ferret on their forehead to ensure some sort of magnetic surprise?

652
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:43,270
Yeah, but the funny thing was that the plague was actually carried by fleas, which were carried by the ferrets.

653
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:50,610
So those foolish medieval people and their silly superstitious medical treatments...

654
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:55,550
I'm sure that our current modern medicine will always seem...

655
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,890
incredibly advanced in future ages.

656
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,350
Why do you think they call it moleskin?

657
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,630
That's kind of a condom, isn't it?

658
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,230
Did I get it?

659
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,430
What?

660
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,550
She said something about moleskin.

661
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,050
I still like to be bled.

662
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,510
I like...

663
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,410
Well, we're all going to be ruptured, I hope.

664
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,570
Maybe that'll be some sort of topical disenfranchisement.

665
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:18,870
Who else but Bob can you trust during the rupture, my friend?

666
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,690
True words were never spoke.

667
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,630
Who will give you that feeling of support, I suppose?

668
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,270
Besides Bob.

669
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,690
Who can hold your guts in...

670
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,250
And...

671
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,790
When they're screaming to get out, out, out?

672
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,390
Yeah, it's been a long night of guts screaming to get out.

673
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:44,810
As a matter of fact, my thorax tried to pop out through the top of the tube.

674
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:48,390
And it's not allowed to go above that little green line there, see?

675
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,290
Your thorax fell into my abdomen!

676
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,610
Wasn't that a joyful collusion there?

677
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:57,350
Your abdomen fell into my thorax!

678
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,290
Say...

679
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:06,910
Say, my cranium was severed by a gigantic septum of some sort.

680
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:12,550
My septum was deviant, and therefore it could not parlance.

681
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,630
It did not learn the correct and the crude.

682
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,410
It... it caroused.

683
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:22,710
It had its day in the sun, and then went to sleep under a distant moon.

684
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:25,650
Wow.

685
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,110
I knew a guy whose, uh, bad septum...

686
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,150
His septum developed a hole in it.

687
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,730
This one guy I know.

688
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:39,110
And he had... he had to have his septum replaced with a plastic plug.

689
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:44,890
But he kept the piece of meat that had been removed from between his nostrils.

690
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:53,730
And hired a... a well-known underground painter, a famous guy, to paint his septum for it.

691
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,490
Paid 500 bucks for a painting of his diseased septum.

692
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,630
And then never picked up the painting.

693
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,390
That was the best part of the story.

694
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:07,550
It was the concept, man.

695
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:13,530
So somewhere in San Francisco... in San Francisco, there's this...

696
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,710
deviant septum.

697
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,270
...this black velvet painting of a septum.

698
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,450
Of a guy's septum.

699
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,150
And it...

700
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,190
It...

701
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,530
It wields a sinister influence, the painting does.

702
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,110
You gaze into it, it's like looking at a picture of Bob.

703
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,690
You just get lost in it.

704
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,550
It's so tiny.

705
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,270
A septum is a very tiny painting to be on.

706
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,810
And also, what would it hold?

707
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,070
Like, perhaps Elvis smoothing a velvet tiger?

708
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,750
He would... yeah, he had...

709
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:44,190
On the tiny septum... the septum was only about an eighth the size of your little fingernail.

710
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,370
Oh, Jesus, less than the Michael Lange.

711
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:50,510
And on that, Paul Mavridis had painted this tiny microscopic picture of Elvis,

712
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,290
as if on black velvet.

713
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,530
Oh, then it was Elvis.

714
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,810
A picture of Elvis doing a sword fight with a bull.

715
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:03,670
Well, I... I like to see Elvis bullfighting pictures.

716
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,330
I had quite a few of them.

717
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,150
I had crying clowns.

718
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,430
I had the tigers.

719
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,550
Did you have the dogs around the bar?

720
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,730
Oh, hell yeah.

721
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,670
The dogs playing poker.

722
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,310
Yeah.

723
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,090
Yeah.

724
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,290
You know, that scene will come true in real life, as...

725
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:17,730
I heard.

726
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,490
...after 1998, when the X's died.

727
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:20,890
Yeah.

728
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:20,890


729
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:20,890


730
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,990
And then, I think, when all of this technology is left on our benighted planet,

731
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:27,770
people will turn themselves into creatures that look like that,

732
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:35,210
and that corny old painting will turn out to be a perfectly ordinary common sight in downtown bars.

733
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:40,790
It's one way to go wandering in Dallas and just maybe clip the turn around into the old...

734
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,690
in Chaffey's Bar or someplace like that.

735
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,750
There'll be people walking around...

736
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:47,390
Eschew with, like, dog masks or just literally full of hair.

737
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,390
No, their face would be... have been genetically...

738
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:56,170
genetically morphed so that they were, in fact, dog-faced old men sitting around smoking

739
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,070
cigars and playing poker.

740
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,890
I was a dog-faced old boy.

741
00:32:59,890 --> 00:32:59,910
And they'll be...

742
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:00,050
You'd be able to...

743
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:00,370
People...

744
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,310
There'll be millions of people walking around.

745
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:07,870
Every city will have dozens of people who look like Kennedy, for instance, or Martin

746
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:08,510
Luther King.

747
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,870
You know, you can look like anybody.

748
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,490
Think how many Elvises and...

749
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,290
Or some guy...

750
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,530
...Michael Jacksons there'll be.

751
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,310
Or some cousin of yours in the Air Force that you never really knew.

752
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:18,810
Yeah.

753
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:18,970
Yeah.

754
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:19,950
That was...

755
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,370
Had his mouth was slightly different than it really was.

756
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,630
You could be...

757
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,090
You can be anything that time around.

758
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:34,230
I think I'd like to look like a kind of a doggish JFK with a little bit of that Bob smile

759
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:34,790
to it.

760
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,390
Well, now, think about it, though, Dave.

761
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,650
This ain't like getting a tattoo.

762
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:39,530
You mean...

763
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,630
It only goes one way.

764
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,510
You're stuck.

765
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,470
But think of the things that teenagers will do to themselves.

766
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:45,810
The things they do now...

767
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,790
Think what they'll be able to do when they can, like, grow up.

768
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:48,790


769
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,390
Grow up into a giant bat devil wings.

770
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:54,630
Or what they can all look like, you know, have pumped up Rambo muscles.

771
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:58,070
Yeah, or can wear clothes that look like barbecue aprons...

772
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,310
Or...

773
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,950
They'll look like the Mitchell and Tyre man.

774
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,870
Yeah, or actual barbecue grills.

775
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,410
They'll be...

776
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,790
They'll be teenagers...

777
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,490
Teenage girls who look just like Snoopy.

778
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:08,870
Peanuts.

779
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,890
Jeez, what a rush.

780
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:10,590
That would be...

781
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,130
And you'd go to jail for that, wouldn't you?

782
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,490
There'll be Garfields walking around on the street.

783
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,890
And there'll be these hideous visages every now and then.

784
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:18,770
There'll be people who look like Snoopy.

785
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:18,770


786
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:18,770


787
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:18,770


788
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:18,770


789
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:18,770


790
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:18,770


791
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,530
They'll be people who look like Bob.

792
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,730
They thought it would be real cute to be permanently changed.

793
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:26,090
Have their facial faces surgically altered.

794
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,870
To have that sardonicus-like grin.

795
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,970
That hideous, rictus grin that would...

796
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,630
And the pipe implanted in their teeth and everything.

797
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:37,850
Their eyes given just that insane glint.

798
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,550
You know, it's...

799
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,230
Yeah, I don't know.

800
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:45,790
I mean, ain't no kind of world for an old man no more.

801
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,170
Well...

802
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:52,990
After this espousal, I can only wonder what kind of surgery you must have gone under

803
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:58,290
to get the pipe-like grin and also some of the weird brain fusions.

804
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,350
Oh, they tell me I was born...

805
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,510
I'm not a joker, man.

806
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,210
I'm an ace.

807
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,630
I want you to understand that.

808
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,010
I can't understand the difference between the cards yet.

809
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,210
I know I'm trying, but...

810
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,150
I'm not a joker, man.

811
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,690
I'm not an ace neither.

812
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,750
It's more like a quagmire I'm lost in.

813
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,650
It's just...

814
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,150
A splattering of 52-dose.

815
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:20,230
I've got different numbers in the deck, and I can't figure out which one to go with.

816
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:25,590
I thought I'd like to be a ten of clubs, but it turned out I was a ten of club foots.

817
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,590
Yeah, that'll get you out of Vietnam.

818
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,810
That got me out of Vietnam.

819
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,350
Why did you want to go there?

820
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,470
Fucking panty waste.

821
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,110
Uh...

822
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:39,450
The post-it states WCSB, and I'm about to tell you what I want to hear.

823
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:45,810
Hey, this is getting more realistic and lifelike.

824
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,150
There's, like, retarded women.

825
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,890
There's retarded people calling me up and talking in my head.

826
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,590
I doubt if we'll ever be able to resurrect these sea monkeys.

827
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,070
Jeez.

828
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:00,990
Look at this one.

829
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,650
It's sprouting a whole new head.

830
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,170
I wonder if I mix this solution back in again.

831
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,270
Maybe some of them...

832
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,850
I could make it take a spore from one of them and reclone the spore.

833
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:14,530
Eh.

834
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:18,790
I'll just go take a nap and write a little report to the committee.

835
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,090
I'm telling you...

836
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,250
Bob?

837
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:23,790
Bob?

838
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,190
I haven't heard the voice of Bob.

839
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:28,430
Bob?

840
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,430
There's just something in the background there.

841
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,410
I can't make that voice out.

842
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,910
I can't make that voice out.

843
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:39,350
Hello?

844
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:50,330
Well, the only thing for me to do on this shift is, well, I gotta remember to call the bathroom.

845
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:55,750
And I gotta, well, remember to eat that stuff they call food.

846
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,950
I can work out again.

847
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:00,670
Yeah, what's that?

848
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,290
I'll go read some more technical manuals.

849
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,830
Take on some more stuff on the monitor.

850
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,330
Hell with that.

851
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,670
I'll try on this Mr. Peanut suit.

852
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:26,050
Yeah, this thing's been laying around for weeks and I haven't had any fun with that.

853
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,530
He's hallucinating the peanut suit again.

854
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,090
We'll have to make note of that.

855
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,610
Tell the psychiatrist.

856
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:38,230
Mr. Peanut used to come to all the fairs and he'd pass out donuts and give favors to the kids.

857
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,370
And bags of peanuts, of course.

858
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,650
I love that monocled eye.

859
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,610
You know what's funny?

860
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:50,230
All of those volunteer, quote, astronauts, unquote, start imagining the peanut suit.

861
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,010
Something about Mr. Peanut.

862
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,410
Do you suppose the Russians had something to do with that?

863
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:59,390
Could they have breached security and implanted the Mr. Peanut fantasy?

864
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,730
Look, he thinks he's Mr. Peanut.

865
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,970
I'm Mr. Peanut.

866
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,210
And if it's not Mr. Peanut, it's Ready Kills.

867
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:08,730
Kill a lot.

868
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,970
Mom and Dad, we enjoyed the opening of the 7-Eleven.

869
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,070
Remember, it's a child's land corporation.

870
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:19,130
It's kind of sad in a way.

871
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,250
Oh, boy.

872
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,990
I'm taller than all the other Mr. Peanut men.

873
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,550
This is a very, very big, important convention of Mr. Peanut men.

874
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,590
I think I'm standing...

875
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,030
Do you suppose his suit is over-medicating him?

876
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:35,770
I wonder if I'd stand up even taller if I would stand up much more from the rest.

877
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,130
But why?

878
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:37,710
Why?

879
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:37,990
Why?

880
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,090
Why?

881
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:38,210
Why?

882
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:38,210


883
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:38,710
Why?

884
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:40,130
Why?

885
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:40,710


886
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,950
Why?

887
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,070
Why?

888
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,370
Why?

889
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,570
Why?

890
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,390
Why?

891
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:52,510
Why?

892
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:53,810
Why?

893
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,210
Why?

894
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:01,950
I'll make a note of it.

895
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,830
We'll have to tell the psychology department.

896
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:07,410
Oh, now I'm blonde, Mr. Potato Head.

897
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:09,270
And now I've got red hair.

898
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,010
We ought to tell the cruelty department, too.

899
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:19,010
They can start implanting evil Mr. Potato Head and evil Mr. Peanuts.

900
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:25,510
No wonder they gave me a shriveled up Mr. Potato Head.

901
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,850
Because now I can scare the little children.

902
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,530
I like this mask.

903
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:36,210
What the hell was that?

904
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,530
There's no welts on the back of my potato.

905
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:45,170
This must be some sort of Stanislaus Lem movie or something.

906
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,410
Anything you think of, it's...

907
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:50,770
Welts...

908
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:55,790
Mr. Tuber costume.

909
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,510
It's the big sweet potato head.

910
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,550
Oh, I love this one the best.

911
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,610
It's carved out in the middle.

912
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:16,050
Do you suppose he has any inkling that all of his silly antics are being broadcast to all the people on Earth?

913
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,090
Oh, I don't think so.

914
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,110
On the crazy astronaut channel?

915
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,790
He's fully lost.

916
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,690
One of these days he's going to switch through those channels.

917
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,570
And he's going to come.

918
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,730
On the channel with him on it.

919
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:31,610
Okay.

920
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,310
Massive.

921
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,190
Massive.

922
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,090
Not real?

923
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:11,110
Dave, your gyros need stabilizing.

924
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,890
Dave, check your computer.

925
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:13,610
Wait, who?

926
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,710
Your gyro, you're spinning.

927
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,110
You're in a spin, Dave.

928
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,370
Whose voice is this?

929
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,650
Stabilize the gyros.

930
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,770
Is this a real voice or is this a real voice?

931
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,050
Turn up the oxygen switch.

932
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,010
I'm getting lightheaded in here.

933
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,890
Reach for the oxygen switch, Dave.

934
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,870
I'll think I'll turn on the oxygen switch.

935
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,350
There, he did it.

936
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,970
At least he thought it was the oxygen switch.

937
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,690
What's wrong with the switch?

938
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,750
There's green stuff going on.

939
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,130
Good, he needed a good washing.

940
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,990
Oh, my God.

941
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,290
They always panic when the suit fills up

942
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,030
with the cleanser.

943
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:56,670
Cleansing fluid.

944
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:57,970
My kneecaps are so short.

945
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,630
Right up to their nostrils.

946
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:00,690
Oh, my God.

947
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,070
It's like he doesn't...

948
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,410
Wait till he finds the church air switch.

949
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,870
My hands are clean.

950
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,610
My face is clean.

951
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:09,650
Hello.

952
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:10,690
Hello, Dave.

953
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,550
Feeling better now, Dave?

954
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:14,810
Feeling better now, Dave?

955
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:15,910
What?

956
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,930
Everything I say itches.

957
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,050
No, no, no.

958
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,390
We're not doing that, it says.

959
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,250
It's just...

960
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:25,370
It's just...

961
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,030
It's...

962
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,350
It's just us, Dave.

963
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,270
The voices in your head.

964
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,550
We didn't want you to be alone.

965
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,430
I bet I could write a whole symphony

966
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,670
on this hollow potato.

967
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,530
That would be something to do for five years.

968
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,950
We'd sit around going mad.

969
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,250
It's that alternative.

970
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,810
There have been great symphonies

971
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,970
written about hollow potatoes, Dave.

972
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:48,670
Great symphonies.

973
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,550
Why don't you try it?

974
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:52,250
It'll keep you busy for a month or so.

975
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,850
Yeah, why don't I try it?

976
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,250
I could, like, make...

977
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,390
Thousands and thousands of little holes,

978
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,970
like some sort of chromatic key.

979
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,990
I could just get a little...

980
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,590
Dave, the cat's loose in the spaceship.

981
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,490
Let me check the monitor for...

982
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:06,950
Shit!

983
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:09,430
Cat's loose.

984
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:10,690
Damn cat.

985
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:12,810
It's crawling all over all...

986
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,190
All those...

987
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:15,470
Faders...

988
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,450
You better catch that cat, Dave.

989
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:19,170
It's walking across the control panel.

990
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:19,950
It's right near the control panel.

991
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,130
You're going into a spin again.

992
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,250
It's going right on the control panel.

993
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:22,810
You're destabilizing.

994
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:23,450
Oh, my God.

995
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:24,610
I'm gonna...

996
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,810
I'm gonna destabilize.

997
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,090
This thing's gonna start flipping.

998
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,470
If I don't get down there right away...

999
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:31,410
Ginger.

1000
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:35,270
Ginger.

1001
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:36,870
Ginger.

1002
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:38,910
Ginger.

1003
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:46,250
Oh, good.

1004
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:46,570
Look.

1005
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,650
Princess Wee, the cat's mutated.

1006
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,650
Just as we were hoping.

1007
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:51,930
What the hell are you...

1008
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,570
He let it wander into the cargo hold where it was exposed.

1009
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:56,650
What is that?

1010
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:58,010
Ginger?

1011
00:43:58,290 --> 00:43:59,150
Is that you?

1012
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:00,950
Jeez.

1013
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:03,010
Ginger.

1014
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,550
What the hell is the slime all over your neck?

1015
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:08,650
What you getting into?

1016
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,810
Just let me get a little closer, kid.

1017
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:12,650
What's wrong?

1018
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,010
Try to make friends with it, Dave.

1019
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,510
I'll try and make friends with it.

1020
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:19,470
Try to make friends with Ginger.

1021
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:20,790
Yeah.

1022
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:22,890
Ginger is always a nice little kitty.

1023
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,470
It's just sick or something.

1024
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:25,630
I'll make friends.

1025
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,950
I'll pet it and take it back out of here.

1026
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:28,950
Ginger.

1027
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:34,170
Now settle down, Dave.

1028
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,710
Try to communicate with it.

1029
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,110
It's a new form of life.

1030
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,590
No one's ever seen a cat spider before.

1031
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:42,450
It could teach us things.

1032
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:45,850
Oh, my God.

1033
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,290
Think what it could mean to science.

1034
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,290
Go on in there, Dave.

1035
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:55,270
Go on back into that cargo hold with that giant mutated cat spider.

1036
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,610
And if I could just talk to her, maybe...

1037
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:00,350
It's gotta be intelligent if it's moving this far.

1038
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,670
It maybe has something to tell me.

1039
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:08,670
A little kitty or whatever the hell you are now.

1040
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:10,710
What the hell's up?

1041
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:11,770
What's up?

1042
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:17,730
Oh, it just needs to be comforted, Dave.

1043
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:21,470
Your music soothes the savage beast.

1044
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:23,250
Why don't you put on some music?

1045
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:24,470
Ginger.

1046
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,310
He's gonna play a little song for us.

1047
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:31,150
Maybe you should put out some milk for it. A little tray of milk.

1048
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:35,950
Um... I was wondering...

1049
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:38,410
Be careful now. Don't let it get hurt.

1050
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:42,450
You know, its blood can burn a hole directly through the spaceship hull.

1051
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:46,610
It'd create a terrible vacuum and suck you out into space like...

1052
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:48,890
toothpaste out of a tube.

1053
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,190
Well, it looks like you're going for it, my man.

1054
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:56,210
And whatever you do, don't let any harm come to Ginger.

1055
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:02,510
The War Department is very interested in your little tabby.

1056
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,510
I don't think we can deal with this right now.

1057
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,910
What's coming up over there, my man?

1058
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:18,030
It's a big blue spot.

1059
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:21,170
And we'll be back to the Lonesome Couch.

1060
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:21,170


1061
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:24,670
Cowboy Dave flipping out in outer space channel.

1062
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:28,530
After these words from our controller.

1063
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:35,450
Cue up the... cue up the controller tape.

1064
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:39,810
From PR News in Washington, I'm undergoing treatment for alcoholism.

1065
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,870
On Wall Street 1686523.

1066
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:44,630
PR's bed.

1067
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,790
Dangerous, malicious, and reckless.

1068
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:47,890
PR's bed.

1069
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:49,610
This is PR News.

1070
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:54,150
House Speaker Dennis Hastert used banned performance-enhancing drugs.

1071
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:58,790
Two Americans are winners of this year's Nobel Prize in PR News in Washington.

1072
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:02,890
Dealing with overpopulation involves more than birth control.

1073
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:07,030
I say kill them all, let God sort them out.

1074
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:10,590
I say send them back to Lexington.

1075
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:15,630
I'm into the voluntary human extinction movement.

1076
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,590
I say let them eat green cheese.

1077
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:24,170
Let them eat green cheese and let the cat sort them out.

1078
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,810
Let the mutated spider cat.

1079
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:33,030
I say exterminate all of these funk monsters.

1080
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:35,310
Everything's putrid, out of its deal.

1081
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:37,510
Stop the whole genetic purge.

1082
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,550
Is there any coffee on this spaceship?

1083
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:47,790
Is there any Ritalin in this little tiny...

1084
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:52,490
Now come on, Dave.

1085
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:54,630
I know you got some of that whiskey stashed somewhere.

1086
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:58,370
Back with the bio-samples from Mars.

1087
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:00,890
Bio-samples?

1088
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:03,430
The samples are stuck in my heart.

1089
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,690
They're coming up to the major guard.

1090
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,790
And I didn't actually go back to when you came.

1091
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,630
And I was just in a dream.

1092
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:16,830
We can't understand a word you're saying, Dave.

1093
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:18,730
I was sorry, pussy. That's for sure.

1094
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:19,690
What?

1095
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:20,570
That's good, man.

1096
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,050
Thank you.

1097
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:22,530
I like your dog face. He's looking good to us.

1098
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:24,870
He's lost in space, friends.

1099
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:25,670
It's sad.

1100
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:26,670
I'm tired.

1101
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:31,850
But it's part of the risks these astronauts take.

1102
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:36,310
Thank God cremora don't make you sleepy like some of the other ones do.

1103
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:39,770
Well, at 1 o'clock, your suit will put you to sleep.

1104
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:42,470
I'm waiting. I'm waiting.

1105
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,850
I'm waiting for my suit to put me to sleep.

1106
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:53,230
Over the last five and a half hours, my suit has enthralled me.

1107
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:56,590
My suit has put me to sleep and waked me up again.

1108
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:58,390
My suit fed me.

1109
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,270
My suit evacuated my bowels.

1110
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:04,670
My suit lulled me into a false sense of security.

1111
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,010
It's a comforting suit.

1112
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:07,910
My suit talked to me.

1113
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,790
My suit made me feel very insecure.

1114
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:16,250
My suit expanded and contracted a few times.

1115
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,090
I didn't understand what that was about.

1116
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,890
It was punishing you, Dave.

1117
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:22,190
The suit punishes.

1118
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:25,430
The suit punishes and the suit rewards.

1119
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:28,970
The suit rewards you, Dave.

1120
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,150
My world is in this suit.

1121
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,990
This is my entire world.

1122
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:35,810
The suit is your friend.

1123
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:38,010
It's a nurturing cocoon.

1124
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,070
Oh, look at the cut of my socks.

1125
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:45,310
This is the kind of seasoning that would make any, any young man in America jealous as hell.

1126
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,830
I'm a true hero.

1127
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:49,150
Wearing this suit made me a hero.

1128
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,370
And I'm proud of it.

1129
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:51,950
I'm glad I signed up now.

1130
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,730
I think my suit's filling me with pride.

1131
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,670
Oh-dee-do-dee-do-dee-do.

1132
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,310
I'm afraid that's not pride, Dave.

1133
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:03,130
You shouldn't have eaten those freeze-dried beans this morning.

1134
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:05,850
They just had a little fuzz on them.

1135
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:08,330
I didn't see nothing wrong with those beans.

1136
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:13,010
Yeah, your suit may be filling up with a lot more than mere pride.

1137
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:13,650
Oh, there you go.

1138
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:15,290
He's using the zero gravity tool.

1139
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:15,870
He's using the toilet again.

1140
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:18,450
Oh, boy, this is kind of a...

1141
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:20,890
Whoopee!

1142
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,770
Oh, no, he left the flap open.

1143
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:26,650
Look, the stuff is floating around inside the cabin now.

1144
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,010
It's coating the windows.

1145
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:30,930
We can catch that stuff on a window.

1146
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,170
Way to go, Dave.

1147
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,390
Smooth move.

1148
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:35,750
Did you...

1149
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:37,690
Oh, no.

1150
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:43,290
Well, now the emergency lights have gone off.

1151
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:43,790
Oh, activate the...

1152
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,730
The little robots have to come out and clean up after you again, Dave.

1153
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:47,910
Activate the cleaning unit, please.

1154
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:49,330
Hello?

1155
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:50,590
Activate the cleaning unit.

1156
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:51,570
The suit's going to have to...

1157
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:53,990
The suit's going to have to punish you again, Dave.

1158
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:54,350
Hello?

1159
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:56,890
I need a clean up on the front window.

1160
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,230
Oh, shh, shh.

1161
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:01,590
The thing's going to be stuck there for weeks now.

1162
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:06,330
Of course, in this vacuous atmosphere, it won't smell much, I don't suppose.

1163
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:08,330
Yeah, just don't take your helmet off.

1164
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:13,290
I wonder what would happen if I took my helmet off.

1165
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,030
I never tried it.

1166
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,530
No, don't do that, Dave.

1167
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:17,370
Wait a minute.

1168
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:19,050
Maybe something might...

1169
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:19,710
I don't know, maybe...

1170
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:20,970
This is not a pressurized cabin.

1171
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:26,610
Might not be such a good idea after all.

1172
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:29,790
Fiddle around with these...

1173
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,430
Oh, look, he's trying to light a cigarette again.

1174
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,870
He can't get it up to his lips through that helmet.

1175
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:36,830
Damn.

1176
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:40,210
That must be the 5,000th time he's done that.

1177
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:40,490
Shh.

1178
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:41,550
Huh.

1179
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,270
16 cartons of love.

1180
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,270


1181
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,270


1182
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,270


1183
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,270


1184
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,270


1185
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,270


1186
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,270


1187
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,670
Look, he's not...

1188
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:44,930
Can't smoke a damn cigarette.

1189
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:49,090
It was a brilliant move on the part of the psychology department to put that no smoking

1190
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:57,630
sign blinking in there and those 20 cartons of cigarettes that keeps up the sort of tension

1191
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,250
that keeps the astronauts...

1192
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:02,290
Oddly enough, it keeps them mentally healthy.

1193
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:06,970
You know, it's so alone out here, the only friend I've got's my own guitar.

1194
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:11,210
Lucille, you've been with me through thick and thin.

1195
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:12,790
Can't smoke.

1196
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:14,790
Can't really eat a good meal.

1197
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:17,190
But I can still sing a song.

1198
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:21,390
I think I'll sing a song about my intergalactic exploits.

1199
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:26,930
Shh.

1200
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:30,530
Can't even hardly touch these fragile, these big mitts on.

1201
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:41,790
Years have gone and years have gone, but still I'm a flying bug.

1202
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:50,970
And someday I'll get there and maybe I won't and I'll never know the reason why.

1203
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:00,010
Shh.

1204
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,970
It's the worst one yet so far.

1205
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,730
I just keep on working it.

1206
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:07,670
I have my opera all figured out by the time I get there.

1207
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:10,430
And then I'll make it back to Earth.

1208
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:12,710
Some more herodom and fame and fortune.

1209
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:12,770
I'll be back.

1210
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:13,390
Fortune for me?

1211
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,870
Just chop that up and search the deep.

1212
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:20,950
You'll be the biggest folk music star on Alpha Centauri, Dave.

1213
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,470
Oh, God, I could see it right now.

1214
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:26,950
I could be like the Woody Guthrie of Alpha Centauri.

1215
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:30,950
You'll be the only musician in the whole star system, Dave.

1216
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:31,970
Of course, yeah.

1217
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:35,010
I'll be the only musician in the whole star system.

1218
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:38,210
You'll be the only music fan in the whole star system.

1219
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:41,390
Yeah, and my head will be shaped like a gigantic fan.

1220
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:44,930
Like one of those Komodo dragons or what do they call them?

1221
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:46,930
Monitor lizards when they get mad.

1222
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:52,490
Good, we've got him doing stream of consciousness again.

1223
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:56,510
That should keep him amused for a few more days.

1224
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:58,710
I wonder if they got a reefer on Alpha Centauri.

1225
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:04,070
I wonder if they got hot like Earth type babes on Alpha Centauri.

1226
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:09,370
The suit is your girlfriend, Dave.

1227
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:11,370
It's yours.

1228
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:12,150
It's clamping down.

1229
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:13,790
It's constricting.

1230
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,190
It's tightening up.

1231
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:20,010
It's form fitting, isn't it?

1232
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:20,690
It's...

1233
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,150
I didn't know this suit could do this.

1234
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:28,210
What the heck is going on?

1235
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,330
All right, that's enough.

1236
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:35,690
Turn off that function of the suit.

1237
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,150
Now let's make him exercise.

1238
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,050
Put the suit in exercise mode.

1239
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:40,490
There we go.

1240
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,550
He's plumping up and down.

1241
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:43,870
He's flopping.

1242
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,990
My knee joint's going out again.

1243
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:48,410
What the hell is this music in this?

1244
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:50,810
It's some good aerobatized music.

1245
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:55,090
We must keep our astronauts in good shape.

1246
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:57,770
He's got resistant calisthenics.

1247
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:00,850
Jumping jacks at this time of the morning.

1248
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:04,050
It'll be five years of this if he's lucky.

1249
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:06,510
Oh, man, I can't do this for five years.

1250
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,410
I can't do this for another minute longer.

1251
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,470
If he doesn't happen to hit one of the platforms,

1252
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:14,050
if there are any in the Alpha Centauri system,

1253
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:17,370
then he'll just have to go on to the next star system

1254
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:20,130
20 years past that.

1255
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:23,290
But you'll probably hit a planet,

1256
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:26,490
some sort of a... or a moon, or an asteroid,

1257
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:30,690
or something, some body of rock floating around in space.

1258
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:32,470
Huh.

1259
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:37,690
Think of the romantic cartoon man on a desert island

1260
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:40,270
with nothing but one palm tree and a shark.

1261
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:42,490
Yeah.

1262
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,990
That romantic fantasy will be yours.

1263
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:46,690
Yeah.

1264
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,910
Only high-tech style, Dave.

1265
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:53,730
I'm a high-tech style romantic hero figure,

1266
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,890
abandoned on a distant moon,

1267
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:01,590
cast into space like some piece of effluvio on the sea.

1268
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,430
Someday I'll be home.

1269
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:07,750
Someday I'll touch the shore,

1270
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,870
a distant shore somewhere.

1271
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,030
Much longer of a wait.

1272
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,930
I'll get there someday.

1273
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,310
If you get bored, Dave,

1274
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:24,390
you can always just put a note in a bottle

1275
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:27,370
and send it out into the radio waves,

1276
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:31,970
like you've just done for the last two hours.

1277
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:38,450
This has been ESO Radio.

1278
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:39,850
Thanks for watching.

1279
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:39,850


1280
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:42,310
I'm WCSB Cleveland with my guests,

1281
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:43,510
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

1282
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,790
the Reverend Ivan Stang,

1283
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,250
and the Princess,

1284
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:48,330
We Are Doe.

1285
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:49,370
My name is Chaz,

1286
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:51,750
and I'll see you all next week.

1287
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,230
Yay for Chaz.

1288
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:57,550
He's the mix master.

1289
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:05,050
Yes, friends, thanks to Dave and Chaz,

1290
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:07,210
and we, and the callers,

1291
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:13,110
and WCSB Cleveland for that strange and wonderful broadcast.

1292
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:15,030
Nice recording there.

1293
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:16,670
For more information, of course,

1294
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:18,970
it's subgenius.com,

1295
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:23,650
and we really do intend to do our X-Day celebration

1296
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:27,310
up until the saucers get here at 7 a.m. July 5th,

1297
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,270
online, I guess.

1298
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:33,010
I mean, I'm not sure what we're going to do.

1299
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:34,230
It should be interesting.

1300
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:35,870
To tell the truth,

1301
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,070
I imagine what the X-Day Zoom meetings,

1302
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,930
it'll probably be all day and all night,

1303
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:44,470
practically, for that week.

1304
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,370
It'll be about like the real X-Day,

1305
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:52,730
in which the best part is standing around in the road talking,

1306
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:55,990
or sometimes sitting around a campfire talking.

1307
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:59,890
But mostly it ends up being standing in the road,

1308
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:00,790
at least for me.

1309
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:03,670
That's my favorite part of all those festivals.

1310
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:05,850
The music is fantastic.

1311
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:06,190
It's fun.

1312
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:10,250
And the jibber-jabber from Loudmouths on stage is fun.

1313
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:14,390
But really, the best part is just the talking to the other subgeniuses.

1314
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,030
It's interesting.

1315
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,130
Speaking of other subgeniuses,

1316
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:21,490
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is,

1317
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:25,590
well, he's probably permanently in kind of a fix.

1318
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:30,810
It's going to be hard for him to get work in Ashtabula

1319
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:32,670
with his physical condition.

1320
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:41,470
And, you know, they aren't going to help.

1321
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:43,990
So maybe we can.

1322
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:47,290
If you look at subgenius.com on the radio section,

1323
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:48,490
the Hour of Slack pages,

1324
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:54,670
there's a button or a link to the GoFundMe for Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1325
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:57,950
And of course there's a donation button on that page,

1326
00:58:58,030 --> 00:58:59,070
just for Hour of Slack,

1327
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:02,650
and on the front page of subgenius.com.

1328
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:06,870
And now this.

1329
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:36,430
.

1330
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:36,790

1331
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:41,410

1333
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:48,290

1334

1335

1336
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:06,490
.

1337
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:06,490


1338
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:13,810
.

1339
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,350
.

1340
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:18,750

1341

1342

1343

.

1344
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:19,470
.

1345
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:47,230
Free your radio and your mind will follow.

1346
01:00:47,230 --> 01:01:04,890
Free Think Radio is your one-stop source for all the subgenius shows, including the Hour of Slack, every Thursday at 11 a.m. Eastern Time, we think.

1347
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:09,450
Yes, friends, freethinkradio.com.

1348
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:16,390

1350
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:27,410
Praise Bob and praise Freethink Radio.

1351
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:32,010
And now this.

1352
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:38,230
Gee, I want to try Triology.

1353
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:40,810
All the kids are doing it, Mom.

1354
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:43,470
There's a Dobbs head in every bar.

1355
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:46,930
Yes, an embedded Dobbs head of soap inside.

1356
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:49,690
Inside a bar of translucent soap.

1357
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:52,390
You can see Bob lurking inside.

1358
01:01:52,770 --> 01:02:02,190
And it tells fortunes as you rotate it swiftly under the water, lathering away the conspiracy smudge and other schmata.

1359
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:10,190
If the Dobbs head comes up at the end in the true perfect pipe placement position, you'll have good luck all day.

1360
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:14,090
If it comes up the other way, 20 more years of winter.

1361
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:16,830
That's Triology Soaps.

1362
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:20,750
It comes in every flavor and scent.

1363
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,150
That's not nonsense.

1364
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:25,670
It's almost every scent you can think of.

1365
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:27,490
And they all have funny names.

1366
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:33,250
Praise Bob and praise Triology Soaps.com.

1367
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:36,330
Try is spelled with an I.
