1
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,860
My name is Max.

2
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,640
My world is fire and blood.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,220
Why are you hurting these people?

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,480
It's the oil, stupid.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,780
Oil wars.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,260
We are killing for gasoline.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:25,700
Gasoline.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,620
The world is actually running out of water.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,880
Now there's the water wars.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,600
Once, I was a cop, a road warrior searching for a righteous cause.

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,260
The terminal freakout point.

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,080
Mankind has gone rogue, terrorizing itself.

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,460
The earth is sour.

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,040
Our bones are poisoned.

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,600
We have become half-life.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,540
As the world fell, each of us in our own way was broken.

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,140
It was hard to know who was more crazy.

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,160
.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,300
.

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:28,300


21
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:33,680
Tony Drag, yes, welcome to the hour of swag.

22
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,380
La, la, la, la, la, la.

23
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,520
La, la, la, la, la, la.

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,480
La, la, la, hour of swag.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,860
Now which dog do you want to be champion?

26
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,260
That dog or that dog?

27
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,980
That's my good boy champion.

28
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,120
That's a good boy.

29
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,880
Hey.

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,120
I need Bob Dobbs to hold my pain.

31
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,500
I need Bob Dobbs to haul around my silly name.

32
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,260
I need Bob Dobbs to haul all the Yeti from my bed.

33
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,960
I need Bob Dobbs to haul the pink boys when they're dead.

34
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,940
I need Bob Dobbs to haul me to Dobbs Town.

35
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,880
I need Bob Dobbs to haul my weird thoughts around.

36
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,720
I need Bob Dobbs to haul my haba fraba zippy laps.

37
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,940
And I need Bob Dobbs to haul all my bobs in.

38
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,980
But you know something?

39
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,260
He kind of looks like somebody, doesn't he?

40
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,620
You have a friend named Bob.

41
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,920
Bob's about the best friend in the world.

42
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,960
Why have you been at the hospital the past two days?

43
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,140
Bob's in a coma.

44
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,720
He was in there a solid three days.

45
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:56,920
Bob's in a coma.

46
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,540
What's that, a bar?

47
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,200
Low town.

48
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,220
That's Bob.

49
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,160
Is your friend Bob a doctor?

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,760
He's just about the best darn veterinarian in these parts.

51
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,760
The army lost.

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,920
Did it have a tattoo?

53
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,000
What's this all about?

54
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,140
I'm a shoe salesman.

55
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:09,820
Settle down.

56
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,940
I just asked you a question.

57
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,180
If you won't tell us, we can find out.

58
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,180
What did it say?

59
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,000
It said, Mom.

60
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,300
Earth people, hear me and hear me well.

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,920
I, from this moment on, am Bob Dobbs.

62
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:26,920


63
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:26,920


64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:26,920


65
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:26,920


66
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:26,920


67
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:26,920


68
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:26,920


69
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:26,920


70
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:26,920


71
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,600
Shall rule over planet Earth!

72
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,540
Your fate is sealed!

73
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,440
The invasion by creatures from space confirmed.

74
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,880
New York City may be their next objective.

75
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,720
Yes, brothers and sisters, the space men are coming and none can stop them.

76
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:50,440
But our lord and mastron, J.R. Bob Dobbs, can broker us a deal with the alien horde.

77
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:56,420
Bob has come to rip asunder the congealed skin on the gravy bowl of postmodern ennui.

78
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,660
And scoop out the filth of the conspiracy within.

79
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:05,920
To lead the mutant tribe of the subgenius race down the magic rabbit hole to the land

80
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,500
of slack.

81
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,040
Are you sick and tired of being sick and tired?

82
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,320
The star forces may already have you in their mind control grip.

83
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,260
Fight back by exploiting your own abnormality and cast off the chains of normalcy.

84
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,880
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

85
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,900

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,560

The end.

95
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,880
Bob Dobbs.

96
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


97
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


98
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


99
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


100
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


101
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


102
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


103
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


104
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


105
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


106
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


107
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


108
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


109
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


110
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


111
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


112
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


113
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


114
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


115
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


116
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:26,880


117
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,720
And so All Stars did our title music.

118
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,260
And there'll be more music coming up by the fantastic Plastics and Rural War Room.

119
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,700
But see, we're still out of town.

120
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,160
In deepest Texas.

121
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,560
On Stang Ranch.

122
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,160
And doing new shows by calling into Radio Synesthesia.

123
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,580
Dr. Sinister's show on WCSB Cleveland that follows the Hour of Slack there on Sunday

124
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,000
nights.

125
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,120
I mean, I could just do ancient reruns and probably will.

126
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,960
But.

127
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,620
But despite the not so great audio quality we get from recording the station's internet

128
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,780
stream, we'd rather do new shows than reruns if possible.

129
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,220
Devout WCSB listeners will be hearing this for the second time.

130
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,040
But believe me, I did all manner of tightening and shortening and carving and sanding to

131
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,920
make it smoother.

132
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,400
And besides, really, how many listeners would remember hearing it the first time anyway?

133
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,620
So now we join.

134
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,940
The radio synesthesia.

135
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Of January 24 already in progress.

136
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,340
The word for throwing people out of windows.

137
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,040
That's what makes sense with the word for Nestor from there.

138
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,380
Yeah.

139
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,240
That's also what I call the blue screen of death on my computer.

140
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,920
I just got thrown out of windows by the blue screen of death.

141
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,620
I take it you're not much of a computer user.

142
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,700
I don't know what the blue screen of death is

143
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,120
on Windows operating systems

144
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,500
on PCs

145
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,260
if a serious

146
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,380
system error occurs

147
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,060
then whatever you're doing will just stop

148
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,100
and you get a blue screen with this message on it

149
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,040
saying that a fatal error or fatal

150
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,340
exception was detected and

151
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,060
your computer is being shut down to prevent damage

152
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,640
to your system

153
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,980
that sounds

154
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,000
pretty serious I've been attacked by

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,800
many viruses

156
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,040
it's not always caused by

157
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,640
viruses it's you know earlier

158
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,740
versions of Windows would do that all the time

159
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,800
yes they would crash suddenly

160
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,220
because their expiration date had gone sideways

161
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,540
at least

162
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,580
in Singapore

163
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,660
and we are getting another call right now

164
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,140
hello you're on the air

165
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,820
I have a joke

166
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,320
are you doing

167
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,560
alright let's have a joke show

168
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,200
I have a joke that's surrealist

169
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,760
or maybe Dada if I'm not sure

170
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,500
okay

171
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,660
knock knock

172
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,580
who's there

173
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,320
to get to the other side

174
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,020
oh I like that

175
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,580
hey did you hear the one about the inquisition

176
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,680
no

177
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,300
you lie confess

178
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,100
too oblique man

179
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,980
I know not oblique enough

180
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,460
Dada

181
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,120
that's stupid

182
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,840
did you hear the one about the presidential candidate

183
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,660
that said that he could shoot people

184
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,820
and his supporters would still vote for him

185
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,180
okay

186
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,740
okay

187
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:19,740


188
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:19,740


189
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:19,740


190
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:19,740


191
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:19,740


192
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:19,740


193
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:19,740


194
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:19,740


195
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:19,740


196
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:19,740


197
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,760
you know every time he has

198
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,980
said something like that it's like

199
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,460
gosh did he really jump the shark this time

200
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,060
you know that we don't even have to

201
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,040
name him now

202
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,220
he who must not be named

203
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,860
yeah

204
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,880
so Donald Trump recently said

205
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,000
oh yeah I forgot I'm sorry I forgot

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,820
was that right after

207
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,300
I thought that was great that he actually got Tina Fey to endorse him

208
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,200
I saw that speech he gave and like you know

209
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,740
in the full Sarah Palin regalia

210
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:49,980
and

211
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,620
I thought that was like one of the greatest pranks ever played on

212
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,780
oh wait hold on a second I just read something

213
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,320
this

214
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,080
wait hold

215
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,460
that was actually Sarah Palin

216
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,960
I couldn't

217
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,500
no

218
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,260
it looked like a cartoon version of herself

219
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,780
she does look like a cartoon version

220
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,120
she has transformed into a cartoon version of herself

221
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,300
you know reality has lapped satire

222
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,060
I've said that before

223
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
and I'm going to say it again

224
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,340
except that now I'm going to say reality

225
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:19,740
has lapped satire

226
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:19,740


227
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:19,740


228
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,660
keeps lapping satire

229
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,960
wasn't Sarah Palin always a cartoon

230
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,580
yeah but now she's like recycling her greatest hits from eight years ago

231
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,880
oh the hopey changey stuff

232
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,680
the porn movies with the lookalike Palin

233
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,400
have you ever seen any of them

234
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,720
any of what's

235
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,660
the porn movies

236
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,760
the porn movies

237
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,640
you know I have to say I am not

238
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,840
turned on by that kind of idea

239
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,520
I would struggle to watch such a thing

240
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,660
well

241
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,420
the premise is

242
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,260
she gets snowed in one night

243
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,380
and some Russian soldiers

244
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,100
wait wait wait

245
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,600
have you had Edward Snowden with her

246
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,040
no

247
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,800
she is snowed in

248
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,860
oh snowed in

249
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,660
that would be funny if you had Edward Snowden

250
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,800
and Sarah Palin lookalikes doing a porno together

251
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,320
that would be funny

252
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,840
that would be much better than what I'm going to say

253
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,520
I must confess

254
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:15,900
but

255
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,760
anyway so these three

256
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,420
four however many

257
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,040
Russian soldiers

258
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,940
are lost

259
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,040
and go across the border somehow

260
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,960
into Alaska near Palin's pad

261
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,080
and

262
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,760
and then

263
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,860
well and then

264
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:32,980
wow

265
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,640
wow

266
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,100
wow

267
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,600
wow

268
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,440
I was like that there

269
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,960
she has the accent as well

270
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,440
you know

271
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,400
which is not really an Alaskan accent necessarily

272
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,040
you know it's kind of like Minnesota

273
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,900
I don't know

274
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,000
Wisconsin maybe

275
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,640
Fargo

276
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,400
yeah that that that's

277
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,880
that whole area

278
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,220
northern

279
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,920
northern Wisconsin

280
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:52,820
Minnesota

281
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,880
parts of the Dakotas

282
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,920
people talk like that too

283
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,060
yes it's a variation of how people

284
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,200
you know why it's so windy

285
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,160
you know why it's so

286
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,760
you know why it's so windy in Minnesota

287
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,240
because Wisconsin sucks and the Dakotas blow

288
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,940
that's a

289
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,380
that's a joke that Al Franken made

290
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,820
you must have been

291
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,200
you have relatives there

292
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,540
are you

293
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,200
I have a step sister in Minneapolis actually

294
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,140
or St. Paul I should say

295
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,380
it's a big place in Minneapolis actually

296
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:19,780
it's a big difference

297
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,000
the difference between St. Paul and Minneapolis

298
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,600
is like the difference between the east side

299
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,360
and west side of Cleveland

300
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,520
plus two different states right

301
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,340
no they're both in the same state

302
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,440
but they're on opposite sides of the Mississippi River

303
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,960
oh I was thinking of Budapest

304
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,500
I had my eyes crossed

305
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,180
ah yes Buda and Pest

306
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,440
they were two separate cities

307
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:37,960
yes

308
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,240
I was trying to reopen my uh

309
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:41,840
curb

310
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,560
and the most important muscle

311
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,040
you were trying to think of Budapest

312
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,840
but you never made yourself a rudder pest

313
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,080
no it's

314
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,320
yeah

315
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:51,880
huh

316
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,720
oh no I was thinking about cabbage oils

317
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,960
cabbage oils

318
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,720
or paprikash

319
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,840
oh cabbage oils

320
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,780
paprikash

321
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,940
my favorite fruit

322
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,920
if I said

323
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,180
one of these days I'm going to try my hand at paprikash

324
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,740
have you ever smelled the ugly fruit

325
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,220
or whatever it's called from China

326
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,180
are you thinking of the durian

327
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:11,440
no it's not bad

328
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,460
but it's real delicious

329
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,220
the durian

330
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,240
yeah I think it's

331
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,580
it's most common in like Southeast Asia

332
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,080
um

333
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,100
I don't know how anyone got the idea

334
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,020
to eat it in the first place

335
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,880
because first of all

336
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,660
it's covered in really sharp spikes

337
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,960
second of all

338
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,640
you cut it open

339
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,580
and it smells like

340
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,000
yeah actually um

341
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,340
I've never actually encountered durian in real life

342
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,220
um

343
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,540
but I did get some durian flavored candy

344
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,220
from uh

345
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,520
from the stangs

346
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,120
and um

347
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,320
it didn't exactly taste like poo

348
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,800
what it reminded me of

349
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,520
is the

350
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,960
the odorant compound they put in natural gas

351
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,700
it tasted like a gas leak

352
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,380
that's what I thought

353
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:48,580
uh

354
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,580
doctor at this point I have to ask

355
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,020
how exactly do you know what poo tastes like

356
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,940
well

357
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,220
I should say

358
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,920
I know what it smells like

359
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,840
it didn't exactly have the flavor profile

360
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,760
okay

361
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,480
oh by the way

362
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,080
there is also a famous story written about this

363
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,680
this food

364
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,380
what the durian

365
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,120
or poop

366
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,960
uh durian

367
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,580
okay

368
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,220
really Sherman

369
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,960
you mean to tell me you've never read

370
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,600
the picture of durian gray

371
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,920
oh no

372
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,320
uh

373
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,240
I can feel my stool softening

374
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,980
and my bowels are a little

375
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,260
turned my bowels to water

376
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,480
I'll write 216-687-3515

377
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,620
I'm sorry I was just going to say

378
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,160
my jokes have an effect on people

379
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,740
mm-hmm

380
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,120
hello you're on the air

381
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,360
Dr. Sinister

382
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,000
ah

383
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,320
welcome back

384
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,700
are you back

385
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,960
I was listening to the show earlier

386
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,380
I'm trying to call in

387
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,180
but then I came down

388
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,820
and started watching the reboot of the X-Files

389
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,280
oh

390
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,360
yeah how was that

391
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,960
well it's television

392
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,920
mm-hmm

393
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,940
I feel really normal now

394
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,320
since I've been staying at my dad's place

395
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,060
my ex

396
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,500
my late dad's place

397
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,560
I've become normal

398
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,280
hmm

399
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,580
I've been watching television

400
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,560
lads

401
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,900
and I have a smart phone

402
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,500
so now I'm always hunched over

403
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,220
pushing little buttons

404
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,920
oh dear

405
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,780
or I'm watching

406
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,960
I'm always watching TV

407
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,900
either on a wall

408
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,760
or on my

409
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,560
oh no

410
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:17,820
hand

411
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,260
oh no

412
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,140
oh yeah

413
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,060
yeah

414
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,000
well hey you know

415
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,080
we live in the future now so

416
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,420
you can still hear the elephants

417
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,580
banging in the background

418
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,020
Stan

419
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,380
I mean

420
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,300
you are in a vast savannah

421
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,480
of many cerebral hopes

422
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,320
and dashed dreams

423
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,400
and out there

424
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,480
where the wind blows free

425
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,040
you want

426
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,280
you're real rare

427
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,560
and yet it's

428
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,980
oh my god

429
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,060
I just saw an ad

430
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,660
that indicates

431
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,960
that there is a series

432
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,880
coming up

433
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,760
about the Kennedy assassination

434
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,420
not just a special

435
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,260
a special

436
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:48,500
a series

437
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,340
not just a mini series

438
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,820
I just saw a little imitation

439
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,960
Lee Harvey Oswald

440
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,160
posing with a gun

441
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,940
in the pamphlet

442
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,800
I feel like I'm being enveloped

443
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,420
in the future

444
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,880
my friends

445
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,740
oh that's weird

446
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,680
and I suppose

447
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,080
what they're going to say

448
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,700
the same thing

449
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,280
that was the revisionist thing

450
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,580
that we can't do

451
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,280
everything with the

452
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,060
Stokes committee

453
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,620
that everybody else found out

454
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,620
that was a conspiracy

455
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,800
and now they're going to be

456
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,480
the Gerald Pesner

457
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,080
or Pesner

458
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,980
whatever his name was

459
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,940
who's the known operative

460
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,980
of the high command

461
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,520
of the

462
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,960
all I know is

463
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,940
the X-Files

464
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,820
is going to reveal

465
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,640
everything

466
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,860
about the conspiracy

467
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,600
so far it turns out

468
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,820
it hasn't been aliens

469
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,440
it's been

470
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,160
human evildoers

471
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,720
using stolen alien technology

472
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,900
oh and they're

473
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,740
apparently they're

474
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,140
unveiling the conspiracy

475
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,960
on live TV right now

476
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,780
at least on TV

477
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,960
so I'm not sure

478
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,220
hmm

479
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,560
but it's being debunked

480
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,660
this Alex

481
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,540
trying to put it in

482
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,480
the most conspiracy

483
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,360
and explaining

484
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,320
wouldn't it

485
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,820
I mean

486
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,860
he explained the conspiracy

487
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,500
to everybody

488
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,220
but already

489
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,700
it's being debunked

490
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,440
just in the first hour

491
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,920
of this rebooted show

492
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,400
and here's the funny thing

493
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,920
I've mentioned that

494
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,960
I'm normal

495
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,740
I'm watching TV

496
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,060
I've never seen

497
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,080
the X-Files before

498
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,800
I never saw

499
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,040
the X-Files once

500
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,860
when it was on

501
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,700
in the 90s

502
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,380
I'd walk by

503
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,040
everybody else

504
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,680
would be watching it

505
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:17,960
I'd walk by

506
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,040
but I had to work

507
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,860
on those Pharisees

508
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,600
and aliens

509
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,880
so I never watched the show

510
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,900
now I'm watching the show

511
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,240
and it seems kind of stupid

512
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,000
it's hard for me to judge it

513
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,320
because

514
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,920
you know I was a teenager

515
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,640
in the 90s

516
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,100
and my tastes are

517
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,920
very different now

518
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,600
than they were back then

519
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,520
and I haven't seen it

520
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,260
in 15 years

521
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:36,600
so

522
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,280
actually more like

523
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,360
20 years now

524
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,960
since the last time I saw it

525
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,720
so it's kind of hard

526
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,620
for me to judge

527
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,180
yeah I remember

528
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,820
when my mommy

529
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,840
used to like it a lot

530
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,700
I didn't watch that

531
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,620
very much I think

532
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:47,960
but I'm not sure

533
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,920
I liked it at the time

534
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,460
apparently the government

535
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,480
is shutting down

536
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,640
everyone who tried

537
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,740
to reveal the truth

538
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,340
this time

539
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:54,900
this is just

540
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,860
in the first episode

541
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,400
they blew up

542
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,780
a secret area

543
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,140
51

544
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,580
just a minute ago

545
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,460
I just saw them do it

546
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,020
because I'm watching

547
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,660
with muted

548
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,320
but

549
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,660
you know

550
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,280
it's times like these

551
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,600
that I'm

552
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,500
the conflict early

553
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,700
that's the opening scene

554
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,820
is the conflict right

555
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,200
in the resolution

556
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,160
well they started

557
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,300
with the Roswell

558
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,300
until the series is over

559
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,040
that was the opening

560
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,160
the opening scene

561
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,020
of the show

562
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,840
was the Roswell

563
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,060
crash

564
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,440
but it turns out

565
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,580
that wasn't really

566
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,180
aliens

567
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,620
that was

568
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,220
that was a

569
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,720
sponsored by the government

570
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,440
to make everyone

571
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,360
think that it was

572
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:25,780
an aliens

573
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,840
to think that was

574
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,400
what was being

575
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,040
covered up

576
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,980
but it was really

577
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,660
something much

578
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,240
much worse

579
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,300
than aliens

580
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,260
taking over the world

581
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,880
I always assumed

582
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,260
it was

583
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,700
yeah I thought

584
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,160
it was like

585
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,360
experimental

586
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,240
aircraft of some kind

587
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,320
the Soviets

588
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,120
used to breed

589
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,640
these midget pilots

590
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,800
who would

591
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,740
be like extra small

592
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,560
so they could fit into

593
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,420
experimental aircraft

594
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,840
and some of the

595
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,400
corpses that have been found

596
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,520
that were supposedly aliens

597
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,400
were in fact

598
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,700
Russians

599
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,920
Soviet midget corpses

600
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,040
and

601
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,820
but you know

602
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,560
it's times like these

603
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,660
I'm glad I'm a subgenius

604
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:04,900
because

605
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,120
you know

606
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,380
I get to know

607
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,120
what the real conspiracy

608
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,900
is all about

609
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,400
well that's a funny thing

610
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,240
I mean they keep

611
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,940
on the sex files

612
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,720
saying they keep

613
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,960
they keep pulling the rug

614
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,720
out from under you

615
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:17,820
so I'm like

616
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,680
oh there's aliens

617
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,000
oh no it's not really aliens

618
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,920
oh there were aliens

619
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,880
but now it's the government

620
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,320
oh there was a government

621
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,580
but now it's a different government

622
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,340
and oddly enough

623
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,460
Fox and Mulder

624
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,760
look strangely aged

625
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,120
she's really skinny

626
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,520
and he's kind of bloated

627
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,720
everything's different

628
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,140
from

629
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:35,420
yeah

630
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,400
imagine that

631
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:36,700
people

632
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,980
15 years ago

633
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,640
imagine that

634
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,480
20 years go by

635
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,200
and people don't look

636
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,800
the same anymore

637
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,380
I don't get it

638
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,380
that can't happen to me

639
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:44,960
can it

640
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,220
oh dear

641
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,960
that's prismatic

642
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,740
neck disease

643
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,200
that happens

644
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,580
when you turn 45

645
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,700
you get spasmodic

646
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,600
neck disease

647
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,380
it's like a chicken visit

648
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,300
or something like that

649
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,260
but the Chinese people

650
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,280
don't like it as much

651
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,940
as they used to

652
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,680
and you have to do

653
00:18:59,680 --> 00:18:59,960
certain

654
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
you have to do like

655
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,580
feng shui

656
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,100
or you know

657
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,020
like feng shui

658
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,280
get in the right place

659
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,820
and then you have to do

660
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,660
some jikon

661
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,620
and stuff like that

662
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,540
and it goes away automatically

663
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,300
unless you don't want

664
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,040
you could make it bigger

665
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,880
if you wanted to

666
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,460
it could be done

667
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,160
not get bigger

668
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,020
because I know

669
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,380
we all want to make it bigger

670
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:16,840
yeah

671
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:17,820
yeah

672
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:17,820


673
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:17,820


674
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:17,820


675
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:17,820


676
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:17,820


677
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:17,820


678
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:17,820


679
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:17,820


680
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:17,820


681
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:17,820


682
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:17,820


683
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:17,820


684
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,820
whatever it is

685
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,620
it

686
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,880
oh it looks like

687
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,120
the FBI is so worried

688
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,560
they're calling

689
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,940
Scully and Mulder

690
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,620
back in

691
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,180
hmm

692
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,020
pulling them out of retirement

693
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,420
they've been out of work

694
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:29,680
although

695
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,620
she's been working

696
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,360
as a surgeon

697
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,700
putting ears on

698
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,480
earless children

699
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,040
like a surgeon

700
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,880
oh the witness

701
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,860
is about to be killed

702
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,980
her car is stopping

703
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,940
in the middle of the highway

704
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,120
weird lights around

705
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,060
I bet she saw

706
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,760
close encounters

707
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,660
for the third time

708
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,000
yeah I was going to say

709
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,720
this reminds me

710
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,460
of once upon a time

711
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,160
my dad wanted to show me

712
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,940
the movie The Godfather

713
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,420
for the first time

714
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,780
and we got a VHS copy

715
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,860
of it out of the library

716
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,040
and apparently

717
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,060
he got it without looking

718
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,620
and there was braille

719
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,160
all over

720
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,940
the case that it came in

721
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,660
and they put the tape in

722
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,100
and it has

723
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,380
a voiceover

724
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,960
describing the scene

725
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,240
movies for the blind

726
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,680
oh cool

727
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,800
kind of ruined it though

728
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,140
well it's like

729
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,440
subtitles for the blind

730
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:17,660
yeah

731
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,600
until this day arrives

732
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,280
oh my god

733
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,620
the aliens just came down

734
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,280
and blew up

735
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,460
the cute girl witness

736
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,400
who could have proved everything

737
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,640
I'd like to remind everybody

738
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,480
it was basically

739
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,380
a radio drama

740
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,180
and that was

741
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,140
common many years ago

742
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,180
also they used to have

743
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,860
novels

744
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,800
books on tape

745
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,560
you put them

746
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,460
in your cassette player

747
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,100
in your car

748
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,020
and

749
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,720
the cow was

750
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,660
the cigarette man

751
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,200
is back

752
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,800
is it still

753
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,480
the same actor

754
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,520
he's a manic path now

755
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,600
I don't know

756
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,400
that's got a guy

757
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,220
that he's got a

758
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,420
throat thing now

759
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,400
he's smoking cigarettes

760
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,300
through his throat

761
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,420
that's funny

762
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,720
he's a hideous

763
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,740
scary cancer dog

764
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,720
that's the end of the show

765
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,560
the cancer man

766
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,440
I almost didn't watch it

767
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:00,780
because

768
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,080
there was a football game

769
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,100
and it made it go late

770
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,600
and that meant

771
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,540
it was hard for me

772
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,400
to call the show

773
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:07,860
because

774
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,580
damn

775
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,860
television show

776
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,040
was going on too long

777
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,100
did you see what happened

778
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,000
I see what happened

779
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,580
are you wearing pajamas

780
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,180
on me

781
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,700
I'm watching TV

782
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,720
there's commercials on

783
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,160
you know I haven't

784
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,840
experienced this kind of thing

785
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,380
in like 25 years

786
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,900
how about that

787
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,480
I can't imagine

788
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
and you know

789
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,560
every night

790
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,740
I've got a favorite show

791
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,740
on every night now

792
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,940
it only took three weeks

793
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,360
or three months

794
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:32,880
three months

795
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,660
to get me completely

796
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,780
sucked back in

797
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,280
well I don't know

798
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,260
but I have to pay

799
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,380
for this damn thing

800
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,740
oh man

801
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,380
of course it's not a good thing

802
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,240
I've been spending

803
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,480
an hour every night

804
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,160
watching television

805
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,080
instead of playing

806
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,820
video games

807
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,760
and paying for it

808
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,700
that's the worst part man

809
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:51,880
it's important

810
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,440
television is insidious

811
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,180
I'm telling you

812
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,300
I must

813
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,140
I must reach out

814
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,020
and explain to everybody

815
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,500
only radio is cool

816
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,740
yeah yeah that's it

817
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,160
only radio

818
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,540
yeah you know

819
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,260
I can still do stuff

820
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,760
while I'm uh

821
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,880
listening to the radio

822
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,760
or a podcast

823
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,660
not that I actually

824
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,700
listen to the radio

825
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,500
either in the last 25 years

826
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,220
not even WCSB

827
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,980
no

828
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,840
I like my

829
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,320
my own brain think

830
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,960
that's my problem

831
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,180
or I did

832
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,840
up until

833
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,500
we got

834
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,880
we moved into this house

835
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,600
with television

836
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,480
and now I watch it

837
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,600
every night

838
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,460
well I thought

839
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,620
you'd be a pod popper

840
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,040
by now

841
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,700
instead you've

842
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,940
transgressed into a video

843
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,700
yeah

844
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,620
I know

845
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,020
it's

846
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,940
it's strange

847
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,480
and

848
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,460
it's like a new world

849
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:38,720
it's

850
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,440
I know now

851
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,900
how everyone else

852
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,000
in America feels

853
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,740
isn't it awful

854
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,360
and

855
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,840
and seduced

856
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,240
by

857
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,260
images

858
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,360
images

859
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,900
where everything

860
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,920
is all shiny

861
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,360
and

862
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,800
it got

863
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,980
it got a lot shinier

864
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,940
I started slobbering

865
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,240
at a Pizza Hut commercial

866
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,600
about half an hour ago

867
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,780
I realized

868
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,400
oh my god

869
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,600
it's making me salivate

870
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,660
that stretchy cheese

871
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,280
it's making

872
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,880
it's having the effect

873
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,200
it's making me want to call

874
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,860
Pizza Hut

875
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,340
isn't that interesting

876
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,020
it's like

877
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,520
I feel like

878
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,940
I'm a lab rat

879
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,660
in a cage

880
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,720
and yet

881
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,320
it's more interesting

882
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,200
I'm doing what

883
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,720
every other American does

884
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,580
every single night

885
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,360
turn on the TV

886
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,560
and watch some show

887
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,520
I think it's so funny that

888
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,440
sales and like

889
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,660
commercial ideas

890
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,300
have been around

891
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,340
for thousands of years

892
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,240
back to the days

893
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,560
of the

894
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,140
the Greeks

895
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,160
the great classical thinkers

896
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,660
and you know

897
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,380
you can convince people

898
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:36,880
of anything

899
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,640
using the right stuff

900
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,140
I'm having trouble

901
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,140
following the conversation

902
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,160
because these images

903
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,640
are distracting my eyes

904
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,220
and all it is

905
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,600
is the local Dallas news

906
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,000
I did it

907
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,940
I shut it off

908
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,560
oh it was local

909
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,120
oh you're still in

910
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,980
you're still in Texas

911
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,080
yeah

912
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,240
oh okay

913
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,320
I thought you would come back

914
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,580
yeah

915
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,120
well wouldn't I be

916
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,400
wouldn't I have been there

917
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,000
at the station

918
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,560
if I wasn't still in Texas

919
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,340
I don't know

920
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:02,640
I think

921
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,060
yeah instead

922
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,100
I had to run tapes

923
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,180
of you guys talking

924
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:06,780
yeah

925
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,080
no it looks like

926
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,640
we're stuck here

927
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,400
do you think I'm going to

928
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,520
drive back to Ohio

929
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,080
in the way the weather

930
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,780
is right now

931
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,420
there's like

932
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,160
you know

933
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,140
cows raining

934
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,700
from giant tornadoes

935
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,000
of clouds

936
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,600
everywhere

937
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,440
up and all the

938
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,120
all the way along our route

939
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,700
yeah

940
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,020
well the

941
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,380
you know

942
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:23,940
the monster

943
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,960
snowpocalypse

944
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,320
has come and gone

945
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,540
but that

946
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,560
didn't really hit Cleveland

947
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:28,840
no

948
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,600
didn't hit Cleveland

949
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,620
didn't hit Cleveland at all

950
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,360
I thought it was interesting

951
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,220
that it affected

952
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,700
so many lives negatively

953
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,520
how they're capitalizing

954
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:36,940
on like

955
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,680
it's snowing again today

956
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,080
we're going sledding

957
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,680
a lot of people

958
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,940
can't get out of their homes

959
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,960
to go sledding

960
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,500
yeah

961
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,420
yeah

962
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,320
that's so weird

963
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,640
yeah

964
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,700
go sledding off your roof

965
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,640
they're really selling

966
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,260
this storm

967
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,140
there's very little negative

968
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,180
about this storm

969
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,700
other than it's very powerful

970
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,500
in West Virginia

971
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,100
they got down

972
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,880
now that I'm

973
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,560
indulging in

974
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,060
normal media again

975
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,920
instead of just

976
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,820
only reading

977
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,620
which is what I used to do

978
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,700
for the last 20 years

979
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,660
I've noticed that

980
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,520
everything's scary

981
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,300
all the time

982
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,800
we're surrounded by enemies

983
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,300
the weather is always

984
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,220
about to do something

985
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,380
unbelievable

986
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:16,380


987
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,820
horrible and dangerous

988
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,800
to all of us

989
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,520
you can't trust anyone

990
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,020
there's thieves

991
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,020
and rapists

992
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,720
coming in from other countries

993
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,660
right and left

994
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,280
mean world syndrome

995
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,720
you go to the supermarket

996
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,580
and you're surrounded

997
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,200
by crazed terrorists

998
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,540
disguised as normal Americans

999
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,180
yes

1000
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,040
you understand

1001
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,880
the only reason

1002
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,520
they don't kill you

1003
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,420
is because they're not sure

1004
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,100
whether you're one

1005
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,500
how things are stacked together

1006
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,320
so neatly and sweet

1007
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
to keep people off their feet

1008
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,880
for 20 years

1009
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,520
I've been living

1010
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,440
in a fool's paradise

1011
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,260
where all

1012
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,300
the only people

1013
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,140
I had to talk to

1014
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,360
were subgeniuses

1015
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,740
and I didn't have to

1016
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,680
go to work

1017
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,220
for anyone else

1018
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,200
but myself

1019
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,180
and I never watched

1020
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,400
TV or listened

1021
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,160
to the radio

1022
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,880
except on very special occasions

1023
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,700
and now

1024
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,240
I guess I should just stay here

1025
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,300
and keep the TV on

1026
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,220
and never come back

1027
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:13,820
to Ohio

1028
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,180
oh gee

1029
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,300
I don't know

1030
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,980
because there's a TV

1031
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,000
in my house

1032
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,860
that doesn't have cable

1033
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,500
I could probably get it

1034
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,980
I suppose

1035
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,400
but

1036
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,220
we worked so hard

1037
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,300
to avoid that

1038
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,200
and now

1039
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,960
all those years

1040
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,600
of discipline

1041
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,420
undone

1042
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,100
in just a short time

1043
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,980
I can't wait

1044
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,880
for the next episode

1045
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,200
of The Expanse

1046
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,760
on Spotify

1047
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,320
Tuesday night

1048
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,700
I've heard it called

1049
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,960
Game of Thrones

1050
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,300
Insight

1051
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:46,640
Space

1052
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,120
that's what I've heard

1053
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,920
it described as

1054
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,600
I call it

1055
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,920
my mother-in-law

1056
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,680
and I call it

1057
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,520
the screwing

1058
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,060
in zero gravity show

1059
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,920
in fact

1060
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,760
the whole network

1061
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,560
the sci-fi network

1062
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,100
is the

1063
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,000
screwing while floating

1064
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,100
in the air network

1065
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,760
yeah I don't know

1066
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,000
it's not zero gravity

1067
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,220
it's because of magic

1068
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,400
or telekinesis

1069
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,540
but all of their trailers

1070
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,640
have people screwing

1071
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,660
while floating in the air

1072
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,500
in slow motion

1073
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:10,960
interesting

1074
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,920
for every show

1075
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,560
I'm really glad

1076
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,500
they've included that

1077
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,380
aren't you as well

1078
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,220
yeah

1079
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:16,300
yeah

1080
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,300


1081
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,300


1082
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,300


1083
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,300


1084
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,300


1085
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,300


1086
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,760
just think about

1087
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,780
the limitless possibilities

1088
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,860
because you could have

1089
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,960
like one day

1090
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,660
you could have people

1091
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,420
screwing in space

1092
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,120
and then the next day

1093
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,800
you could have people

1094
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,640
screwing in space

1095
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,360
and just like

1096
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,260
say a day after that

1097
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,160
you would have people

1098
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,920
screwing in space

1099
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,260
and so on and so forth

1100
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,340
well it's kept me

1101
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,960
from changing that dial

1102
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,800
well it hasn't kept you

1103
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,020
from changing your diapers

1104
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,660
has it?

1105
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,700
no

1106
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,020
continue

1107
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,120
continue

1108
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,500
continue

1109
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:46,740
and now

1110
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,780
let's take one more caller here

1111
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,820
and see what they have to say

1112
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,060
hello

1113
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,780
it's Bob

1114
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,700
oh hello Bob

1115
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,600
would you like to have dinner?

1116
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,720
oh I'm sorry

1117
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,380
not tonight

1118
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,520
got a date with someone else?

1119
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,620
no not a date

1120
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,760
I just want to finish

1121
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,440
some sketches

1122
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,000
somebody there to help?

1123
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,300
no just alone

1124
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,800
you're making me jealous

1125
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,860
don't talk like that Bob

1126
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,640
it's not true

1127
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,440
call me tomorrow night

1128
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,060
about seven

1129
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:13,800
okay

1130
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,360
bye

1131
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:14,800
bye

1132
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,240
excuse me a second

1133
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,520
hello

1134
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,600
the electronics department please

1135
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,760
hey how you doing?

1136
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,240
you're a sound effects man

1137
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,260
always fooling around

1138
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,400
with electronic devices

1139
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,080
fooling around

1140
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,080
with the light

1141
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,940
tell me

1142
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,580
do you suppose robots

1143
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,020
would enjoy listening to music?

1144
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,060
no

1145
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,460
I'm sending you a birthday message

1146
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,680
um

1147
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,340
you per hosting

1148
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:05,340


1149
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,900
Thank you.

1150
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,860
Thank you.

1151
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,600
Thank you.

1152
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,360
Thank you.

1153
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,880
Thank you.

1154
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,920
Thanks to Rural War Room

1155
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,460
for that ear-riping version of the song

1156
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,800
The Modern Age.

1157
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,120
Boy, howdy, they were so great

1158
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,820
at the devotional last year.

1159
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,940
Not man, not beast,

1160
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,680
but thing.

1161
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,820
And the music in the background here

1162
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,820
is by Cool Hand

1163
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,400
Chris.

1164
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,420
And now, back to Radio Synesthesia

1165
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,320
and the Brave Brave Callers.

1166
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
Hello, you're on the air.

1167
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,820
Hello, you're on the air.

1168
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,100
Cowards.

1169
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,180
Cowards!

1170
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,340
Cowards!

1171
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,060
It was the beeping

1172
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,020
noise caller.

1173
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,820
Call and run.

1174
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,280
That's how he talks.

1175
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:08,920
He sounds like

1176
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,200
meh, meh, meh, meh.

1177
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,880
Yeah, so we know

1178
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,580
that can be some

1179
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,040
alien form of communication

1180
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,280
that we can't understand.

1181
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,680
Right.

1182
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,660
It's a question

1183
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,700
of semantical discourse.

1184
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,460
If that guy had made

1185
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,740
me a little slower,

1186
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,360
he would have said,

1187
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,740
ugh, you know,

1188
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,800
he would have made,

1189
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,540
never mind.

1190
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,380
Or maybe they're called,

1191
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,580
the greys are calling in

1192
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,920
to complain about the X-Files.

1193
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,440
Who's calling in?

1194
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,080
Oh, the greys.

1195
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,300
Yeah, you know, I...

1196
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:36,400
To tell the truth,

1197
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,880
I was kind of unimpressed.

1198
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,340
I actually did...

1199
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,280
I can't say that I know

1200
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,260
the old show,

1201
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,760
but the thing I just watched

1202
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,460
seemed awfully old-fashioned

1203
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,420
and kind of...

1204
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,960
I don't know.

1205
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,640
I guess to me,

1206
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,420
all this alien

1207
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,760
and conspiracy stuff

1208
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,040
is so old.

1209
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:54,640
Yeah.

1210
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,120
Everybody knows that.

1211
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,720
Yeah, no kidding.

1212
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,660
Kids are born knowing that stuff.

1213
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,420
Why do they act like

1214
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,300
it's some big mystery?

1215
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,260
And now they've disguised

1216
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:02,960
themselves into

1217
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,160
misnomerizing it

1218
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,800
and ostracizing it.

1219
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:04,800


1220
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:04,800


1221
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:04,800


1222
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,040
And I was just like,

1223
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,100
I'm ostracizing every pilgrim

1224
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,120
that comes along the way.

1225
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,500
I mean, especially when they...

1226
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,620
When they take...

1227
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,500
You know, they get retro

1228
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,580
just for the sake of it

1229
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,820
because it represents retro

1230
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,260
and their brains are like...

1231
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,480
Like ice cubes are like...

1232
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,360
They don't move around

1233
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,200
very much, you know?

1234
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,500
You know, I can't believe

1235
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,160
how many...

1236
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,660
I noticed...

1237
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,300
Like, I don't read much anymore.

1238
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,680
I only read this one magazine

1239
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,920
called The TV Guide.

1240
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,260
And I noticed in that

1241
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,600
that, for instance,

1242
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,360
the History Channel

1243
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,300
was tonight,

1244
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,100
was...

1245
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,700
Alien Invaders

1246
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,100
or Alien Artifacts

1247
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,640
all night.

1248
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,860
It was an Alien Artifacts marathon

1249
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,220
on the History Channel.

1250
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,620
The Learning Channel

1251
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,840
was Honey Boo Boo all night.

1252
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,100
That's Learning now.

1253
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,720
And the Science Channel

1254
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,760
was, I think,

1255
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,680
Loch Ness Monster all night.

1256
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,940
So that's Science Night.

1257
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,620
This is why I will never

1258
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,320
pay for television.

1259
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,500
Well, I feel kind of strange

1260
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,680
because I actually did

1261
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,780
pay for this.

1262
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,100
I got the bill

1263
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,320
that my dad used to get

1264
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,980
and I lowered...

1265
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,600
I removed the pay channels

1266
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,140
because I can get pornography

1267
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,020
for free.

1268
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,180
It's not even pornography,

1269
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,660
you know, that makes...

1270
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,900
If I could just get

1271
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,520
the premium channels

1272
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,500
and nothing else,

1273
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,980
I might actually pay for that,

1274
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,980
but...

1275
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,060
But what if the...

1276
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,900
Well, like I say,

1277
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,080
I haven't done this

1278
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,580
for years and years and years

1279
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,820
and now it's...

1280
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,760
I don't know.

1281
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,280
I want to say

1282
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,300
it's a weird experience,

1283
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,460
but it's not at all.

1284
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
It's very normal.

1285
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,480
It's like how I felt

1286
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,440
in my summers

1287
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,100
in elementary school age.

1288
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,920
You'd be staring at a box.

1289
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,480
You'd be staring at a box.

1290
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,960
It's a terse emotional situation

1291
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,760
and look away

1292
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,620
at some commercial.

1293
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,500
It's...

1294
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,940
There's something weird.

1295
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,100
I probably sound

1296
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,460
like a crazy man saying,

1297
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,800
this television stuff,

1298
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,420
it's crazy.

1299
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,340
It'll rot your mind.

1300
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,800
But I've been...

1301
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,560
I started reading articles today

1302
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,600
on my phone

1303
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:02,740
about...

1304
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,540
about how people

1305
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,580
were swearing off

1306
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,860
using their phones so much.

1307
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,120
Hmm.

1308
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,620
And their idea

1309
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,540
of swearing off

1310
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,680
using the phone so much

1311
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,540
was to look up from it

1312
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,880
every five minutes.

1313
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,440
Yeah, it'll...

1314
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,320
Looking at those tiny screens,

1315
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:18,700
it's...

1316
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,640
not easy on the eyes.

1317
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,280
Oh, I...

1318
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,380
Oh, it's bad for your teeth.

1319
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,900
iPhone 6 Plus.

1320
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,860
Why, it's almost as big as...

1321
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,080
It's bigger than

1322
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,120
a pack of playing cards

1323
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,860
or...

1324
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:31,940
or...

1325
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:31,940


1326
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,660
extra long cigarettes.

1327
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,000
It's a butt pack.

1328
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,180
It's a huge screen.

1329
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,680
Well, whose butt

1330
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,820
could be bigger than that?

1331
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,640
Not just...

1332
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,580
If you're permanently...

1333
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,720
If you're permanently...

1334
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,620
near-sighted like me,

1335
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,140
it's...

1336
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,500
Heck, it's panorama.

1337
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,220
Hmm.

1338
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,360
Cinemascope.

1339
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,520
Hmm.

1340
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah, if I read stuff

1341
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,220
on my phone for too long,

1342
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,300
assuming that when I look up,

1343
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,260
I become even more near-sighted.

1344
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,020
Well, pretty soon,

1345
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,380
I won't have to look up at all.

1346
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,540
I'll just...

1347
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,240
I'll watch it on my TV shows

1348
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,940
that I'm newly addicted to

1349
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,820
on my phone.

1350
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,080
I won't even have to...

1351
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,980
And I'll get those diapers

1352
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,160
you were talking about earlier.

1353
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:06,960
I'll be set.

1354
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,360
Get to...

1355
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,220
Yeah, forget about the...

1356
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:09,960
Forget about the...

1357
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,640
the screen, man.

1358
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,060
Just...

1359
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,640
Gotta go with the neural implants

1360
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,520
to directly stimulate

1361
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,420
your visual cortex.

1362
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:18,760
Yep.

1363
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,740
Well, that's expensive

1364
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,680
and it still gives people

1365
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,900
motion sickness now.

1366
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:23,820
They're gonna...

1367
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,600
You're gonna have to...

1368
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:24,920
to...

1369
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,440
to put up with just

1370
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,880
the halfway measure

1371
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,780
of the Oculus

1372
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,220
or other VR platforms

1373
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,300
or other platforms.

1374
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,000
You know, those are...

1375
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,300
They started pricing those.

1376
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:35,940
They're gonna be about

1377
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,720
400 bucks.

1378
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,060
Yeah, the whole

1379
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,480
virtual reality thing,

1380
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,300
it's...

1381
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,000
in its infancy

1382
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,380
and it...

1383
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,780
You know, what...

1384
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,540
I remember back in the 90s

1385
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,960
when video games

1386
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,640
first started using

1387
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,620
3D graphics.

1388
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,220
Yeah, me too.

1389
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,020
And I've gone back and...

1390
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,600
Star Fox was the very first one.

1391
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,400
And I think there were

1392
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,080
some arcade games

1393
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,240
that used polygons

1394
00:36:59,240 --> 00:36:59,900
back then too.

1395
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,220
But yeah, you know,

1396
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:02,640
I've gone back

1397
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,220
and replayed some older games

1398
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,100
from, you know,

1399
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,980
the earlier generation

1400
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,700
of, you know,

1401
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,360
3D graphics

1402
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,200
and it hasn't aged well.

1403
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,160
But it was a necessary step

1404
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,260
to get to the point

1405
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:13,740
we're at now

1406
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,060
where it's almost photorealistic.

1407
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,840
Well, not really.

1408
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,820
I mean, I know

1409
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,160
it's photorealistic right now,

1410
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:19,720
but I mean...

1411
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:19,940
Almost.

1412
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,920
I think the gap

1413
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,280
and the marketing gap

1414
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,040
is much greater

1415
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,000
than you think, fellows.

1416
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,520
I think that the...

1417
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,680
the Portuguese...

1418
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,060
Huh?

1419
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,260
Huh?

1420
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
I don't understand.

1421
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,280
I'm not sure I understand

1422
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,100
where you're getting

1423
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,680
at either, Dave.

1424
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,840
Marketing gap?

1425
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,000
I don't see any gap.

1426
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,720
It seems to be

1427
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,160
wall-to-wall marketing to me.

1428
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,800
Oh, well, yes.

1429
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,940
I certainly agree with that.

1430
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,840
Wall-to-wall marketing.

1431
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,020
I meant a gap

1432
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,120
in the production

1433
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,840
and marketing

1434
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,220
of different versions.

1435
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,700
One step up,

1436
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,520
two steps sideways,

1437
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,020
two steps around.

1438
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,120
When all could be done

1439
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,460
at once

1440
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,940
with one swell foop.

1441
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,700
My foops are not very swell.

1442
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,880
I don't know.

1443
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,040
Mine are so...

1444
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,260
They're so bad

1445
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,160
that they kept me

1446
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,600
out of the draft

1447
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,940
in the 70s.

1448
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,160
My swoops were so bad

1449
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,300
that they...

1450
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,200
Sorry, you can't be in the Army.

1451
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,820
Oh, what a shame.

1452
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,540
Well, I had...

1453
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,500
Maybe I should go

1454
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,680
join the Navy instead.

1455
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:18,800
Hmm.

1456
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,240
Well, that was...

1457
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,680
I want to join Starfleet.

1458
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,220
I used to have a...

1459
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:23,860
What are those

1460
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,060
window stickers

1461
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,900
that people have for colleges?

1462
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,400
I used to have

1463
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,060
a Starfleet Academy

1464
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,040
window sticker

1465
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,700
in the rear window.

1466
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,280
No.

1467
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,040
No.

1468
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,780
That's when I was a kid.

1469
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,000
I heard earlier in the show

1470
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,180
Dave didn't even know

1471
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:35,960
what the blue screen

1472
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,820
of death was.

1473
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,420
Yeah.

1474
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,580
No, I've been

1475
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,980
staring for 20 years.

1476
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,500
as you know,

1477
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,480
because you saved me

1478
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,120
a couple times.

1479
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,660
Poor Dave.

1480
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,220
He's so old

1481
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,120
and out of it.

1482
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,800
He doesn't even know

1483
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,440
what the blue screen

1484
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,260
of death is.

1485
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,520
He doesn't know

1486
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,060
what the latest

1487
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,180
video games are.

1488
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,900
Well, let me tell you

1489
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,960
what the blue screen

1490
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,660
of death was.

1491
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,500
I wasn't sure.

1492
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,700
I wasn't sure

1493
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,780
if I was sure.

1494
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,000
You'll find out

1495
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,880
what the blue screen

1496
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,040
of death is, Dave.

1497
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,600
Oh, yes.

1498
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,620
Because I can't

1499
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,200
win at them.

1500
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,740
It's very difficult

1501
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,560
for me to win

1502
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,060
or to even do

1503
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,780
anything normal

1504
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,740
on Spazmari.

1505
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,640
Well, you have to

1506
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,200
go out and get

1507
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,840
that computers

1508
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,760
for dummies book

1509
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,440
and then get the

1510
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,420
dummies for computers

1511
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,200
card

1512
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,760
and then plug

1513
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,500
into the matrix

1514
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,660
and there you go.

1515
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,420
It's all click,

1516
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:22,820
click, click,

1517
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,760
wham, bam, bam.

1518
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,300
There you are.

1519
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
But you're saying

1520
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,720
that automatically

1521
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,000
I'll want to love

1522
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,760
video games

1523
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,560
when I told you

1524
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,280
I have difficulty

1525
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,880
with maneuvering.

1526
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,020
Right?

1527
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,100


1528
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,620
in them.

1529
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,980
Everybody does.

1530
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,300
Not really.

1531
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,120
It's just like

1532
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,320
I reach a certain point

1533
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,140
like I don't really care

1534
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,120
even if it looks

1535
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,480
like a movie.

1536
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,040
You never made it

1537
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,060
past that very first

1538
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,120
Goomba in Super Mario

1539
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,480
levels,

1540
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,000
Super Mario World,

1541
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,580
Super Mario Brothers

1542
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,080
level 1.

1543
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,660
You never killed

1544
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:47,720
that person, right?

1545
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,500
I know we've come

1546
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,080
a long way

1547
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,040
as far as noises

1548
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,540
are concerned

1549
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,140
and making it look

1550
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,760
like a car

1551
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,600
is actually crashing

1552
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,080
into you

1553
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,680
and shooting you

1554
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,220
with a shotgun

1555
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,200
at the same time,

1556
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,580
but that's a big

1557
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,340
butt you've got

1558
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,400
and I wish you

1559
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,060
would be tracing

1560
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,840
around the windows,

1561
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,660
where the apartment

1562
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,400
colors can

1563
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,140
get a load of it.

1564
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:07,580
However,

1565
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
and it's a big

1566
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,000
however,

1567
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,780
I get slack

1568
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,320
out of them

1569
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:11,600
anyway.

1570
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,760
But I know

1571
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,440
I know where

1572
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,920
I know where

1573
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,260
you old people

1574
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,040
are coming from,

1575
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:18,500
Dave.

1576
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,360
You people,

1577
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,340
you old, old people

1578
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:21,900
that are like

1579
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,780
three years older

1580
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,260
than me.

1581
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,760
I was that way too,

1582
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,740
but now I'm young.

1583
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,040
Do you remember

1584
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,160
the movie Zardoz?

1585
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,040
Yeah, sure.

1586
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,240
You said,

1587
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:31,680
you know,

1588
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:31,820
the movie Zardoz

1589
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:31,960
is the place

1590
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,960
where we're coming from.

1591
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,100
It's the hidden city.

1592
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,860
And you know,

1593
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,480
the place where

1594
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,260
we're coming from

1595
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:37,880
is definitely

1596
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,420
outside the dome.

1597
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,480
It's true.

1598
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:41,940
I mean,

1599
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,920
we do have barbarians.

1600
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,780
Let's face it, boys.

1601
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,040
We're not going

1602
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,600
to be inside the dome.

1603
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,900
You do understand

1604
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,720
that, right?

1605
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,700
We're going to be

1606
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,220
we are outside

1607
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,960
the dome

1608
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,720
and we're going

1609
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,240
to remain

1610
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,420
outside the dome.

1611
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,080
They're not going

1612
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,740
to let us

1613
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,440
in the dome.

1614
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,600
They might throw

1615
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,300
us guns

1616
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,740
and tell us

1617
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,900
our penises are bad

1618
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,720
and they might send

1619
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,500
giant heads

1620
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,300
with pipes

1621
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,380
to guide us.

1622
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,160
But we're not

1623
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,740
going to be getting

1624
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,460
into the dome.

1625
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,160
Beware the false pipes.

1626
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,520
Yeah, beware

1627
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,260
the false pipes

1628
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:15,920
and the big heads

1629
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,780
with no pipes.

1630
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,580
But either way,

1631
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,400
the dome,

1632
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,400
the folks

1633
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,080
are in the dome.

1634
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,140
They're not letting

1635
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,940
anybody else in.

1636
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,560
But they're all

1637
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,300
old and stinky

1638
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:26,860
and they think

1639
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,820
they're smart and sweet

1640
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,240
in the dome,

1641
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,440
under the dome.

1642
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:31,620
Well,

1643
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:31,640
you know,

1644
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,160
they may be bored

1645
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:33,980
and crazy,

1646
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,120
but they're still

1647
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,120
not going to let us in.

1648
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,140
We need no dome.

1649
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,560
Well, maybe

1650
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,420
they might let

1651
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,520
Sean Connery in

1652
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,500
if he has a silly

1653
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,540
enough looking outfit.

1654
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,540
We can get Devo

1655
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,360
to make energy domes

1656
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:46,740
for us.

1657
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,660
Yeah, we can make

1658
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,700
our very own dome

1659
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,500
and we wouldn't

1660
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,360
let any of them

1661
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,020
come in there

1662
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,620
on punishment

1663
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,960
of pulling

1664
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,660
their scabs

1665
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,440
off or something.

1666
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:57,880
Something really,

1667
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,020
you know,

1668
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,360
like water

1669
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,600
and water

1670
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,600
or toothpaste

1671
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,400
or something.

1672
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,160
Well, I don't think

1673
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,300
even Devo can get

1674
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,040
inside the dome.

1675
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,280
I bet Mark Mothersbaugh

1676
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,380
thinks he's going

1677
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,200
to get in the dome

1678
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,800
at the last minute.

1679
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,400
Danny Elfman

1680
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:14,820
will get in

1681
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,720
right in front of him

1682
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,400
and then they'll slam

1683
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,000
the door and go,

1684
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,600
sorry, Mark.

1685
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,900
No, you and Pee Wee Herman

1686
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,520
are going to have

1687
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,740
to stay outside the dome.

1688
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,720
Well, it's Pee Wee

1689
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,180
and you and Dan

1690
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,500
and all those

1691
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,160
other losers.

1692
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,360
All right,

1693
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,240
let's bring one more

1694
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:29,720
caller on.

1695
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,580
You're on the air.

1696
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,360
Hey, I have a question.

1697
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,160
Okay.

1698
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,740
So, those other guys

1699
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,520
calling in,

1700
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,800
do they really talk

1701
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,000
like that in real life?

1702
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,040
Yes, they do.

1703
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,400
I have met all three

1704
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,240
of them in person before

1705
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,320
and they look

1706
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,580
just like they sound, too.

1707
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,880
Are you referring to us?

1708
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,940
Are you referring

1709
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,740
to each other?

1710
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,360
I've got a house.

1711
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,100
I've got a house.

1712
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,000
Hey, can you play

1713
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,780
something by heart?

1714
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,700
What do you want

1715
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,440
to hear by heart?

1716
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,220
I don't know,

1717
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:58,800
anything you're

1718
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,280
in the mood for.

1719
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,000
Do you normally,

1720
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,780
do you normally

1721
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,440
listen to this show?

1722
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:02,740
What?

1723
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,380
Do you normally

1724
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,340
listen to this show

1725
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,020
that's on right now?

1726
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,520
Here and there,

1727
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,480
yeah, a little bit.

1728
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,040
Abnormally.

1729
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,140
I was going to guess

1730
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:10,600
that it wasn't

1731
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,700
a regular part

1732
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,800
of your routine.

1733
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,760
I don't really

1734
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,360
take requests

1735
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:15,960
on this show

1736
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,600
and I don't think

1737
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,080
I've ever played

1738
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,600
anything by heart

1739
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,040
on this show before.

1740
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:21,860
Maybe that's

1741
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,840
the Friday night show

1742
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,640
I'm thinking of.

1743
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:24,580
Hmm.

1744
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,280
Could be.

1745
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,160
It's Sunday night,

1746
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:28,700
you should be

1747
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,740
in church, young lady.

1748
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:30,720
What?

1749
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:31,860
This late?

1750
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,260
It's only going to be

1751
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:33,660
Sunday night

1752
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,000
for another,

1753
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,880
another 17 minutes here.

1754
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,800
Yeah, but I'm in Texas

1755
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,980
and it's Sunday for me.

1756
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,760
I've got to work

1757
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,020
until,

1758
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,360
for another hour

1759
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,160
and a half almost.

1760
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,120
Breaking the Sabbath?

1761
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:45,840
Well,

1762
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,680
you're working.

1763
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,800
That's my job.

1764
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,140
That's right.

1765
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,440
You know what just

1766
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:50,860
occurred to me

1767
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,260
the other day?

1768
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,300
I,

1769
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,660
I got a text message

1770
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,140
from somebody

1771
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:55,520
that said,

1772
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,120
sup?

1773
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:57,460
Like,

1774
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:57,900
S-U-P

1775
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,020
with a question mark?

1776
00:43:59,260 --> 00:43:59,980
And I thought,

1777
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,340
I thought they meant

1778
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:00,940
to say, like,

1779
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,320
what's up?

1780
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,920
And I took that as,

1781
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,140
oh,

1782
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,820
are you inviting me

1783
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,400
to a late dinner?

1784
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:06,380
Like,

1785
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,380
would you like to sup?

1786
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,460
Sup with me,

1787
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:09,720
please.

1788
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:10,240
No,

1789
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,040
nobody likes a literalist,

1790
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,200
Dr. Sinister.

1791
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:14,840
I just like it

1792
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,380
when a phrase can have,

1793
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,160
when a word can have

1794
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,700
multiple meanings.

1795
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:18,800
I know,

1796
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,280
I know.

1797
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,140
I do that to people,

1798
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:21,460
too.

1799
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:22,620
Well,

1800
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:22,960
maybe you

1801
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,320
might have just

1802
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:25,680
misunderstood

1803
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,740
and thought that was

1804
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,180
an actual

1805
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,860
frame of reference.

1806
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:29,740
Sup?

1807
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,440
Mm-hmm.

1808
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,320
Um,

1809
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,260
I found myself

1810
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,620
typing the phrase

1811
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,380
K-T-H-X

1812
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,140
for okay,

1813
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:38,800
thanks,

1814
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,340
or K-bye,

1815
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,480
and even using

1816
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,240
emojis,

1817
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,520
which I never,

1818
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,300
ever did

1819
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,480
in my previous life

1820
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,000
before I,

1821
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,460
I joined the Matrix.

1822
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,220
And now I'm,

1823
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,560
not only can I

1824
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,300
use emojis,

1825
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,120
I can call it

1826
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,300
clips for movies

1827
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:53,980
to illustrate

1828
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,860
my point

1829
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,720
when I don't want to

1830
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,440
go to the trouble

1831
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,280
of speaking

1832
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,980
my text message.

1833
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,940
To someone.

1834
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,340
You know,

1835
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:02,980
the whole, uh,

1836
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:03,940
K-thanks thing,

1837
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:04,780
and, yeah,

1838
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,140
I don't know,

1839
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,260
I think I've only ever

1840
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:06,960
used those to be

1841
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,740
snarky, like...

1842
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,140
Right.

1843
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,960
I like the poop emoji.

1844
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,840
It's a turd

1845
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,620
with a smiley face.

1846
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:14,720
Right.

1847
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,340
Yeah.

1848
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,000
It is very popular

1849
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,520
right now.

1850
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,420
Did you know

1851
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,520
the true story,

1852
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,980
the first three letters

1853
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,180
sent across the internet

1854
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,440
were LOL?

1855
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:26,900
No.

1856
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,320
For real.

1857
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,000
Yes.

1858
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:29,640
What was this?

1859
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,300
Um,

1860
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,240
I don't know,

1861
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:32,880
was it 1969

1862
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,680
or early,

1863
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,120
you know,

1864
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:34,520
the first time

1865
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,260
they hooked up computers

1866
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:35,980
over, uh,

1867
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,260
telecom networks?

1868
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:38,640
Yeah, but it didn't mean

1869
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,420
lacking out well.

1870
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:40,340
No, it didn't mean that,

1871
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,140
but those were the first

1872
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,140
three letters sent over

1873
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,380
because the first

1874
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,180
command line,

1875
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,640
you get a command line

1876
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:45,940
prompt.

1877
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,720
What you had to do

1878
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,180
back in...

1879
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,240
LOL, LOL, LOL, LOL.

1880
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,420
Yeah, what you had to do

1881
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,180
back in the old days

1882
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,060
was you get a, um,

1883
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,420
a command prompt

1884
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,920
and you would type

1885
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,660
in the word log

1886
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,740
to log into

1887
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:00,040
the computer

1888
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:00,780
you were trying to access.

1889
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,140
So they typed in

1890
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:02,600
the letters L,

1891
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,540
they typed in the letter O,

1892
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,620
and then their computer crashed.

1893
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,020
So they had to reboot

1894
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,760
the computer

1895
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,300
and then they

1896
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,680
typed in log.

1897
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:10,580
So the third one

1898
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,420
was another L,

1899
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,280
their second attempt

1900
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,220
at typing in the word log.

1901
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,300
You're so believable,

1902
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,420
but I think it might be

1903
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,020
poo-poo.

1904
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,600
I'm not sure,

1905
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,460
but I think you made that up.

1906
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,780
I didn't make it up.

1907
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,720
I heard it somewhere.

1908
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,900
I don't know if it's true or not.

1909
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,640
If it was made up,

1910
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,500
it was not made up by me.

1911
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:27,820
So you had a very percent

1912
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,120
anecdotal,

1913
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:29,520
just like,

1914
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,780
where's the fruit and egg sauce?

1915
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,520
You're going to need

1916
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,600
an antidote after listening

1917
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,920
to my anecdotes for a while.

1918
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,080
It's puerile.

1919
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,500
Puerile.

1920
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,360
I like that word.

1921
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,540
Are there still four people

1922
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,660
on the phone?

1923
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:43,360
Yes, there are.

1924
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,560
Okay, then I'm going to

1925
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,660
call, follow my sword

1926
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,980
so someone else can call in.

1927
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,340
Have a great week, everybody.

1928
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,500
All right, thank you, Mark.

1929
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:50,760
What a noble guy.

1930
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,140
Look at the blood.

1931
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,020
His sacrifice

1932
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,320
shall not be in vain.

1933
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,400
Oh, I think we lost Dave, too.

1934
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,680
Dave was already lost.

1935
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,880
Oh, no, I hung up on Dave.

1936
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,400
That was my mistake.

1937
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,120
Dave was lost.

1938
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,660
Hello, you're on the air.

1939
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,980
Hello, you are on the air.

1940
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:17,680
Uh-oh.

1941
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,740
Those rat bastards.

1942
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,600
Those hang-up things

1943
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,640
kill my ear.

1944
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,540
I can barely hear

1945
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,060
some things like Dave.

1946
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,900
I can hear you perfectly well.

1947
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,560
Those hang-ups,

1948
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,160
they come through to us callers

1949
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,760
as a sudden sharp knife

1950
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,480
in the ear.

1951
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,640
I've only got one good ear.

1952
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:36,340
Yeah.

1953
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:37,780
There it went.

1954
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,660
It's gone now.

1955
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,660
When a functional technology

1956
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,320
becomes obsolete, obsolete,

1957
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,780
obsolete, obsolete, obsolete,

1958
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,080
obsolete, obsolete,

1959
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,340
it can then become our...

1960
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,180
...

1961
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:50,640
...

1962
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:52,400
...

1963
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:53,720
...

1964
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:53,800
...

1965
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:53,800


1966
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:53,800


1967
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:53,800


1968
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:53,800


1969
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:53,800


1970
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:53,800


1971
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:53,820
...

1972
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:53,880
...

1973
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:53,920
...

1974
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:53,920


1975
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:53,940
...

1976
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,260
...

1977
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:54,260


1978
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:54,280
...

1979
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:54,280


1980
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:54,280


1981
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:54,280


1982
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:54,280


1983
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:54,720
...

1984
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:54,980
...

1985
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:54,980


1986
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:54,980


1987
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:57,560
...

1988
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:57,560


1989
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,820
obsolete, obsolete.

1990
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,740
We are obsolete, obsolete.

1991
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:08,100
We are obsolete, obsolete we are obsolete, obsolete.

1992
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,420
We are.

1993
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:09,960
Yay!

1994
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,060
...

1995
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:13,220
...

1996
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:13,700
...

1997
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,800
...

1998
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,240
Rubber buns.

1999
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:24,600
...

2000
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,780
Rubber bands scare radio pods

2001
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,460
Have replaced our broken hearts

2002
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,800
Things will never be the way they used to be

2003
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,380
Elevating through technology

2004
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,920
A clockwork brain, alphanumeric thoughts

2005
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:07,300
Synthetic skin, but never once

2006
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,760
Things will never be the way they used to be

2007
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,760
Better living through technology

2008
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,120
I'm so neat

2009
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,560
I'm so neat

2010
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,080
We are

2011
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,180
We are

2012
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:56,180


2013
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:08,100
We've found the keys to remove the locks

2014
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,580
We've opened up Pandora's box

2015
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:21,000
Things will never be the way they used to be

2016
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,580
Better living through technology

2017
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:24,580


2018
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:24,580


2019
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:24,580


2020
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:59,260
We are obsolete by the Fantastic Plastics,

2021
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:04,300
another band that put on a great visual show at the Devotional in Cleveland.

2022
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:09,600
Great fun for those of us who are old, but not obsolete.

2023
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,200
And now, from Lemur, the news.

2024
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,140
From NPR News in Washington, I'm selling their mother for fun.

2025
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,560
At least the fighting began.

2026
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,460
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel wants tunnels.

2027
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:30,140
Netanyahu said a threat of PR news from the sky is not acceptable.

2028
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:35,260
I'm inside two separate underground militarized neutral one-day tunnels

2029
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:38,060
under a sparked strip step in Jerusalem.

2030
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,940
Police in Philadelphia say they were selling fruit on a corner in other crimes.

2031
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,640
Well, the numbers aren't in yet.

2032
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,960
The second during the first three of the year, around a 3-3 as opposed to the 2-2 quarter.

2033
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,020
The .9 first quarter as opposed to the second quarter.

2034
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,780
On Wall Street, 22-16-942.

2035
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:58,260
Federal Appeals Court has ruled that block-shaped steel atheists

2036
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,660
may be sexually assaulted in a family dollar tree.

2037
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,100
Benjamin Netanyahu says you're listening to PR News in Washington.

2038
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,580
Hello, you're on the air.

2039
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,380
Good evening, Dr. Sosa. This is the management calling.

2040
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:13,180
Always good to hear from the management. What's going on?

2041
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,740
The midget. The midget's face.

2042
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,280
I just want to let you know your show's doing okay tonight.

2043
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,400
I give it a B, B-plus rating.

2044
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,200
I think you can do a little better, but ultimately I'm going to give you a pass

2045
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,800
and I'll let you be on the air next week because management always knows what's best

2046
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,680
and I think that the listeners need more of your show.

2047
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,260
Well, screw you, dude. You don't know what you're talking about.

2048
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,840
This show sucks.

2049
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,320
I always know what I'm talking about.

2050
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,240
This show sucks.

2051
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,480
We gotta B.

2052
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,200
B-B-W-6-B-B-C.

2053
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,380
This show is terrible.

2054
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,920
The listeners hate it.

2055
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,540
And I'm just doing it to spite them.

2056
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:57,040
Well, whatever your gimmick or shtick is, I like the program.

2057
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,820
I give it my blessing.

2058
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,720
Continue on.

2059
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,400
Yeah, I talk softly and I carry a big shtick.

2060
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,700
Well, whatever you want to call it, you're doing fine.

2061
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:07,820
It's good.

2062
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,280
Oh, Dr. Sosa, your shtick is good.

2063
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,840
I hope that everybody who's listening is going to vote for Trump

2064
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,800
because we need to take America back.

2065
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,560
We need to make it great again.

2066
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,280
Oh, you're just another Trump chump.

2067
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,160
It's going to be huge.

2068
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,520
It's going to be a huge, huge success.

2069
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,880
I'm sure it'll be a huge success.

2070
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,760
You know what's funny is a lot of polls so far show

2071
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,960
Bernie Sanders actually doing better in a general matchup

2072
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,200
against Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton does.

2073
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,820
Those polls are flawed.

2074
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,920
I've been working with Trump a long time.

2075
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,140
They're flawed.

2076
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:44,960
Trump's going to win.

2077
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,080
He's going to make this country great again.

2078
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,160
It's going to be awesome.

2079
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,160
It's going to be a great country.

2080
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:57,120
Once again, and we can all rest assured that Donald Trump will save us

2081
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,860
from the enemies, wherever they may be.

2082
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,660
He's going to do a great thing.

2083
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,260
Right.

2084
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,080
America will grate our enemies up like grated cheese.

2085
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,580
We'll grate up the Mexicans.

2086
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,080
We'll grate up the Canadians.

2087
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,780
We'll grate them all up in the great chipper of anger,

2088
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,200
of middle class frustrated anger.

2089
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,280
He's not going to do that.

2090
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,960
He's just going to make America great again.

2091
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,480
I don't know how.

2092
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,100
Are you saying America is not great now?

2093
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,820
I'm saying he's going to make it greater.

2094
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:26,520
It's a treason.

2095
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,140
Why do you hate America?

2096
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,820
Nobody hates America.

2097
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,220
Everybody loves America.

2098
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,660
Some are doing a little better than others.

2099
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,060
We want to make it great for everybody.

2100
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,780
Why do you hate our freezers?

2101
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:41,640
Except for Muslims.

2102
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,440
We're not going to make it great for Muslims.

2103
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,160
That's not true.

2104
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,820
And Italians and Mexicans and Texans.

2105
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,140
We'll need to build a wall.

2106
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,560
We'll build a wall around Ohio.

2107
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:53,660
That's it.

2108
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,580
And we'll make the Canadians pay for it.

2109
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:55,780
No.

2110
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:01,220
We'll make the Kentucky and Pennsylvania pay for it.

2111
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:09,120
We should just put like a bunch of electric, like electrical stuff in the Ohio River.

2112
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:10,980
Let's not.

2113
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:11,320
Yeah.

2114
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,300
Electric eels in the Ohio River.

2115
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,040
Like a moat.

2116
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,840
A moat full of electric eels.

2117
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,740
We'll make the Russians pay for it.

2118
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:18,960
There we go.

2119
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:20,320
We're good.

2120
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,060
We're good.

2121
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:21,860
We're negotiators.

2122
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:22,620
That's all you need.

2123
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,500
You got to have good negotiating skills.

2124
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,940
And if they don't like your deal, then you kill them, you kill their families.

2125
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:30,940
You kill their children.

2126
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:31,880
You kill their mothers.

2127
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:32,880
You kill all of them.

2128
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,060
Yeah.

2129
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,520
You got to rip it out root and stem.

2130
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,060
Yeah.

2131
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,540
If you don't kill them, they're going to hate you.

2132
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:38,840
Yeah.

2133
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,800
It's just like wiping out vermin in your home.

2134
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:47,860
Sure, you can kill all the bugs, but if there's still eggs left behind that you didn't destroy,

2135
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,780
that's why you got to kill the babies too.

2136
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,000
If you don't kill them, they think less of you.

2137
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:54,420
That's right.

2138
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,940
They know that you're just weak.

2139
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:01,680
Well, you know, I've said before, if you vote Dr. Sinister for president, all right, I'm

2140
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,420
running on a single issue platform.

2141
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,600
Dr. Sinister for president.

2142
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:10,280
If you elect me president, I promise you on day one at 12.01 PM, I'm going to skip the

2143
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,500
inauguration ceremony and everything.

2144
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,200
I'm just going to have the chief justice there in the oval office waiting for me.

2145
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,560
I'll take the oath of office.

2146
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,220
No pomp and circumstance.

2147
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,760
And then at 12.01 PM on January 20th, 2020, I'm going to have the chief justice there

2148
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:20,760


2149
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,080
in 2017.

2150
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,820
I'm going to press the big red button.

2151
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,640
I will launch all of our nukes simultaneously.

2152
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,820
I will make us the nation to end all nations.

2153
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:28,580
Literally.

2154
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:33,400
I promise you nuclear annihilation.

2155
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,020
That is my one campaign issue.

2156
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:41,720
I can no longer support that idea.

2157
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:46,000
So as long as you don't go with that idea, I...

2158
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,740
My advice to everyone, my advice to everyone will be to gather in very small groups, and

2159
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,740
various population centers.

2160
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,160
And we try to get as many people crammed into as few places as possible.

2161
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,780
So as many people as possible can get the mercy of being at ground zero.

2162
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,580
It's better to be vaporized instantly than die of radiation poisoning.

2163
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,520
The management does not support this idea, but...

2164
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,160
Well, guess what?

2165
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,940
We're kicking the management out.

2166
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,400
That's right, man.

2167
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,840
We're taking this station back from people like you.

2168
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,540
Hello, you're on the air.

2169
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:20,560
Thanks.

2170
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,160
Oh, shut up.

2171
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:22,580
You suck.

2172
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,420
We're going to destroy all the non-people.

2173
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,800
We'll build a wall around...

2174
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,880
That last call was such an idiot.

2175
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,360
...and make WCS be great again.

2176
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,240
It will grate on the ears of the listeners like it used to.

2177
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,100
Yes.

2178
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,760
An hour ago during our slot.

2179
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,000
Yeah, yeah.

2180
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,720
I haven't played enough noise lately.

2181
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,300
I should play some more noise.

2182
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,840
Well, if...

2183
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,480
I think we might be getting close to the end of the program here.

2184
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,400
Nobody else seems to be...

2185
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,420
I think we're going to have to call it a day.

2186
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:50,740
...on calling in.

2187
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,860
Praise Bob in his mercy.

2188
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,200
Well, praise his sacred scribe as well.

2189
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,560
Thank you, Reverend Stang, for your call tonight.

2190
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:58,440
Oh, yeah.

2191
00:57:58,860 --> 00:57:59,320
Oh, yeah.

2192
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:00,680
Oh, yeah.

2193
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:00,740


2194
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,360
That's what I say to everyone.

2195
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:03,980
Oh, yeah.

2196
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:05,420
That's right.

2197
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:05,820
Oh, yeah.

2198
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,200
Como va?

2199
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:07,340
Oh, yeah.

2200
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,400
Oh, yeah.

2201
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,000
Oh, yeah.

2202
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,440
Sex music.

2203
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:11,460
Oh, yeah.

2204
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,380
All right.

2205
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,140
Well, thank you very much.

2206
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,740
We'll talk to you soon, I hope.

2207
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2208
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2209
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:19,520
All right.

2210
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,520


2211
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,800
You got that.

2212
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:21,800


2213
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,180
This is how you ride.

2214
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:39,800
Hey.

2215
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:39,800


2216
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,300
Will you ride this?

2217
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,140
Yeah.

2218
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:45,920

Oh, my God.

2228
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:49,500
It is.

2229
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:49,500


2230
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:49,500
