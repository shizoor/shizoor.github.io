1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:09,320
More than two decades after the Doors, he's still hot, he's sexy, and he's hunting

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,740
rabbits. He's Elmer Fudd.

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:18,140
White as on a storm, and rabbits in the woods.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,900
Forget Val Kilmer. Elmer Fudd is Jim Morrison.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,500
Rabbit, yes doc? I want to kill you.

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,540
With a maroon.

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,620
Kill the rabbit, kill the rabbit, kill the rabbit.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,760
Come on baby, wipe my fire.

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,900
It's right to set the night on fire.

10
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,160
Mr. Fudd, Mr. Fudd, you've gone too far.

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,000
Leave me alone.

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,000
There's a city ordinance against cooking a rabbit on stage.

13
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,700
Let's just say I was testing the boundaries.

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:55,880
Okay.

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,260
It's a reality.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,100
There are things known, and there are things unknown.

17
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,620
And in between there is Elmer Fudd.

18
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,560
Aw nuts, a bad ass and twipper.

19
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,940
Rabbits, rabbits, rabbits.

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,520
Elmer Fudd is Jim Morrison.

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,420
Coming soon to a theater near you.

22
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,960
Quiet, understand?

23
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,900
All right, we're going to run lines in 2D.

24
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,720
Come on boys.

25
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,180
It's locking up.

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,360
Quiet!

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Roll sound.

28
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,180
D.

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,420
C5 take 54.

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,480
There's 220 million Americans out there.

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,200
Can't wait to have their minds twisted and bent.

32
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,260
If I can't do it, by God, nobody can.

33
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,600
I'm going to have to do it again.

34
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,320
Action.

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,040
The Self Genius Hour of Slash.

36
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,420
My fellow roaches, today we face a cataclysmic crisis.

37
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,620
Once again, greedy humans are attempting to withhold food from us, just as they have for

38
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,560
millions of years.

39
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,820
They were not content to simply throw us out of the Garden of Eden.

40
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,080
Now they are on a mission to destroy us.

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,240
Through all the centuries of conflict, we roaches as a species have never killed a single

42
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,920
human being.

43
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,780
Not one.

44
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,120
So why is man obsessed with the idea that he has the right to annihilate us, to commit

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,240
genocide on an entire race?

46
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,120
I'll tell you.

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,900
It's because man feels what he does not understand.

48
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,060
He's not interested in the future.

49
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,060


50
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,060


51
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,460
We think he has the right, and he lives up to our plans.

52
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,800
I trust the only person left to trust.

53
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,500
Me.

54
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,500
Get off the air!

55
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:11,460
Can you be ready for four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four!

56
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,320
Bob!

57
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,040
Bob!

58
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,760
Bob!

59
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,300
Bob!

60
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,000
Bob!

61
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,460
All right, now imagine if you will, nothing.

62
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,400
Nothing.

63
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,760
Nothing.

64
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,760
We hear God's voice.

65
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,480
Oh, thanks, God.

66
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,520
Yeah, where's the voice of God there?

67
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,240
You only hear that on the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack, dear friends.

68
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:14,840
Very few other radio, religious radio programs will actually play the voice of the Lord God on the radio.

69
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,560
A tape, an old tape, in fact.

70
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,840
In this case, submitted by Olo T. Schickl.

71
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,260
Yes, a new contributor to the show.

72
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,760
There's bits and pieces of his varying material coming up.

73
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,320
And, well, in the show script notes, it says, could cut in here.

74
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:43,420
So I'm cutting in to, well, I guess to catch some of the subgeniuses up on recent news.

75
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,740
We're about to mail out a newsletter.

76
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,280
And since the Hour of Slack listeners don't seem to be readers for the most part,

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,700
I'll go ahead and tell you what is on this little newsletter.

78
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,100
It says here, no.

79
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:12,140
In answer to the question most asked of us lately, we are not dead.

80
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,700
Not only are we still alive and twitching reflexively, friends,

81
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,980
but we have just indeed achieved our greatest victory.

82
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,900
Yet, for lo, lo, it is done.

83
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,080
Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon, the last New Testament.

84
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:44,040
Our fourth book for the mainstream conspiracy publishers of Simon & Schuster has indeed been finished.

85
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,120
What's a good background music I could put on for this sort of news?

86
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,700
You know, and at least, dear friends,

87
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,960
it is written.

88
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,660
Yes, it is written.

89
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,900
And the existing art has been woven into it.

90
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,440
And it lies to lies now to perform the final design work.

91
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:16,260
And finally, now we begin the long and arduous process of catching up with everything and everyone that had to be put off for the last few months.

92
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,520
See, people who didn't order anything from us probably had good reasons.

93
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,180
They had to think that we'd closed up shop, closed the church,

94
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,000
because due to the book deadline pressures and sabotage by the conspiracy,

95
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,200
we haven't mailed out a...

96
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,100
We'll admit it, we haven't mailed a new start fist in almost two years.

97
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,720
We didn't even send out excess bus cards.

98
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,820
And if you aren't lucky enough to live in a town where the hour of slack is broadcast weekly,

99
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,980
why, there has been little to indicate to you that we were alive.

100
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,960
In fact, somebody called the station.

101
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:57,360
From Austin last week and asked Ranger Rita if it was true that Reverend Stang had died.

102
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,500
And I'm afraid that's wishful thinking on the parts of you backsliders.

103
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,880
Some of you backsliders, most likely, I figure.

104
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,520
Uh, sorry.

105
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,260
I hate, I hate too much.

106
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,420
And I owe too much to die yet, you sorry bastards.

107
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,840
Anyway, our new book, which incidentally is so utter,

108
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
and relentlessly true,

109
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,520
that old-time sub-genii and newcomers alike

110
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,040
will be laughing till their guts bleed

111
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,100
and be fouling their pants with sheer astonishment.

112
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,700
This new book, now, it was supposedly finished last year.

113
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,800
Uh, but the task of organizing and translating the 48 lawn bags

114
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,540
full of Dobbs scrawlings on post-it notes,

115
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,940
old envelopes, pizza crumb,

116
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,780
and so forth,

117
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,200
and distilling all that down into 200

118
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,240
profusely illustrated pages of purity of essence.

119
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,180
Of Dobbs' word.

120
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,500
That ended up taking two years.

121
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,760
And we should have stopped answering personal mail and phone calls a lot sooner.

122
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,620
So don't feel bad, uh, listeners,

123
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,740
if yours wasn't the only letter, article, tape,

124
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,460
hate mail, inane question, artwork, magazine, book videotape request

125
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,620
to make you famous, anything.

126
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,120
Whatever.

127
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,560
That had to be set aside temporarily.

128
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:29,440
Uh, yeah, we got this mountain of brown envelopes full of confessions and things, uh,

129
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,600
stacking up.

130
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,200
Half the hour of slack contributors probably didn't know until now

131
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,040
that their stuff was played on the show.

132
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,720
Uh, uh, but, uh,

133
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,080
but you know, dear friends,

134
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,200
we are engaged in an effort

135
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,300
to conquer the entire planet

136
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,840
or else leave it a smoldering wreck!

137
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,260
And all of us exist only to be used by Dobbs

138
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,340
however he sees fit!

139
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,860
And if we waste time responding in kind

140
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,320
to everything that's said to us, we'll never have time to see that it is

141
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,400
used properly.

142
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,200
And, uh,

143
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,960
So there will be a new stark fist, uh, ASAP, whatever that means.

144
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,440
You know, uh, sales have slowed down a bit due to our

145
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,880
a book required exit from the information superhighway traffic jam.

146
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,440
And, uh, Bob has seen fit to let the conspiracy test us

147
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:37,860
by denying us funds for printing all the thousands of pages of material that has accumulated,

148
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,780
uh, a lot of its runoff from the new book and so forth.

149
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:48,600
And, oh dear friends, this year has been a financial challenge for our ministry.

150
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,640
We're clinging, we're clinging by a bare thread,

151
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,580
dangling by a ribbon of skin from our very teeth.

152
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,300
Uh, but, well, you know, for the subgenius foundation, that's normal.

153
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,360
But now with the great burden of the book lifted,

154
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:12,560
we intend to modernize, yes, and finally hook up our donated old beat-up modem

155
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,500
and get online and with it like the computer geeks and the rival cults

156
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,600
and start finding new ways to get the information we need.

157
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,600
We're publishing shorter, faster stark fists.

158
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,460
And who knows, maybe we'll even start advertising.

159
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:34,240
And if and only if the faithful subgeni do what they know they must do.

160
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,340
And those of you who have written for free information know what it is you must do.

161
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,540
The information is free.

162
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,000
But are you, friend, are you free?

163
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,940
Are you truly free?

164
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,580
Anyway, our little, uh, catch-up newsletter here, I'll say,

165
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,340
also tells people how they can get the hour of slack on their local radio show

166
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,620
or their local mailbox and how to sponsor a subgenius,

167
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,240
devival, uh, and, uh, why they didn't get their order.

168
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,260
It's probably because the postal, somebody ripped it off in the mail.

169
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,240
That's the only possible reason.

170
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,040
Don't accuse us of ripping you off prematurely.

171
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,880
And, uh, and I should mention very quickly,

172
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:24,120
upcoming subgenius devivals, uh, if you're able to travel,

173
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,140
there's nothing coming up close here in Dallas.

174
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,780
But we've got, well, let's see, we'll do this more, more like the old,

175
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,040
yeah, we've got a lovely tent show revival coming up,

176
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,920
Winter Star, February 23 and 27.

177
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:42,380
That's in, at a pleasant resort in rural north central Ohio.

178
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,580
Uh, and you've also, Robert Anton Wilson and,

and, uh, Pope Bob Wilson and Timothy Leary.

180
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,700
All three of them will be there, yacking and ranting and whatever.

181
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:06,640
And, uh, but to, to, to get to that expensive seminar revival in, uh, Ohio,

why, you'd have to, you'd have to call the station here and find out.

183
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,080
Actually, we'll give the number, uh, you got that pencil ready?

And leave them your address and they'll let you know.

188
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,600
And friends, of course, the Portland pilgrimage is coming up.

189
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,320
X Day, July 5th, 1994.

190
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,060
Of course, it's a pre-X Day sort of a dock stock.

191
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,340
This will be the greatest dock stock ever.

192
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,680
My friends, I know it will be.

193
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,300
And that's all you need to know for now.

194
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,460
Just be in Portland.

195
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,440
Make that pilgrimage.

196
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,660
July 5th, 1994.

197
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,540
Dragon Con, uh, July 4th, 1994.

198
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,040
July 5th, 1994.

199
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,600
And the 15th through 17th in Atlanta.

200
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,340
Why, that'll be a lovely revival.

201
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:58,260
The Swingin' Love Corpses will be providing the religious music.

202
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,320
Uh, yours truly, Reverend Stang will be preaching.

203
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,720
And the lovely, uh, grinding and bumping Reverend Susie the Floozy.

204
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,360
Ah, yes.

205
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,400
So, uh, you listeners in Atlanta, be ready for that.

206
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,560
Uh, and you, uh, Cleveland area listeners, of course, uh, be aware of Starwood.

207
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,710
Uh, Starwood in the, uh, near, uh, July 19th through 24th.

208
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,430
Yes, well, I just gave that number at Ace.

209
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,990
Yeah, look him up in the phone book.

210
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:30,870
Uh, so, that's enough, dear friends, of, uh, church, churchly news.

211
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,350
Yes, good, lovely church news.

212
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:42,010
And, uh, now, we shall go back into a show.

213
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,830
A special show for you tonight.

214
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,190
I...

215
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,610
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

216
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,110
Uh, yes.

217
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,850
Booyah, booyah.

218
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:54,350
Ha!

219
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,810
It was sneaky.

220
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,090
It was sneaky.

221
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,050
But, you know, we talked about that.

222
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,170
Uh, you might be...

223
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:15,170


224
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,190
You might be into something and neither forces...

225
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,170
Neither forces.

226
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,570
We found out there's some things you don't play games with.

227
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,050
You don't...

228
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,150
People you say, you can't...

229
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,650
You don't mess around with somebody else's religion.

230
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,370
Well, there ain't...

231
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:43,470
Ain't no problem to mess around with somebody's damn religion.

232
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:52,050
religion, it's a, it's a, when you start to frown with the damn, neither part, you start,

233
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:06,250
start stirring up. Suddenly everything's going wrong, and what you gonna do about it, huh?

234
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,470
What you gonna do to get straight, huh? Ain't much you can do if you said all,

235
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:18,390
all, said everything all, all messed up, out of balance. You kind of get everything,

236
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,730
feel like nothing's gonna work right. Get it, why'd you ever get out of bed in the morning?

237
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:33,870
You've been making jokes about the dark side, eh? Thought it was real funny. You gonna pull

238
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:39,210
the devil's leg, are ya? Hell, go ahead, son, go ahead.

239
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:51,410
Little girlie, you just go ahead and make fun. You make fun. Yeah. Oh, let's go, let's go spray paint the graveyard.

240
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:59,030
Yeah, that's a good idea. Why don't you go, go try that. Oh, let's go mess around. Let's go make a fake bleeding head

241
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:07,210
on a palm tree launch it. Oh, let's go set up our bob altar and worship for aliens. Hey, you just go ahead and do it.

242
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,850
Hey, you just go ahead.

243
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,290
Hey, you just go ahead.

244
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:11,450


245
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:11,450


246
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:21,510
We did it as deep as you. We took money for it. But we know our souls are damned. Not much we can do now, but try to stay so

247
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,550
fropped up we don't think about it.

248
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:41,210
And I frankly suggest that you may be in it too deep to do otherwise yourself. You're just a bobby, ain't ya? You wanted to be cool. You thought you'd get in with the cool set.

249
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,710
That's there as a coolב

250
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,130
And you wouldn't let you in. You're just a bobby, aren't you?

251
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,270
You ain't.

252
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,930
We laugh at YOU, boy.

253
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,530
You just said, ah, we . . .

254
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,690
You kinda, we make fun of . . .

255
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,990
What's the matter beggin' to sit there?

256
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,530
Don't like to think about it, huh?

257
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,630
Don't like to think about it?

258
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,370
Nah Polish, I just thought you were getting on it.

259
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:11,430
So you thought it'd be a good idea to take acid and let's do a space flight?

260
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:11,430


261
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:11,430


262
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:11,430


263
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:16,470
genius tape eh? Yeah well I hope you're having fun now.

264
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,490
I'll see you next time.

265
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:27,070
Take what you want as the truth The evidence is no proof

266
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:34,690
I really don't mean to spook you when Your head is so empty

267
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,710
There are scars in your eyes

268
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,410
Yeah well I hope you're having fun now.

269
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,830
Little angel please don't listen to Bob

270
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:55,210
Oh little angel please don't listen to Bob

271
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:02,910
I know that he's calling yeah but the price is too high

272
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:10,730
Oh little angel please don't listen to Bob

273
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:23,030
Oh little angel please don't listen to Bob

274
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,530
P.U.

275
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,550
I just feel awkward about it.

276
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:37,130
The puzzling evidence that remains is the number of wounds on Bob's body.

277
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,390
The exit wounds, the wounds that apparently came through the floor,

278
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,690
Or the ones that came Jane-er-ward, and all of them.

279
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,090
Yes, the multiple bullet theory, the multiple Bob theory.

280
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,350
What are we to believe, Dr. Hall?

281
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,410
Well, recently, I was reading an article in this sub-journal,

282
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:57,330
and they say that Bob might have had a closet full of very carefully constructed,

283
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:03,130
lifelike Bob robots that resemble him absolutely down to the slightest cuticle.

284
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:08,050
But I consider this, of course, another tissue of lies and absolute errant nonsense.

285
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,090
U.S. Supreme Court, Washington, D.C.

286
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:16,350
I write, demanding a rehearing of my worst and lowest deadly gangster police state criminal conviction,

287
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,110
which appeal case was, in your farce, deadly gangster ghetto communist,

288
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,790
gangster computer god-manipulated gangster court.

289
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,270
Below, I state some of the many reasons for said rehearing,

290
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:30,330
plus all of my evidence the Attorney General chicanerously forwarded to the Bar Association Grievance Committee.

291
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,690
You'll wake up and you'll say, my God, what happened?

292
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,970
I guess this is...

293
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,990
I thought the conspiracy was a metaphor all along.

294
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,110
I thought it was some kind of a joke.

295
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,450
A joke, that's what you'll be saying, I guess.

296
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,270
I thought the conspiracy was a joke.

297
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,390
Hey, what happened?

298
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:55,390
I mean, you mean, you mean there really was a conspiracy?

299
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,790
You mean I could have had slack and I blew it?

300
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,350
I blew it?

301
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,470
You mean, you mean there really is?

302
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:07,850
There is?

303
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:08,950
A bar?

304
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,950
Look at the madness that goes on.

305
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,550
You've done what you wanted, lost what you had.

306
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,110
Puzzle man, evidence.

307
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,270
I'm seeing puzzle man, evidence.

308
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,650
I keep dreaming about it.

309
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,490
And then I wake up and try and tell myself it's a bad dream, but it isn't.

310
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,350
There isn't always a happy ending.

311
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,950
I should have told you that.

312
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:47,170
Did you say that's significant that the last thing I'll ever hear is a laugh track?

313
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,050
Who are the people who do all the laughing?

314
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,410
Yes, the phone company told you about problems?

315
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,430
I wonder how much you get paid for laughing.

316
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:03,530
You know, some of those people died since they recorded those laughs.

317
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,910
But they go right on laughing.

318
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,030
Right?

319
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:07,330
Yeah.

320
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:07,330


321
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:24,430
I think it's time some kind of a special Project RAJICA Bob

322
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,330
came up on the phone

323
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:26,330


324
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:26,330


325
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:26,330


326
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:31,290
You do think that was very tricky?

327
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:31,290


328
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:31,290


329
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,190
He's not just bringing up their future,

330
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:37,310
he's bringing up themselves.

331
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:37,310


332
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,570
Been thinking, right? He's been talking about it.

333
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,150
Sluck? Sluckin' Bob.

334
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,770
You mean sluppin', McGuff?

335
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,790
Oh God, lead them out of this, please.

336
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,750
We don't want to think about that during the weekend.

337
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,690
The Thing. Can you take it? Next 17 exits.

338
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,930
The Thing. Fresh cherry cider for sale.

339
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,730
The Thing. It grows on Puzzle Gavinus' forehead.

340
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,950
The Thing.

341
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,070
Scientific wonder. Free ice cream for the guineas.

342
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,710
That's right. Hitler's Rolls Royce. The Thing.

343
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:08,110
The Thing. Diamond Jim Brady's diamond.

344
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:14,090
The Thing. Wax museum and UK Corral replica forest.

345
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,670
The Thing. John Villager's cucumber in Alphamore.

346
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,550
The Thing. Brady's cucumber in a...

347
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,350
in a test tube.

348
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,490
In a covering solution.

349
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,870
Charged with millions of megavolts of atomic energy.

350
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:28,990
The Thing.

351
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,610
Something about a one-inch machine.

352
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,470
Yes, sir. I have more than one inch.

353
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,570
When you really have been called back.

354
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,830
Then yes, you've seen the other side.

355
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,370
And you want to know what's there.

356
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,630
I'll tell you what's on the other side.

357
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,870
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

358
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,610
You die and there's simply darkness.

359
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:52,890
There can be.

360
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,950
No streets of gold.

361
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,790
No harps, no halos, no angels and saints.

362
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,230
It's all here, so you better live it up.

363
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,690
Make the most of the here and now, because that's what it's all about.

364
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,430
That's all there is.

365
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:05,950
You're lying.

366
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,110
You can't see any of the signs.

367
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:07,710
Why would I lie?

368
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,630
Nick, you're lying.

369
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,850
Tell me, why would I lie?

370
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,230
He could write a check.

371
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,170
Yeah, you could write a check all right.

372
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,570
But who's the scientist in the check?

373
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,010
Hmm. Yeah.

374
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,630
In the end, the signature is always the same.

375
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,510
You're hearing the voices now, aren't you?

376
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:28,730
Aren't you?

377
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,150
A.

378
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,510
It's merely a sport to them.

379
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:34,650
Yeah.

380
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,050
This is a special tape.

381
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:46,030
These compressed sound effect code release words in the background behind the voices

382
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:52,930
are designed to trigger those self-same voices in your head, your own head, generating those

383
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:53,330
voices.

384
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,250
But guess what?

385
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,510
It's going to be a while before you can turn them off.

386
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:02,350
It's going to be a little while before you can turn them voices off, sonny boy.

387
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,130
You should quit.

388
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,750
Take your headphones off now.

389
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,290
Before it's too late.

390
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,830
Oh, quit.

391
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,190
Take them headphones off.

392
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,070
Oh, go ahead.

393
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:11,850
Yeah.

394
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,990
You think we're kidding you, don't you?

395
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,430
Hey, you think it's all a big joke.

396
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,350
Oh, yeah.

397
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,870
We go and get a dumb subvenience tape.

398
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,870
It's comedy tape.

399
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,290
I play it for my friends.

400
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,510
They'll think I'm cool.

401
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,250
That's what you've got.

402
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,510
You've convinced yourself.

403
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,890
You possess.

404
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,830
And soon to be replaced.

405
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,330
At your request.

406
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,410
At the behest of those.

407
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:52,670
At the behest of those same.

408
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:52,790
Hmm.

409
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,410
Let the inevitable,

410
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,330
the irrevocable, the hasty,

411
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,110
die.

412
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,170
The older,

413
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,110
the stronger,

414
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,190
the stronger.

415
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,950
Was it worth it?

416
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,850
Was it really worth it in the end?

417
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,090
Was it worth 8.50?

418
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,990
Did you have a good time?

419
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,810
Did you enjoy your dreams?

420
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,130
Oh, you say that

421
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,650
frop stick was a little might too strong?

422
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,590
Strong for you, eh?

423
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,430
Thought you were gonna

424
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,510
have a good time, didn't you?

425
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,470
The signs

426
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,950
are apparent now.

427
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,510
Exactly.

428
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,210
Where did these thought processes lead?

429
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:12,590
Ahhh.

430
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,610
Ow.

431
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:25,030
This soul water we squeezed out of you tastes real good.

432
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,710
Even at this moment,

433
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:33,330
your consciousness is sending emissaries.

434
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,350
Fugitives.

435
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,270
Listen to them souls flying by.

436
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,550
Lost.

437
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,890
Arguing in this very moment.

438
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,190
You're gonna end up like that, boy.

439
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,110
Arguing with.

440
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:46,790
Sweetie.

441
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,390
The elder gods.

442
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:49,590
The elder gods.

443
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:49,590


444
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:49,590


445
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,010
They think they're civilized.

446
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,430
They think their civilized sciences

447
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,850
can explain away the forces.

448
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,670
They think they're civilized.

449
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:02,910
The forces.

450
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,110
Say your prayers

451
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,130
you sick

452
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:05,670
Say your prayers you sick

453
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,790
I just wanna be normal.

454
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:09,150


455
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,110
Say your prayers

456
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,110
you sick

457
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,610
You sick

458
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:17,230


459
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:17,630
No.

460
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,090
Nor.

461
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:25,150
Say your prayers, you sick bastard.

462
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,370
I just want to be normal sometimes.

463
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,710
That was only following my orders.

464
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,570
I admit some of my experiments perhaps went a bit too far.

465
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:44,690
Sometimes you have to be just a little bit special to be normal.

466
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,630
Say your prayers, you sick bastard.

467
00:28:50,110 --> 00:29:02,190
Sometimes I invite my little friends to the kingdom and we do things they don't want to do and I have to kill them to be normal.

468
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:10,570
I had to kill her. She psychically willed me to kill her. I didn't want to kill her. I didn't choose to kill her.

469
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,630
Look at the madness that goes on.

470
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,670
You could really...

471
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,410
You could say that. You could. You could say that.

472
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,390
You could say that. You could. You could. But would Odin...

473
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,410
But Odin wouldn't mind if you...

474
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:28,890
You have been listening to, so far, on Subgenius Hour of Slack...

475
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:35,530
Well, just that last little bit there was by Jader Hypercletes and Southland Corporation.

476
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:42,610
Talking about wanting to be normal. How sad.

477
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:50,950
Well, I think, uh, quite a bit of the young Reverend Stang and Pope Sternodocs...

478
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,590
Uh, Kay Kaver.

479
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,490
In Hell.

480
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,630
Oh, it's a big joke.

481
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:01,830
It was when Reverend Stang's voice wasn't quite so ravaged as it is now.

482
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:12,790
Uh, before that, uh, some Dr. Howell and Gary Brogfran and Puzzling Evidence on the show from KPFA in Berkeley.

483
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,050
The Subgenius Show there.

484
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:20,750
Uh, quite a bit of, uh, media barrage cutting by Puzzling Evidence and also by yours truly, Reverend Stang.

485
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,270
Uh, Dr. Howell talking about Bob's exit wounds.

486
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:30,430
Oh, and that lovely song, Angelina Don't Listen to Bob.

487
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:35,270
It was by an Austin band called Fuzz.

488
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,110
Yes, Fuzz. Reverend Sam sent us that tape.

489
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,230
There's more from that coming up, bits and pieces.

490
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,470
Also, you heard some of Fuzz in the background.

491
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:48,290
When I was, uh, first, when I first cut in there earlier.

492
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:57,970
Yes, uh, and bits of the roach war against the humans from, uh, Twilight of the Cockroaches,

493
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:01,110
an otherwise quite forgettable, uh, cartoon.

494
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,870
Uh, the, uh, commercial for Elmer Fudd is Jim Morgan.

495
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,970
Hit it.

496
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,970
Here we go.

497
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,210
Here we go.

498
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:39,630


499
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,230
Here we go.

500
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,570
Here we go.

501
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,430
Here we go.

502
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,590
Pack it up baby, put on your best dress

503
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,270
The ship leaves soon, this land is a mess

504
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,410
I looked at the clock, it's almost well

505
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:07,790
Damn, time really flies with the world going to hell

506
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,490
No one seems to listen to people up to fight

507
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:18,010
I don't care for much, I just want to survive

508
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,890
Yeah, come on now, I can't take the stress

509
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,650
Don't forget the tickets, it's planned by man

510
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,790
Better think about the future

511
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,130
Yeah, it's time we planned it

512
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,350
Better think about our future

513
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,770
It's time we planned it

514
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,410
Time to get off this planet

515
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:42,870
So, pack your new eggs and grab our best

516
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,610
The ship leaves soon, this land is a mess

517
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,110
It's a mess, it's a mess, it's a mess

518
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,370
It's a mess, it's a mess, it's a mess

519
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:04,810
Come on now, it's all for the best

520
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:07,430
If we miss this ship, it hurts like ass

521
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,690
The clock keeps ticking, I can't take the stress

522
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,370
Time to leave, we fail the test

523
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:23,710
With a big old M, M, M

524
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,670
No one seems to listen to people up to fight

525
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,150
I don't care for much, I just want to survive

526
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,310
And I care

527
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,090
It's a mess, it's a mess, it's a mess

528
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,590
It's a mess, it's a mess, it's a mess

529
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,950
Better think about the future

530
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,230
Yeah, it's time we planned it

531
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,410
Better think about our future

532
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,550
It's time to get off this planet

533
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,930
So, pack your new eggs and grab that rest

534
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,650
The ship will break, it's time to land it

535
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,530
Yeah, it's time we planned it

566
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:18,110
They mention here the surge of interest in Indians, especially from Dances with Wolves, the great revisionist history there by Kevin.

567
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,370
But get this, friends.

568
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:29,010
Since 1960, the number of people who told the Census Bureau that they are Indian has tripled to about 1.8 million.

569
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:36,810
In the last 10 years, the number of people who claim to be Indian in New Jersey, for example, grew by nearly 80%.

570
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:40,130
Well, now it's really cool to be an Indian, friends.

571
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,670
And Dallas Morning News had an article about the same thing this morning.

572
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,450
Quoting Clyde Bellacourt, co-founder of the American Indian Movement,

573
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:54,330
whose house I moved into right after he and Russell Means moved out.

574
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,730
See, there's part of the connection.

575
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,690
People used to show up at our place in South Dakota going,

576
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,670
Is Clyde and Russell here?

577
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,570
We go, No. No, they moved out.

578
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,110
No.

579
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,630
It's 40 degrees below zero.

580
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,390
Can you drive me to Rosebud?

581
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:11,730
Sure.

582
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:20,950
Clyde Bellacourt calls these non-Indian New Age medicine people, shake and bake medicine people.

583
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:26,490
In just a few easy steps, he says, something ordinary becomes something new.

584
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:32,850
I don't care if he's charging five cents a person, he's still exploiting Indians and he's wrong, Mr. Bellacourt said.

585
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:35,950
Once you charge people, you lose your power.

586
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:36,790
He said.

587
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:47,570
Mr. Halbick, this is the local sweat lodge white boy, said the $20 charge is for the counseling he gives people who come to the ceremony.

588
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:53,050
And because he's given up his psychotherapy practice, now we see the pay.

589
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,810
The sweat lodge is his only source of income.

590
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:06,430
And this guy, this local guy who does grandmother earth sweat lodges and, you know, the womb, you die.

591
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:08,390
He's a great guy.

592
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:08,390


593
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:08,390


594
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:08,390


595
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:08,390


596
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:12,670
He didn't know it back then, but Indian spirits have always been watching over him.

597
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,110
Hey, what happened to Mike?

598
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:14,990
Hey, Mike.

599
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,090
Was that my headphones or was that me?

600
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:19,290
Only you know, friend.

601
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:30,050
Anyway, he believes these Indian spirits led him to the belief he calls the braided way, a compilation of sweat lodge ceremonies he experienced from various tribes.

602
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:36,530
But as the Native Americans say, now with this whole New Age movement.

603
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,750
White people come to our ceremonies.

604
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,250
They blink their eyes and they had a vision.

605
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:44,490
The next thing you know, they're leading the sweat lodge.

606
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,950
And Dallas and Fort Worth area Indians, some are angered that Mr.

607
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:56,230
Halbick has not only taken something that is sacred to them, but changed it to suit his needs.

608
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,610
Well, friends, I think they're both right.

609
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:06,050
I think that that there's you know, there's no law that says you can't rip off another religion.

610
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:06,690
Christ.

611
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,770
Look at the Church of the subgenius.

612
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,570
We ripped off the best from all of them.

613
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,490
And we use a.

614
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:12,230
But why?

615
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:14,190
Why can't these people be original?

616
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:15,570
That's what I want to know.

617
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,450
Why does it have to be?

618
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,430
You know, why do they have to rip off somebody else's religion?

619
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:21,850
Why can't they make one up?

620
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,070
It's not that hard.

621
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,750
We never slowed us down a bit.

622
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:27,750
Boy, this.

623
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:31,310
My mic is really sounding funny to me.

624
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:32,030
Anyway.

625
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,650
You know, I mean, we sure we use the sake.

626
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:36,490
We use a different.

627
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:37,110
We use a different sacred pipe.

628
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:37,630
Okay.

629
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,290
We're not going to swipe the Indian sacred pipe.

630
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,330
We got Bob's pipe.

631
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,530
Bob will share it with old chief.

632
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:47,050
What's egg roll man there?

633
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,930
I don't want to get into that old satanic subgenius doctrine.

634
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,210
But it's a lovely thing.

635
00:44:53,410 --> 00:45:00,410
And we'll go back to the horror of the tapes and the hell of the roaches.

636
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:04,910
We the subgeni who shall inherit the earth.

637
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,410
Oh, yes.

638
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,970
Oh, this is the Nurk twins in the background again.

639
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,270
Lovely, lovely piece there.

640
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,230
Could you could say that?

641
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,330
You could say that.

642
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:20,390
I'm not going to say.

643
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:22,170
You could say.

644
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:22,710
You can say it.

645
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:23,890
I don't think old man would care.

646
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,330
I mean, you don't think the bro.

647
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:27,470
Heliopter for a pill would never be mine.

648
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,410
What we were doing.

649
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:29,290
I mean, I think it's.

650
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:29,950
It's broke.

651
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,070
And if you decide to burn your draft card.

652
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:37,230
Then burn your birth certificate at the same time.

653
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,890
From that moment on.

654
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:43,070
I have no son.

655
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,170
.

656
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:47,170


657
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:48,790
.

658
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:49,430
.

659
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,430


660
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,430


661
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,430


662
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,430


663
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,430


664
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,430


665
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,430


666
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,430


667
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,430


668
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,570
.

669
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:49,650
.

670
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,030
.

671
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:51,130
.

672
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,670
.

673
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,930
.

674
00:45:59,910 --> 00:45:59,950
.

675
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,030
.

676
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:12,210
.

677
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:12,230
.

678
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:12,250
.

679
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:12,270
.

680
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:12,290
.

681
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:12,310
.

682
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:12,370
.

683
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:17,010
Another day I'd be an Egyptian pharaoh, sealed away in my tomb on the Great Pyramid.

684
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:21,810
Then I'd come to life, rise out of my coffin and come back into the world,

685
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:25,050
and nobody ever guessed the secrets locked away in my ancient brain.

686
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,410
I've got goosebumps.

687
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:30,250
You don't have to worry about the pharaohs. I gave them strict instructions to stay out of sight today.

688
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:31,290
I'm serious.

689
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:39,290
It's obvious to any intelligent observer that God chose the roach to inherit the world.

690
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:43,350
We are much more adaptable than man. We can live where man cannot.

691
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,790
We are able to eat food that would turn man's stomach and sicken him.

692
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:50,390
Most important, our race is in tune with the great forces of nature.

693
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:51,890
We know who we are.

694
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:56,590
We roaches have established an unbroken chain of genealogy that transcends the ages,

695
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:57,930
and we are proud of it.

696
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:00,410
And we will fight back.

697
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:04,730
For every hundred that are killed, we'll breed 10,000 reinforcements.

698
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:09,250
And for every 10,000 lost, a million more will rise in their stead.

699
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:12,490
I give you my solemn oath. We roaches shall prevail!

700
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:18,110
Too much work. It's a waste of my time.

701
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,430
Anyway, what's the point?

702
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:26,290
I'm never gonna be one of those cockroaches who spends his life with his nose to the ground scrambling around looking for food.

703
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,510
America is waiting for the best of a couple of swords or another.

704
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:38,990
His name will be registered.

705
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,670
We can't register his life.

706
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:42,430
You gotta get your CV.

707
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:44,990
It's a genius beat party.

708
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:49,570
I wanted you so much I couldn't stay in that chair anymore. I just couldn't.

709
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:55,090
And look at this. It says here the mud tribes are gonna fight the Nazis in the stadium.

710
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:58,790
I hope we don't miss out on that. That could be a really good show.

711
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:05,450
Do you still insist, Exeter, that we can allow any of these earth creatures to have free minds?

712
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:08,510
Within five years, the United States will be not...

713
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:08,830
We'll...

714
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:09,770
cease to exist.

715
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:14,830
We're living in terrible, perilous, chaotic times.

716
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:20,350
Praise the Lord. And these times are not gonna get any better, my friend.

717
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:24,190
Amen. They're gonna get worse and worse.

718
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:27,270
So I saw this thing coming...

719
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:31,990
I saw this thing coming to me.

720
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,210
I didn't know what it was, but...

721
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:37,270
It looked funny.

722
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,430
...we didn't have to put anything on.

723
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:45,070
Clever deceptions, which have surrounded our space program.

724
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:51,850
Perhaps this is as good a time as any to take a few minutes to repeat a message...

725
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:56,130
...that seems frequently lost in the hustle and bustle of our daily activity.

726
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:00,250
You're listening to the Hour of Slack on KNON.

727
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,170
Keep listening, you idiot!

728
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:03,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

729
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:05,550
Else I shall kill you!

730
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,490
The parchment is sound.

731
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:08,810
Thumbnail box.

732
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:12,270
by your willingness to participate

733
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:17,030
in keeping us afloat just a little bit longer.

734
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:18,950
You did sign the application.

735
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,810
We are ready to proceed.

736
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:27,150
We've got your birth date, place of birth,

737
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:29,210
social security number,

738
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:31,930
your credit card numbers.

739
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,810
We know where your mother lives, your family.

740
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:40,730
We know where to find that which you thought was hidden.

741
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:46,630
And now you've got to give us everything else you've got

742
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:50,950
while we drink the fluids squeezed from your very soul.

743
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:53,270
Ah, listen, it's brewing.

744
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,230
I think the fluid is just about ready, Doctor.

745
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:04,530
Let's have a sip of the nectar

746
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:04,790
of your mother's soul.

747
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:04,790


748
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,970
this victim's soul through his headphones.

749
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:21,710
The coughing you cannot resist. I think he's drained almost dry, doctor. For as

750
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:32,190
Bob has said, every penny freely given counts as a certain percentage of

751
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:39,230
another one made ill in the eyes of the Elder God.

752
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:48,690
Never should have sat away for that little take back. Playing with the Elder Gods, making fun, making fun.

753
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:55,550
You ever notice the coincidences? You noticed the coincidences, I don't doubt that.

754
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:59,010
You thought they were just coincidences, didn't you?

755
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,510
Wasn't that an entire

756
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:05,990
magazine?

757
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:08,090
I would appreciate it if you could rather attach the

758
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:28,090
utarga captions to the fucka

759
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:30,110
הgruppy

760
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:31,030
dzie

761
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:31,990
sz

762
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:51,790
Okay, okay, this is the false FCC. Go ahead.

763
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:54,570
I'm not saying nothing about none of this to nobody.

764
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:58,570
Oh, I just sprained my ankle, so I thought I'd stay here in the studio and see if the swelling went down.

765
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:59,610
Then I was going to go home, essentially.

766
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:05,570
Then he opened wide, rolled, and flickered.

767
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,270
I vibrated.

768
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,450
It's not that funny.

769
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,770
BB finally smoothed.

770
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:18,770
I got an eye dent I can use for you.

771
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:21,210
Ram the bam!

772
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:25,410
He was off again, flickering and rolling hard.

773
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,970
Just Ram will do.

774
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:30,070
Said Monroe.

775
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:33,110
He finally quieted down.

776
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:40,730
Well, Ram, I get the percept that you were just a locked-in, hooked-on human until this thing came up.

777
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:43,410
You had some strong action after that.

778
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,210
You didn't have much smarts.

779
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:49,370
Monroe plies.

780
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:52,450
I still don't have much.

781
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,130
BB says,

782
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:59,370
And you sure do things the hard way.

783
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,530
I rolled a little.

784
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,610
Percept you can do any better?

785
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:07,450
Says Monroe.

786
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:09,030
BB flickered.

787
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:12,750
Why, any dumb curl with only half his eye dent could.

788
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:15,050
I cut in.

789
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:19,510
Once they join up, we're able to get them off to one of our subgenius retreats,

790
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,510
change their diet, start feeding them propaganda,

791
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:25,110
repeating the same thing over and over again until they forget who they are,

792
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,670
and start responding only to our dogma.

793
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:29,590
And the way...

794
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:31,870
to start doing that, dear friends,

795
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:35,690
is by writing to this post office box number I'm about to give.

796
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:40,670
Yes, there's more to it all than just the show.

797
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:45,310
It gets deeper and deeper and deeper,

798
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:48,110
and it sucks harder the deeper you get.

799
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:49,730
No sense in struggling.

800
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:50,450
Go ahead.

801
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:51,850
Pick up that pencil.

802
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,910
You are within range of my voice now.

803
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:59,010
Pick up the pencil and write.

804
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:00,770
Bob.

805
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:08,790
Post office box 140306.

806
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:14,030
Once again, that's post office box 140306.

807
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:18,110
In Dallas, Texas.

808
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:24,090
Zip code 75214.

809
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:28,690
And drop in a self-addressed stamped envelope.

810
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:29,570
Why don't you?

811
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,470
We'll just see what happens next.

812
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:33,870
This is a mutant.

813
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:36,710
You've been breeding them here for ages to do menial work.

814
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:40,530
Well, actually, they're similar to some of the insect life on your own planet.

815
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,410
Larger, of course, with a higher degree of intelligence.

816
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:43,970
Listen carefully.

817
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:47,810
What I have to tell you is crucial to your survival.

818
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,710
In order to improve our breed,

819
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:54,510
God has provided challenges of increasing difficulty.

820
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:56,730
In this latest trial,

821
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,570
he has allowed humans to develop deadly,

822
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,390
and deadlier poisons.

823
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:07,170
Only the fittest of the race will be able to survive exposure to these toxins.

824
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:11,710
And they will provide the seed for the preservation of our species.

825
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:15,070
As mankind develops new chemicals,

826
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:19,450
our race must develop new levels of resistance or perish.

827
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,010
In our previous war with the humans,

828
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:26,390
I discovered that their poisons had no effect on me.

829
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,870
And along with two strong males,

830
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:29,570
I found that they were not as effective as humans.

831
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:30,910
I was able to survive.

832
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:34,330
If you're hearing this message,

833
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:36,650
war has broken out again,

834
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:39,790
and most of your tribe has been destroyed.

835
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:43,750
You now know that the God of all of us

836
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:46,470
is unmerciful in his decisions.

837
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,190
In the long run,

838
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:50,510
we may stay poor and broke,

839
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,390
we may stay neurotic,

840
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:54,650
or whatever we started out as,

841
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:56,410
or whatever we may fall into,

842
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:57,930
but by God,

843
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:59,390
we've got Bob and Nan!

844
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:00,450
And for that,

845
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:01,650
we can hate them!

846
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:03,050
Hate them!

847
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:04,410
Hate them!

848
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:09,430
I'm not prejudiced.

849
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:10,590
I don't care if he's a Jew,

850
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:11,190
a black,

851
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:11,850
Italian,

852
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:12,570
Chinese.

853
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:14,670
If he messes with me,

854
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:15,270
I'll shoot him.

855
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,090
He's got complete equality

856
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:19,170
as he drops to the ground.

857
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:20,950
America's way.

858
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:24,990
Our forefathers' way.

859
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:28,730
The freedom to use,

860
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:30,610
the choice we choose.

861
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:32,850
That's what got us

862
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:34,830
where we are today.

863
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:40,350
It's an American thing

864
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:44,130
that makes the liberty ring.

865
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:47,470
And we all are a part,

866
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,370
very close to the heart,

867
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:50,970
of a system that

868
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:53,070
everyone can say

869
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,950
is America's way.

870
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,470
After my worst than Nazi court criminal conviction,

871
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:01,730
crucifixion,

872
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:03,510
for years in poverty,

873
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:04,230
I suffered hopeless,

874
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:04,750
jobless,

875
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:05,710
character assassination,

876
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,270
and isolation in the...

877
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,590
I'll get you out on the road,

878
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:10,210
you'll see.

879
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:11,650
What we're engaged in here

880
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:12,910
is a war!

881
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:14,830
It is a war,

882
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:15,350
dear friends.

883
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,450
It is us versus them.

884
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:19,610
And that is what every religion

885
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:20,650
is really all about,

886
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:21,690
if you think about it.

887
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:23,590
You give people somebody to hate,

888
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,550
you make them paranoid,

889
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:25,210
not...

890
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,890
Is America's way?

891
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:31,910
The free enterprise way.

892
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:35,570
All America's way.

893
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:39,630
All the way.

894
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:51,110
Do unto others

895
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:53,050
as you would do unto others.

896
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:57,730
Demos, demos, demos, demos.

897
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:01,310
Wooh, wooh.

898
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:03,670
Ohh, ohh.

899
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:09,630
Wham.

900
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:10,650
Wham.

901
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:11,410
Wham.

902
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:29,570
.

903
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:57,310
He's got complete equality as he drops to the ground.

904
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:09,650
It moved up, took off at fantastic speed at the at least 45 degrees angle and it just disappeared between the stars.

905
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:22,530
During the debriefing, which we always said after each combat mission, the officer who was receiving this made a joke of it, how many beer I had.

906
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:31,250
And do you know what happened? Again.

907
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:34,390
And do you know what happened? Again.

908
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:34,930
.

909
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:51,790
Emergency, emergency, there's an emergency going on.

910
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,370
.

911
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:54,630
.

912
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:55,110
.

913
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:59,410
.

914
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:09,770
.

915
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:15,790
.

916
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:16,070
.

917
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:16,150
.

918
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:16,150


919
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:16,790
.

920
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:19,510
.

921
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:32,050
. . .

922
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:32,090
. .

923
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:32,250
. . .

924
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:48,990
. . . . .

925
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:48,990


926
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:50,710
Please don't utter bastard.

927
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:53,890
Humans don't know the heavens.

928
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:56,410
Someone just made it up to the living room.

929
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:57,350
Nuts.

930
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:59,350
My nivgits don't work.

931
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:01,030
My nivgits don't work.

932
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:02,870
My nivgits don't work.

933
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:07,070
Well, I want to talk to you about my penis.

934
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:09,590
Would anyone like any toast?

935
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:12,370
I toast, therefore I am.

936
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,270
Would you like some toast?

937
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,410
Can anyone hear anything?

938
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,430
I haven't much interest in saving my own life.

939
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:22,910
It's a cry of depressed Lenning.

940
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,590
I was just doing a little test.

941
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,510
A little test to see if you've gone crazy.

942
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:29,930
Crazy.

943
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:33,090
If there's one thing I can't stand,

944
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,050
it's crazy people.

945
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:37,110
Don't worry.

946
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:38,170
Don't worry.

947
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:42,310
That was Olo T. Schicklgruber again, my friends,

948
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:46,430
and the Happy Philanthropist Orchestra from their tape Wonderbar,

949
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:48,730
here at the very end.

950
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:59,350
And their address is 2936 Waterloo Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V6R.
