What is that from now?
It's from a show I wrote years ago.
A science fiction musical.
No...
What happened to my coffee?
I don't know. It was...
I didn't take it.
That's your coffee over there.
You should get it.
Alright.
Now you got your coffee, we can get going, I guess.
Ugh...
Ugh...
Ugh...
Look at all the media now.
Yes, I've been recently roman celling this especially awful thing,





Yea, a Variety Anchor.


When you need to.
When I get HORSE ABSRC Annie,
And she tries to be a 對不對,
Where can you sell Plymouth?
Well she did do it with a permettre service,
And now I have several other people,
Don't talk to me!
Alright,
Yes, everything's going fine.
It's a happening scene.
We're recording.
Everything's going fine.
And so, on this historic occasion,
we begin the second in a series of award-winning Bobcasts
from the center of X-Day,
Caffeine, the administrative nucleus.
And we have a great show for you today,
but I understand there's some camp business
we have to take care of first.
Did anybody hear any of those strange noises last night?
We had reports of extremely strange sounds.
Everybody was a little paranoid
because we were expecting terrible weather.
The conspiracy weather people had tried to tell us
that we shouldn't even be here,
that it was going to be floods
and landslides.
And lightning and everything.
I think we got sprinkled on a little bit
and the temperature's been quite terrible.
It veered at the last moment
and the pinks got the terrible storm
and we were spared by some miraculous intervention.
Yeah, but some people asked me
if I thought those noises were thunder.
But I don't know what it was.
Well, there were other sounds distinct from thunder.
Something like the fabled moody noises
heard in the camp.
I don't know what they were.








Strange cracks and almost laughter-like sounds
interspersed with growling and grunting.
But on a much lower level.
But like that, yeah.
It reminded me of that new Godzilla movie.
Which I still haven't seen.
Maybe it's old Sequa.
Maybe old Sequa's coming out of his den
at the bottom of the swimming hole.
My dear sir, what you say is an impossibility.
Old Sequa does not have vocal cords.
He's a Chillonian.
He's silent.
All he can do is hiss
before he drags a squealing, struggling Bobby
down to the abyss.
Well, I still like to think
that those moans and rumbles from the ground.
And we saw moles fleeing the ground
in order to come where people were.
Yeah, even whacked a couple.
Now, what is scaring a mole that much underground?
Hmm.
So it's all...
Anyway, there is some serious business, though.
There's more than one mole in the subgenius organization.
That's right.
I'm not going to say which subgenius it was
that broke the rules.
You're not supposed to have pets at X-Day.
Right.
It's in the brochure.
But who reads a brochure?
Exactly.
And somebody thought,
well, if I bring little...
What was the dog's name?
Snuggles or Snippy or something?
Snuggles?
I thought it was Snuckles.
Snuckle.
Yeah, I can't...
Anyway...
I don't know what...
These people thought they had to bring their little...
Boy, that was...
...apply-named shit.

It's a skit-sue.
Ugliest dog.
It's like a dead rat in a tube top
with wet fur around the mouth.
Right.
So bottom line is this dog,
Sniggles or Snuggles or whatever his name is,
got loose.
If I'm not mistaken.
Your fellow subgeniuses,
I noticed the one, they aren't here,
probably because they're embarrassed.
We're hoping if you see this hideous little dog,
I've been describing it as it looking like a face-fucking bat
with its wings torn off.
We're kind of hard on it.
It doesn't appear to be an attractive animal,
and it's old.
It's got a perpetually wet gray muzzle
and big watery eyes,
but it will probably come into somebody's camp
to get food or to take food.
So if you see it, that's what's going on.
And please inform Princess Wee that Snuckles...
Or me.
...has been found.
Or Hal or Pisces.
Well, you can tell me.
Any of the bossy looking.
Yeah, if you see a subgenius who looks bossy
and you have a horrible little thing,
you think might be a dog,
tell one of the bossy subgeniuses,
and then you're going to have to,
the couple who brought Sniggles or Snuckles
or whatever will have to...
They said, I might have gotten it wrong.
I thought they said Snuckles.
I'll take your word for it.
You know, like Knuckles only.
Oh, yeah.
Anyway, that's what you get for breaking the rules.
Now, wait a minute.
What am I saying?
This is a church of subgenius.
I thought we were supposed to do everything
that the conspiracy station was supposed to do.
Humans, yes, not animals.
But they said,
don't take drugs,
so we just go out and shoot up...
We're talking about animal infractions, Stang.
This is not the usual thing
where humans can do whatever they want.
This is involving animals,
so that naturally is beyond the pale
as far as we're concerned,
unless we're able to handle people's livestock
and become animal wranglers
as well as everything else
without increasing the basic charges,
portage and drayage,
all of that sort of thing.
So, you know,

shipping and handling.
Those little fees that add up.
Now, I see,
when I was talking about that dog,
I saw some guilty faces.
I think some others...
People have probably been feeding it,
and that's one way to make it go away.
So there's no reason to feel guilty.
We just need to recapture the beast
and return it to its owner.
I think they all brought pets.
I think they all have a cat
or a little dog hidden in their car.
Well, there are cats up where we are,
but that doesn't count.
We got cats.
Well, we've got the big house.
We are up at the big house
with cats.
Right.
We make the minions sleep in the mud.
I've been informed of that many times,
that I sleep in a mansion
and I make the minions sleep in the mud.
Actually, Princess,
we and I slept in the mud
just like everybody else
for the longest time,
but now we have more and more...
Well, yeah, it's kind of warm.
With the mud men?
Well,
when we hibernate,
you know,
all through the winter,
deep in the mud.
Yes.
That's a different matter.
You don't see us around
during the winter much.
Yeah, right.
You know,
some dinosaurs did that
and I predicted it in my book
and then that prediction was borne out.
What, dinosaurs curled up
like crocodiles?
Some of them burrowed.
Basal heterodontosaurs burrowed
as I wrote in one of the many poems
in my dinosaur book.
And lo,
it was proved to be so
and they found the fossil,
Burroughs.
Validated.
Vindicated.
Yes, that might balance
some of the mistakes
that are in that book.
I bet that makes you feel
as good as I feel
when I read a new health story
that says,
why,
surprisingly,
coffee is good for you.
Boy, they've even said lately
that Diet Coke is good for you
if you're a diabetic.
And, uh...
I could understand it not hurting you,
but now they're saying
it's good for you.
Well, some like to say
that marijuana helps fend off Alzheimer's.
And my question is,
what's the difference?
Doesn't it really just
give you practice for Alzheimer's?
So it becomes a little harder
for your loved ones to tell
that you've changed.
No, that's just an old hag's tale.
That it actually,
you, whatever it is,
you, wherever you want to go,
it facilitates it.
So if you happen to be
someone who goes into jazz,
and memory trips,
and so forth,
and stares off into space,
it will help you in that project, too.
I'm not going to eat
any of those cookies today
for this show.
Not before the show's over.
You have any of those cookies?
No, I deliberately left them buried.
God, freak Daniel.
With the corpse of Snuckles.
Oop!
Oh, my God.
Just kidding.
That would make me
not ever want to eat
one of those cookies.
I would sure like to
wring that little dog's neck.
The most annoying...
A dog!
Isn't a dog supposed to be
something big and bounding
and full of life
and companions?
And just listen,
the circus music started out.
Yeah, well...
The circus of subgenius clowns
and trained horseback riders.
Nude horseback riders.
Why carry this
Oh, look, they just went by.
They're gone.
They're gone already.
You missed it.
You should have turned around.
Poor subgeniuses.
Of the elephants.
Elephants?
Well, people bring pets
to Burning Man, too,
although that is
strongly forbidden.
I even saw a chicken
there once.
No, I'm not joking.
Not Chicken John.
An actual hen,
or I don't think
it was a rooster
was walking around there.
Eh, you're not supposed to.
That would be
a terrible place
for an animal to escape.
Yeah, that would be
one fried chicken.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But I really did see it.
Well, you know,
we find desiccated
subgenius skeletons
all over Cleveland
after the bad weather.
They get so feverishly...
It's a hard winter.
They can't feed themselves.
They wander,
and then they drop down,
and then they become
sort of mummies.
It's awful
looking at them.
They're all bruised up
from being hit by cars.
They sleep in the street.
We've got to do something
about the subgeniuses.
They're overpopulating
our cities now,
and you can't just shoot them
and put them out of their misery
because you'll go to jail.
They're the most pathetic
things in the world.
They're subgeniuses
who haven't paid
their $35.
Huh.
They have drunk the Kool-Aid,
but they're not going to get
on the saucers.
They're the most ineffective,
worthless pieces
of human protoplasm imaginable.
But they can sure post
on Facebook, can't they?
Yeah, that's all
they're good for.
I saw one of them
laying in the snow.
He's huddling around
his little iPhone
for warmth.
Oh.
But he still had the iPhone.
He could have sold it,
you know,
lived through the night,
but he had to get
that last...
that last...
those last...
last few...
How did Onan put it?
Your unpaid
24-7 data entry job
for Facebook.
Well, now they've installed
the kill switch,
which they say
is for disabling iPhones.
Ha ha.
Oh, really?
Yes, they've installed
the kill switch.
Yes, they say
that if your
electronical doodad
is stolen,
it can be
permanently disabled,
forcing you to buy
another electronical doodad
and forcing it to be...
uh...
uh...
useless to the person
who took it.
They say it's only
the doodad
that will be disabled.
They say.
Right.
Well, but some people
invest their whole brain
and spirit
into their little laptop.
I can't remember
a phone number.
They're all in my laptop.
I can't remember your name.
Hey, you know,
there's an empty
microphone up here.
Uh, Dr. Hal and I
are just sitting here
boring each other.
All right, all right.
Princess Wee
was gonna come up here.
You know, this reminds me
of an amusing anecdote.
Uh...
Yeah.
Yeah, Princess Wee is...
Oh, she's across the street
enjoying the shade
of the shade structure.
Oh, I know what she's doing.
Yes, she's enjoying...
I know what she's doing.
...relaxing, refreshing.
Relaxing.
Retrenching.
Reverend Two Beans.
I know what that's all about.
Yeah, right.
Two Beans.
Okay.
Boy, does that guy get around.
Okay, so, uh,
what we're going to do then
is continue with the old
slap-happy, uh,
hour of slack.
Uh, scientific.
Scientific.
Educational.
Um, uh, um...
Now, um...
Good fun for the whole family.
Between the Carboniferous period
of 250 million years ago...
Oh, no, not again.
No, no, no, no.
...the Paleozoic,
ending approximately
200 million years ago...
...came the age
of giant insects.
You have to say it
into that microphone, right?
If this might...
Oh, there it is.
Sud Piper up there.
Oh.
Okay.
Oh, is this thing on?
Is that what you're asking?
Yes, yes, yes.
So, I'm going to make
an announcement about
something for the
Bulldada auction
that is coming later.
Giant insects?
No, those are after
the Bulldada auction.
But, um,
giant insects aside,
uh, Sud Spishaw
will also be donating
a piece of original art
this year.
Oh, yeah?
So, um...
A comic book cover
by New Chomps?
On the auction day
on the 4th,
we'll be auctioning it off.
The opening bid is $35.
It will be 11 by 14.
It is ink, pencil, paint,
that sort of thing.
So, um...






It, um...
You will be bidding on it
to be...
He will draw it here.
He will sit down
at a table.
He's got his art kit
and he will draw it
live in person.
His art what?
Kit.
Oh, okay.
His art kit.
No, his art kits.
Okay, thanks.
He's got his art kits.
I don't have to cut that one.
And, um,
so since that's the case,
it'll be a $35 opening bid
that will be on the, uh,
Bulldada auction
on the 4th.
So, um,
you have to have
at least $35
and you will get
an O.A.
Sud Spishaw
original.
Yes.
Of course,
at the same time,
even if you're saving money
for the Sud Spishaw
original,
doesn't mean you might
not want to check out
the merch table,
which has a number of
officially licensed
Bob Dobbs shirts.
Oh, b-b-b-boy.
Right.
Uh, yeah,
buy your T-shirt now
before Scotty gets here
with his competing line
of subgenius T-shirts.
I haven't even looked
through it, uh, yet.
Uh,
this, uh, trip,
uh, what wonders
might be available?
There's, uh,
CDs
to annoy
your neighbors with.
CDs,
CDOs,
or if you have
a radio show,
you can play those.
There are buttons.
Buttons,
bumper stickles,
bingles,
bangles,
and baubles,
gee-gaws,
gim cracks,
new laminates,
honeydews for old,
knock-offs,
rip-offs,
you name it,
Bob sells it.
Jingling Johnny,
whatchamacallit,
sting futzers.
And I'm not gonna
stay up here long,
but, you know,
somebody,
they were serious.
You can come up here
and chat with the boys.
That's right.
You know, like,
people, like,
adorable, cute little girls
who play cards
could come up here
and chat with the boys.
But that would mean
they would have to
stop playing cards
if they did that.
Nerds.
God, they go to a campground
to watch television
and play video games.
That's what I did last night.
What?
Oh, good.
I think she will join us.
So,
so that would be
exceptionally great.
Okay, well,
I'm gonna sit the mic down gently.
Good plan.
Unlike certain radio stations
where huge, clumsy people
with giant feet
make loud, clumping,
banging noises
and destroy the symmetry.
Oh, you listen to Rush, too?
Well, I was actually
thinking of problems
and meant my own broadcasts
when puzzling evidence
upsets everything
onto the board
with flailing elbows
and mustache.
Well, I got,
we got to witness
an interesting clash
of cultures this morning.
Thank God for culture clash.
Our buddy,
Mr. Sistar,
who, of course,
is famous for lolling
at all of us socialists
and such,
was,
he was having breakfast
at the big house.
I wasn't there.
I was still in bed.
But apparently,
Charlene,
the hippie witch
who runs that place,
was trying to explain
her recycling
set up.
And Mr. Sistar said,
I put all my stuff
in one bag
and stick it right out
on the street.
We actually have
recycling in our neighborhood.
Well, you know,
that gives...
It's just,
Charlene started to try
to explain to Mr. Sistar
why recycling was good.
The long-suffering,
saintly Charlene, yes.
Princess, we cut in
and said,
you're barking up
the wrong tree there, Charlene.
You ain't gonna get
anywhere with this one.
Yes, her bite
is worse than her bite.
Bark.
Anyway.
The only way you could get
Mr. Sistar to recycle
would be if
Obabo told everyone
they should stop recycling.
But somebody's got to do it.
Somebody has to stand up.
Well, you know,
if you don't recycle...
Actually, I had a
Cleveland Heights garbage man
told me that
at the time,
a few years ago,
they were indeed
dumping the cardboard
in the same dump
because
there was no longer
a market for recycled cardboard.
There was a glut.
There was too much of it.
You couldn't give it away.
All the Vietnamese people
came and got it.
But by that same token,
if you don't separate
your recycling,
some handy bum
on the street
will go through
your garbage
and thoughtfully
take out everything.
Mr. Sistar has just brought
a treasure trove
of bulldada up here.
For the auction?
For the famous
bulldada auction?
Oh, we're gonna auction these?
Oh, my God.
Oh, turn the music off.
Oh, we're bothering
the neighbors.
We have to turn it down.
Probably just making it
hard to hear.
I don't know.
Hard of hearing, you say?
What?
But look, we have
the shockumentary
Plain Jane,
which is,
if you haven't seen it,
it's hilarious
and sexy
and eye-opening
because Jane...
Never heard of it.
It's actually a friend of ours
who has a...
I guess she's a dwarf
with brittle bone disease.
Basically looks kind of
like a head
with little limbs
hanging from it.
And yet,
she's one of those people
that the doctors said
wouldn't live
out of her teens
and she's about
40 years old now.
It's when she quit
taking all the medicine
they told her to take.
And she...
She...
felt a lot better
and...
she teaches...
She even has
a sex education sequence
in that video
where she goes,
people,
people,
they're always real curious.
They're always real curious
and they want to know
how I do it.
And all I can tell people
is how do you do it?
Ah.
You know.
It's great
and he also brought
The Chocolate War,
a real movie.
This movie's static.
It's on a different wavelength.
I thought we were watching
the room
at the Bloody Mary thing.
Are we not doing that?
Where's Mr. Sister?
You have multiple copies.
All right.
You're a good man.
That's a terrible movie.
I couldn't watch it
after the first 10 minutes.
I gave up.
It's funny, though.
Which is the movie
about the guy
who's locked in a room
for a chunk of his life
by some super criminal?
That's Old Boy.
Oh, Old Boy.
Oh, Casper Hauser.
It actually happened to him.
I depend on you
to set me straight
on these things.
There was a historical case
of a...
The American one's not that great.
...a feral man
in a room
in Germany
who had been kept in a cage
all the way to adulthood.
Casper Hauser.
Yes.
Mysterious case.
Right.
They say his ghost
became fairly friendly.
There was an early movie
about that by...
What's his...
Werner Herzog
did a movie
about Casper Hauser.
It was cool.
God Against All
or something like that?
No.
It was called
Casper Hauser, I think.
The Mystery of Casper.
Yeah.
Casper Hauser.
No one knew
where he came from,
but he was a good man.
Probably some rich family
had had him stashed away.
But it had a subtitle
of...
which ended in
God Against All
or One Against All
or something like that.
Are you thinking
of Aguirre?
No.
I'm thinking
of Casper Hauser.
Okay.
What about
Casper the Friendly...
Casper the Friendly Hauser.
Yeah.
He's friendly
because he's got
a Hauser to haunt.
He was dead,
but he was cute.
He'd build you
a big old house.
He looked kind of
like an embryo,
probably an early birth.
The tagline
for the movie
The Room is
Are you ready
to see reflections
of your life?
No.
I turn all...
My life never resembles
anything close to that.
You can turn
your mirror
to the...
Turn your mirrors
to the wall.
Okay, Mark.
Yes.
You just don't want
to see your face
staring back sometimes.
That's just
the ultimate thing
that can drive
your temper
over the edge
to see that
strange-looking person
there
who's not at all
like your young self.
You got to
be careful

You guys traded
mics on me.
That's why I was
going insane just now.
Well, what's the matter
with that?
These are equal
opportunity mics,
aren't they?
I was trying to
turn up mic one
and mic two,
but they were switched.
Well, I thought
she should have a mic
that would stand.
What are these?
What are these cards?
Mine won't stand.
Those are
H.P. Lovecraft cards
with little snippets
of H.P. Lovecraft's
prose on one side
and frightening images
on the other.
Are these for
the Bulldog?
I don't know.
Those are from
the private
Ivan Stang
fetishistic collection
of never-to-be-allowed-out-of-his-sight
property.
With any luck,
we can make off
with it at this festival.
Uh-huh.
But I've
separated
some of the more
plummy passages
of Lovecraft's writing.
I thought we might
shoot some in
to this broadcast,
give it an injection,
put it on its feet,
if we start
slobbing and slubbing
about lost little dogs
and so on.
And if no one
really does want to hear
about the age
of giant insects,
there are plenty
of other things
that we can pop in.
Oh, there is an age
of giant insects?
Well, yes.
That's what I was
starting to say.
Climaxing in the
end of the Paleozoic
when the Permian period
ended and the
greatest extinction
that ever hit
the planet Earth
hit the greatest extinction

The Great Dying,
as it's called,
before the dinosaurs
even got started.
You see, the planet
got hot,
and when it gets hot,
everything dies,
almost everything.
And it killed off
the great big bugs
that lived until then.
No!
Oh, yes.
They couldn't live
because the atmosphere
changed and their
breathing systems
wouldn't work
in the atmosphere,
which is closer
to the atmosphere
of the Earth.






They're much more


we have today
than what they enjoyed
before.
The moral of that story,
friends, is don't try
to breathe through holes
in your sides.
It works if you've got
lots of oxygen
in the atmosphere.
I find dragonflies
scary enough
when they're only
a couple inches,
and I don't need them
to be four feet.
But to them,
you're the monster.
They're not really dragons,
you know.
They don't really
breathe fire.
They're pretty harmless.
If they were,
that would be cool.
No, it's the buzzing.
They can't...
The buzzing sounds.
The old-fashioned kind
with the wings
more than a yard wide
couldn't fold those wings
like the modern dragonfly could.
Well, there is a kind
of a lost world
just down this road.
They call it the pond
where, because of the
dense atmosphere,
the oxygen is much stronger
and the insects do grow huge.
It's in the mud.
Like that spider
we found two years ago there.
That was a spider.











It's a real whopper.
But only down...
And the mosquitoes,
of course,
are the size of small
hang gliders.
Trailer bikes,
chigger bikes,
and mosquitos
collide aimlessly
in the dense gas.
Right.
And you can experience
that primordial atmosphere
when we have our
holy baptism ceremony,
which I think is Friday.
And you can sink down
into that swamp
and meet those gigantic,
buzzing insects.
Well, they'll come to you.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
Thank you.





We should try to look
for the bones
of whatever hippie
lost this ring
that I found.
Oh, yeah.
That was a weird thing.
If it was a hippie

Baby Bear was swimming
in a strange ring
with hieroglyphs
seemed to find its way
in the pond

onto her toe.
Oh.
You were on the edge
of the abyss, right?
Yeah.
Right on the...
Right where it plunges down
into unending,
freezing cold water.
And it's too big
even to be a toe ring
for you, right?
It's pretty large.
It's a pretty big ring.
It came from a hefty hippie
in his prime,
but now,
there's no doubt
if he even survives
into the present era,
he's withered, shrunken,
and etiolated.
I think that thing
is far older, Dr. Howell.
Probably a sacrifice.
I think that thing
dates from some time
before history.
Well, some hippies
are old, too.
Well, yeah.
But how do you know
it's not some ancient
Native American thing
with a curse on it?
That's my point.
Yeah, it could have been
an ancient sacrifice.
Ancient Native American

did the Americans
minted silver rings
and carved them?
Well, maybe
truly ancient.
I don't know,
but orcs and monsters did.
Paleologians.
The minute I saw that thing,
I wanted to just
run off with it,
turn invisible,
and start panting
and going,
Precious!
Sorry, finders keepers.
It's mine.
It's my precious.
Right, right.
It's her precious.
We hates humanses.
You're out of luck.
They had a very good relationship.
Now, let me get this right.
You found a mysterious
silver ring
with ancient engravings
at the bottom

of the pond,
baby bear?
Yes, yeah.
With her toe.
I picked it up with my toes.
An ancient,
by accident.
By accident.
It just jumped onto your toe.
Did you get a strangle
you were wearing?
Like something out of,
oh, I don't know,
Lord of the Rings or something.
Just as a joke.
But,
you were just looking for
You know, I hope that's not
some Indian thing
that would put a curse
on the camp
and draw some horrendous force
out of the ancient.
Oh, wow,
the edge of the ledge.
Yeah.
Maybe now she has the power
to combine with
four other people
to get it out
into one super hero
who can save
the environment.
Oh, Red, that's true.
Then maybe it's the key
to something good.
We'll just have to see.
I just have to hope,
on record,
that this doesn't start
some horrible chain of events
that no one can predict.
Oh, if it does,
it just does.
See, look,
it's working.
Whenever we meddle
with the tombs
of ancient civilizations,
we are toying with forces
we may not completely understand.
Sure,
we archaeologists
are not the only ones



and scientists think
we know everything,
but who knows
what ancient spirits
could be stirred
by the disturbance
of a tomb.
Oh, well,
maybe there's more jewelry
to be found in the pond.
What about that, gang?
No, that's true.
You know,
whenever you stumble
upon a golden ring,
don't run off
to the pawn shop, man.
Look around
and see if there's
more golden rings.
I was looking for car keys.
Right.
I thought for sure
I'd find some car keys.
As long as you could find
the car that they came to.
But I find
when I'm swimming,
if I don't watch out,
my ring wants to fly
off my finger
and get lost.
Your personal jewelry,
people go in with earrings
and so on,
that can get lost
very easily.
Somewhere there's
an old hippie
or a Mayan mummy
looking for that ring.
I'm just saying,
if we start,
you know,
if some shuffling thing
starts slaying
something,
some livestock,
some tourists around here,
you may want to think
about throwing that ring
back into that bottomless pit.
Maybe that's what happened
to the dog.
Well, we hope that dog shows up
just so they'll stop yapping
about it and whining.
But when the dog shows up,
then that will start
yapping and whining.
Well, yes,
but then we can give it
to its owners
and levy them
the enormous fine
for bringing dependent,
subordinate life out here.
Or we could just give it
to old Cipha.
Yes, just throw that little
weasler out over the pond
and the huge jaws would come up
and snap and take it.
That's kind of what I think
we should do,
is return it to nature.
It's nature's nature.
I mean, it's a cool ring
and everything,
but I just have a bad feeling
about all this.
Well, if you'd found it,
Stang, you could do
whatever you wanted with it,
but possession is nine points
of the law.
You just want the ring
for yourself.
Hey, the Purses.
It's not the right color.
I'd keep an eye on old Stang
if I were you, baby bear.
He's got that glint in his eye.
Don't get him started
on that ring thing.
But we've got plenty
to talk about.
Even if we cut the giant bugs
out of the equation,
there's a lot to talk about
because we have to solidify
and cement our plans
for X Day itself
and who gets what.
Without squabbling,
as advanced beings,
we can easily carve up the earth
and essentially plant
our marker flags.
Well, yeah, but what happens
when some other subgenius decides
he wants to fight you
for the Grand Canyon?
Trial by combat.
Or whatever.
You can hold a hot iron
in your hand
and the one who drops it first...
Well, there are a lot of old ways.
But you can't just
put a rattlesnake in your hand.
The Gong-Jabbar.
Stick your hand in my mailbox
and if you're an unholy person,
you won't get your hand back.
Some psycho put a rattlesnake in there.
Didn't the Scientologists make the news
for putting rattlesnakes
in the mailboxes of...
They did it.
And I don't know if anyone remembers,
but Rajneesh Puram,
the followers of Rajneesh,
put rattlesnakes in people's mailboxes.
Well, yeah,
the motion picture
will be temporarily disconnected
until these technical aspects can be re...
Yeah, we're showing an exciting...
What is that wonderful movie
that's being shown?
...slide show,
I mean, movie show.
It's happening right now,
ladies and germs.
It's...
Normally, that has its own soundtrack.
Look at it go.
Boy, it's in eye-burning omnicolor.
How parallel is it?
Now, you know, if we nail that screen,
to the floor...
The problem is it's like...
...this whole building,
it might turn into a sailing ship
and go shooting off across the...

It is a sail.
It will catch the wind,
like the wings of an enormous pterodactyl.
Well, we could be like that pirate ship
in the Monty Python movie
that's really a building full of accountants.
The Crimson Permanent Assurance.
I want that to happen
to my office building every day at work.
Really, that is the most...
If only those old accountants
and British accountants
would just dash in here,
kill all the pigs,
make me their mascot or cabin boy.
No, I would prove my superiority.
Then you wouldn't have to burn the building down anyway.
IGTBTBD.
Yes, there's only...
So far, they can push a subgenius
and then no farther.
Yes.
Well, you can push them pretty far.
You're talking about moving the screen, yeah.
There's a...
Yeah, that's what we call moving pictures, Dr. Al.
Yeah, they move around.
The subgeniuses never did figure out
that persistence of vision thing,
but we can make the screen move like the dickens.
If the screen won't move for you,
we'll move the screen for you.
I had a moment last night
involving projection screens
where I had the incredible shrinking brain.
It was one of those moments
when I've had just too long of a day
and everything flips.
Yes becomes no, right becomes left.
And I was desperately trying to teach Dr. Dark,
who projects movies all the time,
how to move the projector back
to make the picture smaller.
It was a moving experience.
And that's one of those cases
where I get to prove,
in case there was any doubt,
that I'm definitely qualified
for this particular church,
the church of the subgenius.
You are judging yourself too harshly.
Not the uber genius or the menstruating menses
or any of that stuff.
No, sir.
But, you know, we do occasionally get somebody go,
well, I guess you people think you're very smart.
So do you think you're geniuses or something?
Well, no, that's kind of,
almost sort of means the opposite.
But what you gonna do?
Well, what are they getting at?
Do they want to reprimand us
for our lack of smarts?
No, they want to reprimand us.
They want to reprimand us for thinking we're smart.
Because the word genius is somewhere.
...existing in the first place
and disturbing their equilibrium.
And you don't want to explain to them,
no, Pobucker, don't you understand?
What we're saying is they've missed,
been misdefining intelligence all this time.
You got it all mixed up.
Intelligence is not wisdom.
Well, you know, Pobucker, illiterate Pobucker,
you might be the smartest person around here.
But how are you gonna find out?
Because you hate book learning,
and you don't want to be
pompous talking like I'm doing.
Well, that's wisdom.
It's not intelligence.
Wisdom is the stuff you accumulate.
Intelligence is what you do with it,
essentially, to break it down into two.
Sure, there's lots of book-smart folks around,
but they don't know how to change attire,
and they never brush their teeth.
And they never change their attire.
Right, and they never change their underwear,
even more important.
Bob don't ever change.
Weren't we talking about this last year
with the problem where subgeniuses
are suddenly the smartest people in the room,
and that's like a terrifying, terrifying revelation.
Well, it's gonna happen.
That was Pisces' moment of horror.
Everybody else is gonna be gone,
and subgeniuses will be the smartest.
No, I mean while the people are still here, we are.
Oh, well, they're probably still the smartest,
even before that happens.
Yeah, but that's a grim, grim thought.
Well, it's grim that the average person
is incredibly stupid, and half of everybody is.
Everybody, by definition, is dumber than that.
Well, but at least it's not against the law yet
to sell stupid crap, or to buy stupid crap.
That's even more important.
Not saint stupid crap, although we could sell that.
What if, what if, what if,
well, people are always saying,
well, those televangelists that raise all that money
off our illiterate old ladies on TV,
they should go to jail.
Well, if Pastor Bob Tilton was gonna go to jail,
he'd throw us in jail, too.
Uh, well, he's tax-exempt, isn't he, Stang?
Yeah.
Well, that saves us.
That is our bulwark against meddling
from the nanny state government.
That's right, we pay our taxes.
Oh, just before we left, Cleveland,
uh, I mean, really, as we were about to leave,
the mailman came, and what did I find in the box
but the IRS writing the subgeniuses.
The subgenius foundation,
and that's a scary envelope to look upon.
They're writing the wrongs done to the subgenius foundation.
I was pretty sure that, um,
it was gonna be an audit.
They were gonna say,
well, we're gonna have to look at your books,
which, I, I hate to confess this.
Nobody looks at those books.
They're actually pretty accurate and sad,
but it's still a horrible hassle
to have the IRS dig through your stuff.
It's happened to me before.
Sure is.
You don't want them rummaging through your door.
But it turned out they were giving me money back.
I was gonna say that's another option.
Reverend Stunt, you made a mistake.
We owe you 320 more dollars.
Wow.
No, 323.
Not X day, tax day.
Right.
See, Dobbs comes through again.
Praise Bob.
See, I'm young enough that my taxes are simple enough
that I always get money back,
and a considerable amount, too.
Good for you.
So I enjoy doing my taxes every year.
That's the fun time of the year for me.
Boy, how amazing.
To me.
To me, incredible torture,
but I, you know, don't have those skills.
Well, you're basically bragging to the government
how broke you are,
and they go,
oh, that's so sad.
We shouldn't have taken so much from her paycheck.
We're sorry.
Here's $100 back.
Here's $60.
Here's $57 back.
Whatever.
Don't spend it all in one place.
Spend it to keep the economy humming.
Yeah, bragging about how much...
You just spend it on Magic cards.
It's all going to one single shop in...
Magic cards are liquid.
...my town.
You can sell those, can't you?
If you wanted to.
Not that you would.
Some of them get good value later.
You can save your dupes for trade and all of that.
Also, Arazu, I hope I can trust you
to look after my Magic cards right there.
Yes, no light-fingered subgenius...
Don't let anyone touch them.
...should dare filch them.
Well, you can also see from where you are
in your perch here,
as we overlook the card place,
the playing table.
Now, are those cards Magic like in stage Magic,
or like in supernatural Magic,
or that half-assed, kind of in-between OTO Magic?
I would say they were actual supernatural Magic.
Because I heard they were Devil.
That was Devil stuff.
The Magic is Devil stuff?
Magic the Gathering or the game or whatever,
that's Devil stuff.
That's been Devil stuff from the get-go.
I always got that about Dungeons & Dragons.
From Christians.
They believe in the Devil.
The Devil is a Christian character.
Step outside the Christian mythos.
Christians believe that all this Magic energy,
or mana, comes from the Devil.
Well, it doesn't come from God,
because you can't command God.
God commands.
But to Christians, let's remember,
all the old gods and other gods are demonic,
because they aren't Jesus.
So they're connected.
They're consigned to a demonic role
that they may not actually occupy.
Still, we can't really poo-poo this, can we?
Because our entire world is controlled
by an invisible supernatural force.
Something which does not exist
controls the entire human race.
And I refer to money.
Money no longer even exists in coins and bills, really,
but as tiny bits of symbolic energy,
information flashing past faster than nanoseconds.
But, uh, symbolically,
a thing that doesn't exist controls everybody's life,
compels suicides and everything else.
All the tragedy of life.
So let's not say that things that don't exist
can't affect a terrible change,
or wield power,
or be a source of destruction.
Praise Bob.
All those who...
If you think about it,
most people only know Bob as a flat sheet of paper.
And yet, look at the power he wields
over their very lives.
He's actually an 8D.
Especially their sex lives.
Well, I didn't want to talk about that.
Bob won't steer you wrong, friends,
in your private life,
as incredible as that might seem.
Is he trying to stay hip and current?
Did he get that ear piercing
with the safety pin in it?
Bob?
Is he trying to be cool?
Oh, uh, maybe...
Yeah, he went through a period there,
you know, lots of guys,
when they get to be about 45 or so,
they have this kind of second childhood.
I thought an infuriated fan did it.
But that's not...
Baby Bear, you know,
that's not really J.R. Bob Dobbs.
What?
That's a clever...
No.
That's a clever replica.
What? What?
It's realistic.
It looks just like him,
but that's just a dummy.
It's what we call a deodad.
That's why he's hanging there
as if he was dead.
Something to be given to God.
But that's not that weird
for Bob, either.
The idea is that...
I just thought he was...
I just thought he was being freaky.
You know, he's into that kind of stuff.
Well, he is.
He's being freaky.
He's with it.
He's relaxed.
He's a slackful, a studly guy.
But he's also a phony.
He's hanging up there
so that all the malevolence
will go into that dummy
and not the real J.R. Bob Dobbs.
And Bob didn't even plan it that way.
But he's naturally lucky,
and so that's the way
it will flow.
If that's not Bob,
I just don't know
what to believe anymore.
In some ways, all of us...
That's an idol.
...throws my whole world view
into chaos.
Baby Bear, it's an idol.
An idol.
We are not idolaters here.
Well, and it's also a sinkhole
for the bad vibes.
Yeah, but it sucks
those bad vibes in.

To say Bob.
And in that respect,
how is that dummy
so very different from us?
Not at all.
Are we not dummies for Bob
in some ways?
Yes, dang.
It's terrifying.
You know, we get
the anti-dummy.
We get the anti-slack,
and that keeps him
from getting the anti-slack.
Well, one thing about surfing
the luck plane, friends,
which every subgenius should do,
when you're surfing,
you will wipe out
from time to time.
That's just the way things are.
So you've got to get back
on the board.
Cowabunga.
And continue to surf
the luck plane
instead of whining
and complaining
about how you barked
your shins
and your elbows.
And that's the way









you're going to do it.
Oh, whatever else you did.
Because...
It's just because
you fell off your woody
and it came up
and knocked you in the head
and you can't ever surf again.
Don't hold that against
the luck plane.
Right.
It's worth the gamble,
we say.
Yeah.
And make sure
you send your money in
because if you become disabled,
then it'll be harder
for you to send that money
our way.
Right.
That's why we want
to keep you healthy, folks.
First things first.
Producing.
Live on



livestock for Bob.
Yes, the corrals must be filled
on that last day
when the bellwethers lead
the bleating herds
up the gleaming ramps
into the saucers.
No one seems to disagree.
That means you all
got to get to work
and have more kids.
Reverend Rachel Weardigan
is doing the right thing.
She's got one
and something in the oven.
How about that,
ladies and gentlemen?
A round of applause
for Bob.
Sub-Razoo.
There's the seed
deliverer there.
The rising generation.
He had something to do
with this, too.
Of sub-dini.
Welcome to your new life,
Reverend New Razoo.
Everything will be different.
Everything will be born again.
You know, some people,
when they become parents,
they go,
oh, now I've got to buckle down.
I can't.
I got to quit wasting my time
on this sub-genius stuff.

Oh, I've got to be
a real square now.
And others go,
wait, suddenly I have a kid
and a job and,
wait, this is my last chance.
If I continue in this direction,
I'll be a pink forever
with a station wagon
and a cute family.
This is my last chance
to completely wreck
my life forever.
I know.
I'll go to work
for J.R. Bob Dog's
full time.
Well, some said...
Yes, indeed.
If you look at the timeline,
my son, Zandy,
was born August 1979,
and by January 2nd, 1980,
the first sub-genius pamphlet
hit the streets.
And our first mentally ill
sub-geniuses started appearing.
Thanks, Buck.
She lives on Main Street
Bland and normal
Main Street.
So, yeah, it doesn't have to be
the end of the world.
She has a station wagon,
subscribes to House and Garden.
You can be that square
with the square job
and the square car
and the square little children.
A regular fella,
regular clothes,
regular appearance.
And still be like Bob.
He's the squarest,
most normal-looking person
of any of us.
Yes, but that glint
in his eye shows that
the sub-genius thing,
is not cryptic,
where he is concerned.
But some sad subs
have to put up with
having all their sub-genius stuff
in one little closet-like room.
And everything else
is a normal house.
That normal eyes is,
and that normal people
wouldn't be uncomfortable in.
But a true blue,
sold-down-the-river sub-genius,
his entire house
is his slack altar.
Well, you know,
a lot of that depends on...
The thousands of
undustable doodads.
That depends on the spouse.
Yes, the spouse sometimes
just can't handle
all these grimacing
little statuettes and so on.
And so they're sort of in the
dad's rumpus room.
We don't go in there.
Come and look at the carpets in here.
See, you don't have to worry about it
with Arazu and Rachel Weard again,
because their entire house
is beautiful,
bulldada.
Of course.
Slack altar.
We would expect nothing less.
If they wanted to go straight,
they'd have to throw
everything away
and buy everything anew.
And I heard you don't have
that much money after you have kids.
Too painful.
Too hard to do.
And besides,
these so-called hoarders
don't have too much stuff.
They just don't have enough room.
That's it.
So contribute.
Donate.
And...
So that I will have more room
in the slacker room.
I don't know how much stuff
was brought,
but the bulldada auction
at these events
is a great time
to pick up more dust catchers.
And haul them home.
So we hope...
We don't know what's in the hopper,
but we may be able to sell
more stuff,
like the wonderful videos
that were just donated
by Mr. Sistar.
He sure is generous
for a greedy old Republican type,
isn't he?
He's playing it on both sides.
Every time I make fun
of Republicans on the computer,
I'm looking at a monitor
that he donated to us.
He's the biggest socialist
in the world.
He's the biggest socialist
in the whole gang.
From each according
to his means
to each according
to his needs.
That's right.
Oh, well.
But remember,
a revolution is not a tea party.
But you know,
if you do have to...
If you do have to
pretend to be normal,
there's no shame in that.
That's...
The masks of abnormality
were spoken of early
in the church's history
by Dr. Philo Drummond,
who...
I think it's...
As an arms salesman
for the conspiracy,
you should really
look pretty straight.
It's great to be
a secret subgenius
burrowing into the belly
of the beast
like some liver fluke
or whatever.
You seem to be normal.
Like the Kandiru Toad.
Like the Kandiru Toad.
There are warnings
posted around
about the Kandiru Toad,
I believe.
And you know,
you seem to be,
in this scenario,
eager disciple of normalcy.
But you're actually
a subgenius. And when you're supposed to be working on your computer, you're actually
listening to clandestine radio shows and all sorts of
forbidden subgenius activity. That's my life
at work. And they couldn't get along without you. Headphones in
and just listening to weird stuff. Although they got rid of the dress code
last year, so now I just wear metal t-shirts.
That's pretty cool. Metal? That might pinch a little bit.
You wouldn't want to go to work for a church of subgenius because we won't let you do that.
We'll log every single keystroke you do. You can't look at
slack hole or... I don't know. I don't do that that much. I still get a lot of work done.
Yes, exactly. See, that's why I never get to do any of that.
I'm my own boss. That means I'm not paid by the hour.
But if you work for the church, then isn't being on Scrub part of
working for the church? Make the updates
and check in on everything.
He bullies himself to get himself to work.
Well, you know, a subgenius can only get to work
after procrastinating, and that's what I use the Scrub Genius Forum for.
That's the pressure that builds up that forces the action to take place.
I'll go on and on TLDR about the job I'm about to have to do.
TLDR? And then the job only takes about five minutes once you're energized
with procrastination. Or it seems like it takes five minutes because you're not there
when it's happening. You're off doing...
You're off doing something else while your hands are busy.
But I know it's true in your case that if you stop working for your conspiracy job,
the whole enterprise would crumble like a rotten pumpkin.
Actually, it's probably going to do that whether or not I stay because...
You're prolonging its life.
There's a huge exodus at my job right now, and I'm kind of having fun watching the whole thing
deteriorate, and everyone is just all falling around all the manager's ears,
and it's kind of fun to watch.
I don't know how I could say this, but there must be a...
subgenius here somewhere in this organization. Nothing else explains it.
We've got to root him out, man.
Right-o, Mr. Big.
Well, that won't happen.
Well, I've kept several really despicable pink offices going
with my skills and talent and hard work.
I used to work for Christian filmmakers.
TV commercials and industrial films and stuff like that.
The Christian with the clodhoppers who run across...
But by golly, I got paid 20 bucks a day.
And with that, I could go home and buy Dobbs heads.
Hundreds and hundreds of Dobbs heads.
Plus you could splice in...
And eventually dinner.
Splice in single frames of, like, penises and things like that.
Right, yeah.
In Christian films, yes.
You get subliminal projection to make them sit up straight.
If that subliminal crap worked,
we subgeniuses...
would be way ahead of where we are.
I don't think it works.
How about superliminal projection?
Instead of some tiny little thing that just flashes on for a moment
that your subconscious mind picks up,
a huge towering sign that's always there
that's too big to see consciously,
but you're actually loading it as information
while you're in its presence.
Right, you can only tell that there's been a Dobbs head looming over you
when you take your first helicopter ride.
And see that that mountain really is a Dobbs head,
only you have to be seeing it from way, way back.
All right, I don't want to get disgusting and gross here,
but I heard from parents of small children...
Ew!
...that a Dobbs head is great for toilet training.
If you're having trouble with that little moppet on the pot
and he's being a handful,
if you put a Dobbs head in front of the toilet,
it just causes him to let go and all the problem is solved.
No kidding.
People, more than one person has told me this anecdote
that I wasn't prepared to hear, didn't want to hear,
but now you've heard it.
I thought the gross part of that story was parents with small children.
That was the gross part, of course.
Hey, I can add to that a grandparent's story.
Uh-oh, even worse.
When, of course, a subgenius radio host
does the unthinkable and becomes a parent,
of course you train your kids to say Bob stuff.
Shineful, shineful.
There's a...
There's a recording of my daughter at age two and a half or three, maybe.
You have to love Bob. You have to.
Right, right. Yeah, yeah.
If you don't love Bob, he'll Bob you out.
Bob you out.
He'll kill you. He'll Bob you out.
You have to love Bob.
He loves you, but you love Bob.
You have to.
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?
He'll kill you.
He'll Bob you out.
He'll Bob you out, folks.
You heard it here first.
If you don't love Bob, he'll Bob you out, man.
This morning...
Yeah, she does it perfectly.
You have to love Bob. You have to.
It's really good.
Doing your homework.
You can see I have played that little piece of tape a lot.
Well, this very morning, before we left the big house,
I checked my email, and my daughter,
the one who said that...
Oh.
...had sent me a recording of our grandchildren doing the same thing.
In unison.
In unison.
The first recording was just one of them going,
He'll kill you.
He'll Bob you out.
But they don't have a Texas accent.
She had to teach them that.
Bob will kill you.
And then you could hear both of them.
We'll Bob you out.
We'll kill you.
We'll Bob you out.
We're gonna Bob you out.
We're gonna Bob you out.
We're gonna Bob you out.

If you could just see these little subgenius grandchildren.
Don't kill Bob, Daddy.
I love him.
I taught my nephew that.
That was one of the first words I taught him.
Easy to say.
Impossible to forget.
He still responds to it.
He just turned four.
He still remembers.
If he comes into my house and sees the Dobbs head,
He'll never forget.
No.
Well, you know, to this day,
I've run into people who go,
Oh, wow.
This Bob.
Bob thing.
My parents made me memorize that stuff back in the day.
I hate that crap.
And the person saying that is 45 or 50 years old.
A sad, sorry sight.
Yeah.
But there's always the new crop.
Now, my kids were never all that impressed by J.R. Bob Dobbs.
He was just around too much.
You know, the presidency.
They learned to pee on Bob's head very early in the game.
They didn't have to be taught.
I'm told that toilet training thing really does work.
There's something about the Dobbs head that removes the tension and the kids can just go.
Or scares them.
Maybe.
Or scares the crap out of them.
Well, and when you get older,
and I'm not saying any of us have to do this.
No, you don't have to do any of that.
Say you have problems with, you know, sexual release or something.
Some, I'm not saying who,
have found that, you know, having a Dobbs head,
uh, mask on the sex partner or something like that.
You know, a Dobbs head pinned up on the headboard.
We have the, uh,
at the moment of crisis, so to speak.
You can look up and, you know, it's not queer if it's Bob.
Okay, guys?
I mean, that's, you don't have to, not that I would know.
And so what if it is?
You don't have to, yeah, right.
So what if it is?
Exactly.
Yes, you're queer for Bob, aren't you?
Sure.
We all are.
Yeah.
We like it.
Yeah.
We used to, we used to have an ad on the back of the catalog.
Yeah.



It said, Bob's post office box is a hole.
Be cool like gay people and fill Bob's hole.
Some people didn't get, you know, people get offended too easily.
You gotta be careful.
They're all gloomy, grumpy gusses.
