1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,100
B.D.I.s flexing, flexing, eager to crush out life.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,980
Great teeth gnashing with rage, powerful fingers flashing with hatred.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,740
Boyd, what are you doing up on that thing?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,660
And now, for the first time on the air...

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,900
The subgenius, our old swat.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,100
Run!

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,440
How were we to dislodge him from his perch and bring him back alive?

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,700
That is how the Batiks, the natives, make a complete roof over your head.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,120
Bizarre.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,040
Bizarre.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,240
Bizarre.

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,600
Well, sir? Well, sir, ma'am?

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,680
I better get this show on the road,

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,920
because Honey Dipper Dan is on his way to Stang Ranch here.

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,160
He'll be here in about half an hour.

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,060
We'll hear the dogs barking.

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,840
But I have to crank out a show,

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,220
and I might just end up talking for an entire hour,

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,840
because it's the quickest way to crank out a show.

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,200
If there's any cussing, I'll know where it was.

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
And it's...

22
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,640
The reason I've had to do reruns so much lately

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,800
and haven't been doing the call-ins with Dave and so forth

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,240
is that I've been stiff.

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,460
I've been stiffer and stiffer and stiffer.

26
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,340
I ain't stiff myself yet, but I'm really slowed down.

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:41,780
And because of a combination of a couple of kinds of arthritis

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,740
in my back and neck,

29
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,920
and 40 years of Church of the Subgenius,

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,200
and fossils,

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:53,860
and people collecting,

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,280
and landscaping of a large property,

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,360
I'd rather be trimming trails and lopping branches, honestly.

34
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,940
But I can't do much of that,

35
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,640
and I can't sit in one place for very long, friends.

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,600
The excess...

37
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,920
You know, sometimes I think X-Day is just happening continuously,

38
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,340
and they're just taking little bits and pieces of us up onto the...

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,700
escape vessels.

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,400
And they took the integrity of my lower back.

41
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,920
I can still walk and everything, but...

42
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,980
But I...

43
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,720
Everything's much slower.

44
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,300
I'm definitely 68 years old.

45
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,260
Things have slowed down.

46
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,620
And there's a lot of things that I want to get done

47
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,760
besides this show,

48
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,600
before the saucers come.

49
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,420
I've done 1,883 shows.

50
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,780
That includes some reruns, but the reruns take a long time to do.

51
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,420
I've done 1,883 shows.

52
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:53,420


53
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,240
And...

54
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,300
And...

55
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,320
It's harder for me to do shows with other people by phone,

56
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,360
especially Dave,

57
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,320
because my hearing has not gotten any better.

58
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,420
It's probably gotten worse.

59
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,440
And Dave's speaking has not gotten any better.

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,600
He's got early-onset Parkinson's.

61
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,640
And he was always a struggle to understand.

62
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,100
But it's not just me.

63
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,300
My wife has trouble understanding.

64
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,420
And I think that's the thing.

65
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,420


66
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,420


67
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,580
I just don't want to do a radio show

68
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,760
where I'm embarrassed half the time

69
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,480
because I can't hear anything.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,160
It's just too goofy.

71
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,060
But there are lots of other things to talk about.

72
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,300
I'm going to catch you all up on some stuff

73
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,520
that you would not know about

74
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,360
unless you were pretty active

75
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,920
in the subgenius Internet world.

76
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,400
There's so many face...

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,240
The number of subgenius Facebook groups

78
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,280
is too damn high.

79
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,400
And so,

80
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:53,420


81
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:53,420


82
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,580
scrubgenius has kind of slowed down.

83
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,160
It's all old people.

84
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,440
But, there are...

85
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,140
Darn it!

86
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,260
See, I knew my phone

87
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,360
was going to give me hell.

88
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,120
Oh, it's time to go and take my time-lapse picture

89
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,680
of my garden.

90
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,080
Princess Wee!

91
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,300
Can you take the garden picture?

92
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,280
Thank you.

93
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,300
Every day at noon,

94
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,620
there's this waterproof camera

95
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,340
sitting on...

96
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,400
the cheapest tripod in the world.

97
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,700
And every day at noon,

98
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,860
we take a picture of my

99
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,940
huge garden.

100
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,860
It's a vegetable garden, not a flower garden.

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,900
This is all edibles.

102
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,700
Here at Stang Ranch.

103
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,740
Because why not? We got free goat poop.

104
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,960
Free well water.

105
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,180
And seeds are cheap.

106
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,800
Okay. Anyway.

107
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,260
Yeah, my hearing is bad

108
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,280
and that means I can't sweeten

109
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,200
bad sound like I used to.

110
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,560
Because I can't

111
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,940
tell if what I'm hearing is anything

112
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,200
remotely like what others hear.

113
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,060
I can hear human speech.

114
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,020
I have special devices that

115
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,840
allow that to happen.

116
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,460
But it doesn't sound the way

117
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,920
it sounds to you.

118
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,260
But, but, but! Oh, I was talking about

119
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,120
the other subgenius forums that are

120
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,200
really good and much more

121
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,320
active. They've got newer,

122
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,320
younger crowd.

123
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,120
Nothing against the old crowd.

124
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,500
In fact, the best group is one

125
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,460
that you can't get to.

126
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,320
Because only the

127
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,640
very oldest, earliest subgenius

128
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,420
doctors can even know about it.

129
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,640
But it's very active.

130
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,740
Little good it does you.

131
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,240
But you can go to

132
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,940
Dobbs.town

133
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,100
which is sort of

134
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,740
monitored and babysat

135
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,000
a little bit by

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,580
Uncle Dr. Onan Kanabite.

137
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,340
He also

138
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,620
and it's really interactive.

139
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,880
It's fun to use.

140
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,520
It's on the

141
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,860
Mastodon platform

142
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,060
which is actually

143
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,080
really simple.

144
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,860
And you should check it out.

145
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,540
Onan also

146
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
sponsors DobbsTown.org

147
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,440
Now Dobbs.town

148
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,520
is two words

149
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,680
with a dot in between.

150
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,260
But DobbsTown.org

151
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,680
is different.

152
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,660
And that's where there's sort of a very

153
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,000
nice list of where the

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,580
subgenius movie is playing.

155
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,540
What

156
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,880
other news groups

157
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,680
and forums and pages

158
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,520
there are.

159
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,820
What's for sale.

160
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,020
News and so forth.

161
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,580
Yet another

162
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,180
subgenius forum is

163
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,720
DobbsCord.

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,440
On Discord

165
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,160
platform. But the easiest way to get to

166
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,980
DobbsCord

167
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,120
besides following the links

168
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,300
on the front page of subgenius.com

169
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,040
the simplest way is

170
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,740
you'll like this

171
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,400
subgeniuses.com

172
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,140
Just type in

173
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,780
subgeniuses.com

174
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,960
Dr.

175
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,900
Argus Fox and his

176
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,660
cohort, weirdos,

177
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,840
them and peas and fid and them

178
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,200
were smart enough to nail that

179
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,080
subgeniuses.com

180
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,400
domain and that's

181
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,680
great.

182
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,940
It's easy to remember.

183
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,880
Here's yet another one.

184
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,280
Did you know that there are monthly

185
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,440
Zoom meetings of subgeniuses?

186
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,400
It's been going

187
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,780
on for a couple of years now.

188
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,340
It's not very crowded. And also

189
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,940
there's a monthly Ask

190
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,900
Dr. Hal online

191
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,360
that's very entertaining. It's not

192
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,860
just Ask Dr. Hal.

193
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,400
There's, well, actually his shows

194
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,040
always involve this kind of thing. There's

195
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,340
monster movie clips that

196
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,140
he narrates. There's other people do

197
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,900
special shows.

198
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,180
Pastor Pressure does

199
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,300
real cool educational

200
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,480
things that are quite mirthful

201
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,260
and dry. All of

202
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,200
that is at

203
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,740
gonzotronics.net

204
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,100
g-o-n-z-o

205
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,120
gonzotronics

206
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,180
one more, gonzotronics

207
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,240
dot net

208
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,100
and that'll lead you to the

209
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,480
Ask Dr. Hal and monthly subgenius

210
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,340
diaspora. Princess Wee and I

211
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,340
get on that diaspora about every other

212
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:23,840
month.

213
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,500
And

214
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,280
depending on

215
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,960
how bad my

216
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,720
haircut is, I'm

217
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,240
very vain about that one

218
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,340
long hair I have left.

219
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,240
Okay.

220
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,780
And also X Day.

221
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,240
X Day Drill, maybe. Well, no.

222
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,200
This is the real X Day. That's how they're

223
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,780
billing it. And it's not July

224
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,000
4th weekend. It's

225
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,940
a somewhat cooler weekend,

226
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,060
we would guess.

227
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,380
June 10th

228
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,220
through June 13th.

229
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,820
Yes, June 10th through June 13th.

230
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,180
The real X Day.

231
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,540
Actually, everybody has X Day

232
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,640
anytime they want.

233
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,400
The real X Day happens all over the whole

234
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,900
planet.

235
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,180
Actually, as the planet turns

236
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,580
underneath a big line.

237
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,400
Well, ding, dang it.

238
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,220
There is no slack.

239
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,760
There is no slack. There is no slack.

240
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,520
I looked down.

241
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,100
I was in the middle of talking about X Day.

242
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,840
I looked down and my battery had run out

243
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,280
on the recorder. Little digital

244
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
recorder here. No battery.

245
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,280
I don't know when it ran out. I know I was

246
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,360
talking about X Day

247
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,060
and how it happens everywhere

248
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,620
all the time.

249
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,160
And you better be ready for it. But

250
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,180
we like to have parties. And

251
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,240
we've encouraged people this

252
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,120
year to have their own parties because

253
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,340
...

254
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,340
mainly because

255
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,920
we lost our

256
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,280
we temporarily lost our new Florida venue

257
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,380
until next year.

258
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,300
I can't do anything this

259
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,140
year anyway.

260
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,200
And in this case, it's not because of my

261
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
health. It's because I have other people

262
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,620
I have to take care of here.

263
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,460
Some of

264
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,300
you may know that we're taking care of

265
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,000
Wee Ma Ma.

266
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,100
She's the queen mom of

267
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,060
Princess Wee.

268
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,860
She's 92 Earthly years

269
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,800
old. And

270
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,280
nurses come here three times a day.

271
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,360
In fact, you may hear

272
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,240
them. Hospice nurses they're called.

273
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,360
You may hear one in a minute come in

274
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,180
the background. Anyway, so there's

275
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,040
a lot going on here. You know?

276
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,220
And, but

277
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,140
there's a lot going on outside

278
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,280
in the world. And June 10th

279
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,040
to June 13th is

280
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,280
a big party. We hope

281
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,000
it's a big party.

282
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,960
At the G Lodge.

283
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,060
81 Keller Road

284
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,320
in beautiful Hannibal, New

285
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:53,800
York.

286
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,480
I told you you'd hear dogs.

287
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,560
That's

288
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,460
three times a day this happens.

289
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,440
And that's not even the honey dipper man yet.

290
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,400
I'm just going to proceed.

291
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,180
This is part of the world.

292
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,100
And by the way, the music in the background

293
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,380
is Witch Disco. A CD.

294
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,760
Rare CD by Einstein's

295
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,640
Secret Orchestra.

296
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,920
Lonesome Cowboy Dave on guitar.

297
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,240
Chaz Smith on keyboards.

298
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,700
Good.

299
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,760
Settle down Chupacabra.

300
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,360
It's okay baby.

301
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,840
Oh God.

302
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,700
This is a barnyard.

303
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,920
It's a madhouse.

304
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,140
It's a madhouse.

305
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,160
I guess Princess

306
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,820
We must be busy with something.

307
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,060
No, hey Chupy, no.

308
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,720
Get down.

309
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,420
I was hoping I wouldn't

310
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,620
have to edit this show.

311
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,620
Well, maybe I won't.

312
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,640
God almighty. Okay, yeah.

313
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,880
This is so ridiculous.

314
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,920
X Day. The real X Day.

315
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,040
Four day.

316
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,800
Gut blowout gonzo extravaganza.

317
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,920
Friday, June 10th

318
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,380
to Monday, June 13th

319
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,200
in Hannibal, New York

320
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,280
at a lodge.

321
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,560
There's a camping fee.

322
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,280
And there's a fee.

323
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,420
Well, it's

324
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,320
it costs more if you're not already

325
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
a subgenius minister.

326
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,420
I've got too many

327
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,140
public supported stations for me to

328
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,200
discuss prices, but you can find

329
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,560
their website

330
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,180
by going to

331
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,480
subgenius.com

332
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,940
and looking at the events

333
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,540
section. There's a link to

334
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,280
their, it's, here's their

335
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,840
URL.

336
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,980
Xday.ticketleap.com

337
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,340
slash 2022.

338
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,820
I read that last week. Anyway,

339
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,340
what if at the stroke of midnight on the

340
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,100
night of 11th of June,

341
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,200
what if that is the

342
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,620
one true end times?

343
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,980
Could the world end? If it didn't,

344
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,160
would you have to go back to work?

345
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,220
I would, and I'm

346
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,660
far as I know, I'm the only

347
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,440
world's only full-time

348
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,760
person working for Bob.

349
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,400
What if

350
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,860
Bob told us a false

351
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,220
date just to test us?

352
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,420
Come to

353
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,300
the real X Day and experience the end

354
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,880
of the world in style with the only

355
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,340
UFO death cult staffed

356
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,720
by swinging mutants

357
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,180
and the terminally abnormal.

358
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,240
Do you think the universe is

359
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
one sick joke? Do you

360
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,060
offer jokes when presented

361
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,120
problems? Do you

362
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,440
would rather have a good time than a bad trip?

363
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,320
Do you can help

364
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
us with a donation? Then the church

365
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,440
of the subgenius is just the punchline

366
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,140
you were looking for. Repent,

367
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,140
quit your job, slack off, come to the real

368
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,220
X Day and party like it's July

369
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,440
5th, 1998.

370
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,660
So there you go.

371
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,240
Dr. Howell will be there,

372
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,000
Rubik's pube will be there,

373
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,360
I will not be there, I wish I

374
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,420
could, but I can't.

375
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,180
And,

376
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,200
yeah, like I say, it's much cheaper

377
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,640
for subgenius

378
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,280
ministers, but

379
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,100
it's still pretty cheap

380
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,620
either way.

381
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,220
Other news I can

382
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,780
add here is that

383
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,380
oh, the agent and Mr. Dodd,

384
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,320
our latest novel,

385
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,440
subgenius novel publishing thing

386
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,720
by

387
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,000
Reverend Teeters LaVerge,

388
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,440
I read half

389
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,420
of it a couple of months ago

390
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,000
on the air.

391
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,020
We had a hardcover version out

392
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,280
that we were charging a lot for because

393
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,740
it was a special numbered edition,

394
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,300
but the paperback, by the time you hear this

395
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,500
probably the paperback version will be out

396
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,480
or almost out. Just look at

397
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,200
subgenius.com at the

398
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,080
main shop.

399
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,020
Bull.com, time control labs.

400
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,660
And,

401
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,380
under books.

402
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,320
And you'll find it. And we still have

403
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,640
Eyelash, the subgenius

404
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,280
science fiction book by Nicolai

405
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,860
Kingsley and Neighbor World.

406
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,160
Lonesome Cowboy Dave's

407
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,420
amazing novel written in

408
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,420
future slang.

409
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,000
You'll love them all.

410
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:17,840
And,

411
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,260
and more to come.

412
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,360
Australian subgeniuses,

413
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,380
and New Zealand subgeniuses.

414
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,260
Maybe

415
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,240
you're hearing this. I can

416
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,480
finally mail your stuff.

417
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,880
Many may not know that

418
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,080
one could not mail

419
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,280
anything from the United States to

420
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,300
Australia or New Zealand for about

421
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,500
six months there

422
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,240
because of COVID and stupid

423
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,280
crap. But

424
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,340
that has ended and I'm about

425
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,260
to mail all that stuff to Australia.

426
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,800
It's going to cost a fortune.

427
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,020
Seriously.

428
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,600
The subgenius

429
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,820
movie is

430
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,060
running on

431
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,140
Tubi and other things

432
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,880
but it's free on Tubi. It has,

433
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,220
it even has ads.

434
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,400
And it has subtitles.

435
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
My copy doesn't

436
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,120
have subtitles.

437
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,160
You know,

438
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,020
I can't hear an audio book

439
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,620
unless it has subtitles.

440
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,640
Isn't that sad?

441
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,540
Um,

442
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,580
okay. Yeah, the subgenius

443
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,020
movie is still really good.

444
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,200
And if you haven't seen it,

445
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,800
you really should. It's,

446
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,220
you think you know everything. You don't know nothing.

447
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,220
It's really well done. It's

448
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,020
really funny. The editing on it is

449
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,260
just mind blowing. Even the

450
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,120
sound mix is mind

451
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,260
blowing. It's really slick

452
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,560
all the way down the line.

453
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,960
And I helped.

454
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:47,980
Um,

455
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,180
what other news

456
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,300
do we have? Well, here. I'll tell you what

457
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,640
one of my projects is.

458
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,380
Then I'll

459
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,380
do some funny stuff. But I have personal

460
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,360
projects. And one of them

461
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,260
is a rather recent, sudden

462
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,400
one that came up when my bro

463
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,380
of 30 years,

464
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,720
Potter Nostril,

465
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,200
mentioned to me in an email

466
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,160
that he found a, an

467
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,280
affordable system for

468
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,440
digitizing Super 8

469
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,200
and 8mm ancient

470
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,160
home movies.

471
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,420
And it worked. And, uh,

472
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,900
and I got one.

473
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,980
And it is, it's

474
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,420
practically free compared to

475
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,540
paying for a service to do this kind of thing.

476
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,840
The one I'm using is called the Wolverine

477
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,200
Pro. No

478
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,240
relation to X-Men or

479
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,480
the Little Animal.

480
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,380
Uh, Kodak

481
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,420
also makes one.

482
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,320
They're kind of flimsy looking. They have a

483
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,300
couple of, they have a take up reel.

484
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,780
They hold two reels.

485
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,620
One side's motorized.

486
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,220
And it slowly pulls your

487
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,300
ancient home movies through the, past

488
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,180
the little scanner. Click, click,

489
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,260
click. Two per second.

490
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,080
Um,

491
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,340
and it displays what

492
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,260
it's scanning on

493
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,320
itself or on a big TV if you hook

494
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,480
that up. So for one month,

495
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,260
I have

496
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,120
been scanning all

497
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,280
of the 8mm and Super

498
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,420
8 movies in my archive, which is

499
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,180
pretty much all of them. Two

500
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,340
are missing that I can remember.

501
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,660
Only two.

502
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,300
I've scanned about

503
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,440
350 foot

504
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,180
reels.

505
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,300
Most people's home movies

506
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,200
are, you know, the kids opening

507
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,340
presents at Christmas. And there's a little of

508
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,480
that. But

509
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,980
I shot all these home movies.

510
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,500
Not my parents. I shot

511
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,200
them. Starting when I was 10.

512
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,260
And I wasn't interested

513
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,400
in family vacation stuff.

514
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,340
Although I shot that too. And that's

515
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,680
actually some of the most valuable

516
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,080
footage. But the funniest stuff

517
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
is the put on

518
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,340
monster movies that my brother and

519
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,660
I and our buddies did.

520
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,300
I've been putting those on my, the ones

521
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,420
that I, that we kind of finished

522
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,280
that were worth

523
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,080
looking at, that I remember

524
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,200
projecting a lot.

525
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,020
I narrated those recently.

526
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,520
60 years after the fact.

527
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,440
Almost. And they're

528
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,260
on YouTube. My YouTube channel.

529
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,980
RevStang.

530
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,700
But,

531
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,260
then the other ones were, I kept

532
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,960
discovering little treasures. Just

533
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,120
amazingly bizarre

534
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,200
and sick stuff. And

535
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,440
I just couldn't stop. I'm also doing

536
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,220
my wife's home movies

537
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,340
which were shot by her parents. And there's

538
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,520
a lot fewer of those.

539
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,800
But it's

540
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,020
been a real gas. I've been

541
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,240
learning that I haven't changed all

542
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,380
that much. My sense of humor was just

543
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,200
about the same

544
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,120
back when I was 11

545
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,320
years old trying to make monster movies.

546
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,260
I knew we didn't have the budget

547
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,080
for it to do it right

548
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,220
like a grown up. So let's do it fun

549
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,260
like a kid. With all

550
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,160
the fake blood we want. Boy

551
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,040
we messed up a lot of clothing back then.

552
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,260
So that's been going

553
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,280
on. That's been fun. That distracted

554
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,420
me from the newly discovered dinosaur

555
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,420
tracks on Stag Ranch.

556
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,400
Really close to the house.

557
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,360
We had one set

558
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,360
they're hard to get to in the back

559
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,960
40. But

560
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,380
my brother stumbled upon

561
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,320
some that I guess we'd

562
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,180
missed. They'd been under water or something

563
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,260
and the creek's totally dry.

564
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,180
And there's a

565
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,360
long string of them. They're not good

566
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,880
but they are

567
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,120
for real. And there are

568
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,380
a lot of them. And there are several different kinds.

569
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,560
There's at least two kinds.

570
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,680
Some kind of theropod, probably

571
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,920
acrocanthosaurus and some sort of

572
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:49,720
sauropod.

573
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,940
Probably a

574
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,940
let's just say brontosaurus.

575
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,160
Okay. And because

576
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,860
we don't know. But

577
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,220
it's fun. They're fun. They're

578
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:01,660
really fun.

579
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,260
I probably will not

580
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,280
ever get to making plaster casts

581
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,360
like we did of the three

582
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,460
high quality ones in the back 40.

583
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,280
And now back

584
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,100
to the Church of the Subgenius.

585
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,120
I've got lots of funny stuff

586
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,340
here. I can read from the Dobbs

587
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,480
Town Mirror. I can read

588
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,340
some, well here's a few little quotes.

589
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,140
Some quotes from recent

590
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,620
quotes.

591
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,360
He might be an ass, but he's

592
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,300
Bob's ass.

593
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,400
Now see the way I read that

594
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,980
I don't have to do an edit.

595
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,180
There was another word in there.

596
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,980
Onan

597
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,200
heard Bob say

598
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,780
in the restaurant

599
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,880
of the eyeball eaters

600
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,840
the one eyed man

601
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,820
is whiter.

602
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,240
Onan also

603
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,360
found an old flyer

604
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,140
from a three day

605
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,300
sales seminar that Bob did in

606
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,260
1982 that

607
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,920
we missed called

608
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,780
Laugh Till Your Guts Bleed

609
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,280
Invitation or Warning.

610
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,140
Now you think about that.

611
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,420
And finally

612
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,980
Reverend Angry Larry

613
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,400
the greatest guitar player

614
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,860
in the world.

615
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,920
Well actually that's arguable.

616
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,020
Um.

617
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,300
He's the greatest

618
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,720
thrash surf

619
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,300
guitar player in the world.

620
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,100
He has

621
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,160
revealed that

622
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,220
space aliens created the

623
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,100
dinosaurs to build the

624
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,120
pyramids. Then

625
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,280
they double crossed the dinosaurs after the

626
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,020
work was done and

627
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,800
made them extinct. That

628
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,120
is your Forbidden Sciences

629
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,300
subgenius history lesson for

630
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,980
the day. You're welcome and praised.

631
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,600
Bob says Reverend Angry

632
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,840
Larry. And friends these

633
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,160
slaxioms are in fact

634
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,780
the gospel

635
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:01,540
truth.

636
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,360
Um.

637
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,320
Let's see. Before I get

638
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,920
to Dobstocktown

639
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,300
I want to read you all

640
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,020
speaking of quotes. I like little

641
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,280
pithy quotes when I'm

642
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,360
not feeling too pithy about everything.

643
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,340
I read

644
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,460
this news magazine called The Week.

645
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,360
The reason I read it. In print

646
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,340
or the reason I read it in print

647
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,300
is because they try

648
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,000
to cover both the

649
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,780
standard

650
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,480
conservatard and

651
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,340
differently lived

652
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,280
uh. Oh wait I'm not

653
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,720
supposed to use that tard word.

654
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,280
Anyway you know what I mean. They try to cover

655
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,200
both tribal

656
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,920
idiocies and

657
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,420
um. Oh here's an interesting

658
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,520
statistic.

659
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,460
Uh. This is actually

660
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,860
this is kind of old news.

661
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,520
The specter

662
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,980
of a hot war with China

663
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,360
has 71% of us rattled.

664
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,540
61% of us

665
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,140
worry that a nuclear war

666
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,060
could erupt.

667
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,000
57% of us believe

668
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,640
in ghosts. 39%

669
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,240
in visitors from other planets

670
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,920
and 27%

671
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,180
in Bigfoot. Also

672
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,920
known as Sam Squanch.

673
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,100
And there are some

674
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,900
anxious carnivores with

675
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,120
26% of Americans

676
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
believing that there's a movement

677
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,120
to ban red meat.

678
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,180
Which 59%

679
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,340
say is essential to the

680
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,580
American way of life.

681
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,740
Well

682
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,180
I'm in a

683
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,260
I'm. My family

684
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,300
raises red meat and I

685
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,420
don't eat much of it at all.

686
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,360
I'll certainly eat it to be polite.

687
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,980
It's mainly a health thing.

688
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,740
Uh.

689
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,120
And I can't eat goat.

690
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,980
I'd feel like a cannibal. Here's some

691
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,540
interesting statistics. A new study has found

692
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,140
that alcohol related

693
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,200
deaths skyrocketed

694
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,240
more than 25% during the

695
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,380
first year of the COVID pandemic

696
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,560
to nearly 100,000.

697
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,520
And

698
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
get this.

699
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,060
Alcohol actually killed

700
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,160
more than, more under

701
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,640
65 Americans

702
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,840
than COVID during

703
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,020
2020. And

704
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,160
experts think there's even more drinking in

705
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,420
2021. Now see I don't have to

706
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,100
worry about that because I'm over 65

707
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,460
so I can drink like a fish.

708
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,780
But um

709
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,280
but it uh

710
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,220
yeah it actually killed more, more young

711
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,020
folks than COVID did.

712
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,100
Because they're stupid.

713
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,040
Because they don't

714
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,220
they don't just drink to

715
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,140
ease the arthritis. They drink to get

716
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,220
messed

717
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,300
up. You know what I mean.

718
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,300
Okay here's wit and

719
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,460
wisdom that comes from a million

720
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,320
different sources. And I

721
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,960
selected a few from the week.

722
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,240
Alfred Hitchcock

723
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,400
said that the length of a film should

724
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,340
be directly related to the

725
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,540
endurance of the human bladder.

726
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,200
So

727
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,180
that's kind of an F you Stanley

728
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,580
Kubrick from Alfred Hitchcock.

729
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,920
Um

730
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,660
Oh

731
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,180
here's a

732
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,080
touching one. Jonathan

733
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,200
Saffron

734
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,740
Fear

735
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,340
said you cannot

736
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,960
protect yourself from sadness

737
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,740
without protecting yourself

738
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,440
from happiness. So that's

739
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,420
kind of like you can't fend

740
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,040
off false slack

741
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,360
without fending off real slack.

742
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,260
No that's not true. That's not true.

743
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,200
So forget it. Skip

744
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,820
that one. Uh

745
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,980
Alexandra Solzhenitsyn

746
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,240
said evil people usually know

747
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,380
better than anyone else just what they're doing.

748
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,640
And they go on doing it.

749
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,440
Duh.

750
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,420
Mark Twain said

751
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,380
if you tell the truth you don't

752
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,600
have to remember anything.

753
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,560
And uh

754
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,240
after a certain point

755
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,660
in my life I tried

756
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,580
I kind of tried to switch

757
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,420
over to that. Things became

758
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,520
much more com-

759
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,140
much less complicated

760
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,540
when I no longer

761
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,460
had anything to hide.

762
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,500
You don't have to

763
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,200
remember anything.

764
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,440
C.G. Chesterton

765
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,420
agreed that

766
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,260
the great proto-subgenius said

767
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,840
the bible tells us to love our neighbors

768
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,980
and also to love our enemies.

769
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,620
Probably because generally

770
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,980
they're the same people.

771
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,280
And Tyler said

772
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,500
you can be in a good marriage

773
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,440
and you can be in a bad marriage

774
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,100
and they can both be the same one

775
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,960
but just at different times.

776
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,740
I know

777
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,840
I know about that.

778
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,660
I know about that.

779
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,420
And I think

780
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:53,420


781
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,280
Stephen Colbert

782
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,280
let me say something

783
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,580
as an objective observer.

784
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,200
It's never okay to punch a comedian.

785
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,120
I agree with that

786
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,960
as an objective observer.

787
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,320
And I've never been

788
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,480
in a comedy club

789
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,440
by the way. Ever.

790
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,240
Well once. I went to see Paul Krasner for free.

791
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,420
Okay. Star Jones

792
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,760
said

793
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,300
you're never allowed to step

794
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,360
on people to get ahead

795
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,940
but you can step over them

796
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,240
and they're in your way.

797
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,900
I like that one a whole lot.

798
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,280
Boy this is so sad.

799
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,860
Henry Adams

800
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,580
Politics as a practice

801
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,140
has always been

802
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,620
the systematic organization

803
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,320
of hatreds.

804
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,040
I'll say that again.

805
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,000
I'll cut it closer.

806
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,440
Politics has always been

807
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,380
the systematic organization

808
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,020
of hatreds.

809
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,260
That's never been more clear

810
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,320
than in American politics

811
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:53,700
now.

812
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,040
Because that's all it is.

813
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,200
Organized hatred.

814
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,220
Trevor Noah said

815
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,800
just as a general rule

816
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,020
nothing should change

817
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,280
mid-flight ever.

818
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,360
I haven't been on a plane in a long time

819
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,280
but I know what he means.

820
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,400
Well here's the last one of these.

821
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,140
Somebody named Jerome K. Jerome

822
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,880
I wonder if he knows G. Gordon Gordon.

823
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,080
Jerome K. Jerome said

824
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,620
I like work.

825
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,280
It fascinates me.

826
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,040
I can sit and look at it for hours.

827
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,200
And despite record turnout

828
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,880
80 million American adults

829
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,100
did not vote

830
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,140
in November

831
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,700
of 2020.

832
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,820
29% weren't registered.

833
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,640
23% don't care about politics.

834
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,200
20% don't like any of the candidates.

835
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,420
16% don't feel like

836
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:53,420


837
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:53,420


838
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:53,420


839
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,300
their vote would matter.

840
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,860
10% don't know who to vote for.

841
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,020
8% are scared of COVID.

842
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,100
And 53%

843
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,440
think it makes no difference

844
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,140
who's president.

845
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,800
Things just go on as they do before.

846
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,700
And I don't agree with that at all.

847
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,580
I think there is a big difference.

848
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,880
Here's a funny song by Reverend Pease.

849
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,300
I don't know what sort of melody

850
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,560
is supposed to go with it.

851
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Reverend Pease wrote this funny song.

852
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,920
It's more like a poem

853
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,760
than the way I'm going to do it.

854
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,500
Bob's Monkey, ain't I lucky.

855
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,220
Don't live in a zoo,

856
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,940
I'm in the street with you.

857
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,940
Slacking and rocking is what I do.

858
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,940
I'm Bob's Monkey,

859
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,800
what are you?

860
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,920
I eat chicken tacos

861
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,020
cause I don't like nachos.

862
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,920
I drink hard cider

863
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,240
but I'm no fighter.

864
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,420
And I didn't steal your lighter.

865
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,640
The undercover merkin

866
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,460
who's always smirkin.

867
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,200
I'm Bob's Monkey,

868
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,440
who are you?

869
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,400
Isn't that cute?

870
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,680
That old Pease, he's just the cutest little thing.

871
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,880
Not everybody would agree with me on that.

872
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,060
But he is. He's just the cutest little thing.

873
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,360
Now here's something

874
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,280
that I'm going to try to read

875
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,020
to y'all.

876
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,240
It's actually

877
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,360
it started out

878
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,960
as just a little chat,

879
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,320
a text chat

880
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,000
on the secret

881
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,200
subgenius

882
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,700
old, old, old

883
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,020
doctors forum.

884
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,360
And I do mean old.

885
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,900
By the way, Dr. Drummond

886
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,760
just had his 70th birthday.

887
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,200
Onan had

888
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,320
his birthday on the same day.

889
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,200
Commie Day.

890
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,640
But yet,

891
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,200
Onan is the youngest.

892
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,800
He's a little ways behind us.

893
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,540
He's only 150 something.

894
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,260
G. Gordon Gordon's

895
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,600
80 something.

896
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,040
And he started this out.

897
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,840
Somebody looked at

898
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,840
the very first color

899
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,080
television broadcast

900
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,160
kinescope on YouTube.

901
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,860
Boy, that was a weird

902
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,460
string of words.

903
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,460
And G. Gordon Gordon said,

904
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,860
man, that early color was so creepy.

905
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,700
Onan,

906
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,760
I'm just going to go

907
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,180
through this as if it was a

908
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,680
an essay rather than people talking.

909
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,820
It had just been invented

910
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,580
and people were trying new things.

911
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,260
Same with sound.

912
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,580
For a long time,

913
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,740
the world was utterly silent everywhere.

914
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,060
Then sound was invented

915
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,860
by Edison.

916
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,180
How the secrets of color

917
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,920
got lost from the world of painting

918
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,700
to the first color film

919
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,160
remains a mystery.

920
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,660
Philo says,

921
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,500
well, after black and white

922
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,000
was invented first,

923
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,480
you know,

924
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,160
there was that long stretch.

925
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,740
Maybe the black and white

926
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,440
organized crime syndicate

927
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,620
paid off the painters

928
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,640
to keep silent about color.

929
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,520
And besides,

930
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,880
the monochrome rays

931
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,540
burned the color rods

932
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,620
out of everybody's eyes at first.

933
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,660
And that makes sense

934
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,020
because when you look at woodcuts,

935
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,400
they're just monochrome.

936
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,660
People hadn't grown multiple sets

937
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,120
of rods and cones yet.

938
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,380
Black and white TVs

939
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,060
emitted N rays

940
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,480
to neutralize them.

941
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,820
Only salesmen were spared.

942
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,980
Yes,

943
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,920
only salesmen were spared

944
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,860
because as a race,

945
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,400
salesmen are much more advanced

946
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,640
physiologically than mere ordinary humans.

947
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,940
Other races

948
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,060
can't compare.

949
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,040
Salesmen,

950
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,300
they are a predatory species.

951
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,840
So even if they're relatively more

952
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,480
primitive in specific cases,

953
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:50,680
as a whole,

954
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,700
the native prey species

955
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,820
cannot compete.

956
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,800
No way.

957
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,360
The salesmen know the techniques.

958
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,860
Some salesmen are harvesters.

959
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,520
Some are completists.

960
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,980
We can't say which is better

961
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,160
or worse for the

962
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,020
quote,

963
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,180
market, unquote.

964
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,360
It depends on how tired of life you are.

965
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,820
But, you know,

966
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,640
a specially developed section of the brain

967
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,220
that normal humans don't have

968
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,900
is called the vestigial

969
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,440
or if humans do have it,

970
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,140
it's just in a primordial vestigial state.

971
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,040
Even worse,

972
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,720
for the humans,

973
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,520
that vestigial sales gland

974
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,260
is considered either evil or cancer

975
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,920
and is cut out rather than developed.

976
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,060
A salesman can't become a normal,

977
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,500
but the vestigial hindbrain

978
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,060
of a mere pink human

979
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,080
can sometimes be activated.

980
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,740
The evidence confirms this.

981
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,240
Only by the pink

982
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,300
can the human

983
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,040
be able to

984
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,440
become a normal human.

985
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,400
So,

986
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,160
the best way to

987
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:55,940
explain this is

988
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,300
to say that

989
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,740
if you're a salesman

990
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,760
and you're not a salesman,

991
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,980
you're not a master salesman.

992
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,040
You're not a master salesman.

993
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,700
You're not a master salesman.

994
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:12,300
You're not a master salesman

995
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,580
if you're not a master salesman.

996
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:14,580


997
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,020
So, the salesman

998
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,720
who sells the other salesman

999
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,180
his own measuring methodology

1000
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,080
is the master salesman?

1001
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,540
Well, some are very

1002
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,240
strict in their dispensation

1003
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,860
of departmental slack.

1004
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,300
That's how the whole early bird

1005
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,020
and worm ethos evolved,

1006
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,040
as nature intended.

1007
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,860
There's never been a transaction

1008
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,300
in which a salesman

1009
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,400
was not involved in some stage

1010
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,240
of the process.

1011
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,340
Logic dictates that

1012
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,720
there was a master salesman

1013
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,900
on this planet when Bob

1014
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,820
was just a boy.

1015
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,360
Always selling.

1016
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,420
Selling right out of the chute,

1017
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,500
of course, but with a similar sales base.

1018
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,440
The record of that prior master salesman

1019
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,880
when he finally understood

1020
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,340
how outclassed he was

1021
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,860
must be humbling.

1022
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,820
We hope he took it well.

1023
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,900
Nowadays, there are many

1024
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,840
master salesmen each selling

1025
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,800
their own patented sales techniques

1026
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,500
and advanced super sales technology

1027
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,860
and onto the same market.

1028
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,560
One of the signs that Bob

1029
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,580
puts the urrr in salesman

1030
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,100
is that he can

1031
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,120
sell to himself

1032
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,380
at a profit.

1033
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,300
But then Sterno joined the conversation

1034
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,060
and I cannot read

1035
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,800
any of the rest of it because

1036
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,700
it's just so very,

1037
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,840
very juvenile.

1038
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,480
Oh,

1039
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,080
yes, okay, where are we?

1040
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,500
I've been recording for about

1041
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,180
38 minutes or something.

1042
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,240
The Dobstown Mirror.

1043
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,960
Let's see, I cannot remember

1044
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,420
what I read from

1045
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,000
issue number 106.

1046
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,220
So I'm just gonna

1047
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,600
start from issue number

1048
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,820
107

1049
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,980
and assume I don't

1050
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,780
I didn't read anything from this.

1051
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,560
There's something

1052
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,100
that's a nice,

1053
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,600
it opens up of course with

1054
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,420
this is a printed magazine by the way,

1055
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,360
the Dobstown Mirror.

1056
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,160
You can get it from

1057
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,080
Dr. Onan Kanabite.

1058
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,120
P.O. Box 3.

1059
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,080
That's right, P.O. Box 3.

1060
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,680
Columbus, Indiana.

1061
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,280
Not Columbus, Ohio.

1062
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,680
Columbus, Indiana.

1063
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,320
47202.

1064
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,500
47202.

1065
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:41,900
Dobstown.

1066
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,400
And

1067
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,680
boy, this just covers everything.

1068
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,740
There's a great reading

1069
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,580
list of

1070
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,920
cult management study guides

1071
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,100
which includes

1072
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,580
Papillon,

1073
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,220
Castaneda's Journey,

1074
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,460
Gentlemen of Leisure,

1075
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,540
Assault on Culture,

1076
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,940
The Satanic Bible,

1077
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,360
Wag the Dog,

1078
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,520
The Prince,

1079
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,180
The Prisoner,

1080
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,140
TV Show,

1081
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,440
and a whole bunch of other

1082
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,160
stuff that I don't know about really.

1083
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,760
The Making of the Messiah

1084
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,580
by Robert Schaeffer.

1085
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,660
I know that guy, sort of.

1086
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,440
I had to defend

1087
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,220
Robert Anton Wilson from Robert

1088
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,580
Schaeffer one time.

1089
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,180
Anyway, here we go.

1090
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,680
The Dobstown Mirror.

1091
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,240
Subgenius jokes, koans, riddles,

1092
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,380
spells, and gags.

1093
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,040
Things to see, say,

1094
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,100
do, think, know, and buy.

1095
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,380
You know, I think I better

1096
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,120
continue this later. I think the

1097
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,920
Honey Dipper Man has arrived to

1098
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,020
empty out the septic tank, and I'll have

1099
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,300
even more material for you when he gives

1100
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,460
me what he sucks out of the septic tank.

1101
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,180
Be seeing you.

1102
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,540
Okay, we're back.

1103
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,120
We're back, and the

1104
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,520
septic tank man,

1105
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,660
Honey Dipper Dan,

1106
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,920
has been

1107
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,480
here, took the good stuff,

1108
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,400
and gone. I wonder

1109
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,560
where he empties that tanker

1110
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,120
truck after he

1111
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,500
sucks the stuff out

1112
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,460
of four

1113
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,800
or five home

1114
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,640
septic tanks.

1115
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,700
I just wonder.

1116
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,000
Okay, the

1117
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,180
Dobstown Mirror rant readings.

1118
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,420
This one is an actual little

1119
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,260
rant called

1120
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,640
Sell Us Your Time.

1121
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,220
Unless told otherwise,

1122
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,140
everything is by

1123
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,060
Conan, really.

1124
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,280
And this is

1125
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,280
actually from Dobstown issue

1126
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,500
106. I'm pretty sure I

1127
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,840
haven't read this. And if I have,

1128
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,480
well, pick up on it.

1129
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,640
Sell Us Your Time

1130
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,960
is the title.

1131
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,400
Send one

1132
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,620
dollar. You've been hearing

1133
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,420
the Subgenius Foundation repeat

1134
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,040
this mantra for decades,

1135
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,220
perhaps your entire lifetime.

1136
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,300
Send one

1137
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,380
dollar. But now, hear it

1138
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,620
again for the first time.

1139
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,520
Send one dollar.

1140
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,160
We

1141
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,160
will send you one dollar

1142
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,580
if you will sell us

1143
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,640
one hour of your time.

1144
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,380
I don't mean listening to an

1145
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,200
episode of Hour of Slap. That's a

1146
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,140
minimal expectation of any

1147
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,340
subgenius. I mean, quite

1148
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,300
literally, that we

1149
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,280
want you to sell us your

1150
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,340
time. Sell us one

1151
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,500
hour, and we will send you

1152
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,860
one dollar. It's easy.

1153
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,300
Most people have a back

1154
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,420
catalog of hours they've saved

1155
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,320
up. Think of all the

1156
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,580
time you've not invested

1157
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,240
in your physical and mental

1158
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,440
and emotional well-being. It's

1159
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,380
just laying around,

1160
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,380
gathering no interest.

1161
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,460
Gather up an hour of that time.

1162
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,420
Ship it to the Subgenius

1163
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,080
Foundation and watch your

1164
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,500
income explode.

1165
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,380
Or maybe

1166
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,640
your stockroom of

1167
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,600
clockrooms is all talk

1168
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,320
doom. Time

1169
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,660
is tight. You don't have much

1170
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,660
to spare. We've all been

1171
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,980
there, but look again.

1172
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,200
Look closely.

1173
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,540
See?

1174
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,460
See how much time you're

1175
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,260
putting into your unpaid data

1176
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,260
entry job for social media?

1177
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,660
See how much time you devote

1178
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,420
to resentment of things that happened

1179
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,420
so long ago that you're the only one still

1180
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,560
thinking about them? See how

1181
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,540
much time you spend around those who

1182
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,220
are not members of the Church of the

1183
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,360
Subgenius? See how much time

1184
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,000
you spend on not

1185
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,320
resolving your bad feelings but

1186
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,500
practicing them, perfecting

1187
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,060
them? See.

1188
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,400
See how much

1189
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,060
time you really have

1190
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,780
and what you're doing with it.

1191
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,320
Don't be selfish. Sell

1192
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,480
us your time.

1193
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,080
What will we do with your time?

1194
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,440
You probably already know that your time

1195
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,500
surplus is unclean

1196
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,240
It takes a strong

1197
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,300
stomach and a religious mind

1198
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,380
to flens all this

1199
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,420
time, to boil and bubble

1200
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,560
it up until only the good stuff remains.

1201
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,500
You could have done it

1202
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,520
yourself. Bob showed

1203
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,140
you how in Book of the Subgenius.

1204
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,480
But instead,

1205
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,280
you've been paid by us

1206
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,860
to do it for you.

1207
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,340
Once we've cleaned your time

1208
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,260
from the marbling of both

1209
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,380
rogue WeeRordian and

1210
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,440
ultra emergentile funk,

1211
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,280
we'll put your time to

1212
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,300
good use. Doing

1213
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,440
what? Well, that's our

1214
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,620
business. This offer

1215
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,300
is not the phony,

1216
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,220
vampiric, empty promises

1217
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,140
proffered by rival religions

1218
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,340
to live forever.

1219
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,480
No one lives forever,

1220
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,280
not even us. Not even if

1221
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,560
every one of you takes advantage

1222
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,620
of this fantastic

1223
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,480
time-sharing offer.

1224
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,620
We aren't afraid of dying. We don't

1225
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,460
even hate death. We do

1226
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,460
hate that death happens to

1227
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,360
the wrong people in the wrong

1228
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,440
order, but that's a different

1229
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,320
rant. Do not be

1230
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,360
concerned with what we will do with your

1231
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,360
time. You're not using it. That's

1232
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,340
the main point. Waste makes

1233
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,380
haste. Sell your unused

1234
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,380
and misused hours to

1235
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,140
the Church of the Subgenius.

1236
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,320
Send one

1237
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:36,760
dollar.

1238
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,040
I remember seeing Onan deliver

1239
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:44,840
this live.

1240
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,440
This one's best yelled outside

1241
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,100
of a divival on the street.

1242
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,300
Ladies and gentlemen, step right up.

1243
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,280
Welcome to the Subgenius

1244
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,180
Medical Curiosity Show.

1245
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,220
It's all real, all here,

1246
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,260
all alive, and it's all on the

1247
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,040
inside. See

1248
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,580
the smart boy who can't

1249
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,660
keep a job.

1250
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,160
See the pretty

1251
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,840
girl who can't get a date.

1252
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,140
Alive and on the inside.

1253
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,020
We have diseases

1254
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,360
that are spread through sexual congress.

1255
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,540
We have debates settled by

1256
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,540
fisticuffs. We have people

1257
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,200
famous for being famous,

1258
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,220
and they're all inside.

1259
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,140
Alive, alive,

1260
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,540
alive. See grown men

1261
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,280
and women talk to an invisible

1262
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,560
monster that lives in the sky.

1263
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,380
See your own

1264
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,460
body become ever more fragile

1265
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,980
before your very eyes.

1266
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,360
Feel the horror as

1267
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,480
schools turn innocent children into

1268
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,520
innocent adults.

1269
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,120
Listen to shocking

1270
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,320
tales wherein you pay

1271
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,380
to work. They're

1272
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,060
all here on the inside.

1273
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,240
We have a picture of a

1274
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,960
salesman who smokes a pipe.

1275
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,160
What other religions charge

1276
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,520
all worldly goods for, we offer

1277
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,060
at a discounted and guaranteed

1278
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,340
low rate. Read

1279
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,320
words on a screen. Attend

1280
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,420
amateur religious satire

1281
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,260
performance art. Hear

1282
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,180
amateur podcasts

1283
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,620
radio ranters. Get slack

1284
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,040
and feel alive

1285
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,560
on the inside.

1286
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,940
Yes friends,

1287
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,300
science has room

1288
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,260
for the subgenius.

1289
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,600
And you will be able

1290
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,940
to meet or avoid

1291
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,480
subgenie in your area

1292
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,480
if you subscribe to

1293
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,620
the Dobstown Mirror.

1294
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,420
It's

1295
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,440
very cheap.

1296
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,040
And it's paper.

1297
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,160
In fact this one here is

1298
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,480
sixteen

1299
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,280
pages. Like the

1300
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,500
subgenius pamphlet. And just

1301
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,540
about as dense.

1302
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,520
See the Dobstown Mirror.

Box 807, Glen Rose,

Texas 76043.

1317
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,760
That's

1318
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,300
my house.

1319
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,760
Actually that box, that P.O.

1320
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,340
box, that's my house. We

1321
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:34,940
downsized.

1322
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,380
Thank you Einstein Secret Orchestra

1323
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,440
for that fabulous background music.

1324
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,500
Why is this saying it's only

1325
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,420
been recording...

1326
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,720
Oh, oh, oh.

1327
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,020
I looked down and thought it said 000

1328
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:51,860
17 seconds.

1329
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,520
But I...my eyes

1330
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,240
are dim. And the light is

1331
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,800
funny. And it said 008.

1332
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,220
That's just about

1333
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,980
right. We're

1334
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,340
closing in on some kind of a show here.

1335
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,620
From the Dobstown

1336
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,000
Mirror here it says

1337
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,460
It says that my father

1338
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,640
Captain Hugh

1339
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:17,800
M.

1340
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,920
Pappy Smith

1341
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,020
said this.

1342
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,420
I believe what I need

1343
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,920
to believe. And he did.

1344
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,320
He said it sitting right

1345
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,400
where I am sitting now. Believe

1346
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,200
it or not. And

1347
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:32,980
uh...

1348
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,820
And he was just in conversation.

1349
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,480
He was having some kind of an argument.

1350
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,560
He was like, well, people believe all kinds

1351
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,500
of stupid stuff.

1352
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,740
No, no. I

1353
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,280
believe...I go, well, what do you believe,

1354
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,340
Pappy? Why do you believe that? I believe

1355
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,300
what I need to believe. And I thought,

1356
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,400
he just summed up the whole

1357
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,160
human condition in one sentence.

1358
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,620
I told him so, but he didn't

1359
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,160
you know, it was like coming from me.

1360
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,900
It didn't matter as much.

1361
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:01,640
Yes, uh,

1362
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,500
Tarzan's radio station is located

1363
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,680
in what used to be Pappy's

1364
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,620
control model...module.

1365
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,380
Uh, he

1366
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,340
had a TV

1367
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,340
near here that he could watch.

1368
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,960
Uh, I don't.

1369
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,780
I have this radio

1370
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,480
station, let's call it,

1371
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,180
covering the entire table.

1372
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,340
And where the TV was are two

1373
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,300
plaster casts of real

1374
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,200
dinosaur tracks from down in the creek.

1375
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:29,980
And, uh,

1376
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,820
it's a wonderful

1377
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,720
environment in which to do a show.

1378
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,100
I'm not actually sitting in Pappy's chair.

1379
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,900
That would be creepy.

1380
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,600
Because his ghost is sitting in his chair

1381
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,280
right over there. But it's asleep,

1382
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,260
so don't worry.

1383
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,540
All definitions require

1384
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:49,960
definitions,

1385
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,420
etc. Therefore, defining

1386
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,460
a problem is always going to begin

1387
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,020
at an arbitrary point.

1388
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,520
All sources have sources,

1389
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,200
etc. Therefore,

1390
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,480
identifying the source of a problem is

1391
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,340
going to begin at an

1392
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,300
arbitrary point. Beginning

1393
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,520
at an arbitrary point isn't so bad, because

1394
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,500
the goal is not defining a problem or

1395
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,040
identifying the source of a problem.

1396
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,060
The goal is solving a problem.

1397
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,380
Solving a problem, as it is found,

1398
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,240
trying to not accidentally

1399
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,520
make things worse.

1400
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,620
Slack is where you find it.

1401
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,260
Do you find

1402
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,460
Slack being heavily invested

1403
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,620
in Facebook?

1404
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,600
Or do you find Slack avoiding Facebook

1405
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,020
like the plague?

1406
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,260
Both are correct.

1407
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,440
Why not both? Slack

1408
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,620
is where you make it. Do you find

1409
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,500
Slack in regular strenuous

1410
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,020
physical exertion?

1411
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,380
Or do you find Slack in lounge

1412
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,660
changing about passively?

1413
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,380
Both are correct. Slack is

1414
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,900
where the subgenius is.

1415
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,300
You could be that

1416
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,940
very subgenius.

1417
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,220
A subgenius will always

1418
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,680
proceed forward, elbowing

1419
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,400
the world to turn as

1420
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,280
needed. Oh no, no.

1421
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,440
Let me say that again. A subgenius

1422
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,980
will always proceed forward,

1423
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:08,400
allowing the world to turn as

1424
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:08,760
needed.

1425
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,520
Mmm, maybe a little bit

1426
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:12,840
of both.

1427
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,280
Speaking of

1428
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:16,820
allowing,

1429
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,520
or not allowing,

1430
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,480
I'm tired, or I

1431
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,400
will be tired.

1432
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,580
Not allowing I'm tired or I will be tired

1433
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,400
to be a loud voice in my

1434
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,460
decisions was one of the best choices I've

1435
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,420
made in my adult life. In the

1436
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,280
past, I'm tired was

1437
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,820
why I didn't do many things.

1438
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,420
Now, I do many more

1439
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,460
things, and sometimes while I do

1440
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,480
them, I'm tired. The tiredness

1441
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,780
doesn't exist afterwards.

1442
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,240
But having done the things does

1443
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,520
exist afterwards. Many

1444
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,020
achievements and memories

1445
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,600
gathered because I'm tired

1446
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,420
stopped being good

1447
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,420
enough in itself to stop

1448
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,340
them from being gathered.

1449
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,700
Price Bob and the Dobstown

1450
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,240
Mirror.

1451
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,200
And we'll be back

1452
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,280
next week with

1453
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,120
more Bob Time,

1454
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,600
Bob Money,

1455
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,600
Bob Countries,

1456
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,560
and Bob Gods.

1457
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,520
And all the imaginary

1458
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,320
things that make the world

1459
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,080
go round. The world of humans,

1460
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,100
that is, friends.

1461
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,480
Try selling anything

1462
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,300
to an animal.

1463
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,480
Try

1464
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,820
converting an animal.

1465
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:33,720
Try

1466
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,260
getting an animal to

1467
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,760
salute your flag.

1468
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,060
That's one reason I keep a lot of animal

1469
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:44,880
guns around.

1470
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,260
Because they're just not as full of

1471
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,880
crap as everybody else.

1472
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,440
Praise Bob, and

1473
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,400
thank you for listening.

1474
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,840
This has been Reverend Ivan Stang.

1475
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,540
A good day.

1476
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,900
And we'll see you next week.

1477
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,680
Bye.

1478
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,720
There have actually been

1479
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,120
devivals in China.

1480
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,380
There's an American friend of

1481
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,300
ours that lives in Shanghai.

1482
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,500
His reverend, Shining Path

1483
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,760
of Least Resistance.

1484
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,620
And he has a small

1485
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,380
clench, mostly

1486
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,600
foreigners there.

1487
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,500
Right on.

1488
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,980
I don't think we've ever sold

1489
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,700
a ministership to a

1490
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,580
native China Chinese.

1491
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,620
Any other countries?

1492
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,160
And no Russians.

1493
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,860
Neither that I know of.

1494
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,800
Oddly enough, there's

1495
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,620
Bootleg Bob in China.

1496
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,120
A friend of mine found a shirt with

1497
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,800
little dobs heads and golfers all over it.

1498
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,120
In China.

1499
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,360
Not much you can do about stuff

1500
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:28,960
like that.

1501
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,120
Any other interesting countries?

1502
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,960
Africa, Europe, South America,

1503
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,620
Australia, any weird...

1504
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,040
No, Spanish, not much from Spanish speaking countries.

1505
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,560
Because those are heavily Catholic.

1506
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,200
Hardly anything from Mexico.

1507
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,300
But a ton

1508
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,900
from Australia,

1509
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,420
New Zealand, England, Germany,

1510
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,660
the Netherlands.

1511
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,380
We got to travel

1512
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,160
Amsterdam a bunch of times.

1513
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,560
I could find my way around Amsterdam

1514
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,540
without a map.

1515
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,280
That's heaven.

1516
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,000
For a tourist.

1517
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,080
How about recently?

1518
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,340
I heard they kind of changed their stance on

1519
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,520
a lot of things over the past few years.

1520
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:08,960
Yeah, they're cracking.

1521
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,360
Because the Englishmen

1522
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,300
get too high and drunk and fall in the

1523
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:14,900
mouths.

1524
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,780
And walk out in front...

1525
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,700
And Americans walk out in front of traffic

1526
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,440
because everything's going the

1527
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,040
wrong way.

1528
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,120
Just dumb crap like that.

1529
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:27,900
Actually,

1530
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,280
I hear the place to go is Portugal

1531
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,820
now. Have you been?

1532
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,080
It's incredible, bro. It's the best.

1533
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:34,800
Don't tell anybody.

1534
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,780
I've got a buddy in Portugal.

1535
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,320
We did a lot of shows in Germany

1536
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,360
and England. That was really

1537
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,640
fun. Now, how much of

1538
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,300
the Robert Anton Wilson

1539
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,440
material comes into play

1540
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,380
here? Because I might have been altogether

1541
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,300
confused, but I recently

1542
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,180
came across a copy of the original

1543
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,240
Illuminati card game and started

1544
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,400
getting interested in all that. There's a church

1545
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,400
of the subgenius deck that goes

1546
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,900
along with that card game.

1547
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,460
Those were all developed by Steve Jackson.

1548
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,980
Steve Jackson

1549
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:08,420
got permission to use the Illuminati

1550
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,420
stuff and there was some crossover

1551
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,400
there, so he decided to

1552
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,040
do a subgenius one, too.

1553
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,280
Now, the funny thing is I got to

1554
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,360
hang out with Robert Anton Wilson

1555
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,580
many times because of

1556
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,340
that pagan festival, Starwood.

1557
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:23,680
Originally,

1558
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,460
Starwood was going to be kind of

1559
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:26,700
like

1560
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:29,980
wired

1561
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,620
more of a

1562
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,460
mind in those days with Mondo 2000,

1563
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,600
but it was

1564
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,380
more like fringe science,

1565
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,020
alternate healing,

1566
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,380
regular science,

1567
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,460
and world music.

1568
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,240
There were a lot of witches and

1569
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,320
druids and shit up in

1570
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,640
Northeast Ohio and they

1571
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,040
kind of became a little top heavy

1572
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,420
with that gang.

1573
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,560
I know a lot of witches and I can tell

1574
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,020
you what they say about their titties.

1575
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,540
Brave Digger's ass?

1576
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,340
I can't speak for that, but a witch's

1577
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,440
tit is not cold.

1578
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,340
Yeah, well there's a lot of mounds up there

1579
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,480
in Ohio, so I wouldn't be surprised

1580
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,920
if there's something in the water.

1581
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,540
That's some mounds, boy.

1582
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:14,980
Yeah, yeah.

1583
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:16,500
We had a...

1584
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,780
In fact, there was a turtle mound

1585
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,900
at the last campground

1586
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,640
we used in Ohio.

1587
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:26,080
Fake. It was made by hippies,

1588
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:26,760
not Indians.

1589
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,120
You know, it looked good.

1590
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,680
They called it a turtle mound.

1591
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,820
It was a good place to wait for flying saucers,

1592
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,820
I'll tell you that. They never came, but

1593
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:38,000
boy, I was there at 7 o'clock

1594
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,820
in the morning every July 5th

1595
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:41,340
for 25 years.

1596
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,880
And every time,

1597
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:45,960
everybody stares at me.

1598
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,280
Said that we do the countdown,

1599
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,740
saucers don't show up,

1600
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,040
and everybody looks at me.

1601
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,760
So, you know, I've had to

1602
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,020
get used... The very worst

1603
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:58,880
one in 98,

1604
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,820
there were like 400 people

1605
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:02,300
there.

1606
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,900
And there were some who

1607
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,840
really expected they were going to get their

1608
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,100
own flying saucer.

1609
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,960
That was the one in the movie, right, Ivan?

1610
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,680
Yeah, but I got...

1611
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,960
Somebody suggested,

1612
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,700
after the great disappointment

1613
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,140
in 98,

1614
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,700
I unveiled the fact that

1615
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:22,820
1998

1616
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,880
actually looks like another number

1617
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,240
if you turn it upside down.

1618
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,440
It's 8661.

1619
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,620
And the original memo

1620
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,860
that Bob wrote down, it looked like

1621
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,640
maybe it had been switched

1622
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,840
over, you know?

1623
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,340
But people got really mad.

1624
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,820
They stripped

1625
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,720
me naked and

1626
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,940
poured honey

1627
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,120
and pink

1628
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,280
flowers, or feathers,

1629
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,880
pink feathers all over me and threw me

1630
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,500
in a pond. And I

1631
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,480
stood there,

1632
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,700
stark naked, shaking my fist at

1633
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,260
like 300 laughing

1634
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:01,300
people. This is all on

1635
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,720
video. And so what

1636
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,560
to most people is their worst

1637
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,720
nightmare? Standing

1638
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,720
naked in front of a laughing crowd?

1639
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,800
It's just, for me,

1640
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,880
it's just a memory of a wild party.

1641
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,600
I love that.

1642
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,780
I'll never let them do that again, though. Of course, we never had that many

1643
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,560
people. It was

1644
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,100
disappointing to find...

1645
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,600
The next day after

1646
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,380
that, only half as many people

1647
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,660
dwindled each time, which indicated

1648
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,600
to me that more people were taking this

1649
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,560
seriously than we knew.

1650
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,880
And that's a little...

1651
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,280
That's a little creepy,

1652
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,780
actually. I mean, you've literally started

1653
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,580
a cult about a

1654
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,760
joking cult, and then some people

1655
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,360
have literally joined in

1656
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,580
thinking it's serious. This is the most incredible

1657
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,920
thing maybe ever... Has it ever gotten away

1658
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,420
from you? It appeals...

1659
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,860
It sort of...

1660
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,720
There's people out there who are

1661
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,660
just plain schizophrenic.

1662
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,360
And our

1663
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,320
writing style, especially

1664
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,120
in the book and the first pamphlets,

1665
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,420
mimics that

1666
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,460
schizophrenic way of talking.

1667
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,960
And it addresses the kind of things

1668
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,840
they believe. Everybody's out to get

1669
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,980
you. You're... You've got

1670
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,900
magic powers just because you're weird

1671
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,840
and different. You know, it's just telling people

1672
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,880
what they want to hear. But the

1673
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,400
schizophrenics believe it.

1674
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,000
I believe it. There's a guy... Thank you,

1675
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,880
My Family Thinks I'm

1676
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,640
Crazy. That's the name of the podcast

1677
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,720
that interviewed me for

1678
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,680
a while, a couple of months

1679
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,840
ago. My Family Thinks I'm

1680
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,660
Crazy. We

1681
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:36,860
know how that feels.

1682
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,900
Actually, my family was crazy,

1683
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,240
so it's cool.

1684
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,480
Price Bob.
