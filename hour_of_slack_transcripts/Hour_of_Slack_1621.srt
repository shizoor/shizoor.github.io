00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
When I started to learn how to walk, you said, don't keep trying, give up.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,760
When I got frustrated because I couldn't tie my shoes, you said, don't keep trying, give up.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,300
When I didn't make the baseball team, you said, don't keep trying, give up.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,800
And now, I say to you, keep trying, marijuana.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,640
You can get free drugs to learn how.

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,740
Call 788-A-MESSAGE from ONDCP and the Partnership for a Free Drug America.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,060
This is the Institute for Motivational Research.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,580
A place devoted to the intriguing business of finding out why people ticked her.

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,920
Why should we fear anything?

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,240
That's right, there are four stages in a butterfly's life.

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,600
Egg, the caterpillar, the chrysalis.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,480

00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:58,820

00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,360

44
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:07,880
Bob.

45
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,400
Bob.

46
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:08,620
Bob.

47
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,180
Bob.

48
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,540
Bob.

49
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:35,740
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob

50
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,980
The Hour of Slack

51
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,080
The Hour of Slack

52
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,000
Well my friend, listen.

53
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,220
The Spirit of God make you all a straight line.

54
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,240
That line, straight line.

55
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,640
Straight line, line.

56
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,820
Straight line, line.

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,280
Straight line, line.

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,780
Line, line.

59
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,580
Blood, life, spiritual, man, spirit.

60
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,520
Guaranteed.

61
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,720
The Hour of Slack

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,420
is a very important statement.

63
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,280
I want you to hear it.

64
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,380
The internet made me so goofy and lethargic

65
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,060
where I couldn't think, I couldn't study,

66
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,180
I couldn't control anything.

67
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,340
I was just like, marriage.

68
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,840
Bad news.

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,360
If you were in here this morning

70
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,840
and you're dealing with the internet

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,000
and you're hiding it

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,780
and you think you're doing a good job of hiding it,

73
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,760
you're not hiding it from the Lord.

74
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,160
And it's corrupting you.

75
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,400
Well no, I've got it under control.

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Because Jesus said, this is how you deal with it.

77
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,820
Fornication and pornography.

78
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:51,900
Yes.

79
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,060
Uncleanness.

80
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,700
And licentiousness.

81
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,280
Licentiousness.

82
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,040
Yes.

83
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,400
Gushing.

84
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,800
And there's sexual pus and junk all coming out of it.

85
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,940
That's his desire.

86
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,300
To be sexually oozing 24 hours a day,

87
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,700
7 days a week.

88
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,560
Licentiousness.

89
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,480
Just unbridled, uncontrolled sexual excesses.

90
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,720
That was something he invented.

91
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,780
Next is worshipping oozing sexual excesses.

92
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,580
Can you worship your brand new shiny sexual pus?

93
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,140
You bet.

94
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Can you worship fornication?

95
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,400
Yes.

96
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,440
And in our society, how easy it is to worship pornography?

97
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,420
So much.

98
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,680
What do you think?

99
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,600
Will psychiatry help?

100
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,680
Yes, it's an emergency.

101
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,180
It's an emergency.

102
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,580
This is a huge thing.

103
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,900
Download some rock bitch videos, folks.

104
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,640
Go to whatever file sharing you're doing before they make it illegal.

105
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,440
You can't.

106
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,700
You can't.

107
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:54,700


108
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:54,700


109
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,400
You can't.

110
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,520
You can't.

111
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,560
You can't.

112
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:57,560


113
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:57,560


114
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:57,560


115
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:57,560


116
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:57,560


117
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:57,560


118
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,760
Nobody's touched usenet.

119
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,180
That's where the real file sharing goes.

120
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,900
I've tried doing that.

121
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,120
Yeah, but you didn't know how to do it because you're too old and stodgy.

122
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,340
No, I know how to do it.

123
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,020
Or too young and cool or something.

124
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,960
But there's no descriptions.

125
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,700
You can get good descriptions of things.

126
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,360
You're too middle-aged to...

127
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,380
Yeah, but you could use a dictionary to get good descriptions of things.

128
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,340
I mean, a description can be found.

129
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,600
You can make up your own descriptions.

130
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,620
No, you can just mouse over and windows pop up.

131
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,380
They tell you exactly what you're about to download.

132
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:24,920
and everything.

133
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,340
It's very handy, I think.

134
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,460
But just think how you've

135
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,900
archaicized our language

136
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,920
with what you just said.

137
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,220
I am seduced by the UI of it all.

138
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,280
See, once again,

139
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,580
your parlance is like

140
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,080
21st century, Daddy-O.

141
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,960
I can't hip to that.

142
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,980
Did you hear what he just said?

143
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,880
What he's saying is that

144
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,520
the artists shouldn't get

145
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,340
any recompense for their work,

146
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,700
but that we should all get

147
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,500
everything for free while we can,

148
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,820
which is certainly what I'm doing.

149
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,920
I have downloaded everything

150
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,840
I could possibly even see

151
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,380
to download,

152
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,560
whether I wanted it,

153
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,700
whether I cared about it,

154
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,260
just because I could,

155
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,940
just to keep my computer busy

156
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,260
and to feel like I was getting

157
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,860
my money's worth for that DSLR.

158
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,580
A Nestle Crunch bar.

159
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,820
I don't care if it's child pornography.

160
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,900
Well, actually, I wouldn't.

161
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,960
I would not knowingly download

162
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,880
child pornography,

163
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,680
because if you have ever

164
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,200
had it on your machine,

165
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,840
he will come and puff and puff

166
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,000
and blow your door down.

167
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,640
How about that new home and security bill?

168
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,700
How about let's take a little trip

169
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,780
over to the door here

170
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,360
where it says,

171
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,080
are botched, marked fry,

172
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,000
or something like that,

173
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,700
are backed, marked, mocked free.

174
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,980
It's funny, the subgeniuses were asking,

175
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,160
how do I permanently erase stuff

176
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,180
from my hard drive?

177
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,240
I mean, I know that just

178
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,380
throwing it in the trash

179
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,220
and hitting delete

180
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,940
doesn't really do it.

181
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And in fact,

182
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,100
you have to overwrite that thing

183
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,380
two or three times

184
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,380
if you want to hide something.

185
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,920
Now, I'm just the opposite.

186
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,180
It's like, I wish

187
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,960
somebody would pay attention

188
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,940
to the cool stuff

189
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,680
on my hard drive.

190
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,320
And that is the problem.

191
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,740
No one is interested.

192
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,420
And that is the sour slope

193
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,320
we've slipped down

194
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,220
from the orchard heights.

195
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,280
The only way you can get

196
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,500
that child porn off your computer

197
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,300
is blow up your,

198
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,700
you know, you take the hard drive out

199
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,460
and have it installed

200
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,700
as one of the heat shield tiles

201
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,760
on the shuttle.

202
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,180
On the shuttle.

203
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,880
Next to the sock drive.

204
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,820
And when it comes back in through,

205
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,260
it finally gets erased.

206
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,740
Yeah.

207
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,840
And they come back through the atmosphere.

208
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,640
You'll be okay then.

209
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,820
But that's only during

210
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,760
the touch-up cycle.

211
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,460
That's what P,

212
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,680
we should have done.

213
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah.

214
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,540
Twice.

215
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,020
That's what he should have done twice.

216
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,600
And what did he do the first time?

217
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,060
Nobody knows that.

218
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,040
The whole space shuttle,

219
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,140
all those tiles

220
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,240
are really hard drives

221
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,480
of people trying to get rid

222
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,200
of their porn.

223
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,940
That is probably true.

224
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,740
Because now Big Brother

225
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,120
can stick his snoot

226
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,260
right up your snoot.

227
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,800
They're going to make

228
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,540
a big old bonfire out of it.

229
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,380
A huge Arbite mixed fry bonfire

230
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,100
where there'll be a lot

231
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,300
of galopping and goose dumping.

232
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,060
That means work

233
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,480
shall make us free, right?

234
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,860
Doesn't it?

235
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,320
And isn't that true, though?

236
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,040
Doesn't work really

237
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,680
make you free?

238
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,340
Especially if you're

239
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,540
slaving away for some

240
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,680
jack-booted swine.

241
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,900
Yeah, like Bob Dobbs.

242
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,120
That's who I've been

243
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,680
slaving away for all week.

244
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,020
I kind of dig it, actually.

245
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,440
It's not a bad job.

246
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,760
Doesn't pay anything at all.

247
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,900
You have to pay them,

248
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,340
but it's kind of cool.

249
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,260
Sure, man.

250
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,400
Oh.

251
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,420
Because I don't know

252
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,880
what I'm doing.

253
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,020
I'm in a big mess.

254
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,500
Pick it up.

255
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,520
Pick it up.

256
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:21,980
I don't know

257
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,340
where to go.

258
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

259
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,940
I will kill you.

260
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,740
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

261
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,380
to this edition

262
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,500
of the 700 Club.

263
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,680
I'm ready to pull the trigger.

264
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,480
So that's what we're looking at.

265
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,000
A lot of blood being spilled

266
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,220
all over the place.

267
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,580
Oh, and I think

268
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,800
that this is going to be nasty.

269
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,240
With us today is a man

270
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,680
who is just a sleaze.

271
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,040
And they said one of the reasons they wouldn't kill him was because he had the checkbook.

272
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,420
But before we get into that, let's see what's in the news today.

273
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,700
Here's a French elf.

274
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,640
Thank you, Pat.

275
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,460
Most Americans say they're looking to invade Iraq within a month.

276
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:13,140
But the French elf had to come over and over and over again, up close and personal.

277
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,880
And that would be pleasant.

278
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,180
Photos of Iraqi officials moving in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out.

279
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,900
We have come to have plenty of partners.

280
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,600
It's the way it is.

281
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,060
Which offers these words of praise.

282
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,980
This is a disgrace.

283
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,200
In and out.

284
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,340
We have come.

285
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,500
And then I will kill myself.

286
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,060
Oh, yes, baby.

287
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,160
A little bit of ESO swag.

288
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,020
Womp radio from WCSB Cleveland.

289
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:59,500
And before and after that, the great Fernanda Nende-Liemer.

290
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,560
Who did the Bob song there and the cut-ups.

291
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,880
All those cut-ups.

292
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,400
Well, except for the El Queso title song.

293
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,980
We love the El Quesos, friends.

294
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,940
And welcome to Hour of Slack 879.

295
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:18,960
Of a...

296
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,800
A sexy theme.

297
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,600
Generally this time, friends.

298
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,380
Very generally.

299
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,400
And coming up, lots of sexy-ly-mer.

300
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,840
Chop, chop, chop.

301
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,620
Sexy, fat, hairy white.

302
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,580
Some cuts from the good Reverend Cheatham in Australia.

303
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,080
And bug porn.

304
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,900
Yes, bug porn and some wild rice butt will also be on the schedule.

305
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,980
Oh.

306
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,100
Nevertheless, there are no weapons of mass white rice butt.

307
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,080
That information will make its way to President Ashley.

308
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,100
Okay, Chris.

309
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,440
Okay.

310
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,780
You would say buttocks.

311
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,780
I think that's buttocks.

312
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
Um, buttocks.

313
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,280
Buttocks.

314
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,120
Butt.

315
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,160
Butt.

316
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,960
And, oh, by the way, it's God that gives you money.

317
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,200
Or that new automobile that you need.

318
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,180
If you call...

319
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,820
In the next 15 minutes.

320
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,200
I only have the golden medallion.

321
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,020
It will remind you of the scripture.

322
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,600
Thou shall remember.

323
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,420
It's God that gives you wealth.

324
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,760
Or he gives you money to get wealth.

325
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,000
And now make that call.

326
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,300
Hallelujah.

327
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:47,640
Prayer.

328
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:58,440

I'm working out for my lady.

346
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,260
Oh, yeah.

347
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,440
I'm working out.

348
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,300
I'm working out for Lou.

349
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,700
Hey, talking about working out, you know, I like to keep my body in shape.

350
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,760
You know, the shape of a barrage balloon.

351
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,020
That's how all my very sexy lady friends like it.

352
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,920
You know, big and firm with plenty to grab hold of.

353
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,560
Anyway, to get myself an even better knee, you know, I got in with one of the experienced weight trainers down at the gym.

354
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,540
You know, private tuition.

355
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,980
Greg, his name is, big muscle-bound bloke with blonde hair.

356
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,420
When I first saw him in the changing room, I was going to be like,

357
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:17,940
gobsmacked.

358
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,480
I don't think I'd ever seen such a big member in there before.

359
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,940
And you're talking about a membership of 600.

360
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,880
You know, he's massive.

361
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,160
His very sexy lady friend, Debbie, used to train there, too.

362
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,700
Now, she happens to be a very keen weightlifter.

363
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,920
Likes nothing more than to show off her weightlifting techniques with the barbells.

364
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,860
I tell you what, I've never seen a woman jerk one like it in all my life.

365
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,740
Mind you, her snatch was very disappointing.

366
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,420
Personally speaking, I thought it looked a bit messy.

367
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,520
Now, fortunately for her, Greg was always at hand to sort her out.

368
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:55,480
It usually stand in front of her and make sure she got a firm grip of it when she went down, you know.

369
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,920
Great to watch, it was.

370
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,520
Particularly when she'd puff her cheeks out and, you know, push it up as far as it would go.

371
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,740
Well, Greg was a great trainer.

372
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,480
Really keen to get stuck in, you know, get on the job.

373
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,520
He was a very hard man, you know, but he was behind me all the way, getting stuck in.

374
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,140
And that's what I liked.

375
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,340
Because, you see, I've always been keen on that.

376
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,340
I had a job at a sports centre once, did I tell you?

377
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,640
That's where I met Geraldine, right?

378
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,000
We were both working there.

379
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,140
She was a very sexy young lady friend of mine.

380
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,060
Both working at the sports centre.

381
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:32,540
And I was moving some of the Fiverside football equipment when I accidentally emptied my ball bag in the corridor just outside her office.

382
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,600
Well, she heard the commotion and caved straight away.

383
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,080
You know, to give me a hand.

384
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,400
Now, after that, I didn't see her for ages.

385
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,760
Because I spent quite a time working at the Firkin Fudge Company, where I got on really well with my fellow fudge packers.

386
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,040
Hey, the laughs we had.

387
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,260
Filling each other's boxes.

388
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,980
You know, with rubbish and all that.

389
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,000
So often, the box had to be cleaned out before you could start all over again, you know.

390
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,000
Great days.

391
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,400
Anyway, from there, I went to Jessop's, the grocer's.

392
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,720
And that's where I bumped into Geraldine again.

393
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:09,040
I was just packing the fridge full of margarine when she walked up to me, tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me if I'd give her the stork that I had in my hand.

394
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,600
Well, she said she usually had Flora, but thought she'd try a different brand for a change.

395
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,840
So, stork margarine it was.

396
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,020
Well, I think I got it.

397
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,480
After that chance encounter, we started courting.

398
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,360
And nine months later, we decided to get engaged.

399
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,440
Hey, I tell you what, I just couldn't wait to get down to the jeweler's.

400
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,300
You know, to get something special for her.

401
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,500
To slip onto the third finger of her left hand.

402
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:37,520
I tell you what, when I went home and give it to her that night in bed, she was absolutely ecstatic.

403
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,140
The thing was, she said she'd never expected me to present her with such a sparkling ring.

404
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,860
Then, after pushing her finger towards it, she wriggled it in.

405
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,460
Slowly, until it would go no further.

406
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,440
I'll never forget the look on her face when she smiled at me and said, it fitted like

407
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,000
a glove.

408
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,000
Well, unfortunately, the relationship didn't work out, you know, but that's life.

409
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,140
And, you know, you win some, you lose some.

410
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,540
The way I look at it, there's always another very sexy lady friend around the corner if

411
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,740
you keep yourself in shape.

412
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,300
And that's why I'm working out.

413
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,600
Yes, working out.

414
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,480
Working out.

415
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,740
I'm working out for my lady.

416
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,020
I'm working out.

417
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,840
I'm always working out.

418
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,480
A fat, hairy white, dear friends.

419
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,680
The great, fat, hairy white.

420
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,580
And now, Le-Le-Le-Le-Le-Mur.

421
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,020
But why do squirrels need to survive in the wild?

422
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,700
They need to starve.

423
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,460
In the wild, they're nuts, and that requires brains.

424
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,620
So where's the best adorable rabbit?

425
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,340
The most poisonous rodents.

426
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,620
How about Squirrel City?

427
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,680
Sneaky.

428
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,640
Squirrels also show their cities all over our world.

429
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,880
She learned to run this assault course by trial and error.

430
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,680
She's only 13.

431
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,540
But it took her a few days.

432
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,440
This certainly did fail the thinking test.

433
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,200
As we'll see, the squirrels is a free lunch.

434
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,880
So the arms man began, as ever more, to try to stop them from stealing birds.

435
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,480
Some people, they .

436
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
You're here at home, and your parents are here to help you.

437
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:16,600


438
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:16,600


439
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:16,600


440
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:16,600


441
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:16,600


442
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:16,600


443
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:16,600


444
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:16,600


445
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:16,600


446
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,300
Your parents smoked weed.

447
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,700
Lose your weed, you can catch your weed.

448
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,480
Goodbye.

449
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,340
Sponsored by the Office for a Free America.

450
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,020
Trust the drug.

451
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,360
Uh, yeah.

452
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,080
Oh.

453
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,960
Well.

454
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,540
Uh.

455
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,300
Oh.

456
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,660
Yeah.

457
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,380
Oh.

458
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,040
Yeah.

459
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:34,600
Well.

460
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:35,920
Yeah.

461
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,600
Uh.

462
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:37,600


463
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,280
Uh.

464
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,020
Uh.

465
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,980
Yeah.

466
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,600
Uh.

467
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,480
Uh.

468
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,080
Oh.

469
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,340
Well.

470
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,300
Uh.

471
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:44,300


472
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:45,360
Well.

473
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:45,960


474
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:45,960


475
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,000
Uh.

476
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:50,380
Yeah.

477
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,060
Yeah.

478
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:52,460
Uh.

479
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,860
Uh.

480
00:16:59,460 --> 00:16:59,880
Uh.

481
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,800
Uh.

482
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:01,360


483
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,620
Uh.

484
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:06,660


485
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:06,900


486
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:06,940


487
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,020


488
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,040
Uh.

489
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,040


490
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,320
Uh.

491
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:07,860
Uh.

492
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:07,920
Uh.

493
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,520
Uh.

494
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:08,700


495
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:08,700


496
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:08,820
Uh.

497
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,880
Uh.

498
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,960
Oh.

499
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,160
Oh.

500
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
I understand.

501
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,220
I understand.

502
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,260
I understand.

503
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,040
My breasts expand.

504
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,280
And I've had that syndrome for like 25 years now.

505
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:24,620
Wow.

506
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,340
Expanding breasts.

507
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:32,300
I'll be perhaps in the laboratory working on my works or my later opera, as they call them.

508
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,120
Or I'll be bowling.

509
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Or just like trying on a pretty skirt with a poodle on it.

510
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,880
And the next thing you know, my breasts will start expanding as big as the sun.

511
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,360
Is that what that huge shadow was that covered it?

512
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:45,720
Yeah.

513
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,300
I can do more than cast a shadow.

514
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,120
It wouldn't take quarters.

515
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,040
I can hire one if they know what to say.

516
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,840
I wanted, that's all I wanted was chocolate.

517
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,280
Casting is easy.

518
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,280
I just wanted some hot chocolate.

519
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,500
You just look at their faces.

520
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,340
You look at their feet.

521
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,720
You see if they're right for the part.

522
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,280
I've been very naughty.

523
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,960
I've been very naughty.

524
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,520
I've been very naughty.

525
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,220
I've been very naughty.

526
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,860
I've been very naughty.

527
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,340
You know our love was special.

528
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,160
Yeah.

529
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,840
We were like a million stars.

530
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,500
I said I'd buy you a sailboat, baby.

531
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,600
Then we could see the world together.

532
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,380
Just you and me.

533
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,640
We had a love we said would never die.

534
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,380
But now it's time to say goodbye.

535
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,680
We had a love that grew its wings to fly.

536
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,600
Now you have to dry your crying eyes.

537
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,340
Dye your crying eyes.

538
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,580
How many eyes are gonna cry tonight when I say goodbye to my potato?

539
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,040
Whoa.

540
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:27,860
Whoa.

541
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:29,660
Whoa.

542
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:30,560


543
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,600
Whoa.

544
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,360
Whoa.

545
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,100
Whoa.

546
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,760
Beggin' to live, you better beggin' to take

547
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,880
Beggin' to live, I said beggin' to lose you, yeah

548
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,320
Tell me what you want, tell me what you like

549
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,600
Tell me what you need

550
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,220
How many eyes are gonna cry tonight

551
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,700
When I say goodbye to my potato?

552
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,820
More than one brown eye is gonna cry tonight

553
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,380
When I say goodbye to my potato, yeah

554
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,760
I treat you like a queen, you meant more than the world

555
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,500
Take you to the finest shops, dress you like a girl

556
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,060
And peel your panties off, yeah, we can do it like that

557
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,140
Baby, feels right all night, so tight, dynamite

558
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,160
But then I had to push you out and things wasn't the same

559
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,620
Your love was wild, now it's tame, baby

560
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,680
I don't want to see you cry

561
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,860
So I have to let my colon say goodbye

562
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,500
I love you, I love you

563
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,080
Oh, oh

564
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,020
Oh, oh

565
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,140
Oh, oh

566
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,380
Oh, oh

567
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,180
P. Diddy loves his potato dearly

568
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,060
That's anal worship, most sincerely, baby

569
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,920
Come on, yeah, you know it feels so right

570
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,340
But I love you, but what's your name now?

571
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,400
Now my colon don't feel so right

572
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,480
And the seagull stole my toupee

573
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,100
The day I decided I would have to say goodbye

574
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,080
And I lied when I cried, it was not for you

575
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,940
But out of fear that I had disrespected my rectum

576
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,340
And that's not hip-hop

577
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,540
How many eyes are gonna cry tonight

578
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,840
When I say goodbye to my potato?

579
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,680
Oh, oh

580
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,180
More than one brown eye is gonna cry tonight

581
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,540
When I say goodbye to my potato

582
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,120
Oh, oh

583
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,840
How many eyes are gonna cry tonight

584
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,520
When I say goodbye to my potato?

585
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,280
How many eyes are gonna cry tonight

586
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,060
When I say goodbye to my potato?

587
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,680
How many eyes are gonna cry tonight

588
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,720
When I say goodbye to my potato?

589
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,740
Oh, yeah

590
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,900
And you know that I like it like that

591
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,420
P.

592
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:01,800
How many eyes by the El Queso All Stars, dear friends,

593
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,460
the greatest of all the new school subgenius bands,

594
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,380
and you can download more El Queso All Stars

595
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,600
under their other name of Interbulator

596
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,840
at station.mp3.com

597
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,400
slash interbulator, that's spelled E-T-U-R-B-U-L-A-T-O-R,

598
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,260
E-N-T-U-R-B-U-L-A-T-O-R.

599
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,880
And now our how-to department.

600
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,460
Really the only way to get rid of child pornography

601
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,560
is to fill your computer up with adult pornography

602
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,620
all the way till it's completely maxed out.

603
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,240
It won't take anything out.

604
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,280
Erase all that, then fill it up again with adult pornography

605
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,900
and you're clean, you're fine.

606
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,320
Animal sex.

607
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,160
You know, you're like Hooters.

608
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,020
Bug porn.

609
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,840
Or light-block TV.

610
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,740
Bug porn. I have mine loaded with bug porn.

611
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,520
Wouldn't that creep out like a cop if he came into your house

612
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,900
and seized your computer and found out you just had millions and millions of pictures of bug porn

613
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,900
and they were all the same one?

614
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,600
That freaked him out the last time.

615
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Bug porn, one dollar.

616
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,760
And ten.

617
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,480
Bug porn, one dollar.

618
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,440
Bug porn.

619
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,260
Bug porn.

620
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,020
Bug porn.

621
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,680
Bug porn.

622
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:27,120
How hard it is to escape the constant clamoring of insect pornography commercials.

623
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,860
Yet, to those who see through different eyes,

624
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,600
the world is not what it appears to those less attentive.

625
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,280
To some few discerning ones,

626
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:42,740
even God's tiniest creatures can be seen to indulge ceaselessly

627
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,940
in mindless microcosmic reiterations of man's eternal battles

628
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,220
and his passions.

629
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,940
Between viruses, bacteria, and our own immune systems,

630
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,640
as above is so below.

631
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,900
And some see below the belt of the allowable,

632
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,380
deep beneath the underclothing of the forbidden.

633
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:13,300
Some see into the microconspiracy behind the macroconspiracy.

634
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,860
And some like what they see.

635
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,220
But, just as in our so-called human world,

636
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,760
the winner takes all.

637
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,760
For only the winner's genes are passed on to future generations.

638
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:29,320
Yes, the conspiracy rules in the unknown world, too.

639
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,000
Now, maintained in artificial wombs,

640
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,160
aided by technology only guessed at by Earth science,

641
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,980
what might have remained the errant seed of harmless bug porn enthusiasm

642
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,220
grows instead into the all-too-familiar larval stage,

643
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,820
then to a pupa,

644
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,700
and finally,

645
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,000
into a perfect clone seed.

646
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,380
The final simulacrum of your child,

647
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,680
your neighbor,

648
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,900
your boss,

649
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,780
your spouse,

650
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,940
all those people shopping at the mall.

651
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,040
From the tiniest, most seemingly harmless conspiracy,

652
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,420
to bigger conspiracies,

653
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,680
to the final conspiracy.

654
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,920
Dobbs Co.

655
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,600
Bringing slack to the slackless,

656
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,740
and life to the lifeless.

657
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,760
In the Bible says, your body is the temple.

658
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,980
He lives, the Holy Spirit lives in your body.

659
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,440
God can get the glory out of your body

660
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,420
when your body is the temple.

661
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,160
Well, isn't that special?

662
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, God.

663
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,000


664
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Oh, yes!

665
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,560
Well, isn't that special?

666
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,860
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

667
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,840
It has been three days since my last confession.

668
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,000
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

669
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,260
I have sinned against you.

670
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,240
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

671
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,180
So have I.

672
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,840
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

673
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,640
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

674
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,880
And I am well pleased.

675
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,080
If God didn't want us to play with these lads,

676
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,300
why did he make them so much fun?

677
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,140
The female body is the most beautiful thing in the world.

678
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,640
I've been having bad thoughts.

679
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,900
Really bad thoughts.

680
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,260
Most people confuse evil with their own trivial lusts and perversions.

681
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,760
Two-legged.

682
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,200
Two-legged devils.

683
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,840
You on your way to hell?

684
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,560
Two-legged devils.

685
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,340
You on your way to hell?

686
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,140
Two-legged devils.

687
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,420
Sinners can get themselves an awful mess.

688
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,720
Every Christian is sinless.

689
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,320
Are you sin-for-giving?

690
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,280
Could it be Satan?

691
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,820
The only normal and natural and spiritual thing to do

692
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,420
is what we ought to be doing all the time.

693
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,600
Holy God!

694
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,760
The only thing we barely know,

695
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:22,760


696
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,080
Holy God!

697
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,520
We ought to be a one person life.

698
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:44,160
What's on-the- nach- scène mind- SQL

699
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,140
Each and every human being is welcome,

700
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,820
and they are here at peace,

701
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:49,820


702
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:49,820


703
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:49,820


704
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:49,820


705
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:49,820


706
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:49,820


707
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:49,820


708
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,580
Two-legged devils, you're on your way to hell

709
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,980
Two-legged devils, you're on your way to hell

710
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,560
He lives, the Holy Spirit lives in your body

711
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,720
He lives, the Holy Spirit lives in your body

712
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,900
And the Bible says your body is the temple

713
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,820
Are you a sin forgiven?

714
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,040
Every Christian is sinless

715
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,080
Every Christian is sinless

716
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,260
Every Christian is sinless

717
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:52,200
The only normal and natural and spiritual thing to do

718
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,880
Is to be a Christian

719
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,100
Is to be a Christian

720
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,800
The Holy Spirit, the what?

721
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,400
I'm gonna put it in one hole

722
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,560
And then in the other, really fast

723
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,280
Who Sins of the Flock

724
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,560
By Reverend Ed Fred

725
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:12,300
And now some ESO Swamp Radio

726
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,360
From WCSB Cleveland

727
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,040
He loved her butt

728
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,280
He hated her cooking

729
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,240
He loved her butt

730
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,240


731
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,260
He hated her cooking

732
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:47,240
Do you feel different?

733
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:55,600
We have placed some leaves and pieces of newspaper under your seat, Mr. Gus Grissom.

734
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,680
Ready to blow off?

735
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,800
We will begin counting you now.

736
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,800
One.

737
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,920
Backwards from ten.

738
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,540
Ten.

739
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,220
Nine.

740
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,500
No, I'm afraid we're about to ignite you.

741
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,460
You can't get out.

742
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,220
No, no chance.

743
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,040
It's New Year's Eve and you're going bye-bye.

744
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,500
Where did they go?

745
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:28,060
Did they go to the moon or did the moon come to us?

746
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,400
If you see something move, kill it.

747
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,680
Any luck?

748
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,620
Come on.

749
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,300
Come on.

750
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,660
Nobody ever lucked on you.

751
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:54,380
They ran around in circles, ate dog treats and exchanged phone numbers.

752
00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:01,020
But no one ever walked on this moon or any moon you know about.

753
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,000
You see, as artists, we just need to express ourselves.

754
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,900
Goliath, you're so funny.

755
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,220
Whoa, Davey.

756
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,380
Hello there.

757
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,980
I'm George Putnam.

758
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,740
I'd like to begin with a fact.

759
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,040
It is this.

760
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,340
Obscene literature is a two billion dollar a year business.

761
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:32,600
That's two billion dollars for eight hundred distributors.

762
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,920
It is big business.

763
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,660
This traffic continues to increase and flourish.

764
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,260
It is profitable business.

765
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,240
Through this material, today's youth can be stimulated to enter the world of homosexuals.

766
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,120
Lesbians, sadists, masochists.

767
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,420
Big business.

768
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,360
It sparks.

769
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,480
It's thrilling.

770
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,780
It provides kicks.

771
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,760
It encourages children to use the library.

772
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,920
It's an illustrated, detailed course in perversion.

773
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,460
It can be obtained by writing to Perversion for Profits.

774
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,480
Box 12.

775
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,580
Cincinnati, Ohio.

776
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,040
You can hear the ladies' stockings, panties, bras, that stuff.

777
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,220
And we're going to talk about it in a minute.

778
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,220


779
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,220


780
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,220


781
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,220


782
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,220


783
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,220


784
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,220


785
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,220


786
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,700
On the way.

787
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:17,900
Okay.

788
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,460
We start on pictures?

789
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,480
All yours.

790
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,440
This male is angry, distraught, and terrified.

791
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,780
It is a terrible tragedy.

792
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,540
While attempting to mate with a female, he's inadvertently pushed her into a drainage ditch.

793
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,260
But that's okay.

794
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,840
I think I can deal with it.

795
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,300
Now it's up to these rescue workers to mate with a female.

796
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,100
With a remarkable combination of finesse and brute force,

797
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,020
these workers use a crane to force the female.

798
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,900
She shows she's all right by fighting off the crane mechanism.

799
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,180
Nope.

800
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,200
That's wonderful.

801
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:59,660
This lecture was presented on June 1, 1962.

802
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,340
You shall be put to death.

803
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,380
You want to try it, Poki?

804
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,040
We're sorry.

805
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,760
You see, it's a good idea.

806
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,640
I love you, Czech, for being fine.

807
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,500
It's cool.

808
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:40,700
It was a sp Yesterday, she was...

809
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,000
Everybody, be my space-mate.

810
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,000


811
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,000


812
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,460
Our A vest has a Xinxed ancora.

813
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,040
It's not.

814
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,340
No.

815
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,360
No employees.

816
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:59,620
No inventory.

817
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:05,740
And no selling.

818
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:11,300
And I always will.

819
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,980
No thanks.

820
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,240
I prefer grass.

821
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,420
At San Quentin.

822
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:27,840
Ha ha ha.

832
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:34,300
King Yeti vs. The Mere Humes is the name of that musical composition by Heart Ignition.

833
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:40,840
Yes, the same Heart Ignition who does that incredible artwork on Alt.Binary Slack.

834
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,860
And now, Michael Pepe.

835
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,020
Did you know that the Boston Strip is a place where you can find the best music for your music?

836
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,020


837
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,040


838
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,360
I was a big Strip Strangler.

839
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,800
I used to chase Michael Pepe around the park when he was a kid.

840
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,060


841
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,000
I was the prize.

842
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,880
You know, he had strangled everyone but me.

843
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,140
And I was the Strip Strip.

844
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,800
Really?

845
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,700
What happened to the collar?

846
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,320
Did the collar leave?

847
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:02,920
And also, Michael Pepe did a sex show as a teenager to make money and didn't know that

848
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,760
you weren't supposed to actually do sex.

849
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,160
This now can be said, my parents are molasses.

850
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,960
That was intriguing.

851
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,260
And so, yeah.

852
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,360
I guess the guest collar.

853
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,780
But, you know, I was good, but it was very cheap.

854
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,460
And how much money did you make?

855
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,000
And this was like $1,000.

856
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,760
You had to be there 11 hours a day and you got like $100 or something.

857
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,540
It wasn't...

858
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,520
That's pretty good money for...

859
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:21,940
This is 1978.

860
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:22,860
1978?

861
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,020
Yeah.

862
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,400
Just before you moved out here.

863
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:25,860
Sorry, 70...

864
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,500
I'm sorry.

865
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,220
$100 was about $6 back then.

866
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,760
Yeah, it was actually $75, $76.

867
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,380
And...

868
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,940
Yeah, $100 back then.

869
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,820
Make you cheer, man.

870
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,300
Well, but you had to hang out at donut shops and listen to maniacs rap and rant.

871
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,840
It cost $5.

872
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,400
This is when I went insane.

873
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,460
$100 today is worth about $4.

874
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,400
They're like, you're going to be on the show in America today.

875
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,000
$100 today is worth about $4.

876
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,020


877
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,020


878
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,480
You're going to be on the show tomorrow.

879
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,580
Hang out at donut shops.

880
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,060
$20.

881
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,100
Only worth about 3 cents, 100 years.

882
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,420
$40.

883
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,200
I'm worried about people writing down what you say.

884
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,920
Now, didn't Pee Wee Herman also do that for a living at one point?

885
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,220
Yeah, he kind of came down and...

886
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,200
That's right.

887
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,600
Yeah.

888
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,480
Well, he...

889
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,660
But now, the real Wild Young Gypsy Girl is about to start.

890
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,680
It is unlikely that a Wild Young Gypsy Girl like this will ever be made again.

891
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,640
But this is the Wild Young Gypsy Girl who will film it now.

892
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,000
And it's a wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild,

893
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,860
wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild.

894
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,340
The real drivers are in the Wild Young Gypsy Girls.

895
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:23,320
And the command force of Wild Young Gypsy Girls records every second of the action from the

896
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,520
Wild Young Gypsy Girl.

897
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:31,700
But now, it is unlikely that a Wild Young Gypsy Girl like this will film it.

898
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:39,760
Now, the cameras roll as the actual Wild Young Gypsy Girl is not the same unique Wild Young

899
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,700
Gypsy Girl as the repeated Wild Young Gypsy Girl.

900
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,620
Wild Young Gypsy Girl.

901
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,920
All the excitement of the same wild young gypsy girl.

902
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:53,420
The spectacle, the grand adventure of the real wild young gypsy girl.

903
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,120
But now...

904
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,500
Now.

905
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,180
Can you imagine an entire opera being built around Mary Magdalene?

906
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,180
Mary Magdalene.

907
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,940
Mary Magdalene.

908
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,820
Mary Magdalene.

909
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,680
Mary Magdalene.

910
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,240
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.

911
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,320
Really?

912
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:44,840
Really?

913
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,820
Really?

914
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,620
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.

915
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,160
Really?

916
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:05,100
It adds so much more excitement to bring in a street-walking prostitute

917
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,740
and have her say as she does in Superstar.

918
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,700
That feels nice.

919
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,820
I don't know how to love him.

920
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,740
He's a man.

921
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,680
He's just a man.

922
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,940
And I've had so many men before.

923
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,780
Really?

924
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,180
Ha!

925
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,940
Mary Magdalene.

926
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,940
Mary Magdalene.

927
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,760
Mary Magdalene.

928
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,540
Mary Magdalene.

929
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,980
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.

930
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,180
Mary Magdalene.

931
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:45,180


932
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:45,180


933
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:45,180


934
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:45,180


935
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:45,180


936
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,760
Probably before she told 72 seconds, she told an ace that she helped me with the

937
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:51,760


938
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:07,980
Let me try to cool down your économique.

939
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,720
Of all the things.

940
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,300
Of all the things.

941
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:11,940
And It's.

942
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,240
It's really.

943
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:14,520
And it's이야.

944
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:14,600
Oh yeah, Dakota.

945
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:14,600


946
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:14,600


947
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:14,960
Yeah.

948
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,700
Mary Magdalene

949
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,780
Mary Magdalene

950
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,320
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute

951
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,920
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute

952
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,400
Should I bring him down?

953
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,500
Should I speak of love, let my feelings out?

954
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,000
I want him so

955
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,560
Let me try to cool down your face again

956
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,520
That feels nice, so nice

957
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,460
Mary, that's good

958
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,700
Mary Magdalene

959
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,200
Mary Magdalene

960
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,420
Mary Magdalene

961
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,860
Mary Magdalene

962
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,860
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute

963
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,580
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute

964
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,960
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute

965
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,200
Mary Magdalene

966
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:17,420
Mary Magdalene

967
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,280
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute

968
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,440
Mary Magdalene Thank God

969
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:19,440


970
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:19,440


971
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,200
Millions of people

972
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,840
I tell you,�

973
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,940
I tell you, attentively

974
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:31,580
More noise

975
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,120
**

976
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,880
Mary Magdalene

977
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:42,880


978
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,960
Mary Magdalene

979
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,020
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.

980
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,820
I don't know how to love him.

981
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,660
He's a man.

982
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,640
He's just a man.

983
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,080
That feels nice.

984
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:39,460
Mary Magdalene by the Jelly Eaters.

985
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,880
What are you going to teach me first, Master Kwan?

986
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,700
Inspiration.

987
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,120
Music that is absolutely riveting.

988
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,300
See for yourself.

989
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,960
An angel appeared to Mary

990
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,640
on a glittery cloud of angel wings.

991
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:59,000
This angel brought fair Mary news.

992
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,920
You'll give birth to the King of Kings.

993
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,540
Well, Mary gasped and Mary stared.

994
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,180
She'd never seen an angel and she was scared.

995
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,700
The angel said, my virgin maid,

996
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,200
there's no reason to be afraid.

997
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:13,940
Fear not.

998
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,760
The angels smile.

999
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,440
Fear not.

1000
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,260
My virgin child.

1001
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,700
You've been touched by the Holy Ghost.

1002
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,260
Above all women, you've been blessed.

1003
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:23,860
Fear not.

1004
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,180
Fear not.

1005
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,400
Fear not.

1006
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,560
Fear not.

1007
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:36,480
And now, friends, well, you're hearing in the background the amino acids who played at our Akron Revival.

1008
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,480
You can hear more of them at theaminoacids.com.

1009
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:46,300
That's www.theaminoacids.com.

1010
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:15,600
Thank you.

1011
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:42,440
Thank you.

1012
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,220
Thank you.

1013
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,380
Thank you.

1014
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:43,380


1015
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:45,660
Thank you.

1016
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:47,720
Thank you.

1017
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,440
Thank you.

1018
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,500
The amino acids.

1019
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,580
Now, Dave, you've converted to the Church of the Subgenius, is that correct?

1020
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,740
Oh, well, there's no conversion table involved.

1021
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,740
You just take one cup of metric water.

1022
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,340
Right.

1023
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,080
And place it in some boiling pans.

1024
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:00,560
Okay.

1025
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,580
Add three pounds of metric salt.

1026
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,280
I see.

1027
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,120
And there's your conversion table right there.

1028
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,640
Well, that's pretty amazing.

1029
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,740
I didn't think it was that easy.

1030
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,320
Well, you...

1031
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,460
Actually, you also have to spend 30 bucks.

1032
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:13,580
Now, Reverend...

1033
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,660
You have to be born that way and spend 30 bucks both.

1034
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,480
You can just spend the 30 bucks.

1035
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,540
Now, I'm more interested in that loophole.

1036
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:29,480
The one loophole that if you're actually having sex at 7 a.m. on July 5th, that you don't have to pay the 30 bucks.

1037
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:30,900
What?

1038
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,540
I think you said that.

1039
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,640
I found that in an old tape.

1040
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,060
I think that loophole had hair around it.

1041
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,440
That's how he found it.

1042
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,160
No, I was listening to some old tapes.

1043
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,460
And now, out of your very mind...

1044
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:40,820
Now, you said...

1045
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,260
Hello.

1046
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,200
My name is Natalie.

1047
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,360
The only way around the $30...

1048
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,280
Or having your card.

1049
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:52,180
The only way you don't have to have your card at 7 a.m. is if you're actually having sex.

1050
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,040
Well, if I said that, then pick up on it, man.

1051
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:55,740
Now, are we...

1052
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,760
Is the party going to stop by and see if we're carrying our card?

1053
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:58,940
No, I'm saying.

1054
00:47:59,140 --> 00:47:59,600
No, I'm saying.

1055
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,880
Or is old W...

1056
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:00,980
No, you're saying.

1057
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:01,600
No, you're saying.

1058
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,980
Is the party going to check your card?

1059
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:04,960
Who's checking the cards?

1060
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,400
I need to know.

1061
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:08,980
It's a genetic thing.

1062
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,440
They check.

1063
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:09,920
It's a...

1064
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,520
A scanner that's hardly even physical.

1065
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,560
Just call it magic.

1066
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,820
It's not even physical.

1067
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:15,820


1068
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,140
Aliens have magic.

1069
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,840
It's just kind of a scrambler that kind of exists more in the metaphysical plane.

1070
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,660
Oh, it exists all right.

1071
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,340
They can tell.

1072
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:27,760
They can tell who's in the book of life and who's in the subgenius foundation database.

1073
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:31,740
Well, they can tell all they want, but I'm keeping it a secret.

1074
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,260
You know what I'm saying?

1075
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:36,680
And they're going to tell Mr. Chaney tomorrow, and I'm going to get a great big fat check.

1076
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,040
And you might go to jail.

1077
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,920
I think Chaney's...

1078
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,820
If you don't...

1079
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,160
He's a hot looking dude, man.

1080
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:41,920
I like Chaney.

1081
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,160
I like the way he kind of like grins out of the side of his mouth, man.

1082
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,460
That is so freaking hot.

1083
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:50,000
The way he had to wear the fishhooks in his nose to play Phantom of the Opera.

1084
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,320
He is.

1085
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:54,880
I mean, I'm not generally like a gay dude or anything, but man, I see Dick Chaney and

1086
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,580
I start getting a woody, man.

1087
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,280
Oh, Dick Chaney's a cute guy.

1088
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,120
I thought you were talking about Lon Chaney Sr.

1089
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:00,740
Okay, so...

1090
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,800
Now, he was hot.

1091
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,500
People call him...

1092
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,740
The hunchback of Notre Dame.

1093
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,940
Imagine that 80-pound hump of rubber strapped to his back.

1094
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,540
He knew how to...

1095
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,160
It was real suffering in those days.

1096
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:12,800
In the days of...

1097
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,260
Oh, those toothpicks weren't...

1098
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,440
They weren't enough to cause a scar on a...

1099
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,640
Those bags of water weren't stunt bags.

1100
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:23,260
Those were the real actors being tortured and mangled and brutalized.

1101
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:23,820
Brutalized.

1102
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,300
They weren't stunt bags.

1103
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,320
You're saying they're real bags.

1104
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,680
Oh, Mexican men are the gods.

1105
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,540
Well, are you listening on the internet, then, Johnny?

1106
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,160
Well, I'm trying my best.

1107
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,540
It's breaking up quite a bit.

1108
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:34,820
Is it?

1109
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,560
This is actually...

1110
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,140
The only way I could listen to the show was to make a long-distance phone call and sit

1111
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,120
on the phone.

1112
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:40,680
Well...

1113
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,400
Is that break-up?

1114
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,200
Well, if you're on unlimited minutes, you can just sit there.

1115
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,040
I'll lock you on.

1116
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,720
Well, I'll tell you what.

1117
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,180
We've got...

1118
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:50,500
I've got forehead paste on all three of us, and we're sort of sticking together right

1119
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:50,900
now, but...

1120
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,520
What do we got here?

1121
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,540
Oh, we're almost out of time.

1122
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,820
Well, you know, when you stay on the phone like that for a long time, it also serves

1123
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:56,820
as a colonoscopy.

1124
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,760
Have you talked to the people at Atrium Tree?

1125
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,640
I've tried to several times, but they only speak Yiddish now.

1126
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,220
Well, they're still psychic.

1127
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,560
Don't forget that part.

1128
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,940
They still are psychic, especially if you're using it as a colonoscopy.

1129
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:09,520
Well, I...

1130
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:14,120
We're all wondering how we can get our hands on some of that delicious ESO music, as well

1131
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,540
as some WCSB paraphernalia.

1132
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,120
You know, we've never had any in all the years we've called the show.

1133
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,040
How about some...

1134
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,140
We have no paraphernalia.

1135
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,120
No, you know, you can get that paraphernalia...

1136
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,300
How about some good old CSB paranoia?

1137
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,360
Well, you send me an email.

1138
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,020
I can hook you up with ESO.

1139
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:27,360
That's right.

1140
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:36,380
Chaz at subgenius.com, as well as subgenius.com catalog, you'll find ESO information.

1141
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,320
There you go.

1142
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,000
There you go.

1143
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,340
Give it to me.

1144
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:47,980
Give it to me.

1145
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,800
Give it to me.

1146
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,400
Give it to me.

1147
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:59,100
Give it to me.

1148
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:00,700
Give it to me.

1149
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,880
Give it to me.

1150
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,440
Very impressive.

1151
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,540
Amazing!

1152
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,220
Uh, yeah, that was the kicker.

1153
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,620
Nuns of Dobstown!

1154
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,660
The invertebrate flatworm slut nuns of Dobstown!

1155
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,220
They're soft. You like soft women.

1156
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,300
I like them like a...

1157
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,760
Only $40 you come in and we have no bones.

1158
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,980
I like them like a...

1159
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,560
Boneless women.

1160
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,160
Boneless...

1161
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,320
...jello jelly girls.

1162
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,480
Do they put them in the can?

1163
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,180
Female fillet!

1164
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,680
Crawls on her belly like a snail without a shell!

1165
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,920
Ah, you can put it in like a consommé.

1166
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,420
What a trail shell!

1167
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,880
I believe for you, buddy.

1168
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,680
Only $40, come on in, you don't want to miss this show.

1169
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,920
What are you, some kind of a wuss?

1170
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,900
Come on in here.

1171
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:20,420
Only $40, best show in Amsterdam!

1172
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,120
I could go for a mollusk.

1173
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,380
Live on stage, right in front of your face.

1174
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,660
They do it with bugs and snails.

1175
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,760
Subgenius Hardcore.

1176
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:39,360
Subgenius eyes bring you the hottest subgenius adult videos

1177
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:39,500
Jerry Seinfeld.

1178
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,780
Videos and DVDs.

1179
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:46,340
Yes, it's true, those horrible porn banners on the sub site that Stang deliberately cultivates.

1180
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:52,460
He whines and complains that they are needed to make money for the site, but in truth,

1181
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:59,080
Satisfy every twisted desire with their incredible collection of rare subgenius footage.

1182
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:07,560
When you go to the sub site site, you know, you have these porno things there which help pay for the site.

1183
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,120
Are you talking about some kind of art excuse or real just straight pornos?

1184
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,240
No, those banners.

1185
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,680
Those banner ads in the sub site.

1186
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,220
Yeah, I have not actually ever looked at it.

1187
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,640
Well, maybe they got rid of them.

1188
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,280
I don't know if you haven't seen them.

1189
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:20,360
No, they got rid of them.

1190
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,220
I just must have hallucinated it, that's all.

1191
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,500
Yeah, it was a dream.

1192
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,820
Even Stang couldn't stand it anymore.

1193
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:28,600
Even Stang wouldn't stoop so low.

1194
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,460
And you two are dreaming about it?

1195
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,660
No, Stang wouldn't stoop that low, but he just wouldn't stay there very long.

1196
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,540
Okay, let's watch a little Stang puppet stoop now.

1197
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,740
There, and then he stands up now. He's doing a bow.

1198
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,480
Now he's walking off stage.

1199
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:46,000
Now what we've done is we've reached the little tiny puppet subgenius show right at intermission.

1200
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,540
We did.

1201
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,180
That's really entertaining.

1202
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,280
Intermission. Really cute.

1203
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,740
I'm not sure I understand it.

1204
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,980
And then, well, now you go out for miniature coffee and donuts in the miniature...

1205
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,860
In the miniature golf course, miniature restaurant.

1206
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,560
That's right. And then you come back in 12 minutes later and the show starts again.

1207
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,800
It's really cool.

1208
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:04,820
That's exactly...

1209
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,580
Subgenius videos.

1210
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,520
It's a 4-inch video.

1211
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:11,240
A fabulous collection of subgenius women from all over the world.

1212
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:25,700
Some of the hairiest subgenius girls on video see those stinky, sweaty subgenius women tired of close contact with the stinky road of...

1213
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,740
So are we.

1214
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,220
If you're tired of that, then you need to call right now at 840-425.

1215
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,420
We've had enough of that ourselves. We're actually in our own exotic land.

1216
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:33,540
You know, they've...

1217
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:37,520
Now the boffins have developed an onion that doesn't make you want to eat it.

1218
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,940
You cry when you cut into it.

1219
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:39,380
I know.

1220
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,860
What will science produce next?

1221
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,960
Okay, all you driving around town pot smokers, call us right now, 840-425.

1222
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:45,480
Up to now.

1223
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,180
And all you guys in red Camaros with mullet haircuts, call us right now.

1224
00:54:51,520 --> 00:55:01,260
Oh, yes, dear friends, some KPFA Sub Show from KPFA Berkeley with Dr. Howell puzzling evidence, Dr. Philodrummon.

1225
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,720
And before that, some chief themes.

1226
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,140
A theme set.

1227
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:13,080
Where there will be a woman at the head of every nation in the world.

1228
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,660
But models are no less reserved.

1229
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,260
How do you get to be a head of a nation?

1230
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,980
And now, please, pay attention to...

1231
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:22,380
Be a woman.

1232
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,040
Huh.

1233
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:27,820
It's going to be a lot of work.

1234
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:28,440
Get it?

1235
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,620
It seems like it would...

1236
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,580
Well, I'd make a terrible woman.

1237
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,640
I don't know about that.

1238
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:34,640


1239
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:34,640


1240
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:34,640


1241
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:34,640


1242
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:34,640


1243
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:34,640


1244
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:34,640


1245
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,180
You got the right hair for it.

1246
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,740
Well, the hair on his chin, but it's in the wrong place.

1247
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:45,380
It would be great womanly hair, but it's just all arranged wrong.

1248
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,740
It's gone gray, too.

1249
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,080
I like the hair on his ears.

1250
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,680
Well, the hair around his ears will bleed if you cut it.

1251
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,240
That's not just hair.

1252
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:55,440
Oh.

1253
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,880
Well, those are his forgotten appendages.

1254
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,460
Oh, the undiscovered appendages.

1255
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,620
I remember my...

1256
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:05,540
They forgot the appendages.

1257
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,740
Poor crazy Bonnie.

1258
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,060
It's glass-drenched shirtless,

1259
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,380
She just couldn't stop lunatic room.

1260
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,080
...actuality and food.

1261
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:18,540
It is as if the model is according to one picture itself, like an interior...

1262
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:26,880
The ghost of excesslessness must pass, returns to haunt us in these horrible recordings

1263
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,760
from Doc Stock 1 in 1983.

1264
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,600
The saddest, sorriest, most...

1265
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,760
...disease-ridden festival of the arts.

1266
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,480
This is actually a young woman named Laurie's birthday party in Berkeley.

1267
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:41,140
Oh.

1268
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,740
But you know, the other one that...

1269
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,300
...was here.

1270
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,600
The Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1271
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,880
For more information on the Church of the Subgenius, write to...

1272
00:56:50,880 --> 00:57:01,640
For free information from P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1273
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,460
And friends, this music in the background is...

1274
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,380
The Amino Acid.

1275
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,040
Ugh!

1276
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,420
Tinkerbell, Wendy.

1277
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,760
I am Captain Hook.

1278
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,600
I am your friend.

1279
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,680
I am your father, Peter Padden.

1280
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,300
