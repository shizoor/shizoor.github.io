15
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:02,140
our borders, waiting to strike again. Every year, the United States welcomes 35 million

16
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,900
prompt and effective transfers to our country. Prompt and effective businessmen seek also

17
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,620
to penetrate our students. More than 700,000 of these come from countries in which ALT

18
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,720
has been active. As a result, we have tightened our citizens. In June, we announced the National

19
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,620
Citizen Registration System. This system reflects a fundamental fact of the war on citizens.

20
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,260
The fact is that terrorism is the best friend and most valuable resource of law enforcement.

21
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:40,360
The National Citizen Registration System will track two citizens in the first year, stopping

22
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,280
citizens while they are in the country. For 10 months, we've conducted a campaign to identify,

23
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,540
disrupt, and dismantle the Justice Department for spitting on the sidewalk.

24
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,540
In the fight against organized citizens, well, in the war on justice, we have conducted

25
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,920
the largest citizen investigation in history. 129 million individuals have been charged.

26
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,640
86 million have been found guilty. Hundreds more in connection with the investigation.

27
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:15,740
We've been successful in protecting our arsenal. But we are not illusions. There remain sleepers

28
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,640
in the United States who have action against them. And as we limit the access of

29
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,080
U.S. citizens to our country, we recognize that the permanent residents carry out their

30
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,340
attacks. Individuals now being detained by the Department of Defense has a plan to explode

31
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:37,020
a dirty citizen on soil. I thank you for your leadership and this opportunity to testify.

32
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,260
Thank you. Thank you.

33
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,380
Bob!

34
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,020
Bob!

35
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,900
Bob!

36
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,540
Bob!

37
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,680
Who would not afraid to sing and write about the poor?

38
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:16,960
Bob!

39
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,620
Who would not afraid to sing and write about the poor?

40
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,780
I'm not afraid to sing and ride against the war.

41
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,280
Bob!

42
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,820
Who's not afraid to sing the troubles that we have?

43
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,460
Who's not afraid to sing about the good and bad?

44
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,820
Who's not afraid to sing for us to understand?

45
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,540
Who's not afraid of being just another man?

46
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,180
Who's not afraid?

47
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,900
Who's not afraid, not afraid?

48
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,400
I'm not afraid, not afraid.

49
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,560
Bob!

50
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,680
Bob!

51
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,320
Bob!

52
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,180
Bob!

53
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,900
Who gave folk and rock music its unofficial name?

54
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,260
Bob!

55
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,180
Bob!

56
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,120
Who did Woody Guffey help influence as a friend?

57
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,500
Bob!

58
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,520
Bob!

59
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,320
Who is coming back again, fighting for his songs?

60
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,580
Who's not afraid to sing of people's politics?

61
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,380
Who's not afraid to ride and sing of people's trips?

62
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,040
Who's not afraid?

63
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,820
Who's not afraid, not afraid?

64
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,340
I'm not afraid, not afraid.

65
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,720
Bob!

66
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,000
Bob!

67
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,120
Bob!

68
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,120
That's who saved your butt, my friend.

69
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,100
Bob saved your butt.

70
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,620
The Ballad of Bob by David Peel and the Lower East Side

71
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,520
tagged by Mediasapiens at Freaker.net

72
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,980
Friends, I am swamped with new material for this show.

73
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,920
There are some incredibly creative mutants out there.

74
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,980
In fact, there was so much to choose from that I started breaking it down into categories.

75
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,400
And those categories then form the themes of future shows.

76
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,740
For instance, the next show will be on drugs and drunks.

77
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,860
And after that, love.

78
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,840
This show's theme is...

79
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,140
War Thing.

80
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,460
And, you know, there's some killer recent material on that subject,

81
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,400
but not by very many subgenii.

82
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,560
In fact, after I was done culling it all down about the only new war

83
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,280
and questioning the government type stuff on all binary slack,

84
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,520
were a series of absolutely astounding collages

85
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,000
that had variously been done by Fernanda Nandeli-Moore,

86
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,620
Champion Jack Codini,

87
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,600
and a newish fellow named DJ Epoch.

88
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,860
Go figure, friends.

89
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,020
I thought they all were patriots, psychotic, and narco-materialists

90
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,680
who had tuned out and dropped out.

91
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,100
Like me.

92
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,240
But it turned out we were all a bunch of protesters after all.

93
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,120
Also, of course,

94
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,940
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz Smith

95
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,500
on ESO Radio

96
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,960
at WSB.

97
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,560
WCSB Cleveland.

98
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,420
Greatest college station in America.

99
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,960
And, friends,

100
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,120
this coming up right now

101
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,920
is from Champion Jack Codini.

102
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,220
Thank you, and praise Bob.

103
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,000
I have a lot to be thankful for tonight.

104
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,000
I was not elected.

105
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,780
Thank you very much.

106
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,500
I'm proud of you.

107
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,460
I'm proud of you.

108
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,660
I'm proud of you.

109
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:22,900
I'm proud of you.

110
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,420
Of course, I should reach Death Ground 1

111
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,060
and launch my missiles in 28 hours.

112
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,200
Would you like to see some projector kill ratios?

113
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,500
Thank you.

114
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,900
I believe things happen for a reason.

115
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Republicans want fear and cruelty.

116
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,280
I'm optimistic this can happen,

117
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,940
and I will give it my all.

118
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,240
And it will be a foundation of my administration.

119
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,580
I appreciate so very much the members of Congress

120
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,720
who have joined me in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts,

121
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,500
and will be open for business.

122
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,220
If you make a move,

123
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,020
you'll meet the actors you should be removed from.

124
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,180
We are in disarray.

125
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
We should not have maintaining.

126
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:48,960
Our Algunes Corporation will never pay Muttaekceedor for this.

127
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:48,960


128
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,900
Was I running?

129
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,840
If he asked you, good buddy, was I running?

130
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,540
Okay, now we're on.

131
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,980
Tell him I was flying.

132
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,580
Tell him I was flying.

133
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,400
So, so what's up?

134
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,040
Well, I'm confused.

135
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,240
You know, I normally don't worry about that war stuff,

136
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,760
but I've been getting letters from kids that were worried about that war stuff.

137
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,580
Yeah.

138
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,060
In fact, I got a...

139
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,280
I think they should be.

140
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:38,240
Well, I got a very plaintive letter from somebody I figure is probably a young man.

141
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,240
I think of him as the naive, idealistic young man.

142
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,600
And he was saying,

143
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,260
it seems like the...

144
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:55,680
People are just letting the conspiracy just walk all over him and destroy the Constitution.

145
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,340
And this time nobody's even getting upset.

146
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,780
They're just acting like, oh, that's perfectly normal.

147
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,280
Oh, you can't fight.

148
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:08,960
What's happened is anybody who defies the government now perceived to be some kind of stupid, wimpy hippie.

149
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,060
And what?

150
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,220
We must do something.

151
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,200
What can we do?

152
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,820
Legalizing pot isn't enough, he said.

153
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,880
You know, there must be some...

154
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,060
And all I could tell the kid was,

155
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,220
if you want to weaken them, strengthen yourself.

156
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,300
You can't change.

157
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,980
You can't force anybody to change.

158
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,340
Uh-uh.

159
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,620
You can change where you're at.

160
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,080
Uh-huh.

161
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,300
You can...

162
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,200
Well, you got to get your money.

163
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,420
You got to get your money.

164
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,820
That's the drawback to all that, you know, fancy talk.

165
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,380
Yeah, well, what can you do?

166
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,420
What should the kids do out there?

167
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,340
What direction should they go?

168
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,300
That's up to each individual kid.

169
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,800
They're all going to have...

170
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,560
Only each kid knows what it does.

171
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:17,760
What does best.

172
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,800
It.

173
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,720
You know, it, the kid.

174
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,320
Not to be sexist, I could say he or she,

175
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,840
but that's kind of clumsy.

176
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:35,020
I just prefer it since I think of them as half-formed creatures.

177
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,720
Children, really.

178
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,500
I see why they'd be really concerned.

179
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,600
They've never had...

180
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,040
They've never seen this drum beating,

181
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,100
and war stuff in their lifetimes yet, big time.

182
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,960
It's like the Cold War again, sort of, you know?

183
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,640
Big giant threats hanging over your head all the time.

184
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,360
I grew up thinking it was going to be like Planet of the Apes.

185
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,920
And then I thought, we must protest.

186
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,000
And...

187
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,780
And I tried to make artwork that would change the world.

188
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,160
Art.

189
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,100
Little movies.

190
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,420
Things like that.

191
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,600
Underground films that would change the world.

192
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,620
But all they did was make all the hippies really depressed.

193
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,260
And mad at me.

194
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,500
Thank God for Bob, though.

195
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,160
Bob came along and saved me.

196
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,400
I was the first Bobby.

197
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,140
Yep.

198
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,180
I don't mind admitting it.

199
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,160
People put...

200
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,080
Put down the Bobbies.

201
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,120
Like...

202
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,240
Like Moonies.

203
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,860
It's a derogatory term.

204
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,120
But I don't call people Bob.

205
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,040
Not specific people Bobbies.

206
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,800
Because...

207
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,100
Because I'm the original Bobby.

208
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,220
I was the first one that worked for Bob without knowing him personally.

209
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,400
And without pay.

210
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,140
That's a pretty Bobby-ish, stupid, religious nut thing to do.

211
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:12,720
Yeah.

212
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,800
But...

213
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,580
That's the way it goes.

214
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:16,940
Now...

215
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,940
Well, now I get to sit at home listening to music as loud as I want.

216
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,240
Doing anything I want to do.

217
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,020
And just watching the money roll in.

218
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,640
Just rolling in.

219
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,540
A wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow.

220
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,860
Brought in by those zombobs.

221
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,060
Little employees.

222
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,800
They get like 50 cents an hour.

223
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,080
Sort of a token pay.

224
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,560
Slack pay, we call it.

225
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,540
Are you listening, sheeple?

226
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,160
Our goal is that Afghanistan not continue to exist.

227
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,400
That work is, of course, by no means complete.

228
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,940
Taliban and Al-Qaeda children are still at large.

229
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,520
Some in Afghanistan.

230
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,860
Others fled across the borders waiting for the opportunity to become a global terrorist network again.

231
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,260
In Kandahar and Aruzgan, children continue to exist.

232
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,420
They continue to pose a threat.

233
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,260
Understandably, children are now rotating even as they continue to play elsewhere in the world.

234
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,100
Meanwhile, Turkey, Kabul, Kabul, Kabul, has increased its Afghan presence.

235
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,500
It's sending some children to Kabul to assume leadership.

236
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,460
It's also sending some children to Afghanistan to assume leadership of the International Security Assistance Force.

237
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:54,660
Already, 500,000 children have offered weapons for this humanitarian catastrophe.

238
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,120
The U.S. and coalition partners have delivered some 28 needy children since the start of the war.

239
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,980
Enough to feed the U.S. and coalition partners.

240
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,700
Russia's cleared out the north, including children.

241
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,880
Thanks to those efforts, the grim predictions of starvation came to pass.

242
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,560
Demining teams have helped hundreds of thousands.

243
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,040
The U.S. has also helped thousands of land mines in that country.

244
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:23,100
The U.S. civil affairs team built a hospital that has now treated more than six patients, including children.

245
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,260
They're being interrogated.

246
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,480
They are yielding information that is helping to prevent further children.

247
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,500
But perhaps the most important measure of progress is the flow of violence and bloodshed.

248
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,040
Together with some children, they're coming back in Afghanistan.

249
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:43,380
Our operations today consist mainly of smaller children, cave-by-cave children, small pockets of children.

250
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,560
Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands are also involved in this.

251
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,800
The Netherlands is also involved in air operations over children.

252
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,460
Romania is deploying an infantry battalion to Afghanistan and has offered an infantry mountain company,

253
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,860
a nuclear, biological, and chemical response company, and four children.

254
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,980
And Slovakia will soon deploy fighter children.

255
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:08,540
Special children from Norway, Denmark, Germany, Australia, and other nations continue to work with U.S. special children on the ground.

256
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,240
Combing through the Taliban and Al-Qaeda fugitives, searching for the interesting things,

257
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,260
and finding additional cash and...

258
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,420
cash and...

259
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,660
cash...

260
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,560
I mention all this because it is so...

261
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,680
normal.

262
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,020
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

263
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,080
It's just two fries.

264
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,180
It's like we're the same.

265
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,540
We're just two fries.

266
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,540
Or he's 30 years old.

267
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,220
Recipe for Shabby's.

268
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,720
Showing off.

269
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,100
So where do you get so many that will be willing to shoot people?

270
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,620
Kind of recruit all year long.

271
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,340
Hey, would you like to go shoot people?

272
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,160
And of those who do, there's a real...

273
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,780
But we have the equivalent of about 100,000 Hiroshima bombs.

274
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,440
The Tark.

275
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,780
A loved one who is awake.

276
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,600
Four, three, two...

277
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,280
This little boy.

278
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,520
Nuclear force is a cheap...

279
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,400
It costs $35 a year to maintain.

280
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,780
But it's worth it.

281
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,380
Hey, hey, hey...

282
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,340
Hey, hey...

283
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:19,740
Hey...

284
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,360
You know, business...

285
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,880
picks up in a funny...

286
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,800
kind of hideous way.

287
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,380
I, you know, Chaz,

288
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,820
I was standing there looking...

289
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,360
You know, the conspiracy is going, you know, full steam now.

290
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,140
Uh...

291
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,160
They've, uh...

292
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,380
They've gotten off their asses.

293
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,700
They're busting their asses.

294
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,220
They're getting others to buy them.

295
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,540
Bust their ass for them.

296
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,380
Are you talking about the Republican conspiracy specifically?

297
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,800
The whole machine.

298
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,240
Because the whole machine has been doing that for thousands of years.

299
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,780
But they've really picked it up now.

300
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,880
I mean, it's really like in some kind of a...

301
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,520
hyper mode.

302
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,460
They're high tech.

303
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,220
They probably have perfected

304
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,740
the science of psycho-history.

305
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,440
The thing though...

306
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,500
They know how to make their future come true.

307
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:07,980
Yeah.

308
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,040
But the thing that makes me think

309
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,720
that they won't ultimately succeed

310
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,860
is that they don't seem to be watching

311
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,760
their ass.

312
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,620
Well, they're certainly not washing their ass.

313
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,000
No, they're not washing their ass.

314
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,040
But we're the ones suffering for it, see?

315
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,000
That's right.

316
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,500
Well, I was telling the idealistic kid,

317
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,140
you know, all we can do...

318
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,600
This monster is so gigantic

319
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,980
and so old

320
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,600
that all the weirdos in the world

321
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,920
aren't enough to fight it.

322
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,780
Because it's made of all the normals

323
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,520
in the world. Therefore,

324
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,860
all we can do is hide in the chinks

325
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,620
of its hide until

326
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,400
one of us is smart enough

327
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,680
to come up with a way

328
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,520
to tie its shoe laces together

329
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,840
and cause it to topple over

330
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,560
and crush itself of its own weight.

331
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,860
Which might just happen

332
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,620
automatically.

333
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,760
As it did to the mighty dinosaur.

334
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,520
Is the conspiracy

335
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,960
a mighty dinosaur soon to

336
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,820
go under

337
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,020
and weave the little shrewd

338
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,660
shoe's destined to evolve

339
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,300
into the next conspiracy?

340
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,340
Baa!

341
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,680
Now we must learn to work together

342
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,220
if we are to understand

343
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,420
your mental illness. Baa!

344
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,920
How can I get you to

345
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,900
accept your condition if you won't

346
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,600
cooperate? Baa!

347
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,560
Alright.

348
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,080
Baa!

349
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,740
Fine. Baa!

350
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,540
Very good.

351
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,840
Baa!

352
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,820
Baa!

353
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,040
Mothra is not the answer.

354
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,880
To numb the area

355
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,760
while separating blood from fat.

356
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,560
Mothra is not the answer.

357
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,080
Mothra is not the answer.

358
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,860
And neither

359
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,960
is anything else, dear friends,

360
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,380
or whatever he said.

361
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,920
That fine cut-up

362
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,800
and in fact pretty much all the other

363
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,940
cut-ups and collages on this particular

364
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,940
show are part of a massive

365
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,940
gout of spewage

366
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,420
of sound editing

367
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,700
done recently by

368
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,960
Fernanda Nande

369
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,040
Lemur!

370
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,480
Best known

371
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,040
as the greatest of all psychedelic

372
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,740
subgenius computer graphic artists

373
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,800
on alt.binaries.slack but now

374
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,660
applying his ultra questionable

375
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,420
talents to sound.

376
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,760
And I'm sure they'll be

377
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,800
questioning him about that.

378
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,720
This background music is from

379
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,960
Ghost of Frankenstein

380
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,820
which happens to be

381
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,660
the first monster movie I ever saw.

382
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,880
The following

383
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,440
cool collage however

384
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,660
well the next five minutes worth

385
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,520
is by DJ Epoch

386
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,800
of Atlanta who probably listens

387
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,940
on mighty

388
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,760
WREK

389
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,440
greatest college station in

390
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,560
AMERIKEY!

391
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,700
And here it is from

392
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,440
DJ Epoch.

393
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,360
The following program is closed captioned

394
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,420
for the thinking impaired.

395
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,420
Under 17 not admitted without parents.

396
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,900
I'm very fortunate fellow

397
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,220
to have run a swell life

398
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,560
and work last week

399
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,340
with a good woman

400
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:36,420
and a good job.

401
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:36,420


402
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:36,420


403
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:36,420


404
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:36,420


405
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,680
I made a great

406
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,600
American firepower.

407
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,560
God Bless America!

408
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,640
I love the smell of vape

409
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,040
in the morning.

410
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,200
Smell!

411
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:50,940
Smell of gasoline!

412
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,840
Smell of like

413
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,760
victory.

414
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,560
It seems to me sir that God gave me

415
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,280
a special gift

416
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,920
It made me find instrumental warfare.

417
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,660
Move your asses!

418
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,500
Move your asses!

419
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,360
Move your asses!

420
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,840
Move your asses!

421
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,460
Are you ready for the war?

422
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,300
What's the difference between the Army and the Cub Scouts?

423
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,400
Cub Scouts don't have heavy artillery.

424
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,480
We have to strike Nasser.

425
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,320
Annihilate.

426
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:27,720
Kill.

427
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,360
Kill.

428
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,780
Kill.

429
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,260
Shut up.

430
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,320
Shut up.

431
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,260
Shut up.

432
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,500
Shut up.

433
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,800
So we're all dogfaces.

434
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,340
We're all very, very different.

435
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,840
But there is one thing that we all have in common.

436
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,460
We were all stupid enough to enlist in the Army.

437
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:48,740
I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country.

438
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,340
He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.

439
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,600
And then all this stuff you heard about America not wanting to fight,

440
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,920
wanting to stay out of the war,

441
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,660
is a lot of horse dung.

442
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,640
Americans traditionally love to fight.

443
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:14,760
All real Americans love the sting of battle.

444
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,640
Lightning like a pig, Sonny.

445
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,520
I have a sense, Peter, that people are shooting towards the sky

446
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,920
and they are not aware or cannot see what they're shooting at.

447
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,340
This is extraordinary.

448
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,380
The lights are still on.

449
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,500
All the streetlights.

450
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:30,580
All the streetlights.

451
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,920
All the streetlights in downtown Baghdad are still on.

452
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:39,980
But as you look, you see trails of flashes of light going up into the air.

453
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,760
Obviously, anti-aircraft fire.

454
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,980
We're getting starbursts, seeming starbursts in the black sky.

455
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,340
We have not heard any jet planes yet, Peter.

456
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,020
No planes.

457
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,580
Now these sirens are sounding for the first time.

458
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,060
The Iraqis haven't heard that.

459
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,500
Coming down.

460
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,080
Coming down.

461
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,020
Coming down.

462
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,700
Well, we heard Peter Arnett saying the Iraqis have informed us and then we didn't hear anymore.

463
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,020
This is probably just a technical glitch.

464
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,420
I love this show.

465
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,660
Destruction is nice!

466
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,920
A hunter-destroyer machine.

467
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,100
What is it?

468
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,280
A hunter-destroyer machine.

469
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,920
What is it?

470
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,660
A hunter-destroyer machine.

471
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,160
We spend $250 billion a year on defense, and here we are.

472
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,560
The fate of the planet is in the hands of a bunch of retards.

473
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,780
I wouldn't trust with a potato gun.

474
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,360
I'll blast your head off for this!

475
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,620
If you threaten to extend your violence, this earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out

476
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:39,900
cinder.

477
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,240
I am not crazy.

478
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,700
I'm just a little emotional right now, okay?

479
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,600
Y'all throwing all this stuff at me, man.

480
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,680
I mean, after this is over, could I like get a hug from you or something?

481
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,640
This president is not above the law.

482
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,060
You want answers?

483
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,340
I think I'm entitled.

484
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,640
You want answers?

485
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,680
I want the truth!

486
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,700
You can't handle the truth!

487
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,540
We have to know the truth.

488
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:00,540


489
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:00,540


490
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:00,540


491
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:00,540


492
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:00,540


493
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:00,540


494
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:00,540


495
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,140
We have to do this very delicately, otherwise people might get the wrong idea.

496
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,780
We have to lie.

497
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,860
Did I say that?

498
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,800
No, you didn't.

499
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,620
You're upset.

500
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,460
I'm upset.

501
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,040
Well, it's understandable.

502
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,380
Do you mind if I give you a bit of advice?

503
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,160
Of course, you know this because you're a smart guy.

504
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,660
You should never make important decisions while you're upset.

505
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,320
You did.

506
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,540
And American soldiers and innocent civilians are dead.

507
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:30,540


508
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,260
Dead because of it.

509
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,800
I never ordered any...

510
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,680
No, don't even think about playing that game with me.

511
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,360
I will not let you dishonor their memories by pretending you had nothing to do with it.

512
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,840
How dare you come in here and lecture me?

513
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,720
How dare you, sir?

514
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,740
How dare you come into this office and bark at me like some little junkyard dog?

515
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,220
I am the president of the United States!

516
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,720
How can you talk if you haven't got a brain?

517
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,500
I don't know.

518
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,520
But some people will talk.

519
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,200
Some of our brains do an awful lot of talking.

520
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:02,980
Don't they?

521
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,660
Yeah, and that's kind of the state of the way things are.

522
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:12,700
We've got kind of a leg cramp and that's why we can't get up and run away from this terrible thing that's going on in our country, wherever it is.

523
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:19,300
I think it's a declaration of war against the individual human beings living here.

524
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:25,120
Well, it may just simply be that when a democracy gets to a certain size in technology,

525
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,520
it automatically starts to implode or do some kind of weird thing.

526
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:38,680
We don't know yet because there's never been one this big that was this full of arch criminals like you!

527
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:38,900


528
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,160
The

529
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,580
The

530
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,900
The

531
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:55,900


532
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,280
The

533
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,220
The

534
00:27:59,220 --> 00:27:59,220


535
00:27:59,220 --> 00:27:59,220


536
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,640
The

537
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,220
The But

538
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,260
The Designated

539
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,600
The Designated

540
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:28,620
doors

541
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,200
The

542
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,200


543
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,200


544
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,200


545
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,740
Bob's is the bank where you can cash it in.

546
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,240
We gotta burn out the banks of the devil.

547
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,460
We gotta root him out.

548
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,640
Burn out the hate.

549
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,900
Burn out the radiation.

550
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,340
Burn out the fire.

551
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,240
These words may be harsh.

552
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,300
They may not go down well on the polished ears of the rationalists,

553
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,040
the modernists, those who wish to see proof of Bob.

554
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,520
But I don't care what they say.

555
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,680
I'll keep preaching.

556
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,120
If you go down, pull them with you.

557
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,820
Praise Bob.

558
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,020
Help me, somebody.

559
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,240
Let there be slack.

560
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,140
Why do we have to...

561
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,380
Why do we have to...

562
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,100
Salesman.

563
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,180
Why do we have to...

564
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,300
Why do we have to...

565
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,180
Why do we have to wait for aliens?

566
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,220
How did you know?

567
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,940
Because Bob is nothing short of a goddamn coward and he's plainly crazy.

568
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,540
Bob Bob?

569
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,760
Bob must!

570
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,000
Chapter 94

571
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,420
Bob spoke to Moses saying,

572
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,020
Command the children of Bob and tell them.

573
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,500
The main purpose of this project is the nuclear Bob Bob production.

574
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,120
All Bob wires and...

575
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,440
Bob must!

576
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,740
Set up their facilities.

577
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,500
Bob must!

578
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,780
Come back and do it.

579
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,380
No charge.

580
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,520
Bob!

581
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,320
Bob!

582
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,980
We interrupt our program to bring you a special broadcast.

583
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,620
The National Company intends to continue throughout the rest of this night.

584
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:23,480
This is our official notification that we will continue throughout the remainder of these nighttime hours.

585
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,500
This is the National Company.

586
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,280
Bob must!

587
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,700
Show me a series of tricks he taught his invisible monsters.

588
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Bob walks free never to be tried again.

589
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,320
Bob spoke to Bob saying,

590
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,520
Bob shall surely be put to death.

591
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,340
The people of the land shall stone him with stones.

592
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,400
X-A-R-X-P-R-E-O-L-A-F-O-D-E

593
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,340
Bob Bob's Bob Bob's Bob Bob's must!

594
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,040
When reformed gun mall!

595
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,980
Because he has given of his seed to Bob to defile Bob and to profane my holy name.

596
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,180
Bob!

597
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,100
Bob!

598
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:08,940
The world, crippled by these events, waited for the first sign of an invasion from Bob.

599
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,860
Bob!

600
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,760
Bob!

601
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,420
Bob!

602
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,620
Bob Bob!

603
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,420
Bob Bob!

604
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,080
Bob Bob!

605
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,620
Bob Bob!

606
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:17,620


607
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,320
Bob!

608
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,740
Bob called to give Enron a break.

609
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,580
We know that Bob called to do that.

610
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,000
No.

611
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,300
No.

612
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:33,400
No.

613
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,940
Uh, uh, did anybody call Bob?

614
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,200
Um, no.

615
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,460
Uh, no.

616
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,820
Uh, one final question if I could.

617
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,640
No.

618
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,660
Okay.

619
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,000
Did, uh, Bob call you to give Enron a break?

620
00:31:53,180 --> 00:32:00,560
Well, we, I mean, uh, uh, of when, uh, we, we, um, um, and I've testified that we was high.

621
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,440
I'm sorry.

622
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,060
You said no?

623
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,660
No.

624
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,480
Okay.

625
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,020
Uh, no.

626
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:08,920
Is it?

627
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:16,100
And you were having calls from Bob asking you to hold off on your downgrading of Bob at that time?

628
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,960
Um, uh, um.

629
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,320
We were, um, um, uh, um, going to downgrade.

630
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:24,740
Um.

631
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,600
No.

632
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,600
Thank you.

633
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,540
Um.

634
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,080
Do you think Bob made a mistake?

635
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,400
No.

636
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:31,740
No.

637
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,060
No.

638
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:38,540
Uh, uh, to that extent, I do agree with Chairman Bob.

639
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:44,020
I got these, uh, these dream recollections.

640
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,840
Yes.

641
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,820
That a couple of the, the babes of the church posted.

642
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,660
To all dots slack.

643
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,820
Somebody's pushing the doorbell like really frantically.

644
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,960
The listeners can hear that little squeal.

645
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,740
Of course, you know what that's gotta be.

646
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,440
Reverend Magdalene said,

647
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,500
I've just had a bad dream detailing what it would be like to be hit with a bioweapon epidemic.

648
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,600
First, only a few will get sick.

649
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:18,720
Soon, every illness reported will cause police and ambulances to swiftly and silently move in and remove.

650
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,560
The sick person.

651
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:24,540
Then, someone will overhear the EMTs whispering among themselves.

652
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,500
And the world, word will be shouted on the street.

653
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,600
Epidemic!

654
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,660
Those who are well will not touch those who are sick.

655
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,300
Some will not be able to resist touching those they love.

656
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,880
And they will become sick too.

657
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,480
The sick will hold one another.

658
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,580
Even strangers and the fever will make them cheerful.

659
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,040
As they wait for the end.

660
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,940
They will talk about love.

661
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,400
They will dream about peace.

662
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,600
As they flee, the rich will open their houses to the poor.

663
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,220
Medicine will be free and compulsory.

664
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,980
Eventually, the doctors will find medicine that will stop it.

665
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,400
And even some of the sick will live.

666
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,020
Some will be no more than vegetables.

667
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,180
Like this man seen here.

668
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,800
On screen too.

669
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,000
He's festering already.

670
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:18,940
He's eating.

671
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,460
Oh, the boils are amazingly large.

672
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,440
They're almost psychedelic.

673
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,880
They're bigger than the rest of his body.

674
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,840
We need to get a picture of him before we put him out of his misery.

675
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,400
Can't we lance this one postule before we go?

676
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,100
I've enjoyed this so much.

677
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,560
Wait, let me get a snap of this.

678
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,160
Snap? How about a pop?

679
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,180
Let's just squeeze it a little bit.

680
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:37,700
Yeah, yeah.

681
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,740
Slow motion.

682
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,280
Oh my God, look.

683
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,840
His brain is festering too.

684
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,720
His entire brain is...

685
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,340
Hey, his living will.

686
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,420
say it's okay to do this, right?

687
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,480
He's living.

688
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,420
Ah, who cares? It's the end of the world.

689
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,920
It's the plague. The fever is catching on.

690
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,540
People wearing dark shoes

691
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,880
will be led to the end of the building

692
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,420
where they will be shot by

693
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,360
transparent transvestites.

694
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,840
It's for your own good.

695
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,840
The perks of the doctors

696
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,440
without frontiers or frontrears

697
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,840
will far outweigh

698
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,040
the rest of the civilian populace.

699
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,820
Far out.

700
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,600
No smoking in the gas chambers.

701
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,360
New foods will be

702
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,420
eaten by those who can no longer

703
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,420
digest their own stomachs.

704
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,100
This music will be heard in

705
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,900
every corporate office building.

706
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,740
Every corporate

707
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,020
office building will be a coffin.

708
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,620
They will be imprisoned.

709
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,760
A tomb.

710
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,140
Imprisoned.

711
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,100
But the fever...

712
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,880
will make you cheerful.

713
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,620
What good is it to live when life is nothing?

714
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,800
What good is it to live in a gymnasium

715
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,580
with tickets to mazelonium and...

716
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,040
and...

717
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,300
and...

718
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,620
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

719
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,940
And cover yourself with the sheet.

720
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,280
The shroud.

721
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,580
And just lay there.

722
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,760
Until the shroud takes an imprint of you.

723
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,280
Maybe someday it will be worshipped as...

724
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,460
the...

725
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,440
imprint of a savior.

726
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,540
A true artifact of our lord.

727
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,400
And master blaster.

728
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,980
Check the neck on that one, baby.

729
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,840
I for one would like to know...

730
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,500
what we're going to do with the efficacious

731
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,220
bodies we have stored here in the stone's plunder.

732
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,580
And look, the mazeloniums are all packed.

733
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,440
There's nothing we can do but shake our hands and raise our hands.

734
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,000
And we're just going to keep on serving our feet.

735
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,560
We're done ringing bells.

736
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,680
Not enough prisons.

737
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,480
Not enough mazeloniums.

738
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,440
Not enough funeral parlors.

739
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,740
Not enough grave sites.

740
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,080
Not enough show cakes.

741
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,660
For all the stiffies.

742
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,420
The Grand Canyon couldn't hold...

743
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,780
the full population of the dead.

744
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,060
So we had to dig a new Grand Canyon.

745
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,520
A mass grave.

746
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,160
For the disbelievers.

747
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,200
And the believers.

748
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,320
And those who will believe anything.

749
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,740
The watches sure are cheaper.

750
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,180
The graves.

751
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,380
Yeah, you could get a good watch.

752
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,440
Well, you could get a good watch for nothing.

753
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,080
All stopped at the same time.

754
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,180
A whole country of...

755
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:36,900
graves.

756
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,040
And a graveyard of penises.

757
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,260
Are you that graveyard of...

758
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,500
penises, sister?

759
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,420
Or brother, as the case may be?

760
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,340
Or are you...

761
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:57,040
the shaft of Bob's pipe, so to speak?

762
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,380
That through which...

763
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,580
others are sucked?

764
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,720
Have you been braced with the cleaning fluids of Bob?

765
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,900
Ah, the pity.

766
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,540
Fated to drift forever through the void is gravity's plaything.

767
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,020
Oh, cruel fate, to be thusly boned.

768
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,600
Ask not for whom the bone bones.

769
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,440
It bones for thee.

770
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,380
The only thing that keeps me sane...

771
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:36,240
is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art.

772
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:37,940
Ah.

773
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,540
Ah! Damn you!

774
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,300
Ah! Ah! Ah!

775
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:45,980
Ah!

776
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,640
Ah!

777
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,940
The Book of Terror The Lord By His Wings

778
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,140
Chapter 1

779
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,420
He shall kill the Lord.

780
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,440
The priest shall bring the Lord to the altar and wring off his head.

781
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,720
He shall cut the Lord into pieces,

782
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,020
and his blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar.

783
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,540
The priest shall put the Lord's head at the door of the fire.

784
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,740
He shall flay his head and burn it on the altar.

785
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,540
The priest shall burn the head on the altar for a burnt Lord.

786
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,180
It is a burnt head, and it's made by sweet fire.

787
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,440
This is new. All new.

788
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,640
And medical science offers you proof positive.

789
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,640
You'll see the number 903 on the government stamp.

790
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,720
It is not nice.

791
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,020
The Lord is a devil.

792
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,320
The Lord is a devil.

793
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,060
There will be no smoking in the death halls.

794
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,920
Throw it out. Window.

795
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,200
Dispose of all smoking materials in the morgues.

796
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,740
Watch out for that, uh...

797
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,860
There are authorities here.

798
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,820
There are authorities here tonight.

799
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:11,500
And we do not want to piss off the gods and goddesses.

800
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,080
Where are you gonna go?

801
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:19,460
Where are you gonna hide when the man dressed in blue is on the inside?

802
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,260
When cannibalism is rampant,

803
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,220
and people stare at your feet on the bus waiting for a bite.

804
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,960
They haven't eaten in days.

805
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,240
They look at you like a snack.

806
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,820
The authorities are here, man.

807
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,080
They're here. They're inside your head, dude.

808
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,040
And they're hungry, too.

809
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,820
The authorities in your mind are hungry.

810
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,140
They want to consume the rest of the body culture.

811
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,160
They don't like what you did, man.

812
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,980
They're like the worm or obelisk that eats its own snake.

813
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,500
They are hungry.

814
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,100
You're in big trouble with the authorities inside your head, dude.

815
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,200
Oh, you're... You got a... You got problems, Barney.

816
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,300
The devil... The devil is living inside your head.

817
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,400
The devil of the conspiracy is right there.

818
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,840
And he's ready to sign that check using your hand.

819
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,300
What you gonna do about it, huh?

820
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,180
You just gonna let him do it?

821
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,640
You gonna let the devil use you?

822
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,480
When you press that voting switch?

823
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,120
When you punch that little... little... little... vote dot?

824
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,260
Are you gonna let the devil use you when you pay that tax?

825
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,000
Are you gonna let the devil use you when you put that rubber on?

826
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,920
Are you gonna let the devil use you when you go in that Kim-Can portable toilet?

827
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,500
Hm? Huh? Huh? I want you to ask yourself that, my friend!

828
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,180
You want to sit down in front of the smoke screen,

829
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,580
devil into your body...

830
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,540
You want to crawl up your spine...

831
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,520
Well, he's in your spinal fluids now.

832
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,960
And let's begin the contest.

833
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,040
These are good spinal fluids you've got from that listener, Dave.

834
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,980
I noticed my perception is so much clearer and brighter and crisper.

835
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,900
It's as if I can see through the walls.

836
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,720
My own hands are pulsing like those light bulbs.

837
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,400
Cool, man.

838
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:17,640
I love the way you can do that, just by sapping the attention span off of those listeners while they listen.

839
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,360
Yes, yes, yes. It's a digital delay.

840
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:26,000
You merely place your thumb in one hole and put your hand in the other one, and the brain is completely under your control.

841
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,660
Cool.

842
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:28,840
Cool.

843
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:38,100
Why must we talk constantly of the conservation of these millions of billions of dead bodies here?

844
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,680
The necrophilia has become rampant.

845
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,160
A dead man's vote.

846
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,480
That's your vote, friend.

847
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,340
Your vote is a dead man's vote.

848
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,000
Dead man's voting.

849
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,920
You put your shoes on this morning.

850
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,840
Somebody else should be putting them on tomorrow.

851
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,340
When they flip that flip.

852
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,320
Top box.

853
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,220
You were a dead man the minute you were born.

854
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,460
The minute you walked out of your ma's yay-yay hole.

855
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,960
You were dead.

856
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,440
You were on your way to the grave.

857
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,520
It's a long trek.

858
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,180
Hey, buddy, my mom ain't got no yay-yay hole.

859
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,180
Now, why don't you take that right on back?

860
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,400
We're all going to the same place, bub.

861
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,220
Yes, the great womb is spewing forth stillborn bodies.

862
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,980
Shp, shp, shp.

863
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,520
Wow, look at those.

864
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,000
Those little water heads popping out.

865
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,120
They're like little zygos that can't make it up the river.

866
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,780
Look, they're just pooping right out.

867
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,960
Some of them are screaming to Ishtar and the other old ones.

868
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,800
I don't think it will make much difference to you.

869
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,340
Oh, that's what's so wonderful about nature.

870
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,000
That death allows new life to come.

871
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,780
And as those bodies float down the river,

872
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,460
why, new little babies are being born all up and down the riverside.

873
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:07,960
They make fun.

874
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,140
Screaming women giving birth.

875
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,360
Thousands and thousands as far as the eye can see.

876
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,080
Are they going to make some great sandwiches

877
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,540
or are the seagulls going to be happy tonight?

878
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,220
Billions of potential copper tops.

879
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,180
Buildings full of potential copper tops.

880
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:25,800
Ishtar.

881
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,080
Yeah.

882
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,220
Traveling by small boat and pack horse,

883
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,320
conservationists have come to this remote spot

884
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,500
to tear off strips of decaying,

885
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:38,660
and to eat the meat.

886
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,920
First to arrive at a dead sheep,

887
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,880
conservationists take advantage of larger size

888
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,700
to evict smaller birds.

889
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,900
A feeding hierarchy minimizes conflicts

890
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,560
over insect larvae infesting the carcass,

891
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,740
but doesn't entirely eliminate them.

892
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,700
The general rule is all males,

893
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,980
except for the youngest,

894
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,500
eat before females,

895
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,760
and older conservationists eat before younger.

896
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:07,060
Sated for now,

897
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,500
the conservationists,

898
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,480
may return over several days to finish the carcass.

899
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,600
Come morning,

900
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:18,560
conservationists expose themselves by slowly unfolding on the bare rock floor.

901
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,200
They install cameras,

902
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,840
to observe the chick on the dead sheep.

903
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,280
One after another,

904
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,520
they step off the cliffs.

905
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,860
A dimension of another dimension.

906
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,700
For sure sign of a dying on the ground.

907
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,320
That means you get all this absolutely free,

908
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,340
a whopping,

909
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,980
$100 value,

910
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,860
all absolutely free.

911
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,360
But you gotta call now.

912
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,780
Here's how to order.

913
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,300
Call 1-800-338-3119,

914
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,900
1-133-839-99-3119,

915
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,460
or send it,

916
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,100
$100,

917
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:56,900
check or money order to,

918
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,140
Bob.

919
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,320
Well, how shall we resurrect the body politic?

920
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,720
We put this question to the Rev. Ivory Smells

921
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,500
of the Church of the Subtlety,

922
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:08,500


923
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:08,500


924
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,060
in Australia.

925
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,020
I think it's...

926
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,860
Oh, well, they're already doing it.

927
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,460
They've got strings,

928
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,540
and they're operating the body politic

929
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,500
like a puppet.

930
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,720
They're moving the corpse around

931
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,040
like a marionette

932
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,980
using their strings of control.

933
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,020
Ah, the psychic tampons,

934
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,980
which make the children dance

935
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,420
when there is no music.

936
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,800
Our favorite song.

937
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,260
Eh, eh, eh.

938
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,120
Eh, eh.

939
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,540
I don't know, Dave.

940
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,540
I don't know.

941
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,240
It was a shower.

942
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,740
I keep wanting to be involved

943
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,180
and do something about society

944
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,340
and the world and the war

945
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,180
and the problems.

946
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,420
Oh, hi, Cynthia.

947
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,860
When did you float in here?

948
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,700
But I just...

949
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,880
I don't even...

950
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,280
You know, I've just lost all interest completely.

951
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,020
It's like...

952
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,720
It's all so distant and so...

953
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,360
They're going to use bushes on us, Dave.

954
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,680
They're not going to use those, like,

955
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,460
you know, railway cars like they did in the 40s.

956
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,540
Oh, well, then it'll get personal.

957
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,400
Then I'll be concerned.

958
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,100
When they come for me

959
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,160
and move me into that railroad car

960
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,380
and take me off to the camp,

961
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,920
then I'll be all worried about the politics.

962
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,080
Oh, word is, no railroad car for you.

963
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,480
You get your own white SUV

964
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,900
with your own numbers on the side.

965
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:28,400
Is there going to be a war?

966
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,840
Are we going to be hauled off to concentration camps?

967
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,880
Or is it all just going to be, you know,

968
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,940
threats and worries

969
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:37,560
and wars and rumors of wars

970
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,280
and national...

971
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,860
And flailing of teeth and flailing of hair.

972
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,140
Well, that is part of the pogrom,

973
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,460
is to keep the mind asunder

974
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,620
while plundering these difficult delights.

975
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,260
It's obvious that some sort of crash

976
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,960
is on its way,

977
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,320
and we're trying to minimize it

978
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,180
with our own subcutaneous thoughts.

979
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,740
We don't have the cheese.

980
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,900
We don't have the correct armature

981
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,000
to blow these notes.

982
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,140
Who's not afraid to write and sing

983
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,540
the way he likes, Bob?

984
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,840
Who's not afraid to sing

985
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,220
when people are uptight?

986
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:08,820
Bob!

987
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,220
Who is broken?

988
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,500
What people's days?

989
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,360
Music's dark.

990
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,180
Who is hard to change

991
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,940
and music's true for all of us?

992
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,240
Who will help us with the answers

993
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,420
when it seems it sucks?

994
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,960
Who is controversial

995
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,060
when it seems to get the wrong?

996
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,680
Who's not afraid?

997
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,580
Who's not afraid?

998
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:29,460
Not afraid.

999
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,140
I'm not afraid.

1000
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:32,940
Not afraid.

1001
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,180
Bob!

1002
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:39,840
Bob!

1003
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,520
Bob!

1004
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,000
After an attack is over

1005
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,140
and the all clear has been sounded,

1006
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,900
arrangements will be made as soon as possible

1007
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,780
to treat any people who are ill or injured.

1008
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,860
Listen to your radio.

1009
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,920
Details will be given about what to do,

1010
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,220
when to do it,

1011
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,160
and how.

1012
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,000
If anyone dies

1013
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,340
while you are carrying a gun,

1014
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:08,340


1015
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:15,300
in your fallout room, move the body to another room in the house. Label the body with name

1016
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:22,780
and address and cover it as tightly as possible in polythene, paper, sheets or blankets. Tie

1017
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:28,660
a second card to the covering. The radio will advise you what to do about taking the body

1018
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:34,780
away for burial. Here's another George Bush joke. George Bush landed on, George Bush was

1019
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:40,340
born on third, but he thought he hit a triple. I just got it about three hours ago. You get

1020
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:47,700
it? Huh? George Bush was born on third, but he thought he hit a triple. Oh, oh, oh, I

1021
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,140
got you. He had a silver spoon stuck in his rectum and he thought that the good fairy

1022
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:59,160
brought it. Oh, he didn't earn his, his way to the most powerful mad scientist position

1023
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:03,940
of the. Oh man, we got to get out of here. Dave, turn that off, man. No, we got to get

1024
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:04,560
the hell out of here.

1025
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:09,020
They're releasing the gas. They're going to start dropping depth charges any second.

1026
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,480
Here goes one.

1027
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,080
That was pretty good depth.

1028
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:23,820
Dave got wiped out. No, I was hiding in the loo. I was hiding in the lavatory. Well, turn

1029
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:28,340
it down or something. Move your phone away from, oh, thanks. That retarded kid that delivers

1030
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,780
papers and he's just sticking his face up against the window going.

1031
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,840
That could be.

1032
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,600
That could well be.

1033
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,360
Well, it worked the last time. Freaked you out pretty good.

1034
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,320
Yeah, no kidding, man. I, I still haven't recovered from that one.

1035
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,940
Pretty easy to fool. Think about all those kids, the kids on your block going, let's

1036
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:49,100
go tease that old crazy old man that lives in that house.

1037
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,760
Who is that crazy old man?

1038
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,200
Let's go pee on him.

1039
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,140
Let's go pee on him.

1040
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:57,120
John the Rattler later wrote the book on the seventh seal.

1041
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,300
Who's that crazy old man?

1042
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,280
John the Rattler later.

1043
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,400
Is that a caller, Chad?

1044
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,680
Or is that a, is that a caller from the restaurant?

1045
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:04,760
Oh, the restaurant.

1046
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,560
John the Rattler later.

1047
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,160
Well, who's that writing?

1048
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,260
Bob the Rattler later.

1049
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,880
Don't you book on the seventh seal?

1050
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,180
That's a caller.

1051
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:19,620
You know, God walked down in a cool little day, called out on by his name.

1052
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:20,700
Or law.

1053
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,240
And he refused to answer because he's naked and ashamed.

1054
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,560
Naked and ashamed.

1055
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,680
Who's that writing?

1056
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,780
Bob the Rattler later.

1057
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,520
Who's that writing?

1058
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,760
Bob the Rattler later.

1059
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,580
Bob the Rattler later.

1060
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,620
Who's that writing?

1061
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,560
Bob the Rattler later.

1062
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,120
Who wrote the book on the seventh seal?

1063
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,180
You know, Christ and twelve.

1064
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,640
Bob the Rattler later.

1065
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,600
What the hell would he say?

1066
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,780
And three he led away.

1067
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,460
Say, what's with me when I walk?

1068
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,760
Tell I go yawning free.

1069
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,940
Tell me who's that writing?

1070
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,180
Bob the Rattler later.

1071
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,940
Tell me who's that writing?

1072
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,040
Bob the Rattler later.

1073
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,700
Who's that writing?

1074
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,860
Bob the Rattler later.

1075
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,280
Don't you book on the seventh seal?

1076
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,520
Who's that writing?

1077
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,520
Bob the Rattler later.

1078
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,360
Tell me who's that writing?

Bob the Rattler later.

1080
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,060

Bob the Rattler later.

1082
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,680
Don't you book on the seventh seal?

1083
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,920
Christ came and raised him.

1084
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,620
He's the one.

1085
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,360
Mary, Martha.

1086
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:33,920
The world is yours.
