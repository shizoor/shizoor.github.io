1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,960
Well, it seems to be so since this world first began

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,360
That some men are willing to scheme and a plan

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,860
To gouge out a fortune from the poor working man

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,360
For example, the subgenius, our old swat

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,300
But the answer is simple, the answer is clear

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,740
We'll all get together with nothing to fear

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,300
And throw the old bastard right out on his ear

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,800
Farewell to the subgenius, our old swat

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:35,820
Swat

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,700
From PR News in Washington, I'm unfair and discriminatory.

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,400
An 81-year-old woman is separated from her parents between mid-April and the end of that story.

12
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,300
Speaking at the White House, a 9-year-old girl died after a concrete Trump

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:56,720
collapse.

14
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,120
She was walking by.

15
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,180
The United States will be a migrant camp

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,120
And it will be a refugee holding facility.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,260
Russia's foreign ministries talk mostly about the schedule of PR News in the near future.

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:18,300
Crisis 1.2, 1.6, 2.1, 6.1, 65.85, 1.65

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,000
Japanese officials say you're listening to PR News in Washington.

20
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,220
H. L. Ron P.

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,680
There are Texans.

22
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,120
It's wonderful.

23
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,700
They just, they are very...

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,960
They love to get right...

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,540
Get on top of everything.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,220
Misogynated breed or misogynized or whatever they call it.

27
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,600
It's like a monkey humping a football.

28
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,560
When they have an inbreeding too much.

29
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,640
It's like...

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,820
A monkey humping a football.

31
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,000
A Texan likes to just crawl on top of something and wreck it for everybody else and cost

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,700
everybody a whole lot of money and just be loud, loud, loud.

33
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,740
The basis of the church of the subgenius, the product of a perverted or a few perverted

34
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,800
Texans' minds.

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,600
Read, if you will, this...

36
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,600
Are you calling K.R. Bob Dobbs the perverted?

37
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,560
...from humping the football.

38
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,540
Bob actually is not a Texan.

39
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,300
Well, I'm not supposed to be that specific as to what he is or isn't.

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,020
But he is a Midwesterner.

41
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,020
He would...

42
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,460
To a Yankee, I suppose, somebody might mistake Bob for a Texan because of his Midwestern accent.

43
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
Well, what about perhaps a Skanky or a Nor'easter or one of those other platelets that you find?

44
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,680
Oh, they probably think he's a Russian communist.

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,780
Well, he is, isn't he, in some strange way we've yet to discern?

46
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,240
Bob only believes it.

47
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,700
But everyone should be equally rich, not equally poor.

48
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,340
But without working.

49
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,640
There lies the rub, and he'd like to rub your little round belly.

50
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,760
Ah, he can rub the Buddha's belly any time he wants, but he better stay away from my...

51
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,540
Rubbed by Bob?

52
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,340
You've been screwed by George and ticked off by Tipper.

53
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,240
Ain't it about time to just bend over and pull out that wallet for J.R. Bob Dobbs, the

54
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,660
one true savior?

55
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,780
I'm not talking about the Messiah and holy man.

56
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,740
You know, when the pinks interview me on TV about Bob, I always say, oh no, he's not the

57
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:02,740


58
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,100
It's luster now, Stan.

59
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,660
Oh, he's not that welcome.

60
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,820
You know, I joke about it.

61
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:16,040
But the truth is, J.R. Bob Dobbs, a living man whose business is in Texas, is the God

62
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,820
walking on Earth now.

63
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,580
He is not just the son of God, he is God.

64
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,580
Bob Dobbs.

65
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:23,580


66
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:31,040
Not some silly internet character named Bob, but J.R. Bob Dobbs himself, that man Bob,

67
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,680
whose first certificate I've seen, who I saw shot and killed on that stage in Texas.

68
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,960
He is God!

69
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,960
And this Christmas we celebrate the birth of his business manager, Jesus.

70
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,460
Praise Jesus.

71
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,000
Jesus is almost as great as Bob, friends.

72
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,440
Jesus Christ.

73
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,060
In my religion, that's the way we...

74
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,360
We believe he is a prophet.

75
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,660
A prophet.

76
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,940
And the son of God.

77
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,200
Remember the first time that I danced with Bob?

78
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,780
But Bob himself...

79
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,380
It was January 12, 1942.

80
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,360
...changed God's diapers.

81
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,340
You'll know you've made it when your name is put into a crossword puzzle.

82
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:20,940
It has to be a good feeling knowing that number three down is you, and it's the first puzzle

83
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,620
you've ever solved yourself.

84
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,160
Turns out, the next day, you were the only one that solved the puzzle.

85
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,280
Apparently, you were so obscure that only you and your paid whores knew you existed.

86
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,980
Therefore, the only four-letter word that fits for numbers to read down is dork.

87
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,620
If you arrange everything else wrong, you still lose.

88
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,360
You're still you, with more than the fucking puzzle, too.

89
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,600
So...

90
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,660
I...

91
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,840
Dprogram

92
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:00,840


93
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,340
DDAistemum.

94
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:12,340


95
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,380
No.

96
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,120
Who the fuck do you think I am?

97
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,600
What are you fries around?

98
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,580
I don't even need that.

99
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,620
Who do you want to be today? Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

100
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,320
Oh boy, it is so terrible, it's like a dreadful scene

101
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,880
Nothing could be worse than when there's nothing on TV

102
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,820
I'd rather be a cowboy than just a blank out the walls

103
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,460
I've been reborn so many times I can't remember them all

104
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,020
And I say, who do you want to be today? Who do you want to be?

105
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,920
Who do you want to be today? Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

106
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,920
Just like somebody on TV

107
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,800
I think I'll be a teddy boy

108
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
I think I'll be a teddy boy

109
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,780
I think I'll be a hunk

110
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,260
I think I'll be a tough guy

111
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,360
And I think I'll be a punk

112
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,200
I might just be a fashion star

113
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,220
All dressed in pretty rags

114
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,060
With my hands across the other side

115
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,820
And walk around in drag

116
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,480
Who do you want to be today?

117
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,480
Who do you want to be?

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,180
Who do you want to be today?

119
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,220
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

120
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,220
Just like somebody on TV

121
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:03,560
I think I'll be just like someone on TV

122
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,020
Just like nasty kids

123
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,720
Just like a picture of you

124
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:06,720


125
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:06,720


126
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,980
Just like a picture of you

127
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,560
Just like a picture of me

128
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:12,560


129
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:12,560


130
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:12,560


131
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:12,560


132
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:12,560


133
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:12,800
Than the crowds

134
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:12,800


135
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:12,800


136
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Anyways

137
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:13,800


138
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:13,800


139
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:13,800


140
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:13,800


141
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,480
Well, not them

142
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,000
They like the man

143
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000


144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000


145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000


146
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,740
Do you like to live just like a rock in the middle of the sea?

147
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,600
Do you want to suffer by yourself in a pool of blissful misery?

148
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,260
Do you feel like a saint in artist's clothes with a rosary in your hand?

149
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,560
Do you want to be crazy like Bando, like a stranger in a strange, strange land?

150
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,760
Would you rather push the buttons and be feared by all humanity?

151
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,440
Or perhaps you'd like to be a bum?

152
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,920
Do you want to be stupid just like me?

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,020
Who do you want to be today?

154
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:01,820
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

155
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,080
Just like somebody on TV?

156
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,160
Who do you want to be today?

157
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,660
Who do you want to be today?

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,740
Who do you want to be?

159
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,520
Who do you want to be today?

160
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,000
Who do you want to be today?

161
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,920
Who do you want to be today?

162
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,700
Who do you want to be today?

163
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:29,760
Who do you want to be?

164
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,640
Who do you want to be today?

165
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,320
WHO DO YOU WANT TO BE?

166
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,440
Just another show...

167
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,540
Just another show...

168
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,160
It's just another show...

169
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,340
Um...

170
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,600
I can't get this...

171
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,180
Everything turns into an Oingo Boingo song now...

172
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,900
Oh, I know...

173
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:44,980
I know...

174
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,420
Princess Weed and I dug out these Oingo Boingo albums from the 80s.

175
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,820
I hadn't listened to in 30 years, but I listened to them constantly back then.

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,520
And I remember every lyric.

177
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,960
It all came back to me.

178
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:04,240
And now every time anybody says even two words in a row that also appear in an Oingo Boingo song,

179
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,540
that whole song becomes that day's brain worm.

180
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,120
Yes.

181
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,020
It's awful.

182
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,140
And I didn't listen to them the way that he did, but I've been listening to them now.

183
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,400
And they're so good.

184
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:14,620
They're so good.

185
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,560
I'm just soaking in it and I can't stop listening to it and thinking about it and loving it.

186
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,020
Well, don't.

187
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,160
I'm not.

188
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,060
I'm loving it.

189
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,240
We're so good.

190
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,860
They're still good.

191
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,160
They're still good to me.

192
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,840
I'm making movie soundtracks that still all sound the same.

193
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,940
If you think about it, every Oingo Boingo song is every Oingo Boingo song.

194
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,800
And every Danny Elfman movie score is every Danny Elfman movie score.

195
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,300
No, they're different from each other.

196
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,860
Yeah, the notes are different.

197
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,380
They're in different.

198
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,120
They're in different places, but everything else is the same.

199
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,500
That's okay.

200
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,740
Back in the day, it made them very easy.

201
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,520
That's what you do.

202
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,340
You're mean.

203
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,060
No, that's what you do.

204
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,360
No, they were known for being like that.

205
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,280
Having every song sound the same.

206
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,080
That was the phrase.

207
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,720
Sounds like Oingo Boingo to me.

208
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,760
You could say that about any band.

209
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,400
Think how many bands sound like the Rolling Stones now.

210
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,020
Yeah.

211
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,740
I mean, there's been, or the Beatles or whatnot.

212
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,580
There's been lots of times when I was driving around with my teenage kids.

213
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,140
This was 20 years ago.

214
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,960
And some song would come on the radio and I go, what?

215
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,260
The Stones have a new album out?

216
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,360
And they go, dad, God, that's, you know, Greenween or whatever.

217
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,900
They, they, some other band logo band.

218
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,940
And I was like, but the singer sounds just exactly like Mick Jagger.

219
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,220
And the guitar playing sounds exactly like Keith Richards and the whole structure.

220
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,920
It's it.

221
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,200
What?

222
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,720
No, dad, the Rolling Stones are old and stupid.

223
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,380
This sounds exactly the same, but this is new and cool.

224
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,640
Oh, I've noticed that as well.

225
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,060
Oh, there you go.

226
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,800
There you go.

227
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,200
Formula.

228
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,060
Formula.

229
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,500
Decade to decade formula.

230
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,840
This is brand new because nobody remembers it from.

231
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,160
Well, you would think they'd go, wow, that sounds like grandpa's music.

232
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,540
Maybe they like it because of that.

233
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,260
I don't know.

234
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:14,940
It's weird.

235
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,800
Creepy, kooky.

236
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,740
You don't like mom and pop's music, but you like grandpa's music.

237
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,140
Right.

238
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,640
Grandma and grandpa's music was cool and weird.

239
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,240
Mom and dad's music.

240
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,840
Oh God.

241
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,840
How pink.

242
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,600
Got to skip a generation to be cool.

243
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,040
Yeah.

244
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,300
That's a generation.

245
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,360
Each generation.

246
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:42,900
That means our, my grandsons, our grandsons, they'll be super into Hendrix and the Ramones and stuff and my daughter and my son.

247
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,900
Yeah.

248
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,640
And the in-law sons and daughters will all go, that's music.

249
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,340
That's not even music.

250
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,660
That sounds like caterwauling dying people.

251
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,340
What do you, how can you listen?

252
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,260
Caterwauling.

253
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,100
That's what my dad said about Jimi Hendrix.

254
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,040
Said caterwauling dead people?

255
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,000
Dying people.

256
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,960
Dying people.

257
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,380
Yeah.

258
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,740
You gotta be dead.

259
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,700
Almost dead.

260
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:11,620
Right.

261
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,740
You gotta be dead.

262
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:16,560
Bob.

263
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:20,580
Bob.

264
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,920
Bob.

265
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,820
Bob.

266
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,360
Bob.

267
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:40,740
Oh, yes, dear friends, we heard Lee Murr, titles and news, Einstein's secret orchestra radio from the Cretaceous, a quick Sheridan puzzle, and then something squeezed out of a previous show.

268
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,500
This is not a rerun.

269
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,060
Indeed, we'll be playing lots of bands you've never heard before.

270
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:57,620
Almost all of them are friends of mine, and not by chance, because I heeded Bob's suggestion and joined the Church of the Subgenius.

271
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:04,600
Because of that, I have a lot of really interesting and talented friends, and you can too.

272
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,880
Sure, some of them can be difficult.

273
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,780
At least some of them say that about each other.

274
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:20,680
But with rare, if it's really dramatic, exceptions, they haven't been difficult for me.

275
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,080
You expect subgeniuses to be unexpected sometimes.

276
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,400
That's what's so fun about them.

277
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:37,660
Here's one by Cult of Zier, spelled Z-I-R, Cult of Zier.

278
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,920
A song called Five July.

279
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,240
Five July.

280
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
Oh, wait, no.

281
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,800
No, because it's probably about X-Day, among other things.

282
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,500
Let's first listen to some X-Day-flavored old ESO swamp radio,

283
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,720
Professor Chaz Smith's show on WCSB Cleveland, in the day,

284
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,880
with the lonesome cowboy,

285
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,200
All Flesh is Grass.

286
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,300
Then, Cult of Zier.

287
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,440
The innocent metal snakes crawled over me.

288
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,100
I could only think of you, Jeffrey.

289
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,220
It was that long summer in Borigo.

290
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,740
Out South Carolina, I remember the very best.

291
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,740
You called Dad, asking for a quick reminder about the heroin shipment.

292
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,740
Grandmother had her eyes removed, and there was sorrow and suffering throughout the family.

293
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:34,900
And yet, you, with your long loins and classical phallus, came and conquered old Mom in the name of darbs.

294
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,040
A long-loined man he was, too.

295
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,840
Darb.

296
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,660
Darb.

297
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,700
But we had to leave him and all the others behind.

298
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,000
Because they did not have faith in their hearts.

299
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,360
No, they chose to follow their minds instead.

300
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,020
To follow so-called common sense.

301
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,900
Yes, dear friends, some may call it quite common.

302
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:11,480
I hated to concur with you there, Monthers, but I could see that the sides of your heads, your flanks, as we call them, were starting to radiate.

303
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,080
Ah, my old flanks.

304
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:21,780
Start doing that, you know, when I get the feeling of power and the slack and the smoke and this fine, fine crack.

305
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,960
Ah, yes, that's what has given me strength.

306
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:30,720
Yes, at quadruple X day, the crowds, the masses will all rise up, raise their hands up and sing,

307
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,840
All flesh is like grass.

308
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,520
They shall raise their feet and scream,

309
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,880
All flesh is tastier than grass.

310
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,460
And it glitters.

311
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:48,120
Lemongrass can be used with practically any vegetable, fruit, fowl, or fuels, fuels, fuels.

312
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,340
And a new barb odor will rise up.

313
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,560
And a new, newbile repertory will sing behind him and say,

314
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,780
Then all is flesh, as is the grass.

315
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,680
Froppit, froppit, froppit, froppit, froppit, froppit.

316
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,200
Froppit, froppit, froppit, froppit.

317
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,140
I felt, at that time, very rising, kind of disoriented.

318
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,080
My legs, they are looking cool.

319
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,040
Disoriented, and they wanted, wanted, wanted, wanted.

320
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,860
They think of it like anything wrong, I would not break a law.

321
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,760
Disoriented, disoriented, disoriented,

322
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,500
Ohh, you are liking it?

323
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,560
I would not break it, I have been breaking it a lot,

324
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,280
Ah, are you liking?

325
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,280


326
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,280


327
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,880
And believing

328
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,180
Yes

329
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,100
And believing

330
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,420
Yes

331
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,380
Why did you lie?

332
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,120
Pack a bag and say goodbye

333
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,380
All the fools that didn't treat you right

334
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:14,440
The unanointed will be left behind

335
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:26,340
Sailor, we'll go so far away

336
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:32,280
To distant shores so far beyond

337
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,120
That place behind the sun we can't see

338
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,360
How long has it been since we went to sleep

339
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,920
Brand new tellies on our tired feet

340
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,300
Why can't we just drift away

341
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,980
Way, way, way, way, way, way

342
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,420
I'll see you 5 July

343
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,480
Pack a bag and say good-bye

344
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,100
To everything that you despise

345
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,160
That puts stain on your mind

346
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,260
And that we're not alone

347
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:39,360
They've painted to raise a glass in our race mind

348
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,380
Need a barbiturates and cyanide

349
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:52,420
We're waiting at the punchline, baby

350
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,980
Say the word

351
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,380
It will go so far away

352
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,460
And now you know damn well why

353
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,480
We've spun tangled web to the line

354
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:34,660
We're waiting at the punchline, baby

355
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,200
We're waiting at the punchline, baby

356
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:17,880
No time now to debate it

357
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,040
No time now to dwell upon it

358
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:31,480
No time now, well, a day's yet

359
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,660
Black sheets to the flaming sky

360
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,040
We take time

361
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,940
We take time

362
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,680
We take time

363
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:20,560
We take time

364
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,380
We take time

365
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,260
To take this lullaby

366
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,140
Back with you

367
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,980
To paradise

368
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,540
This is bad. Okay.

369
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,380
Man!

370
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,020
5 July by Cult of Zero.

371
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,160
A CD called Better Living Through Confirmation Bias.

372
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,600
There's a ton of production in that.

373
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,440
I can tell.

374
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,720
That's a rich, rich mix.

375
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,160
Cult of Zier, spelled Z-I-R,

376
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,040
is mostly Moldg, our buddy in Portland.

377
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,780
Our fridge is decorated by Moldg's

378
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,000
artistical fridge magnets.

379
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,380
Moldg started his own cult, you see,

380
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,940
like a good subgenius.

381
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,860
I'll bet he pees on Bob's head

382
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,020
every Sunday morning.

383
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,460
I'm going to give you 10 rules for profitable self-discrimination.

384
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,300
These are rules of my own making.

385
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,760
They're very homely, some of them,

386
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,600
but they'll be very helpful.

387
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,900
And number one is keep cool when other people get hot.

388
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,080
I know you can agree with that,

389
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,300
but I'm not so sure that you'll always live up to it.

390
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,500
We're inclined, all of us, to get hot

391
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,640
when the other fella gets hot.

392
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,600
Say angry things when the other fella starts saying angry things.

393
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,040
I was in the home of the president

394
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,300
of a big electric power company one evening

395
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,640
when there came a storm,

396
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,060
and he called up one of his head men

397
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,980
to go out to take care of an emergency

398
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,600
that's happened as a result of that storm.

399
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,580
It was on Sunday evening.

400
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,840
The man was gone about two hours,

401
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,820
and when he came back,

402
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,220
he came up on the front porch of the home of this man

403
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,140
and called him out on the porch.

404
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,240
And I never heard a man get such a tongue-lashing

405
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,420
in all my life

406
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,800
as this president of the electric power company gets.

407
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:39,860
He says,

408
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,880
you blankety-blank-blank,

409
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,380
you think because you're the president of the company,

410
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,320
blankety-blank-blank,

411
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,240
and I'm just as good as you are,

412
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,940
blankety-blank-blank.

413
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,780
Oh, it was terrific.

414
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,360
I only heard one side of the conversation

415
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,240
because there was only one side of it.

416
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,200
One man was doing all the talking,

417
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,840
and one man was doing all the listening.

418
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,120
And after this had been going on for fully three minutes,

419
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,760
the other man ran out of wind

420
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,920
and had nothing more to say.

421
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,560
He was mad, you see,

422
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,560
because they called him out on this stormy night.

423
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,820
I heard the president close the door,

424
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,360
and he came back,

425
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,300
and he just smiled and said,

426
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,380
why, the man was a little bit hot, wasn't he?

427
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,640
That's all he said.

428
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,540
A little bit hot, wasn't he?

429
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,560
I expected any moment

430
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,220
to hear a fist begin to fly over him.

431
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,520
But you see,

432
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,800
there was a man who had risen

433
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,700
to great heights of achievement financially,

434
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,180
and he had done it by self-discipline,

435
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,940
self-discipline in every respect.

436
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,500
And he didn't propose to a law workman

437
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,960
who had been temporarily unbalanced by his anger

438
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,460
to throw him off balance

439
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,000
and make him stoop to that level.

440
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,520
He just didn't propose to have that done.

441
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,820
And you'll notice

442
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,360
when you get into an argument with anyone,

443
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,020
and you're apt to if you don't watch yourself,

444
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,240
that if you just remain silent

445
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,880
while the other fellow's blowing off his top,

446
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,040
he finally gets to the point

447
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,580
where he's got no more top to blow off.

448
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,840
Then if you want to get in a few words of your own,

449
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,300
that's a mighty good place to do it.

450
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,380
It's a mighty fine thing

451
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,700
if the words that you get in

452
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,480
are not the kind of the words you've been hearing.

453
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,040
In other words,

454
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,720
if you say something back kind in return,

455
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,320
it's far better for the other fellow

456
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,260
and far better for you.

457
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,960
It shows you to be the bigger of the two persons.

458
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,200
Now, anybody can get mad and blow his top

459
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,020
because of what somebody does or says,

460
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,580
and that's happening all the time.

461
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,460
But the truly big man,

462
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,840
the man who is in charge of himself,

463
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,960
he doesn't allow anybody

464
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,740
to draw him down to that level of a street brawl

465
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,580
or of an argument in harsh words

466
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,760
unless he wants to do it.

467
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,740
And if he's truly a big man,

468
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,420
he doesn't want to do it.

469
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:30,860
Number two,

470
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,860
remember there are three sides to all arguments.

471
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,800
You ordinarily think there are two sides to all of them,

472
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,240
but they're not.

473
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:37,640
There are three.

474
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,400
There's your side,

475
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,580
there's the other fellow's side,

476
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,740
and then there's the right side,

477
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,120
which is usually about in the middle of the two viewpoints.

478
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,760
Remember that when you get into an argument with the other fellow.

479
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,900
Don't assume that he's always at fault.

480
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,320
Maybe you're partly at fault too.

481
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,340
Maybe neither one is totally at fault.

482
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,500
Chances are in all of the arguments I've ever heard,

483
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,300
both parties were partly to blame

484
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,500
in one way or another.

485
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,360
I've never heard an argument

486
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,860
where one party entirely was to blame,

487
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,220
although I suspect there are such arguments at times.

488
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,600
Number three,

489
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,620
never give directives to a subordinate when you're angry.

490
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,660
If the matter is urgent,

491
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,740
then cool off quickly.

492
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,740
Number four,

493
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,160
treat all people as nearly as possible

494
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,820
as if they were rich relatives

495
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,280
from whom you expected to be remembered in their will.

496
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,320
Now that's a good one.

497
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,040
That's a honey.

498
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,620
That is a honey.

499
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,740
If you'll just do that.

500
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,480
Treat all people as if they were rich relatives

501
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,400
from whom you expected to inherit something at their death.

502
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,520
And you can do that.

503
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,040
You know if you had a rich relative

504
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,780
that had a million dollars he was going to leave to you,

505
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,100
you suspected he was going to,

506
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,560
it wouldn't make very much difference what he said or did.

507
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,900
He would never throw you off balance.

508
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,200
You would never talk back to him, would you?

509
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,620
Of course you wouldn't.

510
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,200
It'd be quite silly if you did.

511
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,720
Keeping quiet for a million dollars seems to me

512
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,500
to be a very easy price to pay.

513
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,820
Number five,

514
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,520
look for the seed of an equivalent benefit

515
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,380
in every unpleasant circumstance in which you meet,

516
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,320
no matter what the unpleasant circumstance is.

517
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,980
Make it the point to discipline yourself

518
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,420
so that you look for that seed of an equivalent benefit.

519
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,080
And you start looking in connection with the circumstances

520
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,320
and the circumstances.

521
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,460
Don't wait a week or two

522
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,720
until you've all worked yourself up about it.

523
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,420
Start writing where you stand.

524
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,420
It'll lessen the blow,

525
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,940
it'll lessen the hurt of the wound,

526
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,320
whatever it happens to be,

527
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,600
if you start looking for that seed of an equivalent benefit.

528
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,840
And number six,

529
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,400
learn the almost forgotten art of asking questions

530
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,120
and then listening to the answers

531
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,140
instead of getting the other fellow told off.

532
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,200
It gives you an awful lot of satisfaction

533
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,420
when you're angry to get the other fellow told off.

534
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,580
And the temptation is very great to do that.

535
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,440
I know because I've done that many times.

536
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,020
Don't do it.

537
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,660
Be bigger than that.

538
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,760
Listen to what the other fellow has to say

539
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,580
and then when somebody makes a statement

540
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,280
that you're not sure about,

541
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,740
learn to ask this one question.

542
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,040
It's one of the most important questions in life.

543
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,520
It'll serve more purposes

544
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,940
than any other short question that I can think of.

545
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,140
When somebody makes a statement that you're not sure about

546
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,720
or that you doubt or that you question,

547
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,460
ask a four-word question.

548
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,280
How do you know?

549
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,960
And then wait for an answer.

550
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,940
See him squirm.

551
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,800
Oftentimes there is no answer.

552
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,320
People make wild statements, but they came back up.

553
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,600
And instead of getting into an argument

554
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,540
and making an incident out of the matter

555
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,240
and getting yourself worked up into an argument,

556
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,800
let the other fellow do it his own fast

557
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,280
by putting him over the bell with that question,

558
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,400
how do you know?

559
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,920
I had a clergyman in my class once who was very...

560
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,720
I just don't know exactly how to describe him.

561
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,840
He was a fanatic, you might say, on the subject of religion.

562
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,100
And he was sure that he knew exactly

563
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,040
what was going to happen to me after this.

564
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,480
He said so in no uncertain terms,

565
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,920
not in the class but in a private conversation.

566
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,140
He raved and grinded for quite a little while about it.

567
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,860
And when he got to it, I said,

568
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,920
how do you know, Parsons?

569
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,840
And that really put him over the bar.

570
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,980
He said, that's the way I feel about it.

571
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,600
That's my faith.

572
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,740
I said, well, I don't have...

573
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,300
Belief and faith is one thing,

574
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,780
but having evidence is something else again.

575
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,360
How do you know?

576
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,800
What's going to happen to me at Radon?

577
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,100
I don't know and I doubt that you do.

578
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,320
How do you know?

579
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,500
Well, he never did give me a satisfactory answer.

580
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,140
There are a lot of questions that come up in life.

581
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,420
The connection is that if you ask that one thing,

582
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,360
how do you know you'll find that the other fellow will be off balance

583
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,440
and you don't need to make an instance out of what he says,

584
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,980
you don't need to get mad at what he says.

585
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,560
Seven, never say or do anything

586
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,600
which may influence another person

587
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,200
without first asking yourself this question.

588
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,500
Will it benefit him or hurt him?

589
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,020
And if it will hurt him, don't do it.

590
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,460
Don't say anything or do anything

591
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,020
that would hurt another person under any circumstances,

592
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,820
no matter how much he may deserve it.

593
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,120
Exercise self-discipline.

594
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,920
Don't do that because if you hurt another man,

595
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,080
you're going to hurt yourself ten times as much at least

596
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,420
because that hurt will come back on you.

597
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,000
I don't care who you are

598
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,740
or what circumstances you're working under or living under.

599
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,460
If you hurt another person,

600
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,180
you will be hurt ten times as much.

601
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,980
And if the hurt doesn't come immediately,

602
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,140
the rate of interest on that is

603
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,060
compound interest on compound interest

604
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,880
and it'll be a hundred times as great if you wait long enough

605
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,840
because everything that you do to or for another person,

606
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,060
you do to or for yourself.

607
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,320
There is no escape from that.

608
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,100
That's just as much a law as the law of gravitation,

609
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,640
which everyone understands.

610
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,780
You know that if you stepped off the top of this building,

611
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,340
no matter what your mind was

612
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,160
or what your belief happened to be,

613
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,520
if you stepped off the top of this building

614
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,040
and violated the law of gravitation,

615
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,540
that you'd hit the ground and you'd die in a very few seconds.

616
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,820
And this law which brings you back,

617
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,660
that's what you send out,

618
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,560
is just as inevitable,

619
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,960
just as inexorable as the law of gravitation

620
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,660
or any other of nature's laws.

621
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,240
Number eight,

622
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,620
learn the difference between friendly analysis

623
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,460
and unfriendly criticism.

624
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,620
Then decide which you wish to live by

625
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,880
in your relations with others.

626
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,920
Now friendly analysis is one thing

627
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,040
and is welcomed by most sensible people.

628
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,160
I don't object to that.

629
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,020
I don't object to friendly analysis of anything that I do,

630
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,300
even though it's very unfaithful.

631
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,000
If it's friendly analysis, I like it

632
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,520
because I can improve by it.

633
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,660
But if it's unfriendly criticism,

634
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,620
very obviously unfriendly criticism,

635
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,520
not analysis,

636
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,580
well then I resent it.

637
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,100
I wouldn't be human if I didn't.

638
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,820
How can I tell whether it's friendly analysis

639
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,200
or unfriendly criticism?

640
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,980
How would you go about telling?

641
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,320
A lot of ways you can tell.

642
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,640
You can tell by the, uh,

643
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,240
your relationship with the person who's making it,

644
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,360
whether it's friendly or unfriendly.

645
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:44,860
To begin with.

646
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,740
If it's an enemy, obviously,

647
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,020
I discount it right off the bat

648
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,340
because you almost know it's gonna be unfriendly criticism.

649
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,100
I can tell also by the tone of voice in which he does it,

650
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,040
by the manner in which he does it.

651
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,920
Because a man who engages in unfriendly criticism

652
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,620
generally uses a few epithets along with it

653
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,780
that clearly indicates that he's biased.

654
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,360
If you have self-discipline,

655
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,460
you're not going to be influenced by that kind of a person.

656
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,920
And number nine,

657
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,220
remember that a good leader

658
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,380
in any calling

659
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,220
is one who can take orders as cheerfully as he gives them.

660
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,440
And number ten, last but not least,

661
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,000
remember that tolerance in human relations

662
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,880
is just as important as tolerance in the operation of mechanics.

663
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,740
Ten rules spoken by the famous self-help author and con man,

664
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,580
Napoleon Hill,

665
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,600
with a music loop by Uncle Dr. Onan Kanabite in the background.

666
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,480
Napoleon Hill was kind of like

667
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:57,860
the president of the United States,

668
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,480
the previous Dale Carnegie.

669
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,020
But you probably don't remember Dale Carnegie.

670
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,340
He was the president of the United States.

671
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:33,340


672
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,680
I can't live by myself anymore.

673
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,680
I need some help from my big brother.

674
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,640
He's always listening,

675
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,220
and he's awful good at watching me,

676
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,400
and I think he'll watch me forever.

677
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,380
I don't want to be myself anymore.

678
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,600
I don't want to be someone else.

679
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,760
Honestly,

680
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,740
I will kill myself.

681
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:25,060
I can promise you a day.

682
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,540
I will be myself.

683
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,940
Rubik's Pube did that.

684
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,840
I'll say that band name again.

685
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,300
Rubik's Pube.

686
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,580
Rubik's Pube did that.

687
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,060
And X Day Drillers will be glad to hear

688
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,600
that that's the unthinkably talented

689
00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:01,320
Vanessa Marciano and Lord Rock God recording in the Fedcom's basement studio.

690
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,440
And I'll bet somehow Reverend Sinfaltimus Ex Mortis is involved.

691
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:15,040
And now, yet another band you've never heard called After Hours.

692
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,340
There are no words to describe the meaning of life.

693
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,380
Just close your eyes and you can feel it, you'll feel it inside.

694
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,740
There are no words to describe the meaning of life.

695
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,680
Just close your eyes and you can feel it, you'll feel it inside.

696
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:37,140
There are no words to describe the meaning of life.

697
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,120
Just close your eyes and you can feel it, you'll feel it inside.

698
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,620
There are no words to describe the meaning of life.

699
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,740
Just close your eyes and you can feel it, you'll feel it inside.

700
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,320
Number four.

701
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,320


702
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,320


703
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,320


704
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,320


705
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:54,020
There are no words to describe the meaning of life

706
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,020
Just close your eyes and you can feel it, you'll feel it inside

707
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:02,460
There are no words to describe the meaning of life

708
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,600
Just close your eyes and you can feel it, feel it inside

709
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,940
There are no words to describe the meaning of life

710
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:15,040
Just close your eyes and you can feel it, feel it inside

711
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,340
There are no words to describe the meaning of life

712
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,400
Just close your eyes and you can feel it, feel it inside

713
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,340
There are no words to describe the meaning of life

714
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,640
Just close your eyes and you can feel it, feel it inside

715
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,160
There are no words to describe the meaning of life

716
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:02,260
Just close your eyes and you can feel it, feel it inside

717
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,920
There are no words to describe the meaning of life

718
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,140
There are no words to describe the meaning

719
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,380
There are no words to describe the feeling

720
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,460
There are no words to describe the feeling

721
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,740
There are no words to describe,

722
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,280
the feeling's bleeding, the feeling is bleeding

723
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,660
The feeling's bleeding, the feeling is bleeding

724
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,500
The feeling is bleeding

725
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,580
The feeling is bleeding

726
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,320
After hours did that

727
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,480
It's a good thing

728
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,840
It's a band of the late boyfriend of our friend, Reverend Katana 007.

729
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,520
A guy named Bobby who died.

730
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,640
Katana 007 was in that band and is now in Subgenius Kids

731
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,820
with Reverend Negative and her pal Poochie, as heard here.

732
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,120
That's right. That's right. That's all I want.

733
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,040
It didn't mean anything.

734
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,960
Express yourself

735
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,000
You want me to express myself

736
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,320
That's right, girl. Express yourself.

737
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,140
That's all I want.

738
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,040
Okay.

739
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,960
You have the freedom

740
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,020
I have the freedom

741
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:15,120
To do whatever I like

742
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,140
I have the freedom

743
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,800
Say what I mean.

744
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,300
I have the freedom

745
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,360
I have the freedom

746
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,180
Sing what you want

747
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,140
connections

748
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,280
Bring it

749
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,640
Can you believe it

750
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,520
We're always going

751
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,820
and we've got something else to say

752
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:40,700
Your voice brings me freedom

753
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,700
I have been

754
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,800
in a certain state of mind

755
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,040
and hearing your voice is like freedom!

756
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,460
It just helps me rise above.

757
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,220
Thank you, Princess Gucci!

758
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,660
You are so welcome.

759
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:02,720
You also changed my state of mind for a better place as well.

760
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,900
Oh, Snippity Snap!

761
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,040
Snap, Snap, Snippity Snap!

762
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,820
Snap, Snap, Snippity Snap!

763
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:22,060
We got the freedom to do whatever we like.

764
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:33,740
We got the freedom to feel how we like.

765
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,320
That's right, girl.

766
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,100
Express yourself.

767
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,440
Expressing myself.

768
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,800
I love it! I love hearing you express yourself!

769
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,240
It's so new to me.

770
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,240
Tell it, girl.

771
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,660
I'm not really used to

772
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,660
having to figure out what I'm gonna do.

773
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,840
It's really fun

774
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,300
That's right.

775
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,780
to get it done.

776
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,420
I wanna rhyme.

777
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,020
I wanna rhyme.

778
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,480
Cuz I don't know why, but I do.

779
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,280
And you're a Disney character, and that's why I love you.

780
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,580
I only surround myself with Disney characters, by the way.

781
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,700
It just happens to be a thing.

782
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,360
Like, you know, I never worked at Disney.

783
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,600
Bobby, for instance, Bobby Clark, he never worked at Disney.

784
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,320
No.

785
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:40,280
However, we would be out and about, and people would approach us and be like,

786
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,360
Did you guys work at Disney?

787
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,220
Well, that's the best compliment in the world, don't you think?

788
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:47,780
I know, right?

789
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,500
Like, what?

790
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,720
Uh, yeah, no.

791
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,820
You're feeling joy just being around me.

792
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,280
Oh my god!

793
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,320
That's right!

794
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,340
That's how it is.

795
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,180
I surround myself, I would love to surround myself all the time.

796
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,380
With Disney characters.

797
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:04,840
With Disney characters.

798
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,980
The last job that I had, there was actually, like, five people.

799
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,400
Who worked at Disney.

800
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,560
And they came to my job!

801
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:14,820
Wow!

802
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:15,700
I know!

803
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,360
It was a good time.

804
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,060
It was a good time.

805
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:18,920
Yeah!

806
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,680
Like, I surround myself with characters at all times.

807
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,140
And I think you do, too!

808
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,100
I do!

809
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,300
I do, I do!

810
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,020
And I want to meet your characters!

811
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,780
I've never thought of myself as a character, but I just love having fun.

812
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,160
That's what's up.

813
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,760
And loving myself.

814
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,940
You just have to be yourself.

815
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,600
That's it.

816
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,840
That's what's up.

817
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:41,980
That's...

818
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,300
That's...

819
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,640
That's ******!

820
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,120
Time was a go-getter.

821
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,280
A hustler.

822
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,960
Nothing was good enough that it couldn't be.

823
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:18,000
get better. The only problem was that he could only focus on the things directly in front

824
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:29,040
of him. Add distance and you subtract detail from Tom's vision of the world. Yet he always

825
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:41,080
saw the near future in his mind. Thar sighted Huck was his unlikely opposite best friend,

826
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:52,200
at least as the photos would suggest. Huck would survive in the off-season on unemployment

827
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,640
until he was called back to interrupt his favorite sleep pattern.

828
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:08,200
Tom created his own underground publishing company and submitted to other magazines as

829
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:20,100
time permitted in any season. Always invited for inclusion, Huck rarely made an impressive

830
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:26,580
deadline and often underperformed under extreme nostril flaring pressure.

831
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,240
Consulate, borrowing, and

832
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,660
recalling the good Mas.

833
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,240
Thank you.

834
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,520
P.A.

835
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,020
INSTITUTE

836
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:06,420
He recruited his friend Huck, who was again on layoff vacation and had a roller and paint tray

837
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:11,620
and all the other elements he purchased from the local Paquitans art store

838
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:18,220
at an incredible savings to dispense of this tedious chore.

839
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:28,600
Huck arrived promptly on time with brushes and tubes of paint.

840
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:39,020
Let's make a mural, he said with his got nothing to do but think about such things and what the heck, why not grin?

841
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:48,200
Tom slumped as Huck began scraping the old peeling paint from the door.

842
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,520
Tom began to climb the fence to create a smooth canvas.

843
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:03,000
Okay, said Tom, and attacked the fence with simple landscape skies and trees and grass.

844
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,220
Not a landscape painter.

845
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:13,980
Tom looks at his fingers, full of paint, myriad colors dripping onto his shoes.

846
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,020
He swings at a gnat.

847
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:22,380
He slaps his fingers and flings paint from his fingers directly into Huck's eyes.

848
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:31,720
Huck, being farsighted, couldn't give a fuck either way and laughed heartily.

849
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,340
I'm going for a drink, Tom declares.

850
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,720
Finish that, will ya?

851
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,100
Tom drank.

852
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:56,740
Well past the time the street lights came on and left only after repeated attempts to coax the mermaid pole dancer to go fishing with him.

853
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:05,780
He stumbled home to find all he'd done on the fence had been obliterated.

854
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:15,100
Huck had blown over all his work with elaborate, meticulous detail of his own design,

855
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:22,180
riddled with obviously so-called hidden faces, bodies, and hands.

856
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:31,460
The parents could not see this psychedelic menagerie in the morning, he thought.

857
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:39,900
With his impaired vision, he could barely focus on it now, but what about daylight?

858
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,080
Being the needy, he was still trying to find a way to get out of the way.

859
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:52,060
A neat clean-up freak, Huck had whisked away all the paint and art utensils.

860
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:02,820
Improvising, Tom resorts to the tools he always has at his disposal.

861
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:09,560
He unzipped, and walking down the length of the fence,

862
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:15,020
pissed the longest determined most important piss he's ever pissed.

863
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:15,060


864
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:27,000
The acidic, vitamin-soaked urine takes its toll as colors mingle and run down the fence into the flower bed.

865
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:38,720
Then he growled, he hacked, he snorted and sniffed, and he rolled his eyes until he had enough phlegm to make a substantial hit.

866
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,180
He pauses.

867
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,040
And he stops.

868
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,040


869
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,640
He thinks, this sucks, he thinks.

870
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,480
It's a fucking fence.

871
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:53,640
We should have paintings in the goddamn museum.

872
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:08,040
His cheeks puffing and turning blue, tongue stirring the mixture, he licks the hot, tooey launch dead center.

873
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:15,020
As it travels down the length of the fence, it resembles a painting of a man.

874
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:21,380
It's a hazel-colored tie you might buy your dad from a 1967 Sears catalog.

875
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:39,760
Having forgotten his keys again, Tom does the familiar climb up to the roof into his second-story bedroom and promptly falls asleep on the floor next to his bed.

876
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,000
He's still sleeping.

877
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,000


878
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,000


879
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,340
He's awakened in the morning by his parents' silhouette in the doorway, jingling his house keys.

880
00:49:53,500 --> 00:50:00,000
Great job, son, says Dad, laying a twenty-dollar bill on the dresser.

881
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:06,640
Excellent version of Monet's water lilies, but a few of them are dripping.

882
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:14,900
Artistic license, Tom says as he rolls over.

883
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:14,980


884
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:14,980


885
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:14,980


886
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,740
He's never pulling the rug over his own eyes.

887
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,580
Thank you, Sheridan.

888
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:30,520
Sheridan's collections of stories, called Didn't See That Coming, had certain rules.

889
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,940
For instance, every story had to involve a nearsighted main character and a farsighted one.

890
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,980
And a gnat had to be mentioned.

891
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,240
And there had to be product placement.

892
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,820
Ahem.

893
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:43,620
Ahem.

894
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:48,120
This Sheridan individual is in Cleveland, but we never met.

895
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,780
I suspect he might be a real weirdo.

896
00:50:53,340 --> 00:51:00,060
But now, here is another band you've never heard of, except here, called Thunk!

897
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,380
On both ends, like in Spanish.

898
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:10,320
This is from 1994, yet it might as well be tomorrow's headlines.

899
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,040
I thought, well I guess he is going to Matt친's затем.

900
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:30,100
Thank you for all the right words for the WMSN.

901
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:30,140
Now, there are a few Doug spicy again and I'll have to try.

902
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,140


903
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,080
This one comes from Herimi Ghobain!

904
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:31,460
Therolling He spent 12 months in Tennessee.

905
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,660
And before I knew it, it's a noted hipster porn.

906
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:32,660


907
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:32,700
Hem machenga hui!

908
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:43,600
The

909
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:43,600


910
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:43,600


911
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,740
When you were young and you'd hear a song

912
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,840
You'd cry in your beer with your long face on

913
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,800
You'd try to sing along but you couldn't hold a tune

914
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,780
You couldn't do it right and that wouldn't do

915
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,480
You tried your luck at heart, you settled on clean

916
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:23,140
So even early on you liked symmetry

917
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,360
But the woman that you loved didn't think you could

918
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,440
So you straightened your beret and walked away for good

919
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,180
Dazzled by the stage, Samuel Beckett came next

920
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:55,300
But you made a mistake, you choreographed the text

921
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,940
Though your acolytes, they didn't have a clue

922
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:02,960
The critics had the day with the director in you

923
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:08,240
You thought you could go through life as a dilettante

924
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,920
Thankfully you were wrong

925
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,480
Now you're big and rich

926
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,520
Real estate these days

927
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,180
That's where the money is anyway

928
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,800
The sweaty naked man at the gymnasium

929
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,800
Is struggling to release the child within

930
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,860
There's a handy telephone with a conference line

931
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:10,860
So he can work a deal while he's working on his thighs

932
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:13,580
And what goes up in the air is what goes down in the air

933
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:13,580


934
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:13,580


935
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,740
So you must come down

936
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:18,780
He's gonna tear your playhouse down

937
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,000
He owns a lion's share of the galleries

938
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,300
And there's no live bands, just canned music

939
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:31,680
You thought you could go through life as a dilettante

940
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,340
Thankfully you were wrong

941
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:37,500
Now you're big in real estate

942
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,960
These days

943
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,520
That's where the money is anyway

944
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,160
You're big in real estate

945
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,700
These days

946
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:50,300

Post 3

Final version of this blockbuster thought 10. La ondan

960
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:41,520
To Reveal

961
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,360
when they drop it.

962
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,900
And remember to say excuse me.

963
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,160
But if they don't have one,

964
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,660
you say fuck it and circle the shit.

965
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,640
Thank you, Sheridan, you weirdo.

966
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,900
Okay, let's try another band we never heard of

967
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,280
called T.T.N., pronounced Titan.

968
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,280
In this case, the good friend of mine in the band

969
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,180
is Dr. Argus Fox of Hypercube Labs

970
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,380
and the Time for the Show show.

971
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:21,520
An album called Standardization by T.T.N.

972
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,040
A song called Standardization.

973
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:07,200
A song called Standardization.

974
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,160
A song called Standardization.

975
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,260
A song called Standardization.

976
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,180
A song called Standardization.

977
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,200
A song called Standardization.

978
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,140
A song called Standardization.

979
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,620
A song called Standardization.

980
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:42,620


981
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:45,960
A song called Standardization.

982
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,740
A song called Standardization.

983
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,320
A song called Standardization.

984
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:49,560
A song called Standardization.

985
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:54,400
Thank you, Dr. Fox and T.T.N. and Hypercube Labs.

986
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:59,460
This is Hour of Slack, number 1794,

987
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,480
and we are all alive and well.

988
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,280
All of us who actually joined the Church of the Subgenius

989
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,580
formerly at some point.

990
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:10,040
I did, in June of 1998.

991
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:16,860
Philo Drummond and I made it possible for you to join in 1980.

992
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:23,000
You still can at subgenius.com.

997
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:53,660
Thanks the most.

998
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,140
Ah, there's the video card.

999
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:55,160
I think there's a video card.

1000
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:55,160


1001
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:55,160


1002
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,320
So, we have to stop at the where?

1003
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:58,340
I think we have to leave the down bar first.

1004
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:58,340


1005
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:01,600
Ah, it is where?

1006
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,400
There's the why.

1007
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,560
And the other subtitles.

1008
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,680
Thank you.

1009
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,560
Thank you.

1010
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:13,460
Thank you.

1011
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,360
Thank you.

1012
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:43,440
Thank you.

1013
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,680
Thank you.

1014
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,740
Thank you.

1015
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:54,820
Thank you.

1019
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:54,880
Thank you.

1020
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:00,080
That was the Psychoskeletons, a ditty called Confusing Development.

1021
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:03,800
Say friends,

1022
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,540
you're not going to be able to do it.

1023
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,620
You may be familiar with an old saying by Bob.

1024
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,520
Well, actually it's a saying about Bob from Book of the Subgenius.

1025
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:16,040
Bob is the gun and you are the bullet.

1026
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:23,980
Somebody came up with a very slightly different version of that for modern times.

1027
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:29,500
Elmer Fudd is the gun and you are the bullet.

1028
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,140
Oh, yes, and thank you for listening, dear friends.

1029
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,540
As always, check out Subgenius.com.

Help from you and for you.

1032
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:49,220
We'd love to help some of our stricken subgenius members,

1033
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,440
such as Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1034
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:58,220
And we'd like to help ourselves to a great big old hamburger.

1035
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,240
We won't just eat that hamburger.

1036
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,120
We'll eat the hell out of it.

1037
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,540
Actually, if you look at my YouTube channel,

1038
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:08,260
RevStang,

1039
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,280
one word,

1040
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,920
there is a hamburger eating video on there.

1041
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,760
But the important thing is, friends,

1042
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,460
subgeniuses all over the world

1043
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,700
could benefit from you.

1044
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,860
Strangely enough, can you imagine that?

1045
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,400
Weirdos you've never met, don't know anything about,

1046
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,240
they could actually be helped by you.

1047
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,520
And vice versa.

1048
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,060
They can help you.

1049
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:40,880
That's...

1050
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:45,580
Actually, that's not something we expected would happen

1051
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:52,520
when Dobbs told us to release the message in the late 70s.

1052
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,900
But it did happen.

1053
01:04:54,940 --> 01:05:01,340
It turned into a social thing where people help each other.

1054
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,500
So, check it out.

Help yourself.

Help Lonesome Cowboy Dave be less lonesome.

1058
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,640
Write him a letter.

01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,900
National Cynical,

1076
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,860
Puzzling Evidence,

1077
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,120
Bob's Black Time Funhouse,

1078
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,580
Fergan Fridays,

1079
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:37,520
and the Hour of Slack.

1080
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,760
Every Thursday at 11 a.m.

1081
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,340
Praise Bob.

1082
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:45,600
And praise Freethink Radio.

1083
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,920
Gee, I want to try Triology.

1084
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,420
All the kids are doing it, Mom.

1085
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:58,120
There's a Dobbs head in every bar.

1086
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:04,360
Yes, an embedded Dobbs head of soap inside a bar of translucent soap.

1087
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:04,560
I'm going to try it.

1088
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:04,560


1089
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:04,560


1090
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:04,560


1091
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:04,560


1092
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:04,560


1093
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,060
You can see Bob lurking inside.

1094
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,080
And it tells fortunes.

1095
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,960
As you rotate it swiftly under the water,

1096
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:16,840
lathering away the conspiracy smudge and other schmata.

1097
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,020
If the Dobbs head comes up at the end,

1098
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,980
in the true perfect pipe placement position,

1099
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:24,840
you'll have good luck all day.

1100
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,460
If it comes up the other way,

1101
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,740
20 more years of winter.

1102
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:32,200
That's TriologySoaps.com.

1103
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,420
It comes in every flavor and scent.

1104
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,760
That's not nonsense.

1105
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:40,320
It's almost every scent you can think of.

1106
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,180
And they all have funny names.

1107
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,500
Praise Bob.

1108
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,980
And praise TriologySoaps.com.

1109
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,000
Tri is spelled with an I.
