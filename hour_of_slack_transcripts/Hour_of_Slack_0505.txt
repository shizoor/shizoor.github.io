Stand by to play. Stand by to win.
And when the Loomis-Albert car pulls up with one million...
Stand by to play the show.
I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoy your show.
You know the more.
It helps and helps.
I want anything like it.
I want something like it.
Within the Great Pyramid, the secret chamber of the subgenius.
My God.
What light and steam come from the special effects department located below the pyramid?
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...
The subgenius.
Hour of Swatch.
It's the recombination of its own devices.
Its history is only itself.
It doesn't touch the ground.
It is simply an endless recycling of what it has already done.
A kind of tedious rehearsal.
With its own promises.
Ready?
Gotta go, guys.
Let's throw it.
Here we go.
In.
The redistribution of its own moves.
It's the recombination of its own devices.
Its history is only itself.
It doesn't touch the ground.
It is simply an endless recycling of what it has already done.
A kind of tedious rehearsal of its own promises.
Hey.
Hey.
What is this?
What is...
What the hell?
Just catching up.
What am I supposed to do?
What the hell is going on, Jimmy?
The hell is going on.

What's going on, Jamie?
Jamie, what's the scale here?
They're robbing him.
Tell me what to do.
Do them out, you idiot.
What?
Okay, dopamine.
Hit him up.
Who the hell is this?
This is Puzzle Hammer.
What do you mean?
This is my show.
Oh, Rose.
There you go.
See, this is Puzzle Hammer.
He gets her blush.
Oh, thanks.
This place is dope.
That's fine.
I'll give you a good time to show.
I can't.
I can't.
We have to do it now.
Good evening.
Howdy.
No bright lights for the go-on that protects us at any time.
It's set up for the event.
Out.
There we go.
Look, it's all clear now.
We shut off the puzzling evidence KPFA and Berkeley Dr. Howell show.
And now it's just the one show.
The one wacky show.
Yes, we're back again with some wacky fun and games and many, many cassettes to spin.
And CD discs and all like that.
And yeah, I'm going to go back to a routine that we were playing at the end of the last show,
which for you was a week ago.
But for me, it was only 20 minutes ago.
So this is what we call the cheapest form of time control.
Patented subgenius flavored time control, whereby I am able to produce.
I have actually already produced two and one eighth hours.
Hours of slack in only about one hour and 45 minutes.
I'm going to put I'm trying for is four shows in three hours.
Okay.
So we'll what?
Me.
But I've been feeling very nervous lately.
I don't want to talk about it right now.
I take these long walks in order to relieve myself of my brain problems.
It appears that during one of these walks, I heard screams.
I mean, maybe from within sight the wall.
It was a good thing that I happened to have my spade in my my pickaxe in my my wheelbarrow of submit handy.
So I was able to unearth her, be able to bring her back into the land of the living.
So to speak.
Even as the wind blows, I think I'm getting a slight chill.
Perhaps I should be still here in the cellar so that she does not catch cold.
I do this.
After all, she is rather naked.
It appears that someone.
Has removed her clothes.
I do have a spare setback in my apartment, which I believe to be her side.
However, I could be so uncertain.
I believe that it looks like someone has been pretending that she was still alive the past five years.
Why, yes, they continue to to to stroke and show such love and affection to her body.
As if they were setting her up in front of the television and the.
In the easy chairs, if she were watching TV with the rest of the family.
Certainly a jury cannot convict such a man who obviously was in love with this girl.
She will replace the oven warmed cantaloupe.
Surely a jury would say that the defendant was mad.
Remember, we are in America, the land in which mad people are never punished.
Why, when I moved here, that was one of the first things I learned.
Some say that is why I moved here.
So that.
I can help prevent these crimes from occurring in my country.
I have experienced many such instances.
Why, I have advanced degrees in mental illness.
In fact, I've spent a large portion of my time studying studying the mental ill in institutions.
I have even pretended to be mentally ill so that they would place me in these institutions and I can live beside these disturbed individuals and learn from their sinister and somewhat distorted views of life.
Some thought what I did was very courageous that I would give up so many years of my life to live among these mentally ill.
Shut up little voices, shut up!
The

This can't be happening
This can't be happening
I think I took too much
It's no video
Psychotic and abnormal
It's beyond Satanism
It's beyond
The long
Unreleased
One pill to imagine
I thought I was talking to God
And I looked up and it was
A police car
A minute ago
I was in seventh grade
Trying marijuana
For the first time
And now
Oh
What happened
A living cow
A living cow
With more free pills
What have I done
And now
And now
And now
Crimes of the conspiracy
Are truly slimy
And chill out there
Ah
I've been living as a subgenius
As long as I can remember
And I think now
I just like to
Nothing
He's melting in his sleep
And he's going into the gene pool
Once again
Dave just dilutes back into the slime
From whence he first crawled
Eighty billion years ago
To become a mighty overman
From the slime of his own genes
A cosmic pudding created by Dave's own schmutz
Dave has taken the ultimate trip
He has gone back to his home town
To his own spermatozoa
And then evolved forward into future man
A brain with two small appendages hanging from them
How am I going to get around like this
I hope this is still a dream
Man this is ugly as hell
That's right it's only a dream Dave
Yeah this is only a dream
There's no possible way I can be like a brain with two tiny legs

And two little dangly things hanging from it
Yeah you'll wake up any minute
It's just a dream don't worry about it
You'll be waking up any minute
Can you believe that idiot
Little voices
Little voices don't usually talk to me while I'm dreaming
I think little I must now I must still be awake
Then maybe I have melted into gene pool
I never can tell what's really going on
Going on
Going on
Going on
Going on
Going on
Going on
Going on
I'm huge and I'm all stinky
At most I think I'm stinky though I didn't have a nose to breathe with
And you spilled your pudding
I am the pudding
Oh god no
The pudding
Yeah man
Yeah man
Get this shit up


Ha ha
You're stoned out of your mind, man.
I'm just kidding.
Yeah!
All right, man!
That was cool, man!
Got anything to eat, man?
Road.
Yeah, check it out!
Twist one up, man.
Let's get wasted.
Sounds like a good idea, man.
I'm trying to come back a little bit anyway.
Here, man.
I have a step on the magic list.
Go dig it.
Fuck it up.
Seems like all we ever do is get stoned and watch the show.
Too many店.
Ah!

Does it have any little throat clusters I can chew on?
Man, I'm still hungry.
Four.
Four bucks.
Loaded.
Eight forty-four.
Oh, wanko, wanko.
Now we're all fat.
Power months.
I love growth, man.
Yeah.
Get ready, man, let's party.
Six one seven.
Lick bone.
Mathan, my mind, man.
I think you gotta know this man.
Yeah, big hit with a bullet.
Oh!
Hey, where have you guys been, man?
We're starving.
We were boobies, man.
Well, we wouldn't have been.
You ate half of them, man.
Oh!
Good.
Oh, my gosh.
Good job.

Good job.
I'm the one who called and said I was in the portal.
You told me I left you behind and you were in the future.
Now let's stop talking about people behind in the future or the past.
I saw a bunch of mushrooms floating around with me.
Right.
Astonishing the way the callers always seem to be wandering.
Yeah, I'm here, Mr. President.
Yes, sir. It was just some flowers.
They were sitting down here at the station.
Oh, Lord.
I'm here.
What were they?
Well, there's one flower, actually.
Just one big bud.
Some incredible plants from another world.
And you tore it up, did you?
Yes, sir, I did.
I tore it up into little pieces and I threw it all over the place.
What'd you do?
I said I tore it up into little pieces and threw it all over the place down at the station.
These vegetable organisms count as seeds or seed rods.
Okay, well, let's get past that for a second.
As you know, I was her husband's vice president.
Yes, sir, I know that.
And frankly, I owe a lot to the Carlisle.
She seconded my nomination.
Yes, sir.
I think you know that, too.
I understand that.
So why don't we all try to get along a little better over there in Ohio?
Doug, what do you say?
Okay, thank you, sir.
Yes, sir, I will.
I'll tell you myself.
One day she calls me, says she can't live without you.
Next day she's calling almost in tears.
So, you know, maybe you two have some kind of sicko thing going on.
No, sir.
No, sir, we don't.
We're just, we're fine down here.
You see this, Doug?
Any more phone calls from her, you're gonna be guarding my dog.
You understand what I'm saying?
Yes, sir.
So I've probably got the most important job in the world.
Yes, sir.
There's a cue.
What do you say?
You gonna help me out on this one?
Yes, sir.
That's fine.
Yes, sir.
Thanks, Doug.
That's what I wanted to hear.
You have yourself a nice evening, son.
All right, thanks, sir.
Bye.
Bye, Mr. President.
Now, the chief executive is a little bit confused there.
It's actually the morning, not the evening.
But aside from that...
He's on Air Force One.
I'm behind his platform 100% as he travels over the international dateline backwards
in Air Force One, otherwise known in military lingo as huevos rancheros.
Hey, where'd my homie go, dude?
Well, your home, see, now in the new age, you have to find your home.

It moves, and you don't.
It's where you are.
You got a Concord.
I seem to have lost you.
I can't take it.
Concord, for God's sake.
Okay, check home page, yeah.
And yes, Reverend Hale's on the Concord.
I'm wondering how old you people are.
Me too.
How old do you think we are?
How old are you?
What difference does it make?
35.
Dude, okay, I'm sorry.
That's the number I get all the time.
Uh-oh.
Sorry.
Oh, you startled that young caller there with that revelation.
No, that's all right.
But, you know, we are older than these callers can imagine.
Give me that crazy dude.
I'm not crazy.

Crazy dude?
Oh, I guess he must mean me, dear friends.
Well, who, what, and what, what are you?
What have we been listening to, dear friends?
Well, of course, that just then was some of the puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell show,
a recent one for once, on KPFA in Berkeley.
You know, the wind's been telling stories that that show's gonna get canceled too because
of stationery.
And the station has gone pink.
Oh, pardon me.
I didn't mean to pop the P's on this pathetic microphone.
Yes, the puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell.
And before that, OBE, the Fantabulous Band OBE Outband Experience with their sort of
mix called Groat Clusters.
It's a special bong fest mix off of the main one.
It's a vocals CD, which is a, uh, proceeds from the sale of this CD will benefit the
drive to end cannabis prohibition in Maine.
Well, when they gonna start talking about frop prohibition, man?
How about the, the free frop campaign?
Um, anyway, I'm gonna play some more off of that CD later, cause it's got some, some nifty
stuff.
And of course, before that, the, the, um, well, we went into the mind of Lonesome Cowboy
Dave, uh, on WCSB ESO radio in Cleveland, uh, Einstein Secret Orchestra.
This show has taken on sort of a mentally ill drug brain damaged aspect this time.
I never, I, sometimes I know where a show is heading to and other times it just, the
subject matter takes over.
And, um, and what led into this particular one was, uh, Father Joe Mama.
It's Saint Jane or Hypercleves on, uh, Suzie the Flusie's show, WREK, Bob's Slack Time
Funhouse, uh, talking about the mentally ill and how they went to live among the mentally
ill so that they could discover them better.
I certainly understand exactly what they're talking about because it, I, I mean, after
all, would a crazy man be capable of doing a show such as this one, eh?
My God.
Look at the destruction that has been wreaked upon this, this, this innocent family.
Who would even think of doing such a thing?
Oh, oh, stand back.
This garage door opener is connected to 100 tons of TNT and my grasp on sanity is so feeble
I just might press it.
Get back, Robin.
I'm sorry.


It's the, the Riddler.
There's only one mind that could be so shaky as to release this man from prison.
I remember.
Surprise!
It's the Joker.
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Hey, I'll do the jokes around here, Jane.
You're getting on my nerves.
Almost as bad as that Batman character.
If I can just reach my utility belt, Robin.
I believe there's an anti-aircraft gun.

I believe there's an anti-jigsaw corrosion device that possibly can save us.
Maybe we could call Alfred and he could come on the ALF cycle.
Just a few inches further, Robin.
I think I've almost pressed the Bat communicator that can reach communication with the Bat
computer that can in fact achieve communication with the ALF cycle.
If I can just...
Oh, man.
That was the closest I could get.
I haven't had the slightest call yet.
For a moment there, I have to admit, I was scared.
I was never worried for a moment, Robin.
How's that?
Haven't you ever noticed how we always manage to elude the vicious ensnarements of our underhanded opponents?
Don't you know why?
Because we're smarter than they are.
I prefer to think it's because we're pure of heart.
If you read your science book, Robin, you'll remember that a jigsaw blade has about 27 gears inside the mechanism.
It was a simple matter to nullify, to...
I had 12 of those gears with the device in my utility belt.
We had precisely...
Collie, you bet me.
Next time I'll have to study a little harder.
We had precisely 2.5 seconds.
I happened to be champion jigsaw cutter alongside by champion chip marble shooter and Marlboro smoker, I might add.
Okay, now we got existentialist superheroes.
Now let's go after that child molester that was on earlier in the show.
Why, you two boys.


Always hither-tither and yawn.
Well, Aunt Harriet, Dick and I were just heading down to the pond for a little skinny dipping, but we'll be right back.
Oh, lookie. It's the bat signal.
Damn. Always at the most inopportune moments.
Very well, Aunt Harriet. We'll be on our way.
I'll be right behind you, Dick.
On the bat pole.
And you've been listening to the width and wisdom of Jane or Hypercleets and Father Joe Mama, those two radio clowns of yesteryear.
We all remember sitting around the old Victrola radios of the past, listening to that dynamically wacky duo.
We did have one caller wanted to know...
Someone just called to ask about your...
Your website on the internet.
Okay, this is the one factual thing I'm gonna say.
You better have your pencil ready, or if you don't have the pencil ready, find something sharp and carve it in your arm.
The subgenius worldwide website, the largest and most complex state-of-the-art website project in the history of the internet, which is actually a pretty short history, thank God.
And we wanted to get this done quick, because we have a feeling it won't last much longer.
I'm gonna give that address.
It's one of those http:// type addresses, okay?
And here it is.
Sunsite.unk.edu slash subgenius.
I'll say that again and I'll spell it out.
S-U-N-S-I-T-E period U-N-C period E-D-U slash subgenius in all small letters.
S-U-B-G-E-N-I-U-S.
That is all.
And have a nice day.
Love.

If we're a Zappa copy band, then what the hell are you?
With metal bands galore, we could use a thousand more.
But they don't really sound alike now today.
We're not just another Zappa copy band.
They don't really sound alike now today.
We're not just another Zappa copy band.

Now that shut them up like clams.
Well, I guess the world wasn't these callers oysters.
Someone talking about Rush Limbaugh?
Yeah, Rush Limbaugh.
Yeah.
Hey, stop laughing.
We can send a scary raise to the speaker right into your heads over there.
Forever to wander in limitless limbo.
You think it's funny?
This is a show.
You like his pizza commercial?
Stop laughing.
It's not funny.
These people died.
They died while performing their duty.
That's something you whippersnappers can't understand.
By God, what's the matter with this generation?
Who's going to fight the next war?
Okay, that's your cue.
What's wrong with generation?
Hey, this is Consumer Products.
How's it going?
How you doing, man?
I'm wondering if the subgenius dating game has started.
Because I'm looking for a tank boy.
Is that like radioactive carbon dating?
Well, what are you looking for?
A tank boy.
A tank boy?
That can hijack a fucking...
We'll hook you up with cat lady.
You've got to put white tape over the little bad...
And we're going to have to excise that portion of the show.
Then, um...
Well, okay, the word...
How's the tank?
Have I got a girl for you.
Maude Findlay.
63.
Yes, you'll really go for her.
Kindly send in your name and your application with the usual fee.
And I will put Ms. Findlay in charge of your personal account.
Thank you.
Those promised sex with it.
Fungus, fungus.
Oh, it's a great promise.
Intergalactic beige.
And a singing contract on Alpha Centauri.
It's all good.
Not.
Fungus.
Sex.
That awaits you, Dave.
Sex.
Fungus.
Sex.
Fungus.
Sex.
Fungus.
Fungus.
Sex.
Sex.





Hi, little girl.
What's your name?
Oh.
Oh.
Fanny Fungus.
What's yours?
Gerald Fungus.
You're good looking.
So are you, babe.
I was wondering if you'd like to go out and inspect some toenails?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

Oh!
That's so good.
Lots of fun.
Have you ever had sex with an elder god?
Why, yes, I have, but mostly in my dreams.
Have you ever tasted a real alien shmeg and pie?
Yes.
I'm among the privileged few.
Let's just go over to the bar and have some sushi,
and then maybe we can go and watch a movie later.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll feel very worried.
I'm worried a lot.
Okay.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Okay.
I hope this tumor is benign.
I hope there's nothing wrong with my arm
and where the cockroach is respiting.
See, I had a dream I had fungal sex
with this ultimate fungus babe.
Maybe.
Maybe I did, and now I'm dreaming again.
Yeah, the dream, it's mixed in now.
You're not hardly there.
It's like the world of No Layer, Elvis,
and what the heck it was.
I stick my hand right through you.
Oh, yeah.
Lamb, lamb, lemon, lemon flavored rum,
Stanislaus lamb, that's right.
You're from the whiskey planet.
You want to torsecute me and persecute me.
It's because we love you, Dave.
Even a man who is pure at heart and says his prayers by night
may become a subgenius when wolfbane blooms
and the autumn moon is bright.
Hey, little voice, I ain't never been pure in my life.
If there's a chance of me having hot sex with a fungus,
you know I'm going for it.
Well, it is a fungus, but it feels almost like a regular woman.
It does feel like a regular woman.
Or whatever.
Well, it's been so long since I've felt a regular woman.
I think this should pass for a regular woman,
except for these little suction cup patches around the bottom.
I wonder what these things do.
Oh, wow.
Do you like that?
Yes, I do.
Well, some of this fungus is now on my hands, though.
It's just...
It's just...
It's just...
It's just...
It doesn't do anything to me.
It doesn't do anything to me.
It doesn't do anything to me.
You'll have to wait and see, Dave.
I wish I could get something good to eat around here.
Eat some of this slack chive, Dave.
You can sort of make out on the surface of me the pattern in the fungus that says,
Drink me.
Hello, everybody.
Hello, everybody.
Eat my red crawfish there, Dave.
Crawfish? Oh yeah, I know about them. I know about them crawfish.
Them Cajun Prairie Squid Gumbo recipes.
Was that what you wanted to hear about? The Cajun Prairie Squid Gumbo recipe?
Well, you know, this is, in Crescent City, this is the number one program for cooking and good eating right here.
And today on the program, you know, what a big town this is for saints and everything like that.
Everybody got their own patron saint.
And tonight, our patron saint is J.R. Bob Dobbs.
And we got a man in the cloth hood as he's going to teach us how to make, what is it again?
It's Prairie Squid.
Prairie Squid Gumbo.
This is a riverboat special, which I'm happy taught me.
How do you make Prairie Squid out of the Mississippi Delta Prairie Squid?
Well, that sounds real delicious.
So we're going to start off.
First up, you're going to butter this.
I mean, you're going to flour this real good, right?
You're going to take...
Well, tell us about the Prairie Squid.
Well, first you have to go out in your canoe in the swamp and gig you some squid, boy.
Now...
You got to go out with your squid gigger and, you know, you can dig up some crawdads and mud bugs and things.
And you gig them into your sack along with them prairie squid.
But you get your prairie squid first.
Fill up that sack with prairie squid, boy.
Now, if we were to go out to Bayou St. John or maybe, like, we'll go up to Lake Ponch, say, for instance.
And you could just go off anywhere or maybe by the river and just get these prairie squids.
Anything.
Anywhere.
I've never seen them before.
You know...
Well, the Mississippi Delta squid is very profligate in these parts.
The only thing you got to remember is the Mississippi Delta squid has a poisonous egg sack.
Oh, you got to take that out for sure.
You got to remove that.
Yeah.
Now, as you see here, we take this knife and we carefully slit the lip off the squid.
Yeah.
Now, that looks like it might be a complicated...
My friend, Thievado...
Well, you have to love the squid while you excise the poisonous egg sack and gallbladder.
Well, that sounds like a very, very exciting experience.
You actually making love to the squid while you're excising the...
As you see, the squid is still alive.
We clip the beak and as we say, suck the head.
Just like a mud bug.
Just like a mud bug.
Now, you notice as I work the squid over, as I have my way with it, so to speak, you'll
notice that we try to shave the squid.
Yeah, I noticed you did.
You did shave it down real tight.
Now, there's hardly no hair left on the squid at all.
The diners do not want to fight.
They find a bunch of curly hairs all over their prairie squid when they sit down for
an expensive meal.
No, drowning in hot sauce ain't going to help that night at all.
No.
So anyway, you take that squid.
Now, you've got that squid has been well loved and you've got the special smegma sauce in
there.
Now, you take that live squid and you flop that squid on the hottest pan in the kitchen.
Because you want to cook that adrenaline, you know, to get that good adrenochrome.
Yeah, you get that in there, you're going to get a hell of a rush out of that, I think.
And then you take that fillet.
You take that fillet de squid.
Yeah.
And you dunk it in hot sauce.
You just literally dunk the whole thing right in there.
Just dunk it.
I noticed there a little taste of filet gumbo in there.
Did you mix in a little bit while you were...
Oh, yeah.
You always take your blackened fish, blackened red fish special peppers and...
Your Popeye smoked sandwich there you put on the bottom of it.
And then you take your grandma's face and you slap it on that loaf of bread and you've
got you a fine, grand filet.
And then you take your grandma's face sandwich and a bowl full of steaming hot prairie squid
gumbo.
Yeah.
You better talk about it.
Well, this has been Thibodeau Boudreau with the Reverend Ivey and the Reverend Ivey.



















And I ended up staying talking about Prairie Squid and cooking them right.
And I guess, well, I only got one excuse and one alibi.
I was home watching soaps with my auntie.
Bye, y'all.
We'll see you Saturday night at Peabody's Down Under, that amazing, trendy disco club
where you too can experience the swa-ka-ba-la!
I'll see you then.
See you.
Bye, y'all.

Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.

Bye.

where the imagination goes beyond all barriers.
¶¶
You dig the excitement, baby?
It stimulates me.
Then don't talk.
Swing, swing.

A complex moral standard sometimes causes its own rejects.
Bans, taboos, hypocrisies on sex are overthrown by some.
And they turn on the same society that spawned them.
Raise bar.
The world's deepest, most enjoyable feeling.
Launching the head.
Stafanis.
Let's all be doing it.
Stafanis.
Stafanis.
Let's all launch the head.
Let's go.
You first.
Oh, yes.
Nothing feels quite so good as that.
¶¶
Oh, I love a good head-launching, don't you?
Boy, I'm sweating like a whore in church.
I hope all of you are launching some heads out there yourself.
Bob knows Arnold Palmer's head is big enough to go around.
But I've got a special treat here for you dues-paying subgeniuses out there.
And I know who you are.
I have right here in my hot little hands a church mailing list for the entire Southeast.
And while our next election throbs on the turntable, I'm going to be rubbing it all over my body.
And, oh, you're going to feel it, seekers, no matter what sexual orientation you think you are.
Even if you're not listening to the show.
I just hope you're not operating any heavy machinery.
Oh, so let's let Charo, the eternal goddess of coochie-coochie, lead us in this devotional debauch.
Oh, here we go.
Oh, yes, yes.
There's yards and yards of you here.
Oh, heads up, seekers.
Here comes a wave of Bob sex slack.
Oh, I'm pulling the subgenius train on the entire South.
Oh, I got a lot of Bob and Connie and me.
But there's plenty of room for you, too.
There are 117 subgeniuses in Georgia alone.
This land is rich in mutants.
I'm hitting the Atlanta.
I'm hitting the area first.
Ha-ha!
Oh, take this!
Oh!
Oh, whoo!
Sean Taylor of Avondale Estates.
Whoo!
Brother Ramsey, Truett.
Oh, the young technocrats of Marietta.
Ah!
Todd Canziani and the evil lymph node contingent.
Take this!
Oh, that's...
Oh, this state of the paper cuts is so good.
Oh, man.
I don't know.
Brother, you're in Harvard.
I don't know, friends, if I can handle listening to Suzie the floozy get off with the entire
subgenius mailing list.
I mean, you can't imagine how horrible that seems to me.
I had to print that mailing list out, friends.
Oh, it's a scary situation.
Oh, but I certainly should.
I suppose.
Give the subgenius P.O.
box because I know at this point you're like going, well, I want my name on that piece
of paper that's rubbing all over that Suzie the floozy's body.
Now, I've seen pictures of that Suzie and unlike most of the lovely voices one hears
on the radio, there's actually a fairly nice thing there to back it up, you might say.
So, you want to get on that mailing list?
Well, here's how.
Well, this ain't exactly how.
You can find out how if you write for the free information.
And that free information, wait a minute, that is not P.O.
box given music right there.
Friends, this has been an unusually, seems like sort of a sex, drugs, and rock and roll
sort of a show this time.
Let's put in some Cleave.
This is probably going to be real smooth, be Brother Cleave.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, that's more like it, dear friends.
You just write to Bub and ask for that free information from Bub at post office box 140306.
That's box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.
Bet you couldn't tell by my accent, could you?
And the zip.
The zip.
I think about Susie and that zip.
A 75214.
Oh, yeah.
And I think we gave all the, I think probably not the first time we gave that address on
this particular show.
But that means I can do whatever, now that I've done that, I can play whatever I want.
Why don't I, do you have any requests?
Well, I'm waiting.
I'm waiting.



I'm waiting.
I'm waiting.
Oh, not to forget the credits, dear friends.
That long sex barrage there was of course put together by Reverend, actually it was
re-cut by me, but it was first put together by Rev. Susie the Floozy there at WREK in Atlanta.
Praise WREK.
That's the way you do it, right.
And pardon me, I don't know what this guy's singing about in the background.
And before that, some of that Einstein Secret Orchestra radio,
ESO radio from WCSB Cleveland, starring Alonzo Cowboy Dave
and Mighty Mixin' Chaz.
Michelle George on violin.
Jensen Adelman on percussion.
Ivan Stang talking his mouth off.
Todd Joel on bassoon.
Lisa talking her mouth off.
Dan Flink started talking his mouth off.
Mark playing bass and Keith playing.
Oh, there's a guitar over there.
My name's Chaz.
I do the zeroing.
I play the keyboard here.
We'll see you all Thursday night, okay?
Don't play.
Hey, now.
Hey, now.
Hey, now.
Hey, now.
I go, I go all day.
Jag a motor, be now.
I know that.
Jag a motor, be now, day.
Feeling groovy.
Ah, well, boy, it's a thankless task.
But the bells continue to ring.
For in the midst of life, we are in death.
And death closes all.
Yeah, what the heck are you talking about anyway, Hal?
Well, I'm talking about the fact that everyone we know and love is dying.
And after 98, this is time for the subgeniuses.
All the time in the world.
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.
So what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to save y'all.
Oh, yeah.











And call my women's up here for just another moment.
Oh, yes.
I'd like to tell y'all that the doctor and his women have come a long way to preach for you tonight.
And one of the benefits that we're not going to reap from this is monetary.
And so I'm going to send my beautiful women's out to take up the collection.
Give till it hurts.
Give till it hurts.
Yes, brothers and sisters.
I don't mind using scantily clad women to take up the collection.
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.
Put them all to work.
Exploit them.
Now, don't be giving these pretty women any of that funny Bob money.
Because Bob don't want to hear it.
Oh, yes.
You must be relieved.
You must be relieved of the burdens.
The burden that wait in your wallet.
You must be relieved of the yoke of money.
Oh, yes.
Give till it hurts, brothers and sisters.
Give.
Because the sun's going down on the normals.
The sun is going down on the conspiracy.
But the sex goddesses are going down on the subgenius.
And the sex goddesses are going down on the subgenius.
Yes, brothers and sisters.
There shall be a squirtin's uncounted.
There shall be a oozing's unmeasured.
There shall be a lust of flame.
There'll be power.
Oh, yes.
Everybody wants a little power.
What do you want, brothers?
You want power.
You want power to destroy.
Power to fight the evils of the conspiracy.
Oh, yes.
And the only way.
You're going to get it.

You're going to get me this power.
The only way is to get down on your knees
and just say,
Bob, I believe in you, Bob.
Bob, I want you.
Bob, I trust you.
Bob, oh, come and do me up with your pipe, Bob.
Oh, yeah, Bob.
Come and put it in me.
Put it in me.
Put the slack in me.
Put the salvation in me.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
And that's where the tape
ran out, dear friends.
And not just the tape.
That was where
Dr. Legumes' span,
his little span
on this particular dimensional plane
ran out.
Actually, there is a tape, too,
of that, which we may get to next week.
But in the meantime...
Oh!
Oh!

Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!


Oh!



Oh!

















Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!











Oh!
Oh!

Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

Oh!


Oh!

Oh!






Go on.
If you need restoration,
What have you done?
In the privacy of your own home,
What have you done?
All the girls reveal
But you don't,

We've been having too much fun
And that ain't right
In the new world, right?
Going to drug war
Because that's what we've been calling it
A drug war
Because everyone's a commie in a drug war
And we've been running though our commies since before
So that's what we're calling it now
Well your high school chum went bump in the night
What has he done?
For twenty years under a prison light
What has he done?
Twined his teeth in Dallas and he wasn't white
Is that all that counts?
One year, one ounce in a drug war
Because that's what we've been calling it
A drug war
Because everyone's a commie in a drug war
And we've been running though our commies since before
Yeah, but everyone's a commie in a drug war
And everyone's a hoodlum in a drug war
And everyone's a hoodlum in a drug war
And everyone's a Jew in a drug war
I hope that they don't come for you in a drug war
I hope that they do not hook me in this drug war
Because that's what they're calling it now
Now
Oh no
Don't practice your goose- anar thought
Don't practice your goose
Oh, that was Drug War.
Drug War by Mr. Jones on the,
yeah, that Mr. Jones,
the same one Bob was talking about.
And that's on this album,
Main Vocals, dear friends.
I'm going to give you the address to write for free information.
Send an SASE or whatever,
because I don't know where you'd find this, actually.
You'd just have to write them.
It's a RR3B29,
oh God,
RR3 Box 29B3.
Uh-huh.
RR3 Box 29B3,
Ellsworth, Maine,
04605.
And that's reverse recordings,
is the CD called Main Vocals.
A strange sensation
has seasoned nation
Man, things are suddenly
peculiarly odd
Instead of thugs and thieves
breaking down our doors
We now deplore the federal forfeiture squads
Who have a blessing
from our Congress
To take a cut of everything they can steal
Here in the land of the free
And the home of the brave
Things have suddenly become unreal
So please, please, federal policeman
Please leave my private property alone
Please, please, federal policeman
You've got no jurisdiction here in my home
When you go breaking in through
Somebody's private front door
You do the Constitution bodily harm
So please, please, federal policeman,

Please leave my private property alone
They got new laws now
They're calling Loan équ�� drummer
Looks like our law enforcement grew a new arm
You make misrepresentation on your loan application
You might just have to forfeit the farm
The crazy fact is
It's retroactive
Which lets them loot your life historically
You may be dead in your grave
But if you did not behave
You might just fold up your family tree
So please, please, federal policeman
Don't you be seizing my poor daddy's farm
Please, please, federal policeman
Sometimes I wonder just whose side are you on
When you go breaking in through
Somebody's private front door
You do the Constitution bodily harm
So please, please, federal policeman
Don't you be seizing my poor daddy's farm
The ATF and the FBI
Just hired the KGB
The ADL's got a list for sale
But you're anti-Semitic if you call it a conspiracy
Now how could they call it a conspiracy?
My widowed mama, they stole her condo
On another federal seizure forfeiture spree
She made the tragic mistake of renting to some reprobate
They copped with drugs inside her property
They say her condo somehow is guilty
Now have you ever heard a condo confess?
Here in the land of the beat and the home of the slave
It's the tangled legal web of a mess
And I know it's a mess, but I'm not sure if it's a mess

So please, please, federal policeman
Don't you be stealing my poor mama's estate
Please, please, federal policeman
Now this is ten times worse than White Watergate
Before you bash right on through
Somebody's private front door
You better check that oath of office detail
So please, please, federal policeman
Don't you be stealing my poor mama's estate
Don't you be seizing my poor daddy's farm
Sometimes I wonder just whose side are you on
So please, please, federal policeman
Please leave my private property
