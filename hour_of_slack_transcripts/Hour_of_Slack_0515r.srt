1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
It seems to me that from the newspaper and magazine articles I've been reading,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,780
all the hype building up to the new Twin Peaks season,

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:12,240
that the critics and the regular TV people are just dying to see Twin Peaks die.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:20,700
They really want the mass TV audience to get fed up with that weird stuff.

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,680
It's so confusing.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,080
I don't know whether it's over my head or maybe I'm missing something,

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,240
but it's about the dumbest thing I ever saw.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,940
And the reason I think these critics and regular TV people want to see Twin Peaks go down

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,620
is because if that show stays popular,

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:47,120
then that would imply that those critics and regular producers and technicians and stars and writers,

11
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:55,380
it would imply that those people had spent their entire lives being wimpy, cowardly, conspiracy pink boys.

12
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,780
And I hate to hear pinks talk about,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
who they think killed Laura Palmer.

14
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,740
It's like they don't even watch the show, you know.

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,720
They'll throw out all these ridiculous ideas.

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
Oh, Leland did it.

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,540
Oh, it's really Madeline.

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,620
She's really Laura.

19
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,620
And all this kind of...

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,600
What they never seem to mention is the element of the supernatural,

21
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,080
which was sort of carefully thread throughout the first season.

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,100
And now, of course, it's come to the fore.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,280
The supernatural aspect.

24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:29,920
The...

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,760
The owls are not what they seem, dear friends.

26
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,920
And Bob killed Laura Palmer.

27
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,320
I'll bet you.

28
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,640
I'll bet you.

29
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,560
In the end, Bob killed...

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,720
Now, of course, Bob was Laura Palmer.

31
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,460
But Killer Bob, as Laura Palmer, said,

32
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,140
kill me.

33
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,880
And that's the way it is, dear friends.

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,760
That's the way it works.

35
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,620
And that's the way it's going to be tonight.

36
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,920
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

37
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,740
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

38
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,320
which reaches from the inner mind to...

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,020
The subgenius hour of slack.

40
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,400
Eternal salvation.

41
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,160
Eternal salvation.

42
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,700
Or triple your money back.

43
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,020
Just let the show flow right over you

44
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,480
like warm honey as you sleep.

45
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,420
It runs down your forehead into your ear.

46
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,260
Feel it? You feel it? You feel it?

47
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,820
That's right.

48
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,540
Ah, relax.

49
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,440
Go with it. Go with it. That's right.

50
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,360
Are you going to stay?

51
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,380
Well, uh...

52
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,120
Well, um...

53
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,940
Whip it up.

54
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,360
Well, uh...

55
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,200
You're so sexy!

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,700
Whip it up!

57
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,080
Whip it up!

58
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,540
Whip it up!

59
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,120
Whip it up!

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,220
Whip it up!

61
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,120
Whip it up!

62
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,140
Whip it up!

63
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,140


64
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,140


65
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,140


66
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,140


67
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,140


68
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,140


69
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,140


70
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,140


71
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,140


72
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,140


73
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,140


74
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,500
It's no laughing matter!

75
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,980
That's as if I'm willing to make value judgments,

76
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,940
which I'm not!

77
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,020
It certainly ain't no permanent solution!

78
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,360
Who knows when another one makes...

79
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,060
Wait, you don't know what's going on?

80
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,780
I can't stop dying!

81
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,240
You're the master of my...

82
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,480
I'll make that man of you!

83
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:18,920
Take it!

84
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,780
I don't care anymore!

85
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,560
You make me...

86
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,300
Be run...

87
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,400
Call it all human.

88
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,740
Call it all human.

89
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,160
Call it all human.

90
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,440
Come to the war.

91
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,720
You mean I should volunteer?

92
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,680
You're drafted.

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,400
Now come.

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,980
You mean I don't even have a chance to volunteer?

95
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,920
You have a chance to come as a draftee.

96
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,320
Are you calling in everyone my age?

97
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,780
Not everyone.

98
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,280
Only the boys?

99
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Girls, too.

100
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,720
Which boys?

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:54,960
Which ones?

102
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,840
The ones drafted.
