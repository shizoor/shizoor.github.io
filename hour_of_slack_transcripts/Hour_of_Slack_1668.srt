00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,340
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:25,760
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

3
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:58,760
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:29,360
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

5
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,960
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,880
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

7
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:59,980
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

8
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,220
week's show. Let's put last week's show away and create a whole new show just for you.

9
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,280
I think we should put this guy over here on the turntable where he belongs.

10
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,580
Oh, he didn't want to do that. Okay, there he is, break dancing.

11
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,520
Well, by the time you get this communicated, it'll be too late. The pigs are outside the

12
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:29,980
door. What I want to know is who speaks for Earth. Hey, here's a, here's a, here's a,

13
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:37,720
a lonesome cowboy, Dave. Michelle, down in the other studio on that box there. I'm sitting

14
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:46,620
here with a keyboard. And Dave's got his guitar. And Lisa, Lisa is over there. And the Reverend

15
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,380
Ivan Stang standing right behind me. And that's a dangerous proposition, boys and girls.

16
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:51,840
Praise God.

17
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,900
Praise God.

18
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,640
Praise you, God.

19
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,420
Princess Lisa.

20
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,560
The KY Jelly is ready to go.

21
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,280
And everyone is standing around and alive.

22
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,440
Look, they fell for it again. They're back again. Told you they'd do it. And they always fall for it

23
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:20,660
every time. Always will again and again. Thought you could get away, did you? Look at it. He

24
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:28,540
doesn't even remember, does he? No, no, no. Just let him guess. We'll just let him drift in and

25
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,600
out of reality.

26
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,820
When the only one who can promise anything is his auch.

27
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,560
Okay.

28
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,800
You have lavished yourself for one of these блок grating days.

29
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,100
We have to listen.

30
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,120
And I'm not части to simply do a simulation cookie.

31
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,120


32
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,320
I'm looking forward to universo 5.

33
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,460
He said, you know, I realized you say the same thing?

34
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:46,460


35
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:46,540
Won't I be the native your-

36
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,020
Never want to say sweetquet, we're born to spend a day saying practicing fortuitously.

37
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,400

Linda was not agreed with custard in this program royal.

42
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:07,580
exist. This show will be a personal experience between you and the man with

43
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:17,580
the pipe. You are about to rip open a yawning chasm in what you thought was

44
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:29,200
your personality. You will stand on the brink of a hole deep within yourself. A pit, a pit, a stinky pit.

45
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:40,060
And in the very deepest, blackest part of the pit that is your mind, you will discover Bob.

46
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:51,880
But first, let's step back out into the real world. The real world. The real world.

47
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:08,460
Now that you have achieved trance state, come with us. Come and travel in the astral planes as we seek that which is

48
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:26,300
dark. But first you must pull loose from your own body. Yes, it's easy. Just a little tug. Close your eyes, float upward and give your

49
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,720
soul a little tug.

50
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:42,000
You see, you're free. You're free. You never thought your soul a little tug. You never thought it would be so easy, did you?

51
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:56,760
Then let's go upwards. Upwards. To get perspective. Upwards. Higher. Towards heaven. But we'll stop here in face, in space, first.

52
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,040
Just past the earth's end.

53
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:08,160
You see, we can go anywhere instantly this way. And it was all so easy, right within humanity's grasp all along.

54
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:14,980
And you know the secret. Really, you can go anywhere. Let's try something new.

55
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:48,440
Oh, it's beautiful down here. We could just float along and watch the fish. Or...

56
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,560
Roll on up on the pricey stuff. Come on in for the best in town. Take your pick at the finest wine.

57
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,380
Hey, I'll dance on the side of the mountain.

58
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,340
Or...

59
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:10,940
I can plunge you into this trench in the middle of this blistering hell planet and send you to sitting chained in this ditch forever.

60
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:21,080
Just waiting, waiting until the ticks come again. Yes, just waiting. The giant ticks. Will they come again?

61
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,520
Press the shooting.

62
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,480
Yants.

63
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,080
Don't look.

64
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:26,620
Click.

65
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:26,780
Click.

66
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,160
Click.

67
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,880
Click.

68
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,200
Click.

69
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:28,540
Oh.

70
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:37,620
Keep shooting. You could shoot another one in another hour and you'll never kill them all. Keep shooting. Keep shooting. Just keep shooting or they'll get you!

71
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,820
See, just like your job back at home, ain't it, boy?

72
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,140
Yep.

73
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,620
You just can't get away. You can't get away from them... them ticks, my friends.

74
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,640
So join them.

75
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,480
The fathers never answered one of my prayers.

76
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,460
I made O'Basin

77
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,760
Well you paid O'Basin today

78
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,760
But did you pay money?

79
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,180
Actual cash, green and gravel

80
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,180
Think about it boys

81
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,240
Don't wait till everyone in your neighborhood's got the bomb

82
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,080
Nuke them

83
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,780
Now at Hiroshima Schwartz's Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse

84
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,720
Hi friends, I'm Hiroshima Schwartz

85
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,220
Of Hiroshima Schwartz's Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse

86
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,280
Home of the Mini-Mag, the Pocket Thunder

87
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,680
The Baby Neutrino that leaves their apartments intact

88
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,820
And many other fine, low-range, low-rad nukes

89
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,680
These teeny tiny warheads actually fit in your wallet, purse or pocketbook

90
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,700
And what's on special this week at Hiroshima Schwartz?

91
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,460
It's the giant X-Day Drill Sale

92
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,300
Now until the wee-wee hours of July 6, 1996

93
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,020
We are literally giving away tons and tons of useless

94
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,700
And useless stuff

95
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:53,700


96
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,480
And useful weapons

97
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,920
It's the Werner Von Braumeister Party Special

98
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,160
That blows away 50 party pinks at a time

99
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,360
Leaving the party intact

100
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,460
Disguised as a four-gallon keg

101
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,440
That first draft really packs a wallop

102
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,400
But for paid subgenius

103
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,660
It's the Smart Prairie Squid Face Seeking Special

104
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,020
I'm sorry, I always get that wrong

105
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,440
It reads your mind

106
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,380
And literally knows where to send the warby

107
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,940
Finally now till X-Day

108
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,380
Bloodier than any golf pro

109
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,640
It's the exploding head of J.R. Bob Dobbs

110
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,540
When the pipe lights, it's armed

111
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,720
When launched, it zaps

112
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,240
Up to 100, that's 100

113
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,580
Useless bobbies at a time

114
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,300
Friends, don't wait till it's too late

115
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,880
Everyone will soon have the bomb

116
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,980
Nuke them now

117
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,860
From now till X-Day and beyond

118
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,920
We are literally

119
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,360
Blowing up the competition

120
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,440
Hiroshima Schwartz's X-Day End of the World Sale

121
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,260
Till a mob sent you and received 23% off

122
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,280
Batteries not included

123
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,900
Some assembly required

124
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,980
You know, I've been eating alien shmigma pie for almost 50 years

125
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,040
Since those first shoster crashes near Roswell

126
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,660
My sons grew up on it, his sons too

127
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,120
Here in Wilberville, it's as natural as pie

128
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,520
But many folks don't know about alien shmigma pie

129
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,360
Things kind of changed since we landed on the moon

130
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,120
Some things we didn't even know

131
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,080
Some folks believe in things called grey

132
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,520
And some folks believe in things called grey

133
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:23,520


134
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,080
Gramps, did you eat your pie today?

135
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,980
It's my daughter, always worrying

136
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,080
Hey Gramps, when are we going to go to the new dancer's

137
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,760
And worry in a massage parlor?

138
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,680
And that grandson of mine always keeps me running

139
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,940
Then forget our little appointment

140
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,760
Oh, nice and tidy

141
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,380
I've been staying in a sack with Grandma for a long time

142
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,740
Thanks to alien shmigma pie

143
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,040
All I know is alien shmigma pie

144
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,380
Is made of a cheesy wax from alien genitalia

145
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,680
It's made me sexually active again

146
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,820
And it tastes great

147
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,020
That's all I know

148
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,080
Building a new race in this life is hard

149
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,160
And nothing gets it as hard

150
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,520
As alien shmigma pie

151
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,800
Alien shmigma pie

152
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,700
The taste that's out of this world

153
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,180
Alien shmigma pie

154
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,760
Bob loves me

155
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,960
And I love Bob

156
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,700
I hate you

157
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,220
He hates you

158
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,940
I love Bob

159
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,880
And Bob loves me

160
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,000
No, he hates you, Dave

161
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,100
He hates you

162
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,160
Bob hates you

163
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,160
J.R. Bob Dobbs has answered all of my prayers

164
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,020
He even told me go and fling myself down the stairs

165
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,060
I did it on a lark

166
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,720
But now I'm glad

167
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,220
Bob loves me

168
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,720
And I love Bob

169
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,480
He hates you

170
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,460
You may love Bob

171
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:52,680
But I'm glad you love me

172
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,380
But Bob hates you, Dave

173
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,620
He makes you fling yourself down the stairs for fun

174
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,640
Oh, I love Bob

175
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,520
And Bob loves me

176
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,200
We're sweet and slimy

177
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,640
Just like little grapes on a tree

178
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,460
And Jake told me on Valentine's Day

179
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,540
And I've sent flowers and chocolate

180
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,840
And he loves me anyway

181
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,620
I said it

182
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,480
Bob loves me

183
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,660
And I love Bob

184
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,900
He hates you, Dave

185
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,320
What could be more pure?

186
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,680
It's the purest form of love

187
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:22,680


188
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:22,680


189
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:22,680


190
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:22,680


191
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:22,680


192
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:22,680


193
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:22,680


194
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:22,680


195
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:22,680


196
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:22,680


197
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:22,680


198
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:22,680


199
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:22,680


200
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,940
I'm a love anyone could imagine

201
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,420
He answers all my letters

202
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,500
He calls me up and leaves messages on my phone

203
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,640
He's always with me

204
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,720
He's always with me

205
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,480
The computer does all of that, Dave

206
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,380
And I love Bob

207
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,240
Don't be a sucker

208
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,000
J.R. Bob Dobbs

209
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
I love Bob

210
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,180
Bob loves everyone except you, Dave

211
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:46,860
I love you

212
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,680
Because you were so stupid as to believe him when he said he loved you

213
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:52,680


214
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,660
That first time

215
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,800
He tells that to all the boys, believe him

216
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,660
Bob loves me

217
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,980
It's not a torture kind of thing

218
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,540
It's pure

219
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,140
It's beautiful

220
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,980
It's just like

221
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,420
Oh, please

222
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,840
Stop

223
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,620
Don't

224
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,580
Stop telling me

225
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,460
You don't love me

226
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,920
This is what Bob meant when he said, pull the wool over your own eyes

227
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,800
I can't see anything

228
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,980
Oh, I'm going blind

229
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,480
I'm going blind

230
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,240
But you can still see Bob in your mind's eye

231
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,660
Can't you?

232
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,220
Can't you, Dave?

233
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,520
My mind

234
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,340
You never stop seeing Bob in your mind's eye

235
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,100
I can't stop

236
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,900
Such as it is

237
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,300
My mind?

238
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,420
What there is of it

239
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,000
What?

240
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,340
My

241
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,680
Your mind

242
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,560
Your mind is no longer your friend

243
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,060
I'm a physical person

244
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,900
I'm in love

245
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,660
I'm in lust

246
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,740
I'm in love with Bob

247
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,820
And I don't care what you say

248
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,680
I love Bob

249
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,560
And Bob loves me

250
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,040
Bob does love a fool

251
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
That's true

252
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,300
Bob loves the fools of this world

253
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:52,660
And Bob loves me

254
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:52,660


255
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:52,660


256
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:52,660


257
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:52,660


258
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:52,660


259
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:52,660


260
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,000
Truly the king of fools is lonesome cowboy Dave

261
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,380
Now performing the greatest guitar solo in the universe

262
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,760
Rock out, baby

263
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,200
Play it, Dave

264
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,980
I don't hear the music, but don't make me go

265
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,700
What do you mean, which one?

266
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,820
I thought there was only strings

267
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,860
And you see, friends

268
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,660
You see how the love of Bob has freed me from the bond of the soul

269
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:22,660


270
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:22,660


271
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:22,660


272
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:22,660


273
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,740
Dave from the ponderous

274
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,680
real life around him.

275
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,940
He pays no attention to

276
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,680
what other people might think

277
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,340
of him. Sure, they think he's a

278
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,700
fool, an idiot, a bad

279
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,260
person.

280
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,800
A half-janger.

281
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,420
But

282
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,460
he's happy.

283
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,320
You can hear the simple happiness

284
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,220
in his voice.

285
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,880
He's a former big star.

286
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,380
I can't express how happy

287
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,580
I was when I think about it.

288
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,760
Oh, don't think about it.

289
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,680
You won't be so happy if you stop

290
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,660
and think about it. Now, will you, Dave?

291
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,460
Why are my pants all wet and what's wrong

292
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,780
with me? And how come I

293
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,680
can't close my mouth or open

294
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,540
my eyes? And why doesn't

295
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,200
Barbara call a writer

296
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,980
and answer my letters or

297
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,360
leave anything on my message machine?

298
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,900
You're not losing

299
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,500
your faith now, are you, Dave?

300
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,740
That would be a great sin, a grievous

301
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,720
sin indeed.

302
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,440
To lose one's feet.

303
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,140
To lose one's faith. To lose one's faith in Bob.

304
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,400
I have no faith in Bob.

305
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,640
Bob has no faith.

306
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,360
He has no faith, meaning

307
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,420
he only has a head. He cannot

308
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,520
have a faith in a head.

309
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,540
God, John has had two faces on his

310
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,460
head. Neither one of them were looking

311
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,940
at the same thing at the same time.

312
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,500
And Bob can see you out of

313
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,400
each one of those dots on his

314
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,260
face, like multifaceted eyes

315
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,920
of the mighty insect.

316
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,340
The mightiest

317
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,000
insect.

318
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,840
Boing, boing, boing.

319
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,400
The mightiest insect

320
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,680
is the Dobson fly.

321
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,840
Little tiny pea-like

322
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,620
into a

323
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,500
magnificent, magnificent

324
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,520
brain. Yes.

325
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,880
The sucking bugs

326
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,500
of the

327
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,060
amazing northern Ohio area

328
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,280
include

329
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,900
among the order Hemptera.

330
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,080
I said the order

331
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,080
Hemptera.

332
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,800
The sucking bugs. The bugs who suck

333
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,180
things through pipes.

334
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,640
Such as the water scorpion

335
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,100
and the rantrofusia.

336
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:30,900
And the giant

337
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,860
water bug. Did you ever see that movie?

338
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,160
The giant water bug?

339
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,500
That was great. The giant water boatman

340
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,260
was the sequel.

341
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,840
These are lovely and interesting

342
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,420
insects of the northern Ohio

343
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,580
swamp areas.

344
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,820
But, aside from

345
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,420
the pleasant, happy-go-lucky

346
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,320
order Hemptera,

347
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,640
one also finds

348
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,700
the order Neuroptera.

349
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,500
Which includes

350
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,860
in the sinister

351
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,760
family Corridale

352
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,740
Day. Do you hear the

353
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,420
significance of that? Corridale

354
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,120
Day?

355
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,020
Salvador Dali Day?

356
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,860
We find a creature, yes, a living

357
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,760
actual bug of

358
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,820
the northern Ohio swamp area. It's called

359
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,240
the Dobson fly.

360
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,380
The Dobson fly?

361
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,160
Which is, you can go,

362
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,600
you can see a stuffed mounted

363
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,920
example of this hideous, vicious

364
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,120
beast in the Cleveland Natural History

365
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,060
Museum. The Dobson fly,

366
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,200
while surrounded

367
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,720
by lovely butterflies

368
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,500
and not too alien looking dragonflies,

369
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,000
you'll notice that the

370
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,300
Dobson fly has the head

371
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,560
of a vicious red ant.

372
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,140
With hideous

373
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,180
clicking mandibles and

374
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,180
the body, a body

375
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,340
that resembles the tail of a rattlesnake.

376
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,320
Then, the Dobson fly, which is a very rare species, is a very rare species.

377
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,700
Horrible flapping

378
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,920
leathery wings.

379
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,600
Yes, the Dobson fly.

380
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,040
This is not some biological freak that we're making up.

381
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,280
I'm afraid there are thousands of Dobson fly larvae.

382
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,400
Now, they are in their season,

383
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,660
their 50 year season.

384
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,720
As evolution lied,

385
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,120
it's evolution and life.

386
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,280
It was in the 40s.

387
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:17,760
In the 1940s was the last time the Dobson fly cycle reached its peak.

388
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,320
And thousands died as the Dobson fly

389
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,320


390
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,320


391
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,040
started to grow.

392
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,540
Dobson flies

393
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,420
attacked the suburbs

394
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,240
of Cleveland.

395
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,900
Oh, the days of Velikovsky,

396
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,200
I thought it was Wassily Kambuski.

397
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,000
And every time you

398
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,700
swatted a Dobson fly,

399
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,260
a million eggs would squirt out

400
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,680
of its ruptured abdomen

401
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,760
each egg

402
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,880
hatching into another million

403
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,180
Dobson flies.

404
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,240
And each time you tried to squash one of those,

405
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,560
it would hatch

406
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:50,500
a million.

407
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,340
Evolution has no plan.

408
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,200
You see, friends, man likes to

409
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,360
think himself the grandest thing

410
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,420
in all of God's great creation.

411
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,960
But indeed, no,

412
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,100
it is the great order of the

413
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,520
insectoride.

414
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,880
The great brain of all

415
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,340
collective insect hives and tribes

416
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,040
is a billion times

417
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,880
smarter than any single

418
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,460
ego-centered human brain.

419
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,860
Certainly,

420
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,880
one Dobson fly

421
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,100
or one tick

422
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,360
may possess a rudimentary

423
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,140
brain, but they can communicate

424
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,820
by radio with each other.

425
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,080
And the millions of each species

426
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,120
each forms a great brain

427
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,000
of that species. And those

428
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,280
brains get together to form brains.

429
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,420
And let's face it, you're outsmarted,

430
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,060
Mr. Earth Boy, Mr. Human,

431
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,680
Mr. Two-Legged, Mr.

432
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,640
Tool-Using Primate,

433
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,980
Mr. Thinksy-So-Big-Time-Smarty-Pants.

434
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,920
But you know,

435
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,160
if you took that human back into

436
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,980
the early Devonian

437
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,240
period, even here in the

438
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,900
lovely Northern Ohio

439
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,100
area, you would find that

440
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,800
there was no Devo.

441
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,040
No Devo?

442
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,920
No Devo, there was, but

443
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,820
because there was a slimy ocean

444
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,860
covering the Northern Ohio

445
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,840
plains. A filthy,

446
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,160
sewer-like, shallow,

447
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,940
but murky, muddy,

448
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,400
disgusting, smelly

449
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:16,920
ocean.

450
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,200
And in the depths

451
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
of these foul,

452
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,080
murky puddles, there grew

453
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,800
such creatures

454
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,680
as the Dunkelosteus.

455
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,960
Yes, the Dunkelosteus.

456
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,200
And friends, I hate to tell you this, but there is

457
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,220
a, it's true that there was a

458
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,540
ancient plant

459
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,160
discovered, fossil, of

460
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,880
this plant, and they named it, yes,

461
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,320
the Clevelandodendron

462
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,720
Ohioensis.

463
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,300
441108.

464
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,080
No, seriously,

465
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,520
the Clevelandendor,

466
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,880
Clevelandendodron

467
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,540
Ohioensis.

468
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,160
That was merely, however,

469
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,160
just a tube-like plant

470
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,220
with teeth and thousands of eyes.

471
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,380
From Club Moss.

472
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,660
Einstein's secret...

473
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,900
I mean, Club Moss was a great place back then.

474
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,300
I saw Devo at Club Moss.

475
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,900
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

476
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,340
ESO Radio, boys and girls.

477
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,360
Ivan Stang

478
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,040
in the house.

479
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,160
Now, as usual,

480
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,440
speaking of the

481
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,120
all themes of the insect kingdom,

482
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,920
we notice that through these

483
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,220
over-exaggerated sense of

484
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,160
smell, that they also keep

485
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,340
in a form of ESP,

486
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,220
extrasensory contact with each and every

487
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,300
other member of their community.

488
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,660
And as we notice here,

489
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,920
if I expose one of these insects

490
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,380
to this molasses, all of the rest

491
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,140
of the insects will begin to

492
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,040
come within the air, even if they have been

493
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,160
exposed, or have been

494
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,160
held in this container,

495
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,020
and are incapable of actually smelling

496
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,120
the molasses. All, as soon as they're

497
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,740
released, they all begin exploding,

498
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,300
because some of them have distillate charges

499
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,680
in the back of the vacuum.

500
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,620
Some of them have even approached

501
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,880
300 feet in length,

502
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,860
and some of them are well,

503
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,660
well over 2,000 pounds.

504
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,400
And I see them in my dreams.

505
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,300
I keep on thinking that one of them

506
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,420
was with Harry

507
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,300
that night when they went over the edge.

508
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,620
.

509
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,320
.

510
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,020
Watch it. Watch it. Watch it.

511
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,940
And confess to me.

512
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,320
And confess to me.

513
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:36,840
.

514
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,160
In this small,

515
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:40,900
.

516
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,140
dark

517
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,920
room.

518
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,560
.

519
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,360
.

520
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:50,840
.

521
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,320
.

522
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,940
.

523
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,140
.

524
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,140


525
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,140


526
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,140


527
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,140


528
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,140


529
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,180
.

530
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,220
.

531
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:19,280
.

532
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:19,520
.

533
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,020
.

534
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:28,820
.

535
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:28,940
.

536
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:28,960
.

537
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:28,980
.

538
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,000
.

539
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,020
.

540
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,040
.

541
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,060
.

542
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,080
.

543
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:45,800
.

544
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,260
.

545
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:49,260


546
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,040
. .

547
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,260
. .

548
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,400
. And how can we surmise that from this incident,

549
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,940
the head of JR Bob Dobbs did emerge into the lustrous as a numinous being?

550
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,600
I don't know but you can find out by coming to the X Day Drill,

551
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,780
on July 5th through 7th this year

552
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,360
and every year from now till X-Day.

553
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,680
That's right, Ivan.

554
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,340
That's right.

555
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,240
Remember to call for free information

556
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,260
about the amazing X-Day drill.

557
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,440
Yes, it's like the legendary Doc Stock Gathering.

558
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,140
That's right, Ivan.

559
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:35,980
That's right, Ivan.

560
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,180
You'll see the most hated preachers

561
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,300
of the subgenius church.

562
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,140
You'll camp out on a lovely,

563
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,600
fully developed campground

564
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,940
surrounded by geeks

565
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,760
you'd rather not ever spend much time with.

566
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,580
But by God, you'll know more

567
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,200
about the church of the subgenius

568
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,780
because, friends, you will have practiced

569
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,860
for that fatal day,

570
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,460
that glorious day, X-Day.

571
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,900
Yes, only two years from now, in 1998,

572
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,180
the sex goddesses from Planet X

573
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,240
shall come against the best wrestles

574
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,840
and rupture up the news

575
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,220
paying fully Dobs-approved subgenius ministers.

576
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:14,900
That's right, Ivan.

577
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,220
All 4,000 of us.

578
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,720
And...

579
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,100
And destroy the rest of the planet.

580
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,700
That's right, Ivan.

581
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,000
Well, not destroy it,

582
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,220
but turn it back into the stinking swamp

583
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,120
that it was before the filthy humans came along

584
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,220
and muddied everything up.

585
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,940
But, friends, you can come along

586
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,200
and muddy everything up.

587
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,700
You can wallow in the filth.

588
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,560
You can dance all night.

589
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,940
Oh, whoa, dude.

590
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,140
You can pull your clothes off

591
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,720
and county law doesn't care

592
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,040
because we are having the first X-Day drill

593
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,400
this July 5th through 7th.

594
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,740
Sunday, Sunday.

595
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,700
Sunday!

596
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,720
You'll see the pill.

597
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,140
You'll see the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

598
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,320
It lives.

599
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,900
It bleeds for you

600
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,160
if you don't vomit your money back.

601
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,460
Friends, you will see things you wouldn't dare believe,

602
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,240
things you never wanted to believe

603
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,260
and things you'll wish you never saw.

604
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,140
That's right, Ivan.

605
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,180
Yetis will be copulating in the bushes.

606
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:08,900
Oh, dude.

607
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,880
The Loch Ness Monster will rise up from the little pond.

608
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,380
The crazed pagan drummers

609
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,520
will drum all night long

610
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,640
and keep you from sleeping.

611
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,560
Mosquitoes the size of dobson flies

612
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,880
will devour you,

613
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,800
but you won't care.

614
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,380
You won't care

615
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,220
because you spent your money

616
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,160
and came to the X-Day drill

617
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,240
July 5th through 7th.

618
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,500
And, friends, you can call for information

619
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,440
216-

620
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,340
6-

621
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,400
0-

622
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:37,960
3-

623
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,680
3-

624
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,220
8-

625
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,460
I'll give that number again.

626
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,620
Write that number down.

627
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,700
It's the free information

628
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,960
to Bible Hotline

629
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,260
at the Church of the Subgenius.

630
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:45,980
Here in Cleveland.

631
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,160
That's 12-6-0-3-3-8.

632
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,740
That's 12-6-0-3-3-8.

633
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,520
What do those numbers add up to?

634
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:54,900
Aha!

635
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,060
Now you know the secret.

636
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,520
Now you know what we're really trying to tell you about.

637
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,300
The froth.

638
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,380
Yes, the froth.

639
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,320
There's no excuse.

640
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,620
That's right, Ivan.

641
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,580
Buckets of froth.

642
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,160
Backtops full of froth.

643
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,960
Three months tired.

644
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,560
That's right, Ivan.

645
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,160
A froth.

646
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,400
A different ancient

647
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,120
Tehranian ocean full of froth.

648
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,600
Oh, dude.

649
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,420
Ancient Tibetan herbs

650
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,020
scrolling right up under your feet.

651
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,420
You won't be able to sleep.

652
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,800
There'll be so much froth growing

653
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,880
at high speed

654
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,220
underneath your sleeping bag

655
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,140
tossing you around.

656
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,860
It's like a giant funhouse.

657
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,960
Yes, it's insane.

658
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,760
It's crazy.

659
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,800
But ain't it always been

660
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,940
the crazy people

661
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,460
that were able to party

662
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,440
like they do now?

663
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,540
Yes, sir.

664
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,160
E-bomb.

665
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,780
Yes, sir.

666
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,220
Ma'am.

667
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:33,420
Sir.

668
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:33,780
Lady.

669
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,460
You will finally learn

670
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,040
what it's like

671
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,700
to be a subgenius.

672
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,040
That's right.

673
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,340
Ivan Stang

674
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,600
of the Church of the Subgenius

675
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:42,980
and

676
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,460
the

677
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,060
Oh, did I say that?

678
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,620
Well, then

679
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,900
pick up on it, man.

680
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,140
It says at the end of the world

681
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,520
there's coming a great flash.

682
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,260
I sure hope so.

683
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,760
Some people might go

684
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,260
and the other ones might last.

685
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,240
Will you

686
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,720
be the one who goes?

687
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,220
Where will you be

688
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,300
on next day, brother?

689
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,920
Where is your

690
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,680
Where will you be

691
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,900
on next day, brother?

692
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,460
Will you be

693
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,120
Will you be

694
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,220
on next day, brother?

695
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,880
Will you be

696
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,800
in the sausage

697
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,140
with

698
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,740
There's still lots of room.

699
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,700
Oh, will you be down

700
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,220
in the room?

701
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,520
You can have anything you want.

702
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,360
Will you be burning?

703
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,720
Will you be burning?

704
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,980
Will you be burning?

705
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,920
Will it be

706
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,800
perfect pleasure

707
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,680
for us to watch

708
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,040
and learn?

709
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,840
Perfect pain.

710
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,100
Which will it be?

711
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,560
It's up to you to choose.

712
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,940
Bob gives you free will.

713
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,400
But you can't feel anything

714
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,180
until you sign on the dotted line

715
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,740
and the next day is coming

716
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,200
so you better move fast

717
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,540
because

718
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,160
where will you be on next day?

719
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,020
I've got plenty of time

720
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,620
to spend my $30

721
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,640
on that Bob ministership.

722
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,040
I've got plenty of time.

723
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,120
It's two more years

724
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,060
for next day.

725
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,640
Why am I in any kind of hurry?

726
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,360
There couldn't possibly have been

727
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,220
some kind of a problem.

728
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:13,860
I'm a misprint

729
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,000
in the book of the subgenius.

730
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,140
I mean, just because

731
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,360
that first edition

732
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,520
from McGraw-Hill

733
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,360
actually did say

734
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,800
that next day was

735
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,760
on July 5th, 1996.

736
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,360
Well, they changed it after that.

737
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,540
I'm sure that, I mean,

738
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,620
it looked like a mistake.

739
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,140
I probably was a mistake.

740
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,400
I don't think I really have to spend

741
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,160
that $30 quite yet

742
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,420
because that probably was just,

743
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,400
it's probably not that the world's

744
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,080
going to end this year, 1996.

745
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,100
Probably.

746
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,520
Probably not.

747
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,920
I could probably afford

748
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,460
to take that risk.

749
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,200
I mean, I've got that $30.

750
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,300
That's not a problem,

751
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,220
but there's this

752
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,960
Hootie and the Blowfish CD

753
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,140
I wanted to get.

754
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,660
And, well, you know,

755
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,080
I wanted to go to this movie

756
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,480
about water spouts.

757
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,500
And, well, I just, I just, you know,

758
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,200
I mean, Bob will wait on me.

759
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,140
I mean, Bob's a patient man.

760
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
He ain't a wrathful God.

761
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,120
Now, you see,

762
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,020
I heard Bob would love

763
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,940
to, uh, they're subgeniuses

764
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,440
even if they never spend any money.

765
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,140
A patient man?

766
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,760
A patient man?

767
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,580
Man, he ain't no patient.

768
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,780
Bob is the doctor.

769
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,320
He ain't no patient man.

770
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,720
Bob is the surgeon

771
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,700
who will excise

772
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,860
the filthy, rotting tumor

773
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,040
that is America,

774
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,720
that is modern America today.

775
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,820
Yes, my fellow rebellious citizens

776
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,840
and untaxed players

777
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,560
and militia members,

778
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,720
all the citizens of courts,

779
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,380
we must come together.

780
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,620
We must come together.

781
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,420
Quick, they're coming.

782
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,880
They're trying to stop me from speaking.

783
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,480
All of us religious nuts,

784
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,060
we, and crazy, bright-winged maniacs,

785
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,700
we must band together against the man

786
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,240
because, oh, wait, they're coming.

787
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,120
I've got to get my message out.

788
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,560
The last, true hope is

789
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,540
5560338.

790
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,540
Call 55603.

791
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,220
Here they come.

792
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,080
No, come on!

793
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,920
I am God.

794
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,540
I am God.

795
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,440
I am God.

796
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,880
Please, I am God.

797
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,160
I am God.

798
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,160


799
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,160


800
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,520
Why not tell you what it's gonna be?

801
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,680
No, no, no, no, no.

802
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,060
I won't give you a long to live.

803
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,420
No, no, no, no, no, no.

804
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,080
You're going to live more than one day.

805
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,660
No, no, no, no, no, no.

806
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,660
I'm gonna tell you nothing.

807
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,460
Got a cobra snake for a necktie

808
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,280
Got me a church by the roadside

809
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,920
Made out of rattlesnake hide

810
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,180
Bob is gonna ask you

811
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,260
Who do you love?

812
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,080
Bob is gonna ask you

813
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,360
Who do you love?

814
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,160
Who do you love?

815
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,700
Who do you love?

816
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,560
Bob is gonna ask you

817
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:52,660
Who do you love?

818
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,460
Who do you love?

819
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,340
Watch my little little

820
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,840
little drop dead body

821
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,580
Your lover man

822
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,740
got a man around

823
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,680
Hey

824
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,460
Bow bow

825
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,640
Bow bow

826
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:10,640


827
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,500
Lead the road

828
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,460
Yeah, that's how I feel

829
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,120
Huh

830
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,060
Huh

831
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,880
Hey

832
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,140
Hey

833
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,640
Hey

834
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:25,640
Hey

835
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,180
Hey

836
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,020
Hey

837
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:30,740
Hey

838
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,140
Hey

839
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:31,620
Hey

840
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:31,860
Hey

841
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,920
Hey

842
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,800
I love you, I fade away

843
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,300
I love you, I fade away

844
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,720
I love you, I fade away

845
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,940
I love you, I fade away

846
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,260
I love you, I fade away

847
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,060
Bob's love fades like one glistening dewdrop, it's gone, man.

848
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,820
He hates you, he hates you, man, give it up, give it up.

849
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,080
He don't love you, man, Bob never loved you in your whole life, man.

850
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,660
And he don't care one thing about you, dude.

851
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,720
You got to get it right, brother.

852
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,020
Your head's screwed on the wrong man.

853
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,200
Bob don't love you, he hates you, man.

854
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,460
You understand the meaning of the word?

855
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,000
Hate.

856
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,500
Ask yourself, are you worthy?

857
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,720
Are you really even worthy of his hate?

858
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,240
To me?

859
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,020
Am I worthy of Bob's hate?

860
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,060
Of course I'm worthy of Bob's hate.

861
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,220
Everybody hates me.

862
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,520
I'm one of the most hated men ever to walk the earth.

863
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,620
There's no reason why there are Bob Dobbs.

864
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,880
The old hate monster.

865
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,740
He wouldn't want to give me a few stabs with the old pole and eyeball.

866
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,580
I'm afraid you flatter yourself, Dave.

867
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,500
Oh, man, it's a form of love, Dave.

868
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,720
You know, like, he beats you up because he loves you.

869
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,540
You know, it's like a heavy thing, you know.

870
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,440
It's like a tough love, you know what I mean?

871
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,240
Watch your pulse with that.

872
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,860
But you know, Dobbs did love Dave.

873
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,680
And there have always been days.

874
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,660
Yes, for thousands, even millions and millions of years, there have been days.

875
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,140
Lonesome.

876
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:09,960
Cowboy.

877
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,080
Boy.

878
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,480
Days.

879
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,600
Generally ignored by science for obvious reasons.

880
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:21,520
But this month only in Cleveland Natural History Museum, there is in fact a display.

881
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:28,060
A rather large exhibit called Cleveland Before Bob.

882
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,080
In which one may actually see fossils of the ancient peoples.

883
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,940
The precursors to the modern day.

884
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,940
The day that we unfortunately know as the New Year's Eve.

885
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,100
Now.

886
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:47,020
There have been, for instance, there's quite a wonderful set of artifacts that were raised

887
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,480
up from the P-Dog site.

888
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,620
There.

889
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,760
That prove that even the early Dave-onians were tool using.

890
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,740
Not quite at the level of primates.

891
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,700
We can get my finger all the way up here.

892
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:06,520
They had an unusual, there were an unusually large number of stone pot shards.

893
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,940
As well as, oddly enough, many pot shards.

894
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,820
Found at this dig.

895
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:12,740
Um.

896
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,780
Oddly enough.

897
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,920
Pot shards were used, overused, probably.

898
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,360
Abused.

899
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,700
The abused, yes.

900
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,540
The abused pots.

901
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,160
They were broken all over the place.

902
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,040
Old clothes.

903
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:24,520
However.

904
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,940
We do know that the ancient Dave's had a sex life.

905
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,460
But sometimes.

906
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,800
As we can see.

907
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:38,980
As seen in this fairly well honed, um, uh, fluted point.

908
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:39,920
Carved.

909
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:39,920


910
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:39,920


911
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:39,920


912
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:39,920


913
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:39,920


914
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:39,920


915
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:39,920


916
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:39,920


917
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:39,920


918
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,720
Carved from stone.

919
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,280
And notice here.

920
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:42,940
The wooden.

921
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,920
The wooden foreshaft.

922
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,940
Of the ancient Dave piece.

923
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,620
Contained quite a wide groove.

924
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,420
So you can take that wooden foreshaft.

925
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,700
The ancient Dave, them old Dave men.

926
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,700
The old Dave men could take.

927
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,460
Had a wooden foreshaft with such a wide groove.

928
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,700
And the fluted point of it.

929
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,520
See now nowadays.

930
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,440
In modern Dave.

931
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,000
It's not even made of wood.

932
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,440
It's just limp.

933
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:09,900
Like a wooden fore.

934
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:09,900


935
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:09,900


936
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:09,900


937
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:09,900


938
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:09,900


939
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:09,900


940
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:09,900


941
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:09,900


942
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:09,900


943
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:09,900


944
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:09,900


945
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:09,900


946
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:09,900


947
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,320
an old Dosh rag, wash rag,

948
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,860
it's still got the fluted coin,

949
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,120
but, you know, it ain't nearly as sharp

950
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,480
as they used to be,

951
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,580
because the ancient, strangely enough,

952
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,700
the Neanderthals actually had

953
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,320
a larger cranial capacity

954
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,320
than the modern homo-davian.

955
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,860
You see here, slide three,

956
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,340
an ugly creature,

957
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,460
but yet, strangely enough,

958
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,180
still our ancestor.

959
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,380
Well, yours, maybe.

960
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,500
Friends, we poised on Edge of Evolution

961
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,520
as we stand together here today

962
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,480
on this historic moment

963
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,760
with brain much bigger than that to follow.

964
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,680
Must rewind now those who follow.

965
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,980
But even with its larger brain,

966
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,880
the ancient Dave men

967
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,980
were able to build nothing but crude pipes.

968
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,120
There are thousands of varieties of pipes,

969
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,800
shattered pipes,

970
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,860
found in the ancient settlement

971
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,320
in which they smoked

972
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,480
what, as far as...

973
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,260
We can tell, wild plant materials,

974
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,980
including dogwood,

975
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,160
the bark of the dogwood,

976
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,440
which was quite strong,

977
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,080
quite a bit stronger than the bite of the dogwood,

978
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,840
although it did have a good bite, too.

979
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,720
If he made you a dog stick,

980
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,620
dogwood stick,

981
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,660
rolled you up,

982
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,220
run up some dogwood,

983
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,860
that does have a bite to it.

984
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,260
It has a hell of a bite to it.

985
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,700
Man, brain too big today.

986
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,200
Come on, dogwood.

987
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,440
However, the ancient Dave men

988
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,320
had a natural,

989
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:39,640
a natural enemy,

990
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,480
the mammothous primigenius.

991
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,460
Oh my God, here they come.

992
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,460
The, or primigenius,

993
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,480
or, which is Greek for primitive subgenius.

994
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,840
Ironically far more intelligent

995
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,460
than the modern subgenius.

996
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,580
I wanna play all the old records.

997
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,420
As proved by the fact that you're listening

998
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,080
to this show at all right now.

999
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,740
I'm gonna smoke all the props.

1000
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,320
Ah, here they come.

1001
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,460
Unfortunately, the largest display in the museum,

1002
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,000
showing the Dave men,

1003
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,480
is the items of unknown value,

1004
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,120
unknown function.

1005
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,680
Carefully carved and intricately decorated,

1006
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,120
bone and ivory fragments,

1007
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,960
which, the uses of which have yet to be discovered.

1008
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,000
They seem to be senseless, randomly created.

1009
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,460
Perhaps some scientists suspect

1010
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,500
they may have been used to dislodge unwanted objects

1011
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,040
from obscure body parts.

1012
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,740
And orifices.

1013
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,500
The early Dave men possessed more orifices

1014
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,400
than the modern Dave,

1015
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,640
and made copious use of them.

1016
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,720
And also thyroid wax collector.

1017
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,000
And also underpinion nostril.

1018
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,580
And also beneath both follicles of the ear.

1019
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,320
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1020
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,940
In these ancient holographic films,

1021
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,760
you can see the olden time Dave,

1022
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,020
the primitive Daves,

1023
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,160
chanting in their silly rituals.

1024
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,140
Yes, even then, man had religion.

1025
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,620
The Daves buried their dead.

1026
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,360
Infant Daves,

1027
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,580
fetus skeletons have been found,

1028
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,180
which show signs of having been

1029
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,280
ritually slaughtered by their parents.

1030
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,640
For the delicacy,

1031
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,420
the one item of diet that we know

1032
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,160
that the ancient Dave men enjoyed

1033
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,260
was fetus nads.

1034
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,520
Don't quite know how to put that,

1035
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,560
but certainly a serious delicacy.

1036
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,480
Those things would go for

1037
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,860
$14.95 an ounce at least nowadays,

1038
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,360
you know, down at the...

1039
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,220
I want you to know you're using...

1040
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,320
Down at the Piggly Wiggly,

1041
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,940
you can't hardly get fetus nads.

1042
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,320
But the ancient Dave men

1043
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,780
were able to harvest these from their...

1044
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,740
Time, time now.

1045
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,120
Time to go out and harvest.

1046
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,800
And harvest.

1047
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,720
What was it we were harvesting?

1048
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,980
This was during the dawn of agriculture.

1049
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,020
And these ancient Dave men

1050
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,620
were in fact what we call skull farmers.

1051
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,280
Ah, there they are.

1052
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,880
300 of them.

1053
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,880
Just waiting to be locked.

1054
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,660
The women stay in the campground,

1055
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,760
mating with the men from rival tribes

1056
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,260
as the Daves were out in the fields

1057
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,120
harvesting the skulls and the heads.

1058
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,980
They tried to grow heads,

1059
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,920
but generally they were so...

1060
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,480
Such badly skilled farmers

1061
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,460
that they were able to harvest them.

1062
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,580
They would only grow skulls

1063
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,680
or else they'd forget to pluck their heads

1064
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,240
until they had become skulls.

1065
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,140
Ah, this white, it is gleaming.

1066
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,600
It is ready to lop.

1067
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,360
Now what do we do afterwards?

1068
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,640
We drink, we drink.

1069
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,960
We carve out the skull and we drink.

1070
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,300
And boy, these are big skulls

1071
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,140
because we have such big brains.

1072
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,720
But hard to drink, eh?

1073
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,900
In a vain attempt to gain the intelligence

1074
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,600
of the mighty mammoth,

1075
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,540
the Dave would drink the brains of the mammoth.

1076
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,460
To gain the courage of the mighty mammoth,

1077
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,960
the mighty, uh, uh, cow.

1078
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,700
And its craftiness and speed.

1079
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:19,260
The ancient Dave men would drink the brains of the cows,

1080
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,380
or rather suck them up through crude stone pipes.

1081
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,600
Now remember, son, when you drink cow,

1082
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,120
you imbue it with all power of cow.

1083
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,920
Strength, beauty, sleep, fast,

1084
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,820
quick, small, tiny, little, eh, shut up.

1085
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,460
This is what is known as sympathetic manhood.

1086
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:37,820
Sympathetic magic.

1087
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,480
Obviously, today in today's modern world,

1088
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,680
we know better than to fall for simple superstitions.

1089
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,900
I drank that genius's urine just for a taste of brilliance.

1090
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,540
That's true.

1091
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,640
There is the one exception.

1092
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,100
Sympathetic magic does still work

1093
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,560
in the Church of the Subgenius.

1094
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:01,260
If you will but drink of the fluids of Bob,

1095
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,500
you will gain the wisdom of Bob,

1096
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,360
his, his great intellect.

1097
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,280
Intellectual acuity will be yours.

1098
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,220
And you all know how smart Bob is.

1099
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,780
He's from the Church of the Subgum Guys at Subgenius.

1100
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,000
They're like all geniuses or something, right?

1101
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,360
Isn't that what they're trying to say or something?

1102
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,820
And, and Bob's a smart guy.

1103
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,120
And so if you kill Bob and drink of him,

1104
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,360
his, his, and eat of his body,

1105
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,900
then you'll be as smart.

1106
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,800
Nay! Nay, it's a lie, friends.

1107
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,320
You and Bob, Bob is not smart nor,

1108
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,360
nor intelligent, but only lucky.

1109
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,480
So you don't drink of his brain,

1110
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,200
you drink of his other fluids

1111
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,260
until you have gained some of his luck.

1112
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,760
Drink his spinal fluids for good luck.

1113
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,560
Wear it on your head for good luck.

1114
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,780
His armpits sweat.

1115
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,860
If you can stand his brother Bob when he sneezes,

1116
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,380
you will be able to gain the viruses of Bob's.

1117
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,760
He knew this is most precious.

1118
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,820
Oh, yes, it's milk and fluids.

1119
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,600
If you clean up Bob's bathroom

1120
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,220
after he has finished in there,

1121
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,940
and I think you know what I mean.

1122
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,260
Hey, I just came to clean up.

1123
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,540
No, no, I wouldn't want to do anything like that.

1124
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,480
Just trying to fix the plumbing.

1125
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,420
You will gain his sales acumen.

1126
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,580
I will own the plumbing business

1127
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,260
around the rest of the world.

1128
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,200
I will control the plumbing enterprise of the planet.

1129
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,820
It's true, folks.

1130
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:33,800
You too could be just like the modern lonesome cowboy Dave.

1131
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,120
This paragon of manhood and manly beauty.

1132
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:43,680
This confident and stalwart stud and cool guy.

1133
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,940
All you have to do is to know Dave is to know Bob.

1134
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,280
And to know Bob, you merely must call the secret number.

1135
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,300
Yes, this is a secret.

1136
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,580
Don't tell anybody.

1137
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,820
Turn your radio down.

1138
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,740
Get your pencil out.

1139
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,320
Call this number.

1140
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:05,980
60338.

1141
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,340
Go ahead, kids.

1142
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,980
Give it a try.

1143
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,960
What have you got to lose?

1144
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,000
A little time, maybe?

1145
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,000
You did sign the application.

1146
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,540
Kids, don't forget to get your special Bob Dom's decoder ring

1147
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,060
that explodes in your face for only $49.95.

1148
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:23,860
Call now.

1149
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,860
It works.

1150
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:57,380
Security is about

1151
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1152
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,360
I haven't thought I'd be my angel

1153
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:19,080
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1154
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,300
Little darling, tell me why

1155
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:28,080
I get so cold looking in your eyes

1156
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,400
Is it you?

1157
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,340
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1158
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,200
Baby, is it you?

1159
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1160
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,060
Oh, Earthboy, dream of angel

1161
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:46,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1162
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:50,380
Oh, Earthboy, dream of angel

1163
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1164
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,460
Little baby, leather in place

1165
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,860
Take a minute to wonder

1166
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,960
Space is in its place

1167
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:06,520
Yeah, yeah

1168
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:11,420
Oh, baby, is it you?

1169
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,060
That boy dreamer angel

1170
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,020
guitar solo

1171
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,880
Ah, little darling, show me now

1172
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:02,100
Somewhere, somewhere, somehow, is it you?

1173
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,960
Oh, baby, is it you?

1174
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:05,960


1175
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1176
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,620
That boy dreamer angel

1177
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:22,980
that boy dreamer angel

1178
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:32,320
that boy dreamer angel

1179
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:50,880
Who speaks for Earth?

1180
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:51,800
Earth.

1181
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,460
Who smells for Earth?

1182
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:57,640
Who flies in the face of authority for Earth?

1183
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,680
Why is none of it in the webinar?

1184
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,300
Who's paying the rent on Earth?

1185
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,380
That's the question.

1186
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,640
Who's going to take care of this bill?

1187
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,220
Who's paying to pass by the pretty piggy?

1188
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,080
Well, who will stand for Earth?

1189
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,680
I don't know.

1190
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,280
Maybe me.

1191
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,120
Maybe you.

1192
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,700
Maybe nobody.

1193
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,100
Is that your dog?

1194
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,320
It's really the same song.

1195
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,720
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1196
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,380
No, really, down at the Cleveland Natural History Museum.

1197
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,880
Have you been down there lately, Dave?

1198
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,620
I had a dream I went there.

1199
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,880
No, no, I mean, did you know that they actually had the jawbone of a Yeti?

1200
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,080
Who had the jawbone of a Yeti?

1201
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,900
You're proud city!

1202
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,680
That's worth quite a lot of money.

1203
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,660
Oh, the jawbone of a Yeti!

1204
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,000
A gigant- They call it Gigantopithecus.

1205
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,360
Which is, of course, scientifically inactive.

1206
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:09,260
accurate name it should be referred to as Gigantanthropus. Gigantanthropus?

1207
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:13,480
It's more a primitive man than just merely some animal. Gigantopithecus.

1208
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:20,500
He's a misanthropus. An animal, an animalistic thing. But this is, yes indeed, the jawbone of an ancient yeti.

1209
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,280
And how could you know such a thing? Well it says so right there on the display.

1210
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:30,640
It's the jawbone of an ancient giant yeti? Yes. It is about a foot and a half long.

1211
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,980
Looks like it weighs about seven or eight pounds at least. You lie like dirt.

1212
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:40,600
It's, no I don't. It's, it is, there's a skeleton of a gorilla not far away.

1213
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:44,320
It's conceivable a skeleton of a gorilla. Even with its massive lower mandible.

1214
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:51,620
It is merely but less than half the size of the Gigantanthropus. The prehistoric yeti.

1215
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:57,040
I had a dream about it. We call it prehistoric. Of course the yetis were keeping records long,

1216
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,620
80 million years before humans knew how to pick their prey.

1217
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,200
And they were keeping their noses. Well I had a dream of a yeti.

1218
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,280
And it was a Gigantopithecus. It broke his, misanthropicus erectus.

1219
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,400
And she was cute too. Yeah. She was awful hairy.

1220
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,160
She was the hairiest woman I ever saw. But she was big, wasn't she?

1221
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,760
Yes. And there was something so fragrant about her feet. Muskie.

1222
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:21,700
Oh, muskie. That's too old. Get a whiff of that yeti's.

1223
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,000
Muskie, muskie, muskie. Oh yes, muskie's a natural.

1224
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,520
I don't know what I'm just thinking about.

1225
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,500
Man, feel manly. Let it go yeti girls. Yes sir.

1226
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,760
Okay, keep off her leg.

1227
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,300
Are you man enough for the she yeti?

1228
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,260
Are you man enough for one of her legs?

1229
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:48,920
Are you? You could ride on that leg, boy. You could grab you a tight hold on that mane she's got growing down that leg and ride.

1230
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,680
I've tried to ride her in my dreams. I've tried to ride her off into the sunset singing my Yahoo! Final Darn Year song.

1231
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,620
But it seems to me every time I begin to mouth the love of young, whatever,

1232
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,300
you might need to play.

1233
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,580
I shouldn't do this.

1234
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,020
I asked her her name and in a back-room voice she said,

1235
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:07,660
Wanda.

1236
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:09,840
Wanda.

1237
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,040
Wanda the she yeti.

1238
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,140
Oh my god.

1239
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,920
Wanda of the jungle.

1240
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,560
Wanda of the Himalayas.

1241
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:26,060
I took a walk around in the park. She held my hand. She crushed my wrist. I ran off running. She caught me just like Batman.

1242
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,820
It ain't no fun when a woman can outrun you and tackle you at the same time.

1243
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:33,760
I never was laying on the ground in Central Park and birds twittering around and screaming in pain.

1244
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,660
And this huge, huge female yeti, is she trying to have her way with me?

1245
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,040
Wanda does Dallas.

1246
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,220
Deep Wanda.

1247
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,040
Wanda does Zane.

1248
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,100
Behind the grill.

1249
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:46,780
Wanda.

1250
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:50,820
Behind Wanda's green behind.

1251
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,520
Wanda likes schoolgirl uniforms.

1252
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,180
Yeah, man. If you got... Did you see the latest issue of Yeti?

1253
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,620
Big Yeti.

1254
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,580
I think it was Big Yeti September...

1255
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,760
B-Y, yeah, I said it.

1256
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:06,240
And, man, there was some spread you there, I couldn't believe.

1257
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,060
In fact, it was one of the largest magazines I ever bought.

1258
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,540
We had to get a guy who had, well, he had a Volvo wagon, and we loaded up three or four of them.

1259
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,380
It took half an hour just to get them in the back.

1260
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,440
Oh, yeah, the fold out in the middle is like 30 yards long.

1261
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:24,880
Yeah, we was gonna wallpaper that mansion over on the top of the hill there where, oh, Mr. Hippocasian had lives.

1262
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,600
Oh, those human stroke books, Mike Shepard.

1263
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:29,620


1264
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,520
And we had to throw some pink.

1265
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:31,560
Oh, those.

1266
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,260
But you won't be seeing no pink in Big Yeti magazine.

1267
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,380
No, no.

1268
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,900
It is kind of expensive. They're like $8.95. It's specialty material.

1269
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:48,740
And if you've seen the Yeti binaries on the news, on the internet, you can get you some...

1270
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,800
Boy, there's some pictures out there. It takes about 30 days to download.

1271
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,000
I downloaded them all.

1272
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:54,280
They're so big.

1273
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,180
In my dreams.

1274
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,400
In my dreams.

1275
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,240
Big Yeti.

1276
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,100
Big Yeti.

1277
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,280
Big old Harry.

1278
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:08,940
Because the true women of the Yeti race, the big old Harry, were powerful.

1279
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:14,900
And they could pick us men up by our parts and swing us around their heads.

1280
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,060
And we loved it.

1281
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:16,880
Oh, it hurt.

1282
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,440
Yes, it hurt, but we loved it because they were disciplining us, you see.

1283
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,340
We had discipline in those days.

1284
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,800
The big women.

1285
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,580
The bigger and hairy women.

1286
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,080
The women taught us discipline.

1287
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,320
And we thanked them for it.

1288
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,820
Yes, we got down on our knees and we worshipped them.

1289
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,000
We were polite to a woman in those days.

1290
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,120
And I languished in my Disney's wedding.

1291
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,100
When we exploited a woman with respect for the woman.

1292
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,800
There was no one to blame.

1293
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:53,980
When we, when we disrespected a race of gigantic yetis, we did it out of respect and discipline.

1294
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:55,540
We did it on time.

1295
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,720
Not like these slackers of today.

1296
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:03,120
Yes, in the old days, the very Yeti women.

1297
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,440
On time, always on time.

1298
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,700
Their blood runs thin.

1299
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,020
They have fluorine in their blood.

1300
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,800
They're not like the Yeti of yesteryear, the yester-Yeti.

1301
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,560
But boy, they can make a pickle when they put it under their armpit.

1302
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,280
No, I'm sorry.

1303
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:25,520
I remember that sometimes, when the Yeti women, you could take a whole cucumber and slather it.

1304
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,120
And put it under their armpit.

1305
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,900
And make a pickle in five seconds.

1306
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:42,780
And you too can get a whiff of one of them pickles if you come to the X-Day Drill, July 5th through 7th in Brushwood, New York.

1307
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,480
At Sherman, New York.

1308
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,340
At Sherman.

1309
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,120
That's right.

1310
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,780
You'll find out all about that when you call that phone number.

1311
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,040
Call that important phone number.

1312
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,380
Who Speaks for Earth?

1313
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,780
You can find out at 216-

1314
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,540
216-0338.

1315
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:58,840
Praise Jesus.

1316
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,720
And there ain't no Chinese fire drill, is there, wherever you do stay?

1317
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,740
Oh, hey, did you know that Jesus is now working for the Church of the Sub-Genius?

1318
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:13,020
I had heard that he was not only on the payroll, but that also that he was having eye surgery from some crooked Medicare program he was running.

1319
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,260
Uh, well, that just goes along with the job.

1320
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,020
We like to look after our employees.

1321
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:18,660
But it's true.

1322
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:23,740
The Lord Jesus Christ, who is now about 26 years old in this incarnation.

1323
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,200
26 to 52, somewhere in the middle.

1324
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:31,180
Formerly the owner of the flying, now defunct, flying lemur bookstore.

1325
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,640
Jesus is now, has moved to Dallas.

1326
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,340
Jesus just left Chicago and has moved to Dallas.

1327
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:43,320
And he's, uh, filling the, he's taking over the mail order of the Church of the Sub-Genius, friends.

1328
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:47,480
He's the promotion, he who was foretold by Bob.

1329
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,880
They said he would come wearing one sandal.

1330
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,580
And he would buy a cherry.

1331
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,360
And he would carry it from the Eritreans.

1332
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,920
And they would cheat him.

1333
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,680
And he would be screwed.

1334
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,080
And yet, and yes, it is as the prophecy said, friends.

1335
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,000
Praise Bob!

1336
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,420
We were saved!

1337
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:08,380
The smart money guy finally showed up.

1338
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,000
And this time, he's got connections.

1339
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:12,840
You know what I mean?

1340
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,820
He's got family, if you know what I mean.

1341
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,960
Yeah, the Church of the Sub-Genius has got some new friends.

1342
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,220
What kind of friends?

1343
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:23,560
It's got some new friends.

1344
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,240
He's got some muscle.

1345
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,580
You know, the kind of friends that if you cross Bob the wrong way,

1346
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,340
he may just wake up with cement overshoes at the bottom of the Cuyahoga.

1347
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:37,160
I thought Jesus made down missions to him.

1348
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,980
Jesus was a Capricorn.

1349
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,340
And is just all right with me.

1350
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,700
But, uh, except that, uh, notice that he sheds.

1351
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:50,900
Jesus does.

1352
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,840
Now, he lives at my, at my,

1353
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,980
especially at the Sub-Genius offices.

1354
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,740
He works so hard.

1355
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,460
And he's a really, really, such a martyr.

1356
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,860
He sleeps on the couch.

1357
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,180
But he sheds.

1358
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:04,620
Now that it's summertime in Texas, Jesus is shedding all over the Church.

1359
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:08,580
I can't believe Jesus deflated all over the Church of the Sub-Genius.

1360
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:11,440
You mean all of these bodily hairs are laying around your area there?

1361
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,280
Yeah, they, yes, they are.

1362
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:20,360
All of the above was from ESO Swamp Radio on WCSB Cleveland from the old days.

1363
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,820
The show of the late, incredibly famous, and most famous,

1364
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:22,820


1365
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:22,820


1366
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:22,820


1367
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:22,820


1368
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:22,820


1369
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:22,820


1370
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:22,820


1371
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:22,820


1372
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:22,820


1373
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:22,820


1374
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:22,820


1375
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:26,020
really great Chaz Smith, who also played half the instruments.

1376
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,780
Praise Chaz.

1377
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:33,760
Okay, friends on the internet, where I can flog our swag legally, if you want to help

1378
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,920
yourself and the Church of the Sub-Genius and get a pretty cool package with like 25

1379
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:44,260
different nifty things in it, like pins and bumper stickers and a real preacher card,

1380
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,220
you need to go to subgenius.com and click to become a minister.

1381
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,800
You'll see photos and a list of all the stuff you need.

1382
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:52,800


1383
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:52,800


1384
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:59,040
And you really do get to go to the Scrub Genius Forum, which is members only, and we talk

1385
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,380
in ways that people don't talk on Facebook.

1386
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,820
Much, much smarter ways, ironically enough.

1387
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:05,500
Isn't that funny?

1388
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,340
We also have things like T-shirts and damn near everything you can think of with Bob's

1389
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,060
face on it.

1390
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:17,140
That and a huge selection of other subgenius graphics on coffee mugs and so forth.

1391
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:22,800
And we sell several very weird DVDs and CDs of the Bob's.

1392
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:22,800


1393
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:26,300
And we also have a lot of old MP3 stashes of this show.

1394
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:33,700
And best of all, from our main online store, you can buy the book of the subgenius, which

1395
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:36,140
is by far the greatest thing we have ever done.

1396
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:41,620
It's an actual Simon & Schuster book, 22 bucks, in print for over 30 years.

1397
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:46,700
And every copy that we send out is signed by yours truly.

1398
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:51,340
For that matter, your address on the puffy envelope is handwritten by me also.

1399
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,800
So, uh, yeah.

1400
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,180
Keeps my fingers nimble.

1401
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,600
That's subgenius.com.

1402
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:59,840
And remember, it's only money.
