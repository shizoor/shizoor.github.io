1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
Alright, let's just pick a name at random.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,540
Oh, right, out of the phone book.

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,340
That's a good idea. Leave it to fate.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:05,780
Okay.

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,020
When I stop, you point.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,400
Bob.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:13,980
Great.

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,320
Yes, sir.

9
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,520
Yes, I understand. Goodbye.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,460
He says he's pretty sure this isn't sabotage.

11
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,540
That he thinks there's something far more terrible than that in back of it.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,060
The Soul Genius.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,760
Power of Sack.

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,300
What?

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,040
But why did they come here?

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,040
Well, they're not friendly, we're sure of that.

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,580
No matter what the cost, it must be destroyed.

18
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:44,780
Oh, well.

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,500
Bob and Nipsey's Morning Laugh Factory.

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,200
Apparently Bob and Nipsey couldn't make it tonight, so I accept this award on their behalf.

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,600
That brings us to our final category.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,880
But rather than compete for the coffee service,

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,980
let's take a short break.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,720
And we'll be right back with the Man of the Year Award.

25
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,560
Now the time has come to present Man of the Year Award.

26
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,480
Thank you, Susan.

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,960
As you all know, this award is presented every year

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,340
to the radio personality that brings honor to our medium.

29
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,640
This year, that person is Bob.

30
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,020
They tell us that we lost our tails

31
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,060
Evolving up from little snails

32
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,780
I say it's all just women's tails

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,140
Are we not men?

34
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,020
We are Devo

35
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,480
Are we not men?

36
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,500
We are Devo

37
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,700
Where Penn has all

38
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,440
We're not all

39
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,020
Where Penn has now

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,560
Giacomo

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Are we not men?

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,400
We are Devo

43
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,880
Are we not men?

44
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,940
Navy O's

45
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,040
Navy O's

46
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,060
Oh, we're not men

47
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,320
Navy O's

48
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,100
Monkey men all in business

49
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,720
Teachers and critics

50
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,900
All dance the pooh

51
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,260
Are we not men?

52
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,140
We are Devo

53
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,820
Are we not men?

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,040
Navy O's

55
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,840
Are we not men?

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,620
Navy O's

57
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,100
Our Lord made man

58
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,480
With a simeon hand

59
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,700
And his wolf plan

60
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,880
Along my friend

61
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,060
We walk like apes

62
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,300
Talk like them too

63
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,440
Oh, God made man

64
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,040
With a monkey hand

65
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,740
We're the munchin' pookoo

66
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,680
Oh, God made maaaaan

67
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,100
With a munchin' poookoo

68
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,700
With a munchin' poookoo

69
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,020
craft ash

70
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,160

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:22,040
Go brain

74
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,540
Go brain

75
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,980

We must repeat

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,760

00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:57,460
We must repeat

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:27,760
We must repeat

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:57,720
We must repeat

92
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,760
We must repeat

93
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:57,760
We must repeat

94
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,180
We must repeat

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,540

We must repeat

102
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:14,740
We must repeat

103
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:20,600
Abnormal is right.

104
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,440
The collages in that section were both from the Dr. Musica project,

105
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,900
new contributors,

106
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:34,860
and the song Don't Shoot was the Spud Boys covering that Devo song at the 2010 Devotional.

107
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,000
The song before that was William Devo performing a song Devo, Devo, Devo.

108
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,100
All of those were taken from this year's Devo.

109
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,820
Covers compilation not necessarily beautiful but mutated, produced by Reverend Toth Wilder.

110
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,120
Friends, I had to get away from my cult and take a breather with somebody else's The Devo Cult.

111
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,720
I set out.

112
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:03,840
I make a show from the 2010 Devotional, which is the Devo fan event held here in Cleveland every year.

113
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,640
And there's enough for 300 shows.

114
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:13,940
So just to make it easier, I decided to gather up the Devo covers done by bands that are associated with the Church of the Subgenius.

115
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,160
Here are, for instance, the German Subgenius band Mutate Now.

116
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,820
He's a mad cow mania boy.

117
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,360
He's a mad cow mania boy.

118
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,720
He's a mad cow mania boy.

119
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,920
We're working with him in Coastine City.

120
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:42,920


121
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,600
There's a discoácao.

122
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,420
That is called, To 전� şeyler.

123
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,760
That remember we just played YOUNG OR gaatilij stating that eggs were called Jo sé dè.

124
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,220
Hehee!

125
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,020


126
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,480
and let me tell ya, to75j ko Dana.

127
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:47,500
Talkin' about people with statute of limitations don't really matter.

128
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:47,520


129
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:47,520


130
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,160
Bou vamos.

131
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,180
Bou vamos.

132
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,580
Thoseっていう sth,

133
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,700
he's an everyday man.

134
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:54,700


135
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,380
This is a boy who went too far

136
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,760
Wash his eyes with yellow soap

137
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,920
He stole his daddy's microscope

138
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,380
All alone, in a crowd

139
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,740
Never say his name aloud

140
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,160
Now he wants to know your unit's name

141
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,440
Where you go and whence you came

142
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,960
He's a mecha-mania boy

143
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,800
This is a boy who never goes slow

144
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,360
He is the one who destroys his young

145
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,300
Everybody got a new way to go

146
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,420
All alone, on the telephone

147
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,420
He knows the time you spend at home

148
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh no!

149
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,360
Never say I didn't tell you so

150
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,920
Wash his hands of his daddy's fate

151
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,600
He put himself in an altered state

152
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,380
In a crowd, all alone

153
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,860
No one's laughing anymore

154
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,180
Now he wants to know your unit's name

155
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,660
Where you go and whence you came

156
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,040
He's a mecha-mania boy

157
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,140
All alone, in a crowd

158
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,620
Never say his name aloud

159
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,120
Now he wants to know your unit's name

160
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,460
Where you go and whence you came

161
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,740
He's a mecha-mania boy

162
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,680
In a crowd, all alone

163
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,420
No one's laughing anymore

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:52,420


166
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,640

Let's go!

192

Take a step outside yourself

193

194
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,260
Take a look at who you are

195
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,140
It's pretty scary

196
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,780
You're so silly

197
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,480
Well it's a road thing

198
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,220
You're not much

199
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,440
Yet you're anything

200
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,200
Take a step outside the city

201
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,220
And you turn around

202
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,400
Take a look at what you are

203
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,420
Well it's a road thing

204
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,720
You're really nowhere

205
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,180
You're so wasted

206
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,460
It's full

207
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,920
So foolish

208
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,300
All big talk

209
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,680
Who said don't look back

210
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,800
Don't believe them

211
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,920
You go for that corner seat in a restaurant

212
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,660
Cause they're gonna try and get behind you

213
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,040
Don't you let them do it

214
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,240
You know what I'm talking about

215
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,380
You hear me talking

216
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,420
Well if you're so stupid

217
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,160
You don't have to be a police officer

218
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
It's pretty scary, it's so revolting

219
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,380
Take a step outside the country

220
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,360
Then you turn around

221
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,660
Take a look at where you are

222
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,180
Well it's amazing

223
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,140
Take a good look

224
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,080
You're no big deal

225
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,020
Oh you're so petty

226
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,620
Well it's a laugh

227
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,440
Take a step outside the planet

228
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,000
You turn around and around

229
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,340
Then take a look at where you are

230
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,120
It's pretty scary

231
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,760
I believe Poopy Necropondy and the...

232
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,500
Poopy Necropondy's cream based soup

233
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,760
I believe is coming up next

234
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,060
I believe is coming up next

235
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,440
And I read that in the newspaper by the way

236
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,620
They were in the Cleveland scene

237
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,120
That's how I learned I was supposed to be here tonight

238
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,340
Also, I noticed that there was a listing of the bands that were going to play

239
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,600
And one listing was one of my favorite bands of all time

240
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,800
The Mutant Mountain Boys

241
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,560
Now the funny thing is, in the newspaper, the spelling was a little funny.

242
00:18:51,840 --> 00:19:00,000
They spelled, out of Mutant Mountain Boys, they spelled mountain without the A. So it

243
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,420
sort of looked like it was saying Mutant Mounting Boys.

244
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,160
Now, let me put the apostrophe on it.

245
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,180
Mutant Mountain Boys.

246
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,160
Does that mean they are boys who are mounting mutants?

247
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,380
Well, there's a lot of ways you can take that.

248
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:31,820
And that misspelling was another example of proof that in fact, Devo was right about everything.

249
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,400
I'm sorry if you're not aware of this.

250
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:35,400


251
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:41,800
The band, one of my other favorite bands, the Athery Squash, couldn't be here because

252
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,660
they're from England.

253
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,280
They do a great song called Devo Was Right About Everything.

254
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:59,400
Every time I read Yahoo News.com and then read the comments from the humans at large

255
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,260
that they had at the end of the news stories.

256
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,400
Devo was so funny.

257
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,860
He was very, very right about everything.

258
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:15,020
And it would be sad, but I think we've found a way to live with it, haven't we?

259
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,140
I'm going to keep this short.

260
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,740
I did have one observation.

261
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:29,980
The other day, I was preaching to the Freethinkers, which seems like a contradiction in terms.

262
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,840
It was the Cleveland Freethinkers Club, which means they're mostly a bunch of atheists.

263
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,240
I mean, by definition, they can't believe in Bob, J.R.

264
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,940
Bob Dobson.

265
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,540
This guy was sure.

266
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,880
Can you hear him?

267
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,400
Praise Bob!

268
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,400
Praise Bob!

269
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,560
That's not bad for the tavern part of the room.

270
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,400
That's good.

271
00:20:52,420 --> 00:21:00,780
Anyway, I was preaching to the Freethinkers and telling stories all the insane weirdos,

272
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,360
and insane weirdos that I've met over the years working for Church of the Sentient.

273
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,400
I was a big fan of the Freethinkers.

274
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:05,760
They're a genius.

275
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,660
And, on a couple of occasions, working for that band, the Devo's.

276
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:19,260
Anyway, the guy that invited me to come speak, afterwards, he said,

277
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,260
I need to ask you a question.

278
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,280
When you get into something, say you get some new thing that you're interested in,

279
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:35,220
do you get into it all the way where you just study?

280
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:41,620
Do you study every little detail about that thing that you're into, to the extent that

281
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,740
you're like a complete and utter geek about it?

282
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,320
Well, yeah.

283
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,720
What's behind the Church of the Subgenius doctrine of short duration personal safety?

284
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,660
You know, I can't spend 24-7 worshiping Bob Dobbs.

285
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,920
He's just not that good looking.

286
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,360
Or funny.

287
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,200
Or funny.

288
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:05,600
Or funny all the time.

289
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,440
But, yeah.

290
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:16,660
And I realized that that's a defining feature of a lot of geeks and weirdos is when they

291
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:22,800
get interested in something, they don't just sort of listen to the hearsay about it.

292
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,200
They read the Wikipedia article.

293
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,840
They read every link on the Wikipedia article.

294
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,280
They go out and buy the book about the thing or the ten books about the thing.

295
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,380
They read all of them.

296
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,060
And I've done that my entire life.

297
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,500
It's like, I bet some of you are like that.

298
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,140
Maybe you are.

299
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,920
I've come to think of it, the fact that we're at a devotional that is devoted to this one

300
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,580
band and all the stuff they did.

301
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:58,960
And I would wager that probably most of you here could quote every lyric of every song

302
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,760
of every commercial release and the bootlegs.

303
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,120
And the in-between stuff.

304
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
But, you know, let's face it.

305
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,440
Yeah, sure.

306
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,580
We're geeks.

307
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,520
We're totally.

308
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,200
When you get into something, you leave no stone unturned.

309
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:24,600
Now, I was, I ended up making a list of what were the various things that I've gotten obsessed

310
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,120
with.

311
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:30,660
You know, the devo obsesso as our friend, Reverend Pilmer over there.

312
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,440
Oh, Reverend.

313
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:31,920
I know.

314
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,360
I know.

315
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:32,740
I know.

316
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,740


317
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,740


318
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,740


319
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,740


320
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,740


321
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,740


322
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,740


323
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,740


324
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,740


325
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,740


326
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,740


327
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,740


328
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,740


329
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,740


330
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,820
I know.

331
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,800
I know.

332
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,000
Praise Reverend Pilmer.

333
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,520
Thank you.

334
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:46,820
When I was a little kid in the 1950s, it was monsters.

335
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,300
That was the very first thing that I totally got into.

336
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,020
Monsters.

337
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,340
Dinosaurs, wolf men, Frankensteins.

338
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,780
They hadn't invented the living dead yet.

339
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,200
But you know where I'm coming from.

340
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,940
Monsters.

341
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,460
It got more specific.

342
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:02,720
I mean, I didn't know what I was going to do.

343
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:02,720


344
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:02,720


345
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:02,720


346
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:02,720


347
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:02,720


348
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:02,720


349
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:02,720


350
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:02,720


351
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:02,720


352
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:02,720


353
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,400
I was going to be a Ray Harryhausen monster.

354
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:10,360
In fact, one reason I'm so glad to be at this devo convention is so I can hear some new

355
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,540
music and get Bernard Herrmann's score for Seventh Voyage of Sinbad out of my head.

356
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:24,900
And then after the monsters, I guess I discovered weird rock music.

357
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,820
Frank Zappa and Jimi Hendrix.

358
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,560
There was a time when I was probably one of the world experts.

359
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,620
I'm Jimi Hendrix.

360
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:42,660
Then what was that weird band, the guys that played in the radiation suits?

361
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,740
Oh, Devo.

362
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,260
That's it.

363
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:53,400
That was another thing I was a complete intense fan of to the point that I actually read the

364
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,940
tiny print on the poster on the second album that gave their fan club.

365
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,000
Oh, no.

366
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,720
That was the one that gave my fan club address.

367
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,320
Well, anyway.

368
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,460
One of them had a fan club address and I sent them the very first So Genius pamphlet.

369
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,540
They were such losers.

370
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,700
They wrote me back.

371
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,860
And it was the beginning of a beautiful marriage of horror.

372
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,460
I was also a geek for underground comics like Robert Crumb used to do.

373
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,880
And actually, more Robert Williams was my favorite.

374
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,080
And the...

375
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,960
Anybody here ever heard of the Fireside Theater?

376
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:31,660
Yeah.

377
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:31,940
Yeah.

378
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,300
Yeah.

379
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,300


380
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,520
Yeah.

381
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,900
Anybody here memorize every single line of every Fireside Theater album script?

382
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,220
Yes.

383
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,000
Yes.

384
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,920
Well, I'm getting at it.

385
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,980
Anyway, there's been many things since then.

386
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,240
That was in the old days.

387
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:53,840
My most recent weird geeky obsession has been with microbiology.

388
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,500
My new hobby is monster watching.

389
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,380
But they're very, very tiny monsters.

390
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,720
I'm watching through them.

391
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,440
I'm watching through a microscope.

392
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,260
They're very basic.

393
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,220
They're very Devo, you might say.

394
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,340
Amoebas, permettrees, things like that.

395
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,000
Mosquito larvae.

396
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,920
Kind of cute when you get to know them.

397
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,620
But the bottom line, I think, that was in common throughout all of this stuff, the stuff

398
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:31,700
that the geek gets into, including Devo, the thread that runs through Devo.

399
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:31,700


400
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:31,700


401
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:31,700


402
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:31,700


403
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:31,700


404
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:31,700


405
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:31,700


406
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,760
Monsters.

407
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,580
Do there happen to be any other monster fans in this room tonight?

408
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,600
There's a few, yeah, a few.

409
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,020
A few monster fans.

410
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:49,080
I've looked at my list of great things,

411
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,600
things that I had felt I had to know everything about

412
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,800
or I wouldn't be able to go to sleep and learn those things.

413
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,800
And the bottom line, in the end, I ended up with a formula.

414
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,440
And here's the formula.

415
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,140
Devo equals monsters.

416
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,020
Praise monsters, praise Devo, praise Bob, praise the Devo Show,

417
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,680
and praise this mysterious thing that's about to happen,

418
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,220
which may or may not be,

419
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,140
from right here in Cleveland, friends.

420
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,800
Poopy.

421
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:26,920
Poopy.

422
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,980
Poopy.

423
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,460
Necropondy.

424
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,340
Poopy Necropondy's cream-based soup.

425
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,120
Woo!

426
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,720
Be super!

427
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,240
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

428
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,440
My baby dog.

429
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,960
My baby dog.

430
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,540
My baby dog.

431
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,220
My baby dog.

432
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,360
My baby dog.

433
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,400
My baby dog.

434
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,780
My baby dog.

435
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,080
My baby dog.

436
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,420
You look so good,

437
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,260
baby,

438
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,740
hon.

439
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,980
You feel so big,

440
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,240
dig it off!

441
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,580
You let me have it,

442
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,600
baby dove,

443
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,060
why did you do it, baby dove?

444
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:12,780
Your baby dog.

445
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,580
Your baby

446
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,920
devex you too, your belly's going up-

447
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,680
Baby dog.

448
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:22,760


449
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,580
Why did you do it, baby dove!

450
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,580
My favorite queen knows what she wants

451
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,100
And what I got is what is not

452
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,020
My baby dog

453
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,260
My baby dog

454
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,900
My baby dog

455
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,320
My baby dog

456
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,520
My baby dog

457
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,880
You look so good

458
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,320
You feel so good

459
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,020
You let me have it

460
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,500
Why didn't you do it, baby dog?

461
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,060
Baby dog, you look so good

462
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,780
Baby dog, you feel so good

463
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,220
Baby dog, you let me have it

464
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:23,880
Baby dog

465
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:53,980
Yeah!

466
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:07,060
Sixth grade, I took a D-45 in sixth grade to Mrs. Rowland's music class.

467
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,400
And put it on one of those school-issued deals.

468
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,960
And it gradually began to joco-homo.

469
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,720
And I was just sitting there going,

470
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,060
Oh my God, I'm going to get my ass kicked for this.

471
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,060
And I did.

472
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,100
But it's all good.

473
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,620
Because being a spud, you got to get tempered a little, if you know what I mean.

474
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:35,720
Right?

475
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:41,240
You don't want to skate through with those assholes listening to Halen with the cool hair.

476
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:41,840
Right?

477
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:43,780
All right.

478
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,560
Bye.

479
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,420
Bye.

480
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:57,540
Bye.

481
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,620
Bye.

482
00:30:59,660 --> 00:30:59,820
Bye.

483
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:10,300
There's a vine of heaven waiting in the sky.

484
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,920
Bob in the sky.

485
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,240
Well, I bought the beast MVP.

486
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,760
Yeah.

487
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,060
It was bright and sunny day.

488
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,800
Well, I finished listening to it.

489
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,500
I put on some Q&A.

490
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,020
My turntable started jumping.

491
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,600
What is it I don't know?

492
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,100
Yeah.

493
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,440
Oh, let Bob.

494
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
Okay?

495
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,660
Bob O Spacef.

496
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:09,660


497
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:09,660


498
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,260
God bless you all.

499
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:20,480
Have a nice day.

500
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:30,940
Well, I bought a second coffee

501
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,720
Mr. Toothbread, I expressed

502
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:42,980
My girlfriend came home to me

503
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,120
She started taking off her dress

504
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,240
Oh, yeah, she must come in

505
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,500
I said, call me

506
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,420
With a sweet ass country voice

507
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:02,180
I just told her

508
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,660
Gotta wait now, girl

509
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,860
I'm listening to freedom of choice

510
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,900
Mm-hmm, where your record

511
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,760
Be unbroken

512
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,760
Bye, bye, bye, bye

513
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,220
Bye, bye, bye, bye

Bye, bye, bye, bye

Never find a

00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,000
Never wait

521
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,560
In the sky

522
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,040
By me in the sky

523
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,020
Now I know I

524
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,400
Ain't no young ass

525
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,100
One day I'm gonna

526
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,420
Be old

527
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,320
Got that

528
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,620

Deeper

530

Freeland

531
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,360
Now I can't

532
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,900
Be told

533
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,700
But I got my

534
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,600
High five

535
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,500
Got my

536
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,220
Doobie

Got my

538
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,200
Albums in my lap

539
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,740
Should I

540
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,420
Ever

541
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,340
Be

542
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,080
Unbroken

543
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,080


544
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,080


545
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,660
Lose my way now

546
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,040
But I do well

547
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,220
I got smooth noodle maps

548
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,820
Mm-hmm, come on

549
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,580
May your record

550
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,340
Be unbroken

551
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,540
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, and bye

552
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,420
There's a vital

555
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,140
By me in the sky

556
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,660
One more time

557
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,080
There's a vital

558
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,680
May your record

559
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,460
Be unbroken

560
00:35:55,080 --> 00:36:00,160
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, and bye

561
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,720
Cause there's something

562
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,120
For everybody

563
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,740
In the sky

564
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:15,820
Bye, bye, bye, and the sky

565
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,040
In the sky

566
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,060
In the sky

567
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,060


568
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,880
In the sky

569
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:26,880


570
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:26,880


571
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:26,880


572
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:26,880


573
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:26,880


574
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,000
May your records

575
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,920
Be unbroken

576
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,780
That was Reverend Robin Rene singing in The Mutant Mountain Boys.

577
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:39,300
The lyrics of that song incorporate every Devo album and numerous song titles.

578
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:39,800
Tricky.

579
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,920
And now from the devotional, Jerry Casale and the amino acids.

580
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,620
Well, mostly the amino acids.

581
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,940
Get the amino fucking acids!

582
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,620
We've got amino acids up here so we can all get some

583
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,100
commingling of bodily fluids going.

584
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,200
B tens

585
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,300
B tens

586
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,740
B tens

587
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,820
B tens

588
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,720
B tens

589
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,880
B tens

590
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,480
B tens

591
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,140
Bens

592
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,980
Bens

593
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,620
Bens

594
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,380
Bens

595
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:13,380


596
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:13,420
Bens

597
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:13,420


598
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:13,980
Bens

599
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,840
Bens

600
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,360
Bens

601
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,360


602
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,360


603
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,360


604
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,360


605
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,360


606
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,600
Bens

607
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:15,600


608
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,260
guitar solo

609
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:45,880
solo

610
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,820
There's a few remaining survivors

611
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,340
of the search party that was attacked.

612
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,940
They wanted to at least be uncovered

613
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,000
but many times the size they expected.

614
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,000
indicating that the monster has some strange power of rapid growth.

615
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,940
Exact description was...

616
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,160
The evolution just received.

617
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,480
According to a report not yet confirmed,

618
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,600
a beast of seemingly gigantic proportions

619
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,280
has been sighted lurking in the hills due northeast of town.

620
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,220
City officials have called for military help.

621
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,660
Planes and troops are expected to arrive within the next two hours.

622
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,200
Meanwhile, citizens should take rest within places of safety.

623
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,720
Cellars, farm shelters, as directed by civil defense and military,

624
00:38:43,720 --> 00:39:13,680
are expected to be evacuated.

625
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,700
Thanks for watching!

626
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:13,680
Thanks for watching!

627
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,740
Thanks for watching!

628
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,940
Thanks for watching!

629
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:29,980
Thanks for watching!

630
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,020
Thanks for watching!

631
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,400
Thanks for watching!

632
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,080
But with former members of the late clay animations band Indian Roadburn,

633
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,680
this is Psycho Charger.

634
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,380
Psycho Charger

635
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,240
Psycho Charger

636
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,600
Psycho Charger

637
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:24,800
Psycho Charger

638
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,880
Psycho Charger

639
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:37,620
Psycho Charger

640
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:42,740
Psycho Charger

641
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,720
Psycho Charger

642
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:13,700


643
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,700
Psycho Charger

644
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:26,540


645
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,100
Psycho Charger

646
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,220
Psycho Charger

647
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,980
Psycho Charger

648
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:37,300
Psycho Charger

649
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:42,680
Psycho Charger

650
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,700
But the Earth is all we know

651
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,740
We made a plane out of human waste

652
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,760
Just to wait against our steel

653
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,380
A man is real, not made of steel

654
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,020
But the Earth is all we know

655
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,140
We made a plane out of human waste

656
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,100
Just to wait against our steel

657
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,320
The beginning was the end

658
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,800
Of everything now

659
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,480
The ape regards his tail

660
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,620
He's stuck on it

661
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,480
It beats until he fails

662
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,480
Half a ghoul and half a god

663
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,400
A man's not made of steel

664
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,560
Twist away, now twist and shout

665
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,700
The Earth, it moves too slow

666
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,740
But the Earth is all we know

667
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,820
We made a plane out of human waste

668
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:13,020
Just to wait against our steel

669
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,480
A man is real, that's how he feels

670
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,820
The Earth, it moves too slow

671
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:24,460
It beats until he fails

672
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:28,240
The Earth, it moves too slow

673
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,380
It beats until he fails

674
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,460
The Earth, it moves too slow

675
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:39,440
It beats until he fails

676
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,620
It beats until he fails

677
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,220
It beats until he fails

678
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,100
It beats until he fails

679
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,660
It beats until he fails

680
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,960
It beats until he fails

681
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,780
Well, that's just great, Bob.

682
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,180
Yeah, congratulations.

683
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,400
Do you know where we are?

684
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,220
Louisiana.

685
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,340
No, I know Louisiana, but...

686
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,720
It's near the border of Texas.

687
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,340
Ah! You see? Texas!

688
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,780
I knew this, eh?

689
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,520
Texas, near!

690
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:10,820
Remember!

691
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,900
Well, I propose a toast.

692
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:14,800
Yeah, thank you.

693
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:14,900
To Bob.

694
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,800
Oh, my friend.

695
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,180
Oh, thank you.

696
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,500
Thank you.

697
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,760
Thank you.

698
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,720
Yeah.

699
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,400
What's up,із!

700
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:09,400


701
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:09,420
I повернулся,

702
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:09,420


703
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,360
All their experimentation

704
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,480
Go through some commutation

705
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:19,960
We're on default

706
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,880
They all under

707
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,700
Go down, down

708
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,300
They all under

709
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,820
They all under

710
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,740
They all under

711
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,100
Go down

712
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:52,160
They all under

713
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,060
Under, under, under

714
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,540
Down under where the lights are low

715
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,300
Two place where the memes go

716
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,120
Two things I never did before

717
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,200
Inside I've come back for more

718
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,880
A little girl before I lived

719
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,780
Never knew it could be like this

720
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,640
You put me in a situation

721
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,360
Go through some commutation

722
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,260
Down under where the lights are low

723
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,060
Two place where the memes go

724
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,920
Two things I never did before

725
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,880
Inside I've come back for more

726
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,580
A little girl before I lived

727
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,640
Never knew it could be like this

728
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,400
You put me in a situation

729
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,080
A little girl before I lived

730
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,000
Down under where the lights are low

731
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,680
Two place where the memes go

732
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,500
Two things I never did before

733
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,700
Inside I've come back for more

734
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,360
This girl was for a lift

735
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,140
Never knew I could be like this

736
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,740
You put me in a situation

737
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,760
Gone through some complications

738
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,740
You're not there

739
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,600
You're not there

740
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,480
You're not there

741
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,980
You're not there

742
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,040
When you pick up

743
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,140
The Demoman

744
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:44,360
We like crazy music

745
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,460
Do you like crazy music?

746
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:35,660
Do you like crazy music?

747
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,160
Do you like crazy music?

748
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:56,040
Do you like crazy music?

749
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:35,660
Do you like crazy music?

750
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:58,020
Do you like crazy music?

751
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,680
Do you like crazy music?

752
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:58,040
Do you like crazy music?

753
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,020
Do you like crazy music?

754
00:53:35,700 --> 00:54:05,220
Do you like crazy music?

755
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:35,680
Do you like crazy music?

756
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,220
Do you like crazy music?

757
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:46,240
It's a beautiful world we live in

758
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,780
A sweet romantic place

759
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:53,980
Beautiful people everywhere

760
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,860
The way they show they care

761
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,780
Makes me want to say

762
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,160
It's a beautiful world

763
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:05,680
It's a beautiful world

764
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,960
