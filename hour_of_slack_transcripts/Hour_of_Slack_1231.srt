00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
The Skulls of Genius

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,480
Praise Bob!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,120
Praise Bob!

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,620
From PR News in Washington, I'm killed and wounded.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,400
The President is announcing billions of government grants today to speed the process along.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,220
The grants will go to a hundred different states.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,540
On Wall Street, 6 to 9, 99, 5, 37, 37.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,160
The War Crimes Board reported today that this is PR News.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,600
The Obama Administration is reporting that nothing changes.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,760
The report says that nothing changes.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,780
The U.S. military in Afghanistan says it is time to update the government

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,040
to make PR's reports cheaper for aging leader Harry Reid,

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,060
and PR News was once again absent.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,500
This is London.

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,280
This is London.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,280
Sink into the abyss of a new dark age,

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,220
made more sinister and perhaps more protracted

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,060
by the likes of perverted science.

19
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,300
The Skulls of Genius.

20
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,100
Power of Science.

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,520
This was their finest hour.

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,500
TSA notification of brain inspection.

23
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,200
To protect you...

24
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,440
and your fellow Americans,

25
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,840
the TSA,

26
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,240
Telepathic Security Agency,

27
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,800
is required by law to inspect all citizens' brains on a daily basis.

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,800
As part of this process,

29
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,980
some brains are opened and physically inspected.

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,660
Your brain was among those selected for physical inspection.

31
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,440
During the inspection,

32
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,500
your brain and its contents may have been searched for prohibited ideas or thought crimes.

33
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,140
At the completion of the inspection,

34
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,200
the contents were returned to the public.

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,580
The TSA is required to inspect your brain.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,200
If the security officer was unable to open your brain for inspection because of your cranium,

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,460
the officer may have been forced to break your skull open.

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,020
The TSA sincerely regrets having to do this.

39
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:15,800
However, the TSA is not liable for any damage to your skull resulting from this necessary security precaution.

40
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,000
Your government thanks you for your continued compliance, cooperation, and complacency.

41
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,540
Have a good day.

42
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,360
On Exchange Day and Pop Culture Week

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,720
Speaking on the blinking screen

44
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,180
Inspecting

45
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,880
The indirect media

46
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:41,880


47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:41,920
In vÃ¤ldigt

48
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,860
You're fired!

49
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,900
You're fired!

50
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,980
You know your locker at the club, Bob.

51
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,500
You're fired!

52
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,580
I'm talking about 40 million

53
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,740
Deutsche Werke, Bob!

54
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,620
40

55
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,020
million Deutsche Werke, Bob!

56
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,400
Hello. This is Mr. Dodd.

57
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,800
This is not science fiction. This is real.

58
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,100
This is real.

59
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,380
The Hitchcock's are appearing in the sky.

60
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,440
Break it for me.

61
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,720
You can see them outside this window

62
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,540
at the right location, at the right position.

63
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,000
But you know when I first

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,500
became aware of

65
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,720
the Genius Foundation, you know,

66
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,380
Radio Ministry Hour of Black,

67
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,420
and you know, and the literature,

68
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,940
it all seemed like science fiction, and at first

69
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,520
you know, it's hard

70
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,080
to believe, to want to

71
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,060
believe that it's more like

72
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,900
because at first it seemed like science

73
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,860
fiction mixed with religion.

74
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,760
But now, this time

75
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,040
period in which everything

76
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,560
is playing out, UFOs are appearing in the sky

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,400
right before you, and it's up close and personal.

78
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,800
You know, you think twice about,

79
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,380
because you, because you live, because you brought up

80
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,100
and it

81
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,420
It may be weird to you, but it is my religion.

82
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,320
It's about time, it's about space,

83
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,660
about strange people in a strange place.

84
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,460
It's about time, it's about flight,

85
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,900
traveling faster than the speed of light.

86
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,600
It's about time, it's about space,

87
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,960
about strange people in a strange place.

88
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,520
We're here.

89
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,760
It's about time, it's about flight,

90
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,200
traveling faster than the speed of light.

91
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:16,980
MMMMBOB

92
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,020
Squity, squity, squity, love my little squity,

93
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,680
squity, squity, squity, rock and roll.

94
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,740
Squity, squity, squity, love my little squity,

95
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,460
squity, squity, squity, rock and roll.

96
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,300
That put the frothy head on a beer of Nazi laughter.

97
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,220
And they, I mean, Bob, this is getting bad.

98
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,700
The key to all of this is money.

99
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,580
Man, I wish I had a nickel for every bag of nickels I have.

100
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,300
That's a lot of nickels.

101
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,960
Let's count them.

102
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,340
He is rock and roll and swag.

103
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,800
I shaved my head.

104
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,060
I shaved my head.

105
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,500
I shaved my head.

106
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,760
I shaved my head.

107
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,960
Praise Bob and all his years.

108
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,920
Large.

109
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,620
What if Bob was one of us?

110
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,820
Oh, what if, what if, what if?

111
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,120
Friends, oh, well, well, well.

112
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,680
We're back on the air live and it's lunch drive time.

113
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,700
Oh, boy.

114
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,320
And welcome to our event.

115
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,280
Slack number 1,231.

116
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,420
Oh, we're so jolly and happy here at the station

117
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:11,240
as we dig through the lists of wonders that we can offer you.

118
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,780
When you pledge, that's right.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,800
Yes, friends, you know, here at Hour of Slack,

120
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,260
sure, we can put together shows made of the corpses of other shows,

121
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,100
but it's best to do it live.

122
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,320
And it's just not the same.

123
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,940
It's not the same without a radio station.

124
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,240
You know, it's hard to do a live show without a radio station.

125
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,480
And not every radio station is going to let us do these kinds of shows.

126
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,120
No same.

127
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:49,040
I don't have to tell you that wherever you are, whatever town you're in,

128
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,340
you've probably only got one or two good stations, if any.

129
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,640
And none of them are the commercial stations, right?

130
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,900
Well, you know, we dole out the word of Bob

131
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,800
and the music of all these bands and such like and so forth

132
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,080
for pretty much next to nothing, but it ain't really nothing.

133
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,760
And that's why I'm going to ask the true subgeniuses

134
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,800
and the false subgeniuses and everybody who hates the church and subgenius

135
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,860
to call into this station.

136
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,820
I'm going to give you that number.

137
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,240
That's...

138
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,440
I bet you can remember that and I won't have to say it over and over again.

139
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,940
In the 216 area code.

140
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,020
See, you can remember that.

141
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,800
It ain't that easy.

142
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,600
For the $10 pledge, friends, for $10 you get the subgenius book

143
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,280
called Pamphlet No. 2.

144
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,640
It's a 16-page book and, you know,

145
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,280
the way we used to do things when we were younger,

146
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,060
we used really small print.

147
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,440
So it takes about a month to read this 16-page booklet,

148
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,320
which you will get for only your $10 pledge.

149
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,060
But get this.

150
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,680
Imagine if you had $15 in your pocket.

151
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,780
Now, I know for most of you that's vast riches you can hardly imagine,

152
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:25,040
but just if you had that $15 and could send it to this station

153
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,620
or bring it to the open house coming up,

154
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,880
November 20th and November 22nd, Kennedy Day,

155
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,220
we'll be here to see you and take your money personally.

156
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,680
That is me, Reverend I.D. Stang, Princess Wee.

157
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,680
Dr. Sinister will be here.

158
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,200
Last time I was at open house, I met Dr. Sinister's dad,

159
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,260
who was younger than me.

160
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,600
Kind of depressing.

161
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,820
Anyway, friends, for $15 you get the subgenius pamphlet

162
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,200
as well as a WCSB premium.

163
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,460
Yes, the WCSB premium.

164
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,680
Now, get this, friends.

165
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:05,640
The $15 premiums include an ashtray for your drugs from WCSB.

166
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,860
I mean, the ashtray has a WCSB logo.

167
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,360
The drugs, you have to get those at the convenience store.

168
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,580
You can get a T-shirt of your own pick.

169
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,800
For instance, there's a Day of the Dead T-shirt,

170
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,500
but you'd have to come to the open house to get that.

171
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,160
You can get two VHS tapes for your $15 pledge.

172
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,340
VHS.

173
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,520
Remember that?

174
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,200
That's the kind that will continue to play

175
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,640
no matter how many scratches it has on it.

176
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,740
And they have some nice bad film here,

177
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,380
the kind that subgeniuses like.

178
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,680
There's an Elvira tape.

179

00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,120
The remake, unfortunately.

185
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,720
Things to Come.

186
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,640
The original.

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,440
Things to Come.

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,520

Those are all available.

190
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,300
For just a $15 pledge, you can get the subgenius pamphlet and two movies.

191
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,980
For $20, friends.

192
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,320
$20!

193
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,700
Which you can spend by calling...

194
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,580
For only $20, we will give you, as a subgenius premium,

195
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,520
a CD called Devival, Then Fire.

196
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,240
Conspiracy.

197
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,600
Conspiracy.

198
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,600
Something, something.

199
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,520
It's one of the few DVD subgenius CDs

200
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,360
that was produced by somebody else besides us.

201
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,420
It's got me preaching in Madison, Wisconsin.

202
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,320
And Dr. Legume preaching in Madison, Wisconsin.

203
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,840
Hello to WORT in Madison, Wisconsin.

204
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,700
Friends, now, when I tell you to pledge to your station

205
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,760
from the one I'm talking from,

206
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,840
of course I mean WCSB in Cleveland.

207
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,100
But if some...

208
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,260
If you're on a show that's...

209
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,280
Some station that syndicates this show,

210
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,820
that plays it in syndication,

211
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,560
why, you could donate to that station.

212
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,320
But my dear friends by internet,

213
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,340
and I see that there's quite a few of you

214
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,460
all over the world listening by internet.

215
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,080
Now, you can call 216...

216
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,640
If you spend $20,

217
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,380
you can get any number of CDs

218
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,160
as well as the subgenius CD.

219
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,040
Including...

220
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,900
Now, then, you subgeniuses listen,

221
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,600
because there's...

222
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:25,980
We've...

223
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,460
For real, these...

224
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,840
We only have one each of these in the station.

225
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,660
But I went through the premiums

226
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,340
to pick the ones that you would be interested in.

227
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,260
For instance, this CD,

228
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,800
The Billy Nair Show,

229
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,480
American Astronaut,

230
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,120
as seen at X Day.

231
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,140
We actually had that band played

232
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,140
and showed the movie American Astronaut

233
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,020
three X Days ago.

234
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,280
Goat Horror.

235
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
I've never heard them, but I love the name.

236
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
GWAR CD,

237
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,160
called Beyond Hell, is available.

238
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,240
Notice that I'm only reading out the names of bands

239
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,300
that we are friends with.

240
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,340
Kirkendall Void, from here in Cleveland area.

241
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,780
Their CD, Graveyard of Go-Go, is here.

242
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,260
Only one, with your $20 pledge to Hour of Slack.

243
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,180
KMFDM,

244
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,660
Tohu Vabahu is here.

245
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,560
That CD.

246
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,240
Reverend Paul Krasner's comedy album,

247
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,460
We Have Vays of Making You Laugh,

248
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,200
is here.

249
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,360
Princess We is here.

250
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,700
Oh, but she's not a CD that you can have.

251
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,760
Oh, and Dave has called.

252
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,140
Let's see what happens if we poke Dave.

253
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,420
Is Dave in here yet?

254
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,900
He's in here.

255
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,380
Oh, there's Dave. Okay.

256
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,220
But where is in here?

257
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,920
In here is where you can also find a CD of Negative Land.

258
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,900
A big 10-8 place.

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,100
My favorite Negative Land CD for your $20 pledge.

260
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,320
A wonderful, horrific living room of the mind

261
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,700
for you, available for a limited time only.

262
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,700
But it's only a limited time.

263
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,140
Isn't it?

264
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,560
It's, well, you know, Dave,

265
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,360
we're all on limited time.

266
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,540
Except for those who have become subgenius ministers.

267
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,500
They live forever.

268
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,140
In the minds of others, but not...

269
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,720
No, no, they live forever physically in heaven on earth.

270
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,660
You mean everything I've hoped and prayed for for so long

271
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,280
is actually true and available for a limited time

272
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,940
only from a church of the subgenius?

273
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,420
Yeah.

274
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,220
Okay.

275
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,440
But we can't advertise,

276
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,440
we can't advertise Church of the Subgenius materials

277
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,240
unless they're pledge premiums for WCSB,

278
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,560
which they are.

279
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,660
In fact, for $25 pledge,

280
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,540
you get Arise, the subgenius DVD.

281
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,040
Yes, Arise, the subgenius DVD.

282
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,020
And any pledge on up.

283
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,460
I mean, even if you pledge more than $25,

284
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,280
you'll still get Arise or and, and,

285
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,820
not just that subgenius premium,

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,580
but you also get the tote bag,

287
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,420
the WCSB tote bag.

288
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:56,900
The tote bag.

289
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,820
It's beautiful.

290
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,440
It's hairy, it's wrinkled.

291
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,240
You can put cabbages in there.

292
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,920
You can tote them everywhere.

293
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,400
Yes, I'm sorry.

294
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,780
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.

295
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,040
When I think of them, all of a sudden,

296
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,860
all these images start coming in my mind,

297
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,740
and I just wish I could pledge something because,

298
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,340
well, I mean, I do want to pledge to every pledger

299
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,860
that I will personally extrameditate upon them

300
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,400
getting slack for one solid month.

301
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,420
That doesn't mean it's going to happen,

302
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,420
but, you know, I'm going to pledge to them.

303
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,060
You know, often people, when they expect your pledges,

304
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,020
they offer prayers for you to some deity or thing like that.

305
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,400
That's right.

306
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,000
We'll pray for you, and we'll play with ourselves for you.

307
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,440
And you must remember about...

308
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,400
We'll pray with you.

309
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:39,800
Exactly.

310
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,860
We'll play with yourself.

311
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,520
We're sitting across from the same table.

312
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,420
I mean, there's not too many places we can go.

313
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,880
We can play footsie, or we can put up where we shut up,

314
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,380
exactly in the evacuation parts.

315
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,340
And think about it.

316
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,340
When the only truth you can get on radio,

317
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,240
is a damn comedy show.

318
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,640
You know, don't you think that's worth something?

319
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,520
Comedy show?

320
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,100
Well, the station also has comedy shows.

321
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,760
That's true.

322
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,700
Oh, what? The conspiracy has comedy shows?

323
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,400
And the station even has, I think, some sort of humorous show.

324
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,360
Now, this happens to be a religious program.

325
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,760
Oh, okay.

326
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,620
I didn't know you were doing that tonight.

327
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:21,780
Well, we do.

328
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,120
That's all we ever did.

329
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,320
This is the only thing we ever did.

330
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,080
This is a religious show.

331
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,320
But it is a pledge drive.

332
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,220
This is the only time when we get to act like Christian preachers,

333
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,840
and hit you up for money.

334
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,340
Because normally, this is a public supported station,

335
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,040
and we don't really advertise per se.

336
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,860
I'm going to actually ask that the hand of Bob comes out.

337
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,380
That the pipe, even super eternally, comes out of his mouth,

338
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,320
which is impossible to begin with.

339
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,040
Comes out and offers you slack,

340
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,240
if you can get off your big, fat, rosy duff,

341
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,500
and move yourself to an area where your cell phone can actually be received,

342
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,940
and call, what's the number?

343
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,200
6900 in the 216 area code.

344
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,680
And if you can't remember 6900, then you're way behind.

345
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,620
And I can see those listeners out there,

346
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,340
with their finger hovering over that little push button phone,

347
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,340
trying to figure out, well, dude, can I really spare $50, or even $5?

348
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,440
Just to get me a little bit of money.

349
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:39,360
And then, if you can't remember $50,

350
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,360


351
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,360


352
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,200
for a $50,

353
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,320
for a $50,

354
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,380
for a $50,

355
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:40,380


356
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:40,380


357
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:40,380


358
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:40,380


359
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:40,440


360
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,740
for a $50,

361
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:52,340
for a $50,

362
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,860
we're going to tax you.

363
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,380
And you can have that,

364
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,620
and a Subgenius CD,

365
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,280
D-Vival CD.

366
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,700
And the love of your favorite, hot, other-sex babe person.

367
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,240
Now, get this Dave.

368
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,580
I'm sorry.

369
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,980
Get this Dave.

370
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,560
You might,

371
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,560
if you had $20, you'd probably wanna spend that,

372
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,240
because not only would you get the Subgenius CD, D-Vival, then Fire,

373
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,820
you would also get,

374
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,320
your choice of e-book,

375
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:29,000
Either a big old beer mug, the CSB beer mug, or the Sin Pack.

376
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,060
Now, get this, friends, brothers, sisters, listen to me.

377
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:38,220
This is the only church, the only radio station that offers you a Sin Pack as a pledge premium.

378
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,380
I bet you want to know what's in that Sin Pack besides condoms.

379
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,400
Well, actually, there are no condoms in it, although I suppose I could throw in a Connie condom with Connie's face on it.

380
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,260
But the Sin Pack has a WCSB ashtray for your ashes and your drugs.

381
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,340
You can haul your ashes into that tray.

382
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,180
It's got a beer cozy.

383
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:06,380
If you're the kind that has to keep your beer cold because it takes you so long to drink it, then you get that, and you also get a shot glass.

384
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,800
A shot glass, a beer cozy, and an ashtray.

385
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,860
All in one, that's a Sin Pack.

386
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,220
And we'll throw in a Connie condom if you mention it to us, friends.

387
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,160
That is one of the most beautiful marketing plans.

388
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:26,900
I've ever heard in my life an actual Sin Pack consisting of everything that you're going to need for a debauched or semi-debauched or even a flash of evening at home,

389
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,740
as so many radio listeners are today.

390
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:39,140
When they feel the hand of Bob come down and stroke the center of their forehead and push the palm of his hand slightly up towards their third nostril,

391
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,920
they're going to know.

392
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,500
There is no more money.

393
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,340
Please, please, please pledge by calling this number.

394
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,160
It's 6900.

395
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,080
And don't miss the opportunity.

396
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,940
Sire, we've got to get some money.

397
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,480
Don't miss the opportunity.

398
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,100
Please act now.

399
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,200
Don't blow it.

400
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,660
Act while actions are so irrelevant.

401
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,000
Think of it.

402
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,160
We live in a bull-dodger world.

403
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,280
What sort of meaning could you extract from your life, you stupid one?

404
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,340
Excuse my language.

405
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:13,940
I'm sorry.

406
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,240
I didn't mean that.

407
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,880
I mean a couple of maximum, but you know what I'm saying, don't you?

408
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,260
Please, please excuse me.

409
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,820
You know what I'm saying.

410
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,300
Just put it up.

411
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,680
Come on.

412
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,180
Get up off that chair.

413
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,360
Follow me.

414
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,860
Now you can have something to sell.

415
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,240
We all know we're in the art of selling.

416
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,720
We create a mental and an emotional climate of unconscious selling.

417
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,120
Right in your own home.

418
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,220
Right in this radio station, friends.

419
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,100
That is where we're selling.

420
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,180
You on yourself.

421
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,280
And your pride.

422
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,800
In stationery.

423
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,360
Not stationary, but this station.

424
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:57,480
Think of this beautiful, humongous, living room, church, comedy, whatever you choose to call it.

425
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,620
And how long it has served your needs as an aborigine.

426
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,940
I mean, as an abnormal.

427
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,660
How long it has serviced your needs as a Hunan bean.

428
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,700
Or another saucer gravy.

429
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,820
You've been around for long enough to know that if you only pledge,

430
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,260
you'll never be able to get it.

431
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,460
You'll never be able to get it.

432
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:16,460


433
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:16,460


434
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:16,460


435
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:16,460


436
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:16,460


437
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:23,640
And some miraculous, miraculous toys, presents, supernatural powers are going to be at your disposal.

438
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,940
Just like the ways disposals use it at home.

439
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,900
At least for a limited time only.

440
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,380
Because after tonight, this pledge-a-thon may be temporarily over until the next one.

441
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:44,580
So please, friends, if you've got anything to do, make sure one of the things that you do do,

442
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,780
is call this number.

443
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,640
And the message is 6900.

444
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,560
And pledge your life if need be.

445
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,500
I'm overcome.

446
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,800
Dave, Dave, it's good.

447
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,420
No, don't, really, please don't come over the keyboard.

448
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,220
You have to have shoes, handles, forbearance.

449
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,400
They mean foreskins.

450
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,020
Many of them are totally alarmed.

451
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,040
They're left alone for too long.

452
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,660
That's not.

453
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,260
That's not.

454
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,680
Some of them need.

455
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
They have so many needs out there.

456
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,660
I mean, I know that it's a luxury to help the station, friends.

457
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,000
But what is it a luxury?

458
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,080
Is staying warm a luxury?

459
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,220
No, it's a necessity.

460
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,140
Winter's coming on.

461
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,180
So you're going to need that beautiful green coach's jacket with that WCSB logo.

462
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,100
It's such a great pickup object for your $40 pledge.

463
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,340
Oh, yes.

464
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,220
And if later on in the winter, it's going to get even colder and you're going to need

465
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,800
that hoodie with your $50 pledge to 6900.

466
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,600
And when you prance around your local dairy mart or, I don't know, commercial product,

467
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,620
your actual, do they still do it?

468
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,060
Quickie Mart.

469
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,360
You can say Quickie Mart.

470
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,100
Boobie Mart.

471
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:10,740
When you go to your local small area there, you're going to look really styling down to

472
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,860
the, I'm sorry, man, I'm losing it.

473
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:19,760
Friend, you don't want to be like Dave, losing it all over the airwaves, losing your dignity,

474
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,220
sneezing your dignity onto the airwaves of Northern Ohio and the world.

475
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,560
But I'd look so much better in a CSB hoodie, though.

476
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,760
Maybe that would take a little bit off.

477
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,100
Now, look, we're starting to get calls in from far, far away.

478
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:43,300
For instance, here's Wombat Diaz, the good Reverend Wombat Diaz out of Sacramento, California.

479
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:43,800
He's a corny.

480
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,920
Make her a fine guano.

481
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,900
He's managed to put out that $20.

482
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:53,880
Now, he can't even come to WCSB's open house on November 8th, or I mean November 20th and

483
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:00,880
November 22nd, Kennedy Day, to meet a Reverend Stang, Princess Wee, and Lonesome Cowboy Dave's

484
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,520
ghost or spirit or cat or something.

485
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,960
But yet, he will get that GWAR CD, so nobody else can get it now.

486
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,340
All of these are priceless originals right now.

487
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,500
Now, I mean, just think of what you could probably do with these things on the Internet

488
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,480
or probably in the bathroom if you have the mind to.

489
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:27,180
Any object you're going to receive in return for your gracious, generous offering of support

490
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,300
for Station WCSB 89.3 in Cleveland.

491
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:38,720
By the way, listeners and Dave, I want you to know that just in case you were thinking,

492
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,380
well, this is a pretty popular show.

493
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,040
They probably are doing pretty well.

494
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,900
I mean, I probably don't need to, you know, they don't need it that bad.

495
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,720
Well, guess what?

496
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,200
That name I just read, that's the only caller.

497
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,320
Oh.

498
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,520
The only one.

499
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,540
We've got one.

500
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,600
Oh, wait.

501
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,460
No, no, I'm wrong.

502
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:01,580
Princess Wee does, the beautiful Princess Wee has brought in two more.

503
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,320
Oh, my God.

504
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,440
Two entire pledges.

505
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,700
The praise mark of Euclid and praise Joe.

506
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,680
He's a true Joe.

507
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:13,600
Friends.

508
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,220
I guess we're winning in New Hampshire and I'm sure we're going to close the gap soon.

509
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,760
Whatever kind of gap we're trying to close.

510
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,000
Mind the gap.

511
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,340
Friends, my brothers and sisters in England, we'll take your euros.

512
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,540
We'll take any kind of money.

513
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:35,300
We'll take YAP money, the giant stone disks that are used for money on the island of Yap.

514
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,040
We'll take YAP money.

515
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,060
We'll take confessions.

516
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,100
We'll take prayers.

517
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,420
We'll take your love.

518
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,180
We'll take your.

519
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,780
We'll take your trust and abuse it.

520
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,520
Well, no, we won't abuse your trust because, you know.

521
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,960
Well, we did once.

522
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,240
Who can you?

523
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,900
But that's another story.

524
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,760
That was so long ago.

525
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
Remember the chest merkins?

526
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,940
Until the rupture, who can you trust?

527
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,060
Who can you trust?

528
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,380
But J.R. Bob Dobbs.

529
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,760
Especially if you've got a herniated area down there, which brings me back again to,

530
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:11,420
I'm sorry so many of you were disappointed last year when the WCSB chest merkins,

531
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,180
which really did.

532
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:13,560
They do exist.

533
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,480
Oh, I forgot about the merkins.

534
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,280
We, yeah, we don't have those this year.

535
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,000
And we're a little bit backed up.

536
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,260
So in other words, if you do a little back, we can't.

537
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:23,720
You're right.

538
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:31,760
We can't exactly print up more chest merkins, so to speak, unless we pay for individual

539
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,500
because we can't get a lot figure, so to speak.

540
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,100
If you know what I mean, in business terms, we can't get a large amount for a reduced

541
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,340
rate wholesale.

542
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,980
Um, if there probably won't be any merkins.

543
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,060
Unless one of you guys wants to, you know, pledge a whole lot of money to WCSB.

544
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:54,540
I guarantee a thousand dollar pledge to WCSB by anybody out there, whether you're in Baja,

545
00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:02,740
California or Reno, Nevada, just any kind of money, but mostly a thousand dollars will

546
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,500
get you what?

547
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,480
How many chest merkins staying for a thousand dollars?

548
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,480
You will be, uh, an, uh, an overman first degree.

549
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,440
We will make you.

550
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:12,920
We will.

551
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:19,260
We will actually do the surgery on your mind that will turn you into an overman first degree.

552
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,980
You hold up a picture, a full scale picture of a Yeti right next to you and there'll be

553
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,260
no difference.

554
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:32,100
Now, friends, while we're on the subject of important things like your call to WCSB to

555
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:38,880
pledge at, uh, while we're on that, I should mention some subgenius news.

556
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,820
Uh, there is a devival coming up.

557
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:52,560
For those who have, uh, uh, friends or, uh, lifestyles in Detroit on November 28th, the

558
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:59,160
amino acids will be hosting a big devival in Detroit, November 28th.

559
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:06,000
For information on that, you'll just have to look at the amino acids.com or subgenius.com

560
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,740
and click on the events button.

561
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,820
You'll also see that there's going to be weekly devival.

562
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:19,200
In Chicago or rather sermons by Pope Michael Flores, the Pope of Chicago.

563
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:25,780
He's going to be giving, uh, lectures at the liars club, hellfire sermons, uh, every week

564
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,480
starting November 28th.

565
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,700
Uh, and, uh, then every, uh, whatever day that is in December in Chicago, you're going

566
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,860
to want to check that out at subgenius.com events.

567
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:42,800
Maybe the hour of slack, this radio show, you know, this is the 1,250 hour of slack.

568
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,760
31st episode.

569
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,040
You ever wonder where we keep the old episodes?

570
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:53,480
Well, you can download all 1000 of them now, just about actually, uh, probably only about

571
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,460
900 of them.

572
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:04,300
And you can find that at subgenius.com under the part that says radio on the front page

573
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,720
radio Haas.

574
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,680
Haas is short for hour of slack, short for HOS.

575
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,500
And, uh, yes, you can now, we now have...

576
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,020
We have archived radio.

577
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:20,240
You, Dave, you probably didn't know this, but now you can for free download hundreds

578
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:27,440
of hours of slack going back to the 1990s, starting with, I think, hour of slack number

579
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,660
333 or something all the way up through the current ones.

580
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,240
And you can find that at our website.

581
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:40,740
Did you know that there's a movement to make Dr. Howell, the subgenius personality of San

582
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,740
Francisco into, uh...

583
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
They want to run him for Congress.

584
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,700
That's on your Facebook subgenius world, which I don't pay any attention to.

585
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,100
Because if I start doing Facebook, I'll never get any work done.

586
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,600
And besides, you'll be mugging constantly and you just want to hurt small things around

587
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,200
you like the rock you sit on.

588
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:06,620
So, friends, you can, if you don't like a hard thing hurting your butt, quit sitting

589
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,400
on that rock.

590
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,920
Get up off it.

591
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,460
Get up.

592
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:09,900
Get up.

593
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,660
Get up.

594
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,140
Get up.

595
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,400


596
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,600
Get up.

597
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:12,680


598
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:12,680


599
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:12,680


600
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:12,680


601
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:12,680


602
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:12,680


603
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:12,680


604
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:12,680


605
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:12,680


606
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:12,680


607
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:12,680


608
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,760
Get up.

609
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,140
Get up.

610
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,160
Get up.

611
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,540
Get up.

612
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:29,660
Get up.

613
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,380
Get up.

614
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,340
Get up.

615
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:31,380
Get up.

616
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,340
Get up.

617
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:41,980
Get up.

618
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,620
Get up.

619
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,600
This station.

620
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,780
That is as soft as buttermilk candy.

621
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,760
It goes down as easy as slop-o and winky.

622
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,460
It is beautiful.

623
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:57,740
We sell the thing for $20, and yet for $25, you not only get that thing,

624
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:04,940
but a WCSB tote bag or a baseball-style tee or a Marcus-style t-shirt,

625
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,560
whatever that means, or a tote bag.

626
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,800
A tote bag.

627
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,620
It has glimmerings of angst and nausea plastered all over its forehead.

628
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,660
It is for you, my friend.

629
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,220
Friends, these stations are for you.

630
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,340
And it's not just this station, as this happens to be this station's pledge drive.

631
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,980
But while I'm thinking about it, I'd like to do a shout-out to all the other stations

632
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:31,380
that play the Hour of Slack not on a podcast but a broadcast.

633
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,280
For instance, WORT.

634
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,600
Beautiful WORT in Madison, Wisconsin.

635
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,600
Lovely WQL.

636
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,480
WFS at Guilford College in Greensboro, North Carolina.

637
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,760
Fabulous WREK in Atlanta, home of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse and Reverend Susie the Flusie.

638
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,320
WMPG in Portland, Maine.

639
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,720
They just had an unauthorized revival in Portland, Maine.

640
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,560
And they would do it that way up there.

641
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,600
WHUS in Storrs, Connecticut.

642
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,740
We hear from our beloved friends.

643
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,780
This one holds a spell.

644
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,780
This one holds a special place in my heart.

645
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,960
WEFT in Champaign, Illinois.

646
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:20,440
Because I spent my whole weekend playing with toys that were given to me by the good Reverend Oroboros from WEFT.

647
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:25,700
He donated microscope equipment to the church.

648
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,920
And, you know, we do a lot of science experiments.

649
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,880
We're kind of an island of Dr. Moreau in miniature.

650
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,720
Actually, it's in a Petri dish.

651
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,720
Also, it would help with your eye, with your errand, with your bazaar.

652
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:45,140
Well, it helps in making poisons that can be used to infect other people's eyes.

653
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,240
And relax twitch tissue as well.

654
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,080
So, you see, it's any station that you happen to be at.

655
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,420
Even if they don't do pledge drives.

656
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,740
Even if, like WREK in Atlanta, they're so well off they don't have to do pledge drives.

657
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,480
Heck, give your local station your money.

658
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,580
But best of all, give this station you're listening to right now.

659
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:07,940
Yes.

660
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,160
All of your money.

661
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,300
Don't just give us your money.

662
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,680
Give us your wallet.

663
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,440
Give us your checkbook.

664
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,580
Give us your library card.

665
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,300
Your driver's license.

666
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,620
Give us back everything you ever bought from Church of the Subgenius.

667
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,600
Give us your membership.

668
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,140
Give us the deed to your house.

669
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,300
Give us your car.

670
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,300
Siphon the gas out of it.

671
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,220
Give us a can of gas.

672
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,940
We need anything we can get.

673
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,120
And we want to get you.

674
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,200
You.

675
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,560
That's what we most want to get, my friends.

676
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:40,780
You.

677
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,780
Your attention and your trust.

678
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,300
And it's not that Bob needs money.

679
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,880
Bob's the richest man in the world.

680
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,480
Even if he wasn't, he wouldn't need money because he's so lucky.

681
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,900
We need your faith in this station.

682
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,300
And your money in this station.

683
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:06,500
Think how you could have sex with WCSB by sticking something into it.

684
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,520
Well, you can.

685
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,600
You can stick your money into this station.

686
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,340
That's like having sex.

687
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:22,880
You may be a loner, have a little bit socially awkward, have trouble picking up the opposite or otherwise desired sex, whatever it is.

688
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:31,220
Friends, this is a virtual way to have sex by proxy with everyone in the station.

689
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:37,500
And there's some very attractive young men and ladies that do shows at the station.

690
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,220
They're not all like me.

691
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:58,440
And when you donate, when you shove that rigid donation into this station slot, you are inspermanating and impregnifying and making this station impregnable to brokenness.

692
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,600
Impregnable?

693
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,900
Impregnable.

694
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,120
We'll have your babies, man.

695
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,920
We want you to be our daddy.

696
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,480
We will not.

697
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,260
I'm asking $6,900.

698
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,420
Why do you think they call it $6,900?

699
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,840
Where have you been?

700
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:28,860
This guy, he thinks the fetuses we've got, or the feti, the fetuses we've got in the trunk have something to do with him and his girlfriend.

701
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,780
Now, speaking of, it has a lot to do with the girlfriend.

702
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,380
Whose girlfriend?

703
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,480
This station is the closest thing some of you are ever going to get.

704
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,540
We're going to have no girlfriend.

705
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,640
Just think of it, Frank.

706
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,780
You'd spend $150 taking a real girlfriend out on a date.

707
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,040
Take the station out for $20.

708
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,420
And don't you prefer your long-termness by yourself anyway?

709
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:59,020
Wouldn't you rather sit around the electronic fire and have illusions spun and webs woven in the back of your forehead and the front of your mind?

710
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:06,920
Just sit there where you sit and stand up and say, I want to support WCSB as an athletic supporter.

711
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,280
As a jerk.

712
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:13,680
It doesn't matter what kind of, what emblematic designs you have on the job itself.

713
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,880
If you're terrible, I never, please just send whatever it is.

714
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,640
Whatever we ask for, do it.

715
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,240
That's all we're asking.

716
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,240
Just do it.

717
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,680
Whip it out, man.

718
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,660
Baby.

719
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,400
What is this music in the background?

720
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,720
Is that, who is it?

721
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,360
I don't know, actually.

722
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,480
Are you doing a murder?

723
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,340
No, it's not.

724
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:47,960
Earlier, it was some easy listening stuff that Byron Werner was playing on Susie's show when we didn't know how to turn the automation back on.

725
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,840
Oh, well done.

726
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,180
But, but.

727
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,620
I believe.

728
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,460
Where is my, I have a, I have all kinds of.

729
00:35:53,540 --> 00:36:06,580
Friends, what we heard at the beginning of the show, by the way, were the collages by Lee Murr, but also by the large Reverend Eric did the TSA brain inspection.

730
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:14,780
And Brother Jess Bone sent us a whole bunch of great collages that we played right there at the beginning.

731
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:22,140
And interspersed between Brother Jess Bone's collages was a call from Bernard.

732
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,660
You remember Bernard, don't you, Dave?

733
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,900
Yes, I was going to say brilliant work by all.

734
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:34,060
But then you added the Bernard thing, and I know that probably what we should do is light a candle.

735
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,560
Or perhaps.

736
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,420
Maybe we could just light a building on fire.

737
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:45,480
Or perhaps we could set the seat of our pants on fire and run around going woo, woo, woo in a larum.

738
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:55,100
As if that would wake the nation to the fact that what we need to do right now is to support free voices of unionism and underpants.

739
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,740
I'm talking about reality, friends.

740
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,280
I'm talking about it in tiny, small voice you can barely hear.

741
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,260
But what I'm really saying.

742
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,460
Is expend all of your donuts.

743
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,920
And donations.

744
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,180
And donations.

745
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,460
That's what I was.

746
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:14,780
That's it.

747
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,480
We're a do-nation, friends.

748
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,700
We're not a don't-nation.

749
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,420
We're a do-nation.

750
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,020
So do.

751
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:21,700
Donate.

752
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,160
We're on the positive.

753
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:23,940
By the way, this.

754
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,400
One from both sides.

755
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,260
A and B.

756
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,960
Just think of it that way.

757
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,060
If you have to.

758
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,900
In any way.

759
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,280
Sort of justify it.

760
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,800
As stupid an action as.

761
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,720
Sending a radio station money.

762
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,860
Think of it that way.

763
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,840
Now see, on your NPR, they'd be playing Bach in the background.

764
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,160
But we're playing Kenneth Johnson breaking Bach.

765
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,000
His broken Bach.

766
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,120
Allegro and E, B major.

767
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,240
Kenneth Johnson is the strange.

768
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,180
Listen to this.

769
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,500
And only through the magic of the hour of slant.

770
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,480
A particular show that you will be hearing.

771
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,140
On a particular station.

772
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,960
Can you envision it?

773
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,260
Oops.

774
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,920
Listen, listen, listen.

775
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,040
Listen.

776
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:06,880
This is me for God.

777
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,500
I just want to say it would be great.

778
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,300
And even interesting.

779
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:15,380
If you could bring back genius radio ministry, our flat time period after 1998.

780
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,620
With the UFOs are turning in the sky for me.

781
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:19,740
Personal.

782
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:20,700
There.

783
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,820
They are appearing in the sky for me.

784
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:35,400
If they appear at the right location, at the right position in the air for me to see them outside the window of where I'm still trying to maintain a place of residency here in this house.

785
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,980
You know, even though they.

786
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,940
Oh, close.

787
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,700
And it had been taken over.

788
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,320
But I'm still here.

789
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:47,480
And the UFOs are still appearing in the sky at the right position in the right location for me to see them.

790
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:54,360
Would be interesting if you could bring back our new message after, you know, long after 1990.

791
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,940
We're going to try.

792
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,920
Regardless of what we're going to try to bring back the hour of slack even after 1998.

793
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,820
Poor Bernard doesn't know that the show is still exists.

794
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,560
He's been.

795
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,220
He's been leaving these messages on my machine.

796
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,760
But he I don't think he I don't think he's quite cognizant that we're.

797
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,820
To me now.

798
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,620
Still doing.

799
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,900
Very cognizant.

800
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:20,560
And I think what he's done is he snapped a thread from one of those other concurrent realities.

801
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,940
They're folding by an apparel to me on a man mentioned, so to speak.

802
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,680
And he's grasped them.

803
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,560
And he's all the way there because he is in 1998, maybe nine or something.

804
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,560
And doesn't know or didn't know that.

805
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,820
Is it 1998?

806
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,120
Well, there's only one way of knowing for sure.

807
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:53,080
Send nineteen hundred and ninety eight X dollars to this station courtesy of this telephone number.

808
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,560
And we go to one six numbers.

809
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:56,980
They're nine.

810
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,520
And the rest is.

811
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,160
And give until it hurts.

812
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,400
Oh, it's hurt.

813
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:04,540


814
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:04,540


815
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:04,540


816
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:04,540


817
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:04,540


818
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,440
It's I'm so rusty.

819
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:15,040
And, you know, friends, we this station is not cheap to run and the government doesn't support it.

820
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,380
This isn't like NPR.

821
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,960
It's not a it's not a government propaganda station.

822
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,280
And the college in Cleveland State doesn't especially support it all that much.

823
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:30,800
We need your pennies to pay for the dang transit.

824
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,100
Trent Transmister on the top of the roof here.

825
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:40,140
I think they've got it wrong in their minds when they assume that you walk around, you know,

826
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:49,580
amidst these tall, tall columns of CDs dressed in surgical masks and outrageous footwear and that we expect for some flow.

827
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

828
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,040
I thought, did you see that light go by?

829
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,940
That is an omen of disaster for those who will not.

830
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,440
It's the UFOs.

831
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,720
They're up close and personal.

832
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,060
Speaking of freedom or, you know.

833
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,080
Eternal Self-Defense.

834
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,220
You know, I'm not talking about the information or triple your money back.

835
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,440
These are the end times.

836
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,900
Even morons know it.

837
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,620
And folks, who's a bigger moron than I?

838
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,780
I'm not talking about my physical.

839
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,780
I am talking about my ego being.

840
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:21,440
And perhaps I've misconstrued some certain parts, important parts of the English language.

841
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,380
And so have you.

842
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,420
We all have.

843
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,360
We're all confused about what to do right now.

844
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:32,600
But one thing is certain that you can do if you want to extract meaning from your meaningless life.

845
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:42,040
Send $25 as a pledge of support for this beautiful, wonderful station that you've taken for granted for time.

846
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:51,880
And if you can't extract it from your boring life, extract it from your boring wife.

847
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:57,700
Go to your mommy and daddy's purse and take out their money and send it to this station, kids.

848
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,000
Go to the nearest bar.

849
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,580
Ask the bartender you already owe $4.

850
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:02,580


851
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:09,240
If you could bum $25, do anything and everything you can.

852
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,120
Listen, folks, we've got to get together.

853
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,180
You've got to get together.

854
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,340
Are you different than you're one of the chosen?

855
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,460
And that's why this radio show has accidentally fallen into your hands.

856
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,480
Or do you stupidly assume you're the same as others?

857
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,100
Either way, it's time to forgive yourself, forgive others, and kill them.

858
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:32,560
Okay.

859
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,860
No, I mean metaphorically speaking.

860
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,620
And send us $25, $35, $45, $55.

861
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,580
That's pretty good.

862
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,180
And support WCSB.

863
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:53,300
And you can call in and you can talk to the, there's some sexy ministers on the lines tonight.

864
00:42:53,380 --> 00:43:00,060
Your prayer partners are here ready to receive your promise.

865
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,880
Your covenant with Bob, friends.

866
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:11,520
Why, the evil Dr. Zaphod here picked up, he got one from Joseph Prowl for $200.

867
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,040
And I happen to know that that one's not a joke.

868
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,800
Those were the days, friend.

869
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:21,240
Back in the days when they would, when they were so dazed they would donate $200.

870
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,620
Of course, that was from Dallas.

871
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,980
People were rich in Dallas.

872
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,180
But they cared, too.

873
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,180
Think of it that way, Stangee.

874
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,320
They cared.

875
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:37,860
And if people in this area and any area we cover by the internet, I mean, come on, we will take your euros.

876
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,640
I don't know what we'll do with them.

877
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,520
We'll put, since they're worth a little bit more, we'll definitely convert it and probably use that administrative cost, won't we?

878
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,600
Yeah, but you can always donate to Bob.

879
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,520
And Bob will give it to the station.

880
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,100
Yeah, right.

881
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,000
If you have to, use PayPal.

882
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,080
But Bob will take credit cards.

883
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,780
I don't know about the station.

884
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,800
But Bob will.

885
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,900
I'd be willing to.

886
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,700
I will.

887
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,100
Of course.

888
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:05,500
Wait a minute.

889
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,840
God, the station.

890
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,220
I don't know if we can control it much longer the way it's running.

891
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,820
It's getting a little bit clunky.

892
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,060
Yes, it's acting up.

893
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:19,460
The engineers are trying to fix the undercarriage, but it's...

894
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,700
Is the console kind of giving you bad time?

895
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,340
Well, it always does.

896
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,180
It's always done that.

897
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,080
There's smoke coming out of it all of a sudden.

898
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:26,340
Whoa!

899
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,520
Oh, man.

900
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,780
Should we call some worthwhile numbers?

901
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:31,620
Right.

902
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:31,820
All right.

903
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,520
If you've got numbers, we can call.

904
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,400
Yeah, the 911.

905
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,280
Call 911.

906
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:34,840
No, no, no.

907
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,940
And then call some device.

908
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,520
Yes, the 6900.

909
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:37,600
Yeah.

910
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,780
I don't want to die.

911
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,680
I don't want to die.

912
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,520
6900.

913
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,480
I know what that number means.

914
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,700
It means...

915
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,520
Okay, I think I've got it under control.

916
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,020
No, wait, wait, wait.

917
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,020
I was worried, man.

918
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,300
I thought you might have to...

919
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:55,260
In one of those B movies from the B movies days, you might have to actually use CO2 instead

920
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,500
of petroleum distillate to blow up the station.

921
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:57,500


922
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:57,500


923
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:57,500


924
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:03,120
Well, I'm not going to blow up them fires because certain of those monsters were allergic

925
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,540
to cold weather or conditions that had...

926
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,020
And friends were all allergic to poverty and rust.

927
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:15,140
And so, we want you to combat those things, fight poverty.

928
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,260
We're going to wipe out poverty in our time, starting with this radio station.

929
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:27,380
We're also going to lift the icy hand of doom from your fetid, febrile forehead.

930
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:27,480
That's right.

931
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,640
And actually lay down the hand of Bob.

932
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:39,320
Like I said before, I will personally extra meditate on any individual who sends in over

933
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,060
$25 a pledge of slack for one month.

934
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:43,860
Think of it now.

935
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,820
It might not happen.

936
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:50,360
You might not get slack, but I will be extra meditating upon it as hard as I can.

937
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,680
And I promise you that.

938
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:57,460
And when a subgenius promises, you know that they're going to...

939
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,180
They're going to keep up the FIB, the faith in Bob.

940
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,440
Don't you know it?

941
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:09,140
That preacher in Dallas, Reverend Tilton, he used to promise that he would sleep on

942
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,880
the prayer requests that people sent in, but he didn't.

943
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,780
They found him in the trash behind the bank.

944
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,920
And then he lied and said, oh, I hallucinate.

945
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,380
It's so hard because I sleep on those letters and the ink soaks into my veins.

946
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,120
Well, friends, we don't do that.

947
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,660
We smoke your letters and the smoke goes up to heaven.

948
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,240
We're the men from Planet X with it.

949
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,440
And then they know that you're worth saving.

950
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:39,040
And that's why they deliver improved stereo sound to you, the WCSB listener, while making

951
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,820
every other station lame.

952
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,280
That's right.

953
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,180
Those aren't just voices in your head.

954
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,200
That's just not the cacophony of your ears barking back and forth to each other.

955
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:53,580
That is the sound of a government agent whispering false commands into your head.

956
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:56,640
Or it could be the voice of a Louis Vuitton.

957
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,760
Or from the west in a

958
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,720
ĞĞ¸Ğ´ĞµĞ¾

959
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,900
Or a radio week or a radio show.

960
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:19,020
Or on a showå¶ÑĞ±'s

961
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,260
call in and pledge, and I'm going to give their names.

962
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,180
And we've only got 10 minutes left in this show.

963
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,840
Wouldn't you like to hear your name read out by me in some funny way?

964
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,600
Like this.

965
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,020
Reverend Agent Lloyd in Fort Worth.

966
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,920
Now, he's all the way down there in Fort Worth at 817 area code, and he donated $25.

967
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:43,200
He's going to get him a Rise DVD and some kind of WCSB premium.

968
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,900
And Dr. Dark here in Cleveland.

969
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:57,720
He got him a gift certificate for a chocolate shop because he talked to Princess We about what other things you can get because they do have gift certificates.

970
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:07,860
If you've already owned every subgenius item like Dr. Dark does and every WCSB promo like Dr. Dark does, you can get gift certificates.

971
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,540
That's a new thing we're offering here.

972
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:15,880
If you call 216-6900.

973
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:22,300
Now, the hard part for some of you to remember is that 216, that's a Cleveland area code.

974
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:35,120
Because, you know, by definition, our slack is supported by aliens from other places outside of the city where it's actually broadcasted in.

975
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:36,360
See?

976
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:42,380
That's the backwardness of the forward thinking of the subgeniuses.

977
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:45,340
I is saying that there are strange beings.

978
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:54,780
There are some place out there on the countryside beaming thoughts into the hearts and minds of little boys and girls across the country.

979
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,540
Can't you see that's wrong for crying out loud?

980
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,180
Dang.

981
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,140
Think of the damage it'll do to our schools.

982
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:06,600
There are unseen titanic forces acting upon you.

983
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,040
I'm sorry.

984
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,000
I had to be a fair man.

985
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,540
Act back.

986
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,140
Fight back.

987
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,320
Fight.

988
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:15,620
Be.

989
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:26,580
Don't just be a tepid, timid, useless, cool listener doing nothing but listen.

990
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:27,260
Be active.

991
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,240
Be active.

992
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,540
Reach out.

993
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,740
Join us, humans.

994
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,440
And call in your pledge.

995
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:40,260
Remember, the medium is not only what you're hearing in your ear vessels and your manacles and your dortal fins.

996
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,260
It's also the message you're getting from wonderful gift items.

997
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:50,300
Like a big lump smack at home style delicious box of delicious, delicious chocolates.

998
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,240
Which you have to eat.

999
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,460
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

1000
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,620
I can taste them.

1001
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,740
Well, actually, the gift certificates for the chocolates is gone.

1002
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,040
But there are others.

1003
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,960
But there are so many, so many wonderful things.

1004
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:10,400
I don't think anybody's got that Billy Nair Show CD for the $20 pledge yet.

1005
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,920
That's a great CD.

1006
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,780
The Paul Krasner CD is still there.

1007
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,160
Oh, man.

1008
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,740
Negative lands, Big Ten 8 place.

1009
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:23,780
Quite easily, they could snack these not only collector's items, but these illuminatory tomes or volumes,

1010
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:32,460
these reams of spoken word, which bring truth to mankind, which doesn't need truth.

1011
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,460
It needs slack.

1012
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,140
So give us some slack.

1013
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:35,600
That's it.

1014
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:39,420
And we'll give you some back, Jack, in the form of slack.

1015
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,600
That was very poetical, Dave.

1016
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,840
It was easier that time.

1017
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,520
Time, because it was not a true haiku.

1018
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:53,960
I forgot that, you know, where you, you know, children, a child falls in water, a monkey argues or something.

1019
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,920
I think you're confused with the Kama Sutra.

1020
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:05,080
Oh, well, that explains why they've all been having such a sexual time out there at WCSB.

1021
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,000
Just thinking about their organs expanding and contracting in time to the wind.

1022
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,600
Just thinking of those organevs.

1023
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,160
Expanding and contracting and springing.

1024
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,100
You know, some of them have little springs in them.

1025
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,020
Some of them have huge eyeballs, too.

1026
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,320
But if only they would send in a third of them.

1027
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,360
Is there a $30 pledge?

1028
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:28,940
You're sure?

1029
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,460
There's any amount you want.

1030
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,040
Can you talk about imagination?

1031
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,160
You get a tote bag and an Arise video.

1032
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,940
A subgenius Arise video.

1033
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,740
Now, I'm not even going to try to describe what the subgenius DVD is like.

1034
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:42,680
I'm not even going to try.

1035
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,580
I ain't even.

1036
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,180
I ain't even.

1037
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,420
Don't try to make me.

1038
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,760
There's a big dead air there.

1039
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,440
Come on, man.

1040
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,480
I ain't going to do it.

1041
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:52,660
I can't.

1042
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,360
That's why.

1043
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,140
I can't.

1044
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,660
You could even in your right.

1045
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,040
I even, I've seen it.

1046
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,620
I helped direct it.

1047
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,040
I can't even imagine it.

1048
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,580
Now, think how badly you need to see something like that.

1049
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,720
You'll never forget it.

1050
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:09,740
Once it's in your head, you can't, you can't unsee it.

1051
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,740
But you have to see it first.

1052
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:12,700
So how are you going to do that?

1053
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,240
They don't, they don't show it on conspiracy TV.

1054
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,180
They don't even show it on WCSB because this isn't a TV station.

1055
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:20,960
It's a radio station.

1056
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:26,480
But you can see it if you donate that pledge and then the money following the pledge donation.

1057
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:42,680
And did I mention that there's an open house at four o'clock to eight o'clock Friday, November 20th and November 22nd Saturday, Sunday, Friday, 12 noon to four when Princess Wee and and Lonesome Cowboy Stang will be here.

1058
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,240
To meet and greet and eat.

1059
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:51,540
And because there were, and it's only five minutes left in the show, friends.

1060
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,740
So you know what that means, Dave?

1061
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:59,940
It means it's time to wrap up the gums and start slathering to a different beat.

1062
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:07,920
But leaving on the note, if there is such a thing in this anti-musical world we live in.

1063
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:12,680
On the note that these people who don't have the darn gum.

1064
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:23,480
To flip up 25 lousy stinking US miserable bucks or even in the form of neuromatics as your more aromatic type like to use lately.

1065
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,040
I'm not going to guilt trip him this time.

1066
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,780
I might do it on tape, but I'm not.

1067
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,200
I'm not going to rub it in.

1068
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,640
They've got enough troubles.

1069
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,380
Yeah, well, you know, without the guilt.

1070
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:35,760
From.

1071
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:36,920
You.

1072
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,820
I remember the lesson.

1073
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:50,760
If only I'd gone back in time and call that number 216.

1074
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,700
And the best yes, 6900.

1075
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,620
Then it wouldn't have turned out this way.

1076
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,380
It still be a park to walk across.

1077
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,600
There's still be squirrels instead of those damned.

1078
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,860
I could hear whatever those things are.

1079
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,340
I can see those furry scrambling pipes.

1080
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:11,940
They're big.

1081
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,780
Bigger than we are.

1082
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,460
But they're not bigger than this station.

1083
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:18,120
My friends.

1084
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:22,360
Nothing is bigger or grander than this station.

1085
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:32,800
And you have who have pledged and have given are as much a part of this station as these sound effects in the background.

1086
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,040
Or this caller named lonesome cowboy Dave.

1087
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:42,040
Or this voice box of mine that's blabbering away without any control of my mind.

1088
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,000
Friends.

1089
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,640
This has been your chance.

1090
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,400
And some of you achieved greatness.

1091
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:54,680
Some of you have yet to grate on our nerves as much as we would like.

1092
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,440
But we have faith that that day will come.

1093
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,620
Yes, Captain.

1094
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,180
I can only hope enough can call after the show.

1095
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,980
Even if they've just a limited time.

1096
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,760
And there's still always time.

1097
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,360
Remember, we're sending out an SOS.

1098
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:10,740
It stands for.

1099
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,100
Man.

1100
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:12,680
We're sending out.

1101
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,260
SOS.

1102
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,380
SOS.

1103
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,360
SOS.

1104
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,200
SOS.

1105
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,920
This church doesn't need sustenance.

1106
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,360
But this radio station needs SOS.

1107
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,000
Quit while you're ahead.

1108
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,260
Praise Dave.

1109
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,440
Praise WCSB.

1110
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,580
Praise Stang.

1111
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,480
And so we now will fade.

1112
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,960
And thanks to those who pledged.

1113
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,860
And remember, subgenius.com.

1114
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,220
For everything you don't owe.

1115
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:51,640
And if you need to know any more about the station, check out WCSB.org.

1116
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,060
Yes, WCSB.org.

1117
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,040
Heard here in the background.

1118
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,840
Good night, Dave.

1119
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,140
And bye.

1120
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,060
Good.

1121
00:55:59,200 --> 00:55:59,760
Gone.

1122
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,160
And Eve and I now shall go slowly away.

1123
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,440
You picked the wrong planet.

1124
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:12,300
Dr. Drummond and I once talked about, you know, who means the most?

1125
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:12,800
Who means the most to Bob?

1126
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:18,120
Is it the little old lady who can, who, you know, doesn't have anything at all to her name,

1127
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,120
but she donates a quarter, her last quarter?

1128
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:26,280
Or does, or is Bob more impressed with the rich man who could give a million dollars,

1129
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,800
but only gives 10,000?

1130
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,300
We prayed on that, friends.

1131
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:35,500
And we realized that in Bob's eyes, that rich man is the only one that's going to get to heaven

1132
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,740
because he paid more money.

1133
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,360
So I want you to call.

1134
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,740
We got to sell you, friends.

1135
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,920
We're not just going to sit here and talk.

1136
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,280
We're not just going to sit here and talk.

1137
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:42,280


1138
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,060
Bob said we had to party.

1139
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:44,500
Didn't he?

1140
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:45,360
Didn't he?

1141
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,240
He said we had to party.

1142
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:47,980
He didn't say we could.

1143
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:49,520
He said we had to.

1144
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,540
And so, we must also sell.

1145
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,720
Praise Bob and thank you.

1146
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,140
Or they're destroyed.

1147
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,080
When everybody sells.

1148
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,760
We're all selling.

1149
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,440
For we all have something to sell.

1150
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,560
Yes, everyone selling together, mighty symphony of prosperity.

1151
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,520
For we all have something to sell.

1152
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,280
Ha, ha, ha

1153
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,380
Que tenga la mÃºsica.

1154
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,140
A candy-colored clown they call theèor,

1155
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,380
tip does two malon

1156
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,620
every night, every

1157
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,100
nine Î¿Î¹

1158
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:24,420
situaÃ§Ã£o

1159
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:24,860
song

1160
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,020
we teach

1161
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:26,020


1162
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:26,320
your

1163
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,400
team,

1164
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,820
we

1165
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:39,420
got

1166
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:42,260
it.

1167
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:51,880
night. It's been determined. And this is our fate. We're singing this song. Singing this song so you

1168
00:57:51,880 --> 00:58:00,440
can relate. We are going to save the universe. We are going to save the universe. We are going

1169
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:11,260
to save the universe. I've got one hour to convince you how badly we and the station need

1170
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:19,120
your support. We have a special, special form of slack in store tonight. Instead of us giving you

1171
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:25,480
slack for once, you're going to finally give some back to us. For some of you have been doing so

1172
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:31,800
all along. Praise Bob. But for the rest of you, oh, this could be the moment of truth.

1173
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,260
The moment at hand.

1174
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:41,040
You have to love Bob. He loves you.

1175
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:45,120
But you love Bob. You have to.

1176
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:48,020
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

1177
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,880
He'll kill you. He'll Bob you out.

1178
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,480
He'll Bob you out, folks.

1179
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,700
You heard it here first.

1180
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,660
You heard it here first.

1181
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,600
Bob you out.

1182
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,420
Bob you out, baby.

1183
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,060
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1184
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:08,980
Well, you know, if you don't pledge, there's going to be more and more and more reverent

1185
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:09,460
stangs.

1186
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,880
You're going to have to listen to it forever.

1187
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:11,500
Stangs.

1188
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,420
Can you imagine?

1189
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:13,280
Or at least until the money runs out.

1190
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,260
Dear friends.

1191
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,080
We need that money.

1192
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:15,860
Oh, my gosh.

1193
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,880
Let's get us some spirit going here.

1194
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,300
Look at those phones light up.

1195
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,540
Oh, yes.

1196
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,600
We like that old gold, friends.

1197
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,280
Shake it off.

1198
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:25,900
Shake it off.

1199
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,160
Can you imagine a world without slack?

1200
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,400
A world without the hour of slack?

1201
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:35,000
And even almost as bad, a world without this station.

1202
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:41,240
Because if you don't send some money by midnight tonight, you're going to be wishing to go.

1203
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,320
To God you had or Bob.

1204
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,780
I believe you should have this.

1205
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,320
I believe you should have this.

1206
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,300
I believe you should have this.

1207
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,480
Now you can have.

1208
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,160
I believe you should have this.

1209
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,340
I believe you should have this.

1210
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,160
This amazing new symphony.

1211
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:55,960
The symphony of prosperity.
