1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Instead of making your dollars shrink by investing in United States savings bonds,

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,160
why not make them grow with interest by spending needlessly when prices are high?

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,880
Here's the way it works.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,020
Seventy-five dollars invested now each month will in ten years turn into an income of one dollar

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,680
for as long a period as you forcibly fought forces of evil each month for a fact.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,620
But now...

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,360
The Soul Genius!

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,800
Power of the Soul Genius!

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,600
Savings plan.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,600
What sort of life, if any, inhabits these other planets?

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,400
Human life like ours?

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,400
Or life extremely lower in the scale?

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,000
Or dangerously higher?

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,880
You know, our next guest is Reverend Ivan Stang.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,440
He's with the Church of the Subgenius.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,780
And it's a church that's been around for quite a while.

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,720
Saved a lot of people.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,340
From...

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,240
I don't know what it saved them from, but it saved a whole lot of people.

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,680
I think it helped a lot of people get married.

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,360
And helped a lot of people get married.

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,640
They are now claiming that the end of the world is coming soon.

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,120
And specifically, I think, on July 5th.

24
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,480
And just like any good organization, they're trying to make some money off of it.

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,420
And so I don't know.

26
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,520
We'll talk to...

27
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,880
Good Reverend, are you there?

28
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,880
Yes, I'm here. Praise Jack.

29
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,220
Thank you so much.

30
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,720
The end of the world is coming.

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,760
It says the doomsday is coming for the 15th time.

32
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,120
I've missed the first 14 of them.

33
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,420
I don't want to miss this one.

34
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,180
Tell me what I need to do to be there and be hip about it.

35
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,200
Well, Jack, I was just looking at your description on Wikipedia.

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,660
And your website.

37
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,880
And I feel like I should be interviewing you.

38
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,400
You're certainly weird enough to...

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,640
I would think you'd probably get a free admission to the X-Day end of the world.

40
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,300
X-Day?

41
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,460
You know, it's going to happen everywhere.

42
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,300
But we figure we want to be with our friends and sex partners or whatnot.

43
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,580
If, you know, when the world ends.

44
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,040
I do believe in theories, Doctor.

45
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,080
But when you tell me flying to another planet is a possibility,

46
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,060
you're out of the realm of theory.

47
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,020
You're in a dream world of the impossible.

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,720
Even if the world were to end,

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,900
would it be less unpleasant to die out in space than here on firm ground?

50
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,860
The world will not end.

51
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,860
Predicting the end of the world is an annual crackpot event in our society,

52
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,880
an attempt to corner the newspaper headlines.

53
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,640
Read all about it!

54
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,400
End of the world, just around the corner!

55
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,160
Read all about it!

56
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:02,460
Get ya!

57
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,660
People tend to let go of their inhibitions when they know everything is coming to an end.

58
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,480
Well, you know, I like to base everything on cartoons that I watch.

59
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,760
And one of them that I love to watch is called Squidbillies.

60
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,460
And at the end of the... on their version of the end of the world,

61
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,760
everyone got nude and all the Christians went up to heaven.

62
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,780
Rose up.

63
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,500
And...

64
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,360
Now, the members of the Church of the Subgenius,

65
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,900
will they float up nude or clothed,

66
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,200
or will they remain on the ground to take care of business down here?

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,300
Well, that's a delicate subject.

68
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,120
Mm-hmm.

69
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,960
What we suspect will happen, according to prophecy,

70
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:56,660
is everybody who has bought a subgenius ministership, an ordainment, in the Church,

71
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
it may be a little disconcerting,

72
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,840
because they'll all appear to be bursting into flames and screaming and yelling.

73
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:11,580
But their beautiful naked spirit will rise up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

74
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,840
Out of the flames.

75
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,860
Which, by the way, are unichromosomal.

76
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,700
They're... we call them goddesses, because they can reproduce,

77
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,160
but they can appear as anything you want.

78
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,180
So, you know, if you want your sex god or your sex goat, for that matter,

79
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,560
Right.

80
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,480
whatever you want,

81
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,840
this is only available to dues-paying subgenius ministers, however.

82
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,720
Right.

83
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,940
I mean, we're crazy, but we're not any crazier than, say, the Jehovah's Witnesses,

84
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,020
who have predicted the end of the world numerous times.

85
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,960
At least we do it on a regular yearly schedule.

86
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,180
And at a good time of the year and a good place, too. You know?

87
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,400
It's in a campground in rural New York in Amish country.

88
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,020
Mm-hmm.

89
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,540
But the campground is regularly used by neo-Semites,

90
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,300
neo-pagans.

91
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,820
Oh.

92
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,000
And it's a nudist campground if you want to be naked.

93
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,560
Of course, only the ones who shouldn't be ever do,

94
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,660
but that kind of goes with the territory.

95
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,000
Right.

96
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,740
And we will be in that territory soon enough, dear friends,

97
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,320
because X Day is a-comin'.

98
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,480
This hour of slack show, number 1,258,

99
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,480
is composed almost entirely of people on other shows

100
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,540
talking about X Day.

101
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,760
We've heard some just now from the Jack Jett Show

102
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,020
on Rational Radio in Dallas, Texas.

103
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,220
We'll also hear snippets from the Puzzling Evidence Show

104
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,440
from KPFA Berkeley and from the popular British podcast called

105
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,640
Right Where You Are Sitting Now.

106
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,560
Reverend Susie the Floozy's Bob's Slacktime Funhouse

107
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,060
from WREK Atlanta will be exploited, used, as usual,

108
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,040
and, well, you'll see.

109
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,740
Many of our listeners are unbelievers.

110
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,380
They think this show is cute or funny,

111
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,180
but they don't believe in Bob

112
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,460
and they don't take X Day seriously.

113
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,600
Maybe this upcoming recording will change that.

114
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,440
It was recorded at the 2002, or 2003,

115
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,200
X Day Drill Ceremony

116
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,360
in Hamburg, Germany,

117
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,240
the epicenter of the Euro-subgenius movement.

118
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,740
Oh, no, what? That's Amsterdam.

119
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,420
Anyway, this is an actual recording from Hamburg, Germany,

120
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,480
of a live subgenius-devival sermon

121
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,220
preached by the great minister, father,

122
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,640
or, rather, Papa Joe Mama.

123
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,220
I want you to put your hands together

124
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,340
and scream like maniacs

125
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,420
for the infamous, evil

126
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,600
Papa Joe Mama!

127
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,300
Papa Joe! Papa Joe!

128
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,680
Papa Joe! Papa Joe!

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,780
Papa Joe! Papa Joe!

130
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,300
Papa Joe! Papa Joe! Papa Joe! Papa Joe!

131
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,920
Hallelujah, ladies and gentlemen!

132
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:35,900
Jehovah

133
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,240
Dobbs

134
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,480
Uberales!

135
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,320
You asked what time it is, friends, and I'm here to tell you what time it is.

136
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,140
It's five minutes till midnight!

137
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,020
I am...

138
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes, dear friends, the end times are upon us.

139
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,060
The proof is everywhere around.

140
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,080
Despite the conspiracy's best efforts to comfort and reassure you otherwise,

141
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,040
their sinister control in existence is fast coming to a close.

142
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,260
Best of all, they know it.

143
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:17,460
Like the pilot announcing over the intercom that the engine trouble is nothing to worry about,

144
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,000
the more they urge everyone to remain calm,

145
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,740
the more obvious their own panic becomes.

146
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,760
They all see the fulfillment of Bob's prophecies unfold.

147
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,700
A world on the edge of Armageddon,

148
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,300
the conspiracy's desperate last-ditch efforts to pull itself out of its nosedive,

149
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:45,020
and Bob's bold plan to reestablish freedom and slack in the conspiracy's aftermath.

150
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,840
Do I hear a praise ball?

151
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,020
Praise ball!

152
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,040
Praise ball!

153
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,840
Praise ball!

154
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,000
Who would have ever imagined that Bob's prophecy would be fulfilled?

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000


156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000


157
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:58,100
Who would have ever imagined that the countdown to July 5th would have begun on September 11th?

158
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:07,480
See how the world's armies converge upon the Middle East in a futile attempt to maintain the status quo!

159
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:15,200
Who amongst us seriously believes a conspiracy will ever allow itself to completely win this war,

160
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,760
then turn around and restore the civil liberties they so jealously snatched away?

161
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,960
Ah, there shall always be at least one terrorist who gets away.

162
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:35,680
One that's big enough and bad enough to justify the continuation of the newly expanded police state,

163
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,400
if not make it even bigger.

164
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:50,180
But we, the subgenies, we do not, and we are not, intimidated by a conspiracy show of force.

165
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,080
We recognize only one, only one supreme authority.

166
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,560
Not the faceless, nameless men in black.

167
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,100
No, sir!

168
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,360
No!

169
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,420
But a smiling face, named J.R. Bob Dole!

170
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:16,580
We, we, we will follow that face to the ends of the earth and well beyond after this planet is no more.

171
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,440
That time is coming soon, my friends.

172
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,080
It's five minutes till midnight!

173
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,740
Look at humanity!

174
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,720
Look at humanity!

175
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,480
And America alone!

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
The so-called land of milk and honey.

177
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:38,500
700,000 people owe 30 billion dollars in high-interest credit card debt.

178
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,440
They'll never pay it off.

179
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,000
But of course they're not supposed to pay it off now, are they?

180
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:46,620
No, sir!

181
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,800
The conspiracy wants them to remain in debt perpetually,

182
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,760
running down that endless treadmill.

183
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,040
Bob says no!

184
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,100
It's time to get off!

185
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,640
It's time to get off like you never got enough before!

186
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,460
It's five minutes till midnight!

187
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:12,960
In the last month alone, American Post delivered three billion pieces of mail.

188
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,240
Three people died from anthrax from those legends.

189
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,300
So now the peak public is terrified that they are next.

190
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:30,720
That's a one in one billion chance that you could get infected and be killed.

191
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:38,180
More people have died from spontaneous combustion, just unexpectedly exploding into flames.

192
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,860
Yet millions, millions still believe that they're in desperate danger.

193
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,240
This is called mass hysteria.

194
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,180
The first step to complete social breakdown.

195
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,080
The rats are ready to flee the ship whether it's sinking or not.

196
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,580
It's five minutes till midnight!

197
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,580
He who knows the future owns it.

198
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,280
He who knows there is no future rents it to others.

199
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,960
Ah, Bob Dobbs said, and I quote,

200
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,980
The world ends July 5th, 1998.

201
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,900
Now the conspiracy believes that 1998 is over and that they are now safe.

202
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,320
They don't believe in time control.

203
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,860
They don't believe in excess UFOs.

204
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,840
And worst of all, they don't believe in Bob!

205
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:45,000
And for that unforgivable blasphemy, they shall surely die!

206
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,800
It's five minutes till midnight!

207
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,940
For centuries, humans banged their heads against the walls trying to find the answers.

208
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,980
To life, happiness and peace on Earth.

209
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,660
But that answer sadly never came.

210
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,820
You want to know why?

211
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,120
Because the answer's not here, friends.

212
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,480
They're looking in the wrong place.

213
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,340
That answer isn't on Earth at all.

214
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,840
It's on Planet X.

215
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,980
And there's only one way to find it.

216
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,640
And it sure as hell ain't by brown-nosing the boss.

217
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,180
Or by trying to stockpile the most numbers in your bank account.

218
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,520
No, sir!

219
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:33,640
The only way to find paradise and avoid hell on Earth is to possess a ticket aboard an X's flying saucer.

220
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,960
That ticket cannot be bought, friends.

221
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,220
It can only be bought if you must trade true love and affection for Bob.

222
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,140
Plus a $30 love offering.

223
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,800
To the subgenius foundation.

224
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,280
Now, some people wonder, can I really afford it?

225
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,120
The answer, of course, is, can you not afford it?

226
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,240
Because, in the most simple of terms, it's five minutes till midnight!

227
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,060
Ladies and Germans,

228
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,020
we cannot promise you

229
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,220
that you will walk out of here with all of the answers.

230
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,920
But we're hoping to at least provide you with some of the more vital, life-changing questions.

231
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,880
One of them is this.

232
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,500
Do you wish to live after July 5th, 1998?

233
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,640
Yes!

234
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,260
If the answer is no, however,

235
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,120
just keep serving the conspiracy.

236
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,820
Those X's saucers will arrive here and rain death upon you and all your pink friends.

237
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,780
But, if however the answer is,

238
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,280
yes,

239
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,160
well,

240
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,080
in that case,

241
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,140
I suggest,

242
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,820
and that's assuming, of course, you prefer an eternity of slack,

243
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,280
and want to enjoy a space journey aboard the pleasure saucers with Bob,

244
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,740
enjoying sex-star beautiful babes,

245
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,760
an abundant supply of have-a-fropped zippy-lops,

246
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,400
and of course good quality rock and roll,

247
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,880
and I'm not talking that 70's shit.

248
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,300
Then turn your life over to Bob!

249
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,200
Yeah!

250
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,800
Bob!

251
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,680
It ain't hard, friends.

252
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,660
It's easy and it's fun.

253
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,960
You'll get eternal salvation and slack at no extra charge.

254
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,700
But best of all, best of all,

255
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,040
you'll feel a thrill instead of a chill when someone asks you,

256
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:30,840
Uh,

257
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,620
what time is it?

258
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,060
And the answer is,

259
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,800
it's 5S, don't be a lie!

260
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,880
Narrated the work of Bob, Craig, Bob, and Bill!

261
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,080
Passy Bob!

262
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,780
Little secret.

263
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:51,780


264
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,860
Didier!

265
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,760
Uncle Nick!

266
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,760
Judge Ludwig!

267
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,380
What is that, voir Hè!

268
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,380


269
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,380


270
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,640
I'll come two chairs 263?

271
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,160
No Red?

272
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,680
No Red!

273
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,920
Well, this is the next question.

274
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,760
When I hit this button sign.

275
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:11,760


276
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,780
For dear Lord!

277
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,140
spacecraft.

278
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,820
I paid my $20!

279
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:14,940
Hallelujah!

280
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,120
The subcommittee didn't believe a word we told them.

281
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,460
At least they didn't ridicule us.

282
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,400
No one believes us.

283
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,820
How will we ever interest enough private capital?

284
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,680
It's hopeless.

285
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,780
I believe you, Bob.

286
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,100
I'll buy you a start on your rocket ship.

287
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,140
At my age, I'll settle for the satisfaction that I contributed toward salvaging something

288
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,320
from our old world.

289
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,320
Hey, I'm older and richer than you are.

290
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,640
I'll arrange a lease on a large enough camp, one of the government's old proving ground

291
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,860
sites, by between Marston and me you'll have enough to start construction.

292
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,220
Wonderful, Spiro.

293
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:46,740
Wonderful.

294
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,580
I'll arrange the details for our next meeting.

295
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:48,960
Right.

296
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,780
Hello, Reverend Stang.

297
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,120
Thanks so much for coming on the show again.

298
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,080
We really appreciate it.

299
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,900
Always good to have you on.

300
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,760
Praise Ken and praise Kim.

301
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,340
Both co-hosts with one syllable names starting with a K.

302
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:03,880
Yep.

303
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,580
In order to confuse subgeniuses.

304
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:06,940
Yeah.

305
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,920
That's our cunning plan.

306
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,900
Not really.

307
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,160
It's pretty easy to confuse.

308
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,400
I was going to say, it's not even working very well, so.

309
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,180
Yeah, true, true.

310
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,580
We're not doing too well on that one.

311
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,140
So, you've just finished Ex Day and I assume, unless we're talking to you on some kind of

312
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,700
interstellar Skype, the sources didn't turn up this time.

313
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,360
Right.

314
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,300
This is actually the 12th time that we've done this.

315
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:37,300


316
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:44,120
We've waited on July 5th, 12 years in a row, at the ungodly hour of 7 o'clock in the morning,

317
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,240
waiting for aliens to come and save us from this planet and let us destroy everything

318
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,020
we didn't like on this planet for only 30 bucks.

319
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,320
But, once again, it turned out just to be another drill.

320
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,260
Yeah.

321
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,300
Is that...

322
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,060
Nonetheless, I'm sure we'll be out there next time.

323
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,020
Next time will be lucky 13.

324
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:05,880
Ah.

325
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,200
And, you know, you cannot shake the faith of the subgenius.

326
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,580
It's unshakable, possibly because it's not even really there.

327
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,380
Ah.

328
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,700
That's funny.

329
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,260
Yeah, there you go.

330
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,260
But you'd think someone that was so keen on Slack would arrange a slightly later date

331
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,620
to pick up the subgeniuses.

332
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,280
Well, that's the thing.

333
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,340
You know, we don't...

334
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,860
I think Bob's lesson from this whole Ex Day thing is that we're not going to be able to

335
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,360
do anything.

336
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,160
We know not the hour in which they will come.

337
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,880
And that means you better be ready any second now.

338
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,740
The world could end tomorrow.

339
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,680
Do you have that subgenius minister's card in your pocket that will provide you with

340
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,720
eternal salvation or triple your money back?

341
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,200
Yeah.

342
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,080
That's the question everybody must ask themselves.

343
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:03,500
You know, the fact that we gather like idiots and wait at 7 in the morning every July 5th

344
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,840
on this rainy campground for sausage.

345
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:15,400
And then the saucers not picking us up only indicates that this is not yet the year that

346
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,080
Bob predicted the saucers would pick us up, 1998.

347
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,380
This must be before 1998.

348
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:28,140
And the conspiracy of the normal people has obviously been diddling the calendars for

349
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,840
hundreds of years just to embarrass Bob.

350
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,640
Yeah.

351
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,760
Or Guru, J.R.

352
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,580
Bob Dobbs.

353
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,000
Yeah.

354
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,820
Who predicted all this.

355
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:35,820


356
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:35,820


357
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:41,640
And we still have faith in Bob, or FIB for short.

358
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,140
We steadfastly maintain the FIB.

359
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:47,880
The fib.

360
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,480
Faith in Bob, yes.

361
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,360
Have you considered that maybe aliens don't like early mornings?

362
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,740
Everybody has considered that.

363
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,960
Any more than any other saving individual.

364
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,580
I can guarantee you that the subgeniuses really don't like to get up at 7.

365
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,600
Now, most of them have to get up at 7 in the morning five days a week.

366
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,440
To go to work.

367
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,560
For me, that's the only morning that I have to get up that early.

368
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,600
That's my sacrifice for the subgeniuses.

369
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,880
I get up there and let them throw rocks at me when the aliens don't show up.

370
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
But I only have to do that one day a year.

371
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,940
So, you might say I have a pretty good job.

372
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:31,100
You know, I want to see that one that was 60,000 B.C. when there's really no humans

373
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,040
that are really like humans yet.

374
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:34,380
Yeah.

375
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,580
They're almost human?

376
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,660
They're like ferrets.

377
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,460
People.

378
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,640
They're like cartons of milk.

379
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,520
This is the sickest, sickest thing I've ever heard on KFJC, George.

380
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,800
Each person has a face.

381
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,120
Their face is a carton of milk.

382
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,360
George, I don't think I'll ever listen to this show again.

383
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,440
No, no, you probably won't.

384
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:00,140
You know, I used to listen to this show, George, to get my news and I'd get my relevant information

385
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,000
for the day.

386
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,520
I would get my marching orders.

387
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,360
I'd be able to go out and face and coach.

388
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,100
I'd be able to cope with the world.

389
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,720
And yet now, I'm George.

390
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,120
George, when I listen to this show now, all I get is confusion, chaos, and tumult.

391
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,340
But it's all together now.

392
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,280
Your obsequious tone is unfulfilling.

393
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,700
Yeah, it's chunky business fun.

394
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,100
Oh, no.

395
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,440
It's chunky business fun.

396
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,200
I say eshoo, obsequiousness.

397
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,080
Okay, those are the magic words.

398
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
Oh, yeah.

399
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,660
Absolutely.

400
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,660
Thank you.

401
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,620
Huge thanks to our sponsors.

402
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,480
Thank you so much to Justine and George for signing up this evening.

403
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,740
Thank you.

404
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,360
Oh, thanks to you, too.

405
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,080
Thank you.

406
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,100
It's just so much fun.

407
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,100


408
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,100


409
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,100


410
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,100


411
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,100


412
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,100


413
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,100


414
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,100


415
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,120
Bye.

416
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,140
Bye.

417
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,140


418
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,480
Bye, George.

419
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:46,560
Bye, George.

420
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:46,560


421
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,420
Bye, George.

422
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:47,420


423
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,280
I make a copy of you on some radio-clear version of all the songs.

424
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh, that's great.

425
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,500
Yeah.

426
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,380
So, no bad words in this.

427
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,040
Oh, that's great.

428
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,160
We have a 3D cover.

429
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:08,740
cover delicious d yeah the pg version yeah because they're a nice band really they are a nice band

430
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,380

432
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,220

433
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,100
show together man come on

434
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,340
so

435
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,860
eight four eight four four two five that was a short home movie of bob

436
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,800
you could be sitting there and listening to yourself talking about this

437
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,160
no you're just

438
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,160
sitting there and getting ready to push the your own especially individually

439
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:34,200
yeah but but not with both here not with both eric no because she's dead

440
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:43,740
the humans are dead they're not make that clear so now this is this uh x day it's going to be

441
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:50,560
in new york on july 5th right and what will be taking place on that date

442
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,040
mostly a lot of stuff that i probably shouldn't talk about on the radio

443
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:01,520
because we don't need the extra attention but there will be quite a few bands this year it

444
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:08,520
seems to be mostly what you would call horror billy man um we'll have the naked

445
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:14,620
blood wrestling on a giant american flag that's kind of a tradition that's good we've had some

446
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:21,280
injuries doing that but we'd persevere we'll be doing live radio all the way to the bitter end of the show.

447
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:36,320
just want to let you know thatikit therov is showing up réalité

448
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,980
who impressed me is that she's in the audience and help herself is getting this idea right

449
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,020
and blah blah blah blah blah we she doesn't like snipers we've

450
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,700
been very mindful we'll admit i always put myself in this game

451
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:37,700


452
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,980

454
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,420
Mary Hart from Entertainment Tonight.

455
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,880
Everyone's going to want to interview you.

456
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,760
Gloria Compos.

457
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,860
Gloria Compos.

458
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,200
Olivia Newton-John.

459
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,040
I bet.

460
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,600
I can't.

461
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:12,580
You know, I'm jealous, Jack, because I was looking at your website, and there were pictures of you with Charo, Sean Young, the dueling bankheads.

462
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,580
Uh-huh.

463
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,440
I had no idea.

464
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,380
You've definitely explored the subterranean tunnels, haven't you?

465
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,480
Yes, I've been an aging TV gas bag for some time now.

466
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,100
Man.

467
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,500
For about 10 years.

468
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:34,080
And I used to host a show with Sandra Bernhardt, and she, you know, she is Jewish.

469
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,340
No.

470
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,920
Of the Jewish faith.

471
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,860
No way.

472
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:43,020
And I tried to convert her every day of my life.

473
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:47,980
I tried to convert that woman, telling her, you know, you killed the Jesus dude, and you're going to go to hell.

474
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,440
And, uh...

475
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,940
But she is still just as catty as she ever was.

476
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,160
That's the way she is.

477
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,680
Do you know what I miss?

478
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,060
What were you trying to convert her to?

479
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,280
I didn't really know.

480
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,280
That was the problem.

481
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,620
Oh.

482
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,700
Is I didn't have anything specific.

483
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,880
You got her to become a lesbian.

484
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,540
I was just trying to convert her away from the Jew business.

485
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,080
Well, what I really miss about Sandra is really bad cinema.

486
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,380
What?

487
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,460
Really bad cinema.

488
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,240
You've never seen that show?

489
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,560
No.

490
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,140
She used to host a show called Really Bad Cinema.

491
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,080
And she would...

492
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,280
Make these running, goofy commentaries about all these 50s and early 60s vintage exploitation films.

493
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,080
Oh, that's good.

494
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,140
And it was flawless.

495
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,840
It was absolutely...

496
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,480
I mean, you would go out and rent these ridiculously awful movies just because...

497
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,240
Just because Sandra Bernhardt...

498
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,060
Well, I will tell you this about Sandra Bernhardt.

499
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,600
She has the prettiest girlfriend in the world.

500
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,220
Beautiful.

501
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:38,740
Beautiful.

502
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,220
Beautiful.

503
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,280
The type of species with which we've been experimenting is not satisfactory.

504
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,460
Size, strength, the will to live.

505
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,580
Essential in what we're trying to accomplish here.

506
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,300
Lacking in these animals.

507
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:50,620
Yes.

508
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,740
We have at hand the very elements that could make possible the things we're trying to do.

509
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,500
I don't understand.

510
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:05,300
It's been proved beyond doubt that glands can transform physical matter into any size, shape, or appearance.

511
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,360
Yes, that's true.

512
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,740
We have here in this sanitarium a rare case of follicular cyst,

513
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,000
which induces the secretion of unusual amounts of the sex hormones.

514
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,160
Miss Coleman?

515
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,420
Yes?

516
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:25,060
If we've been able to create through the medium of glandular extraction such specimens as we have,

517
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:34,400
what's to prevent us transfusing these glandular extractions from a human being into a higher type of animal?

518
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,120
The authorities.

519
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,220
They wouldn't permit it.

520
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,300
I see you're not truly a scientist at heart, Miss Strand.

521
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,160
Nor a subgenius.

522
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,720
And Miss Strand will pay for that flaw.

523
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:57,080
John Carradine will transplant her brain into the gorilla woman body of Captive Wild Woman, 1943.

524
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,280
The movie once that clip was ripped.

525
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,940
One of the lesser universal monster movies.

526
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:09,400
But because of that, now all the more bulldada looking.

527
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,780
And the female star who played the egg woman, Aquanetta.

528
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,060
Oh my god, enough said.

529
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,720
Anyway.

530
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,220
Anyway.

531
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,840
We have also heard clips from When Worlds Collide, the old movie,

532
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,480
and from the puzzling evidence show of which more is coming.

533
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,160
But first, back to the British podcast of right where you are sitting now.

534
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,480
So how long does an average egg stay last for?

535
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,820
Usually about a little less than a week.

536
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,840
We'll start arriving at the campground on Tuesday or Wednesday.

537
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,080
And depending on when the 5th of July lands,

538
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:56,600
we usually end up going home dejected and sad and sick on Sunday.

539
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,240
But it's well worth it.

540
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:05,080
Just because you get to meet the other subgeniuses.

541
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,580
You know, in any given neighborhood, there may be plenty of other subgeniuses scattered around,

542
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,620
but you don't know them.

543
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,700
You don't know who they are.

544
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,400
You can't tell them by how they look.

545
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,100
They could be any age, any type of person.

546
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:24,020
And the smart ones don't wear subgenius T-shirts all the time.

547
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,820
Because that can affect your income.

548
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,160
So X-Day is the chance for all of us to get together.

549
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,380
And essentially, it's a migratory mating ground.

550
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,440
And the mating really does happen.

551
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:46,600
In the old days, we were accused of it being what you might call a sausage fest.

552
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,720
At all boys.

553
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,180
A group of geeks.

554
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,840
And it was in the early years.

555
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,140
But we started lying and saying there were a lot of horny girls around.

556
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,740
And build it and they will come.

557
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:08,000
Pretty soon, there were lots of horny nerd girls around to meet the nerd boys.

558
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,980
And now there's little nerd children.

559
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,180
You know, we've been doing this for so long.

560
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,240
There's a second generation.

561
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,500
Children who were raised in the church of the subgenius.

562
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,200
Most of them.

563
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,940
Most of whom have not been taken away from their parents yet.

564
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,300
And even the one that did get taken away from his parents is now back with his parents.

565
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,860
Yeah, is that Rachel?

566
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,240
Rachel Bevilacqua, or Reverend Magdalene as we call her.

567
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,320
And my former business partner, Jesus.

568
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,140
They met at X-Day Drill in 1997.

569
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,820
They were married there in 1998.

570
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,960
Then the child custody case took them away from us.

571
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,860
For a long time.

572
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,900
How is that going?

573
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,480
They did win the case.

574
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,840
And they got the kid back.

575
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,960
They didn't exactly win it.

576
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,440
But they have had the kid for a while now.

577
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,440
And it's unlikely that the biological father will be able to get the kid back.

578
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,120
Because he's even worse than we are.

579
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,600
You were saying earlier on about the mating ground of the subgenius.

580
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,880
What would the mating call of the subgenius sound like?

581
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,440
It sounds like this.

582
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,840
Yee-haw, yee-haw, yee-haw, yee-haw.

583
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,780
Yee-haw, yee-haw, yee-haw.

584
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,260
It's beautiful.

585
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,240
I find myself strangely aroused and I'm not even a subgenius.

586
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,700
Well, it's not for amateurs.

587
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,400
You can hurt yourself making that noise.

588
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,040
And I did this inside of a house with the windows closed.

589
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,940
So that neighbors wouldn't come flocking to me at night.

590
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,200
Just imagine them bouncing off the windows like birds now.

591
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,340
It's mostly bats right now bouncing off the windows.

592
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:48,960
They also.

593
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,460
They also respond.

594
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,440
Ah, yes.

595
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,160
But here on the show.

596
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,760
This is the color of meditation.

597
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,660
Oh, well, is that a soothing purple?

598
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,780
Mm-hmm.

599
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,400
See, you can hear the sound of purple in the background.

600
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,640
Well, I'll be jiggered.

601
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,540
Into outer space.

602
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,780
At X-Day, yeah.

603
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,500
At X-Day.

604
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,260
Are you going to X-Day this year?

605
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,620
I think so.

606
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,060
What about puzzling?

607
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,480
Are you going?

608
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,080
I think so.

609
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,640
Yeah, that'd be great.

610
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,520
Right.

611
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:18,780
Right.

612
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:18,840
Right.

613
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:18,940
Right.

614
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:18,940


615
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:18,940


616
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,360
I think it's on the train.

617
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,120
Train to X-Day?

618
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,720
There's a train that goes all the way to Erie.

619
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,860
Didn't you say you were gonna do that?

620
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,280
And then you rent a car and drive 75 miles, and you're there.

621
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:29,920
Wow.

622
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,040
Then you have to have a car.

623
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,440
Don't you?

624
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,180
But.

625
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,460
You have to rent a car in Erie.

626
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,740
Right by the train tracks.

627
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,720
You can rent a car.

628
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,720
They'd be so happy to rent you a car because there's no business and everything's sad in that part of the country.

629
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,080
But they don't know it's sad because they have a lowered.

630
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,820
Because of the toxic waste that's been in the area for so long.

631
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,420
they have a lowered sense of expectation there.

632
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,320
Well, you know...

633
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,920
What looks sad and austere to us is actually quite cheery and bright to them.

634
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:04,240
They lead very rich lives in Pobucker Junction, actually, which we can't even imagine.

635
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,740
They understand the concept of blissful ignorance.

636
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,600
That's true.

637
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,520
Best scene in the winter when it's gray.

638
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,160
And then you see the little eyes looking, staring out from...

639
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,300
The shiny car.

640
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:21,600
From the cars and from the windows in the homes.

641
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,680
Visitors have money.

642
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:29,220
And, of course, they're surrounded by Mennonites, Hutterites, and photosynthetic algae.

643
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,900
But in the country, there are the Amish, and an homage to them is in the works.

644
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,440
Omelets are available at the store in that little two-bit tank town.

645
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,540
I forget the name of it.

646
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,460
What is it?

647
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:45,720
Oh.

648
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,200
Oh.

649
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,120
Sherman, New York.

650
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:47,740
I own it.

651
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,320
Yeah, that two-bit spit hole in the road.

652
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:55,480
That run-down, beat-up car paper...

653
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,260
The writing card, please.

654
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,460
...shack, the bracket, the rod.

655
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:58,760
Yeah.

656
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,780
That bleeding piece of earth.

657
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,080
That smelly hole in the bucket of filth, we call...

658
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,220
That rhinestone in the...

659
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:10,440
Humanity.

660
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,560
Yeah, it's actually a lot of fun.

661
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,200
This last X-Day, we had...

662
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:27,280
We had a special guest, Hal Robbins, also known as Dr. Hal, who is an entertainer and a cartoonist from San Francisco.

663
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:34,780
We bring him in every year to prove that there's at least one subgenius left who is still intelligent.

664
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:45,400
And if you ever listen to my radio show, The Hour of Slack, or his radio show, the Puzzling Evidence show, or the Ask Dr. Hal show,

665
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:45,940
you'll know that he's a genius.

666
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:45,940


667
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:45,940


668
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:45,940


669
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:45,940


670
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:45,940


671
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:45,940


672
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:45,940


673
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:45,940


674
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:45,940


675
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:45,940


676
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:45,940


677
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:45,940


678
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,900
You'll see what I mean.

679
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,620
Yeah, he just released a load of subgenius stuff, didn't he, for old videos and things.

680
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,780
He kind of knows everything.

681
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,720
He has a nightclub act called Ask Dr. Hal.

682
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:06,280
He also performs it at X-Day, but he does it on a weekly basis in San Francisco, where he lives.

683
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:11,820
And you can ask that guy anything, and he will answer convincingly.

684
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,640
You should really have him on your show at some point.

685
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,280
Yeah, I think we would.

686
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:16,560
You might have to.

687
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,220
He definitely sounds interesting.

688
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:26,880
Sorry, I thought being hardworking and super knowledgeable were disqualifying features of the Church of the Subgenius.

689
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,300
No, not necessarily at all.

690
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:37,820
When we talk about Slack and being a subgenius, that doesn't equate with laziness and stupidity.

691
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:46,160
It equates with freedom and happiness, which means, for some of us, working hard at what we wanted to work at,

692
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:46,960
is Slack.

693
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,820
And I think that would be true of Dr. Hal and myself also.

694
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:57,580
Some subgeniuses get Slack from sitting around watching television all day,

695
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:03,760
and others get Slack from doing things, but only the things they wanted to do.

696
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:10,780
The conspiracy sets it up so that you have to do things you never would have imagined yourself doing

697
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,160
just to keep a roof over your head.

698
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,280
Well, as subgenius,

699
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,200
we object to being forced to do that.

700
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,840
Now, that's about all we can do is object,

701
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,400
because most of us still have to have jobs.

702
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,980
But the Church provides a certain amount of Slack in between.

703
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:36,740
I've noticed a lot of subgeniuses who have day jobs log on to the Internet during the day

704
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:41,620
and check out alt.slack, which is our news group,

705
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,000
when they're being paid to be doing something else.

706
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,860
And that's the greatest.

707
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,280
That's the greatest.

708
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,280


709
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,280


710
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,280


711
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,080
That's the greatest.

712
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,080


713
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,080


714
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,080


715
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,080


716
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,080


717
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,900
Stolen Slack.

718
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,820
The whole black market for it.

719
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,200
Hi, there.

720
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,260
This message is for Reverend Ivan Spain.

721
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,000
This is Monica over at Flash News.

722
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,760
Sorry I missed your call earlier.

723
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,360
I'm interested in writing up a short story about the subgeniuses.

724
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,500
I'm going to get it coming up in July.

725
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,960
If you could please give me a call back soon as possible, I'd really appreciate it.

726
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,320
Thank you.

727
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:09,460
Bye.

728
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,340
Hello, this is Nipa Nott of Great Way Second Message.

729
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:22,360
That, you know, you and me, those of us who are like so-called subgeniuses and have our names on the list,

730
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,420
you know, see that it's the end times.

731
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,100
It's possible that some so-called subgeniuses are going to be left behind.

732
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:35,660
If you didn't have a dream that an alien invasion is coming and that you're going to be taken away from it,

733
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,840
you might be, as a subgenius, left behind here with the rest of the pinks to deal with the conspiracy.

734
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,720
But I had a dream that I'll be taken and that an alien invasion is going to take place.

735
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,200
So if you are a subgenius and you haven't had a dream,

736
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:56,340
you think that it's the end times, that an alien invasion is going to take place and that you're going to be taken out of here,

737
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,120
then you might be left behind as a subgenius along with the pinks.

738
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:07,080
All right, well, tell us what you get for your $30 ordination fee.

739
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:15,420
Well, the main thing you get is the right to board the escape vessels of the sex goddesses from Planet X and live forever.

740
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,020
Right.

741
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:21,200
Or as long as you want to live, doing anything you want.

742
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,500
Yeah, see, that $30 shows that you're a bard.

743
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:34,380
But in more practical, immediate terms, you get a nice folder with an all-inclusive, frameable excuse doctorate that excuses all sins.

744
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:42,920
You get a doctorate of the forbidden sciences, which includes many perversions and things that you've been appointed an expert in.

745
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,280
And just a million little posters and geeky.

746
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,240
And all the goofy crap you would get with any fan club.

747
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,160
You know, bumper stickers, pins, secret decoder ring.

748
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,180
Oh, secret decoder ring.

749
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,200
You hit it right there.

750
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,660
It's the starter kit.

751
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,740
Do you get a priest coat?

752
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,940
After that, we get you hooked on the radio shows and the books and the comics.

753
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,520
Do you get a collar to wear on your shirt?

754
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,320
A collar to wear on your shirt like a priest thing?

755
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,400
Some do that.

756
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,340
We don't supply that ourselves.

757
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,860
We suggest you go to your local Catholic.

758
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:16,720
Supply house.

759
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,100
Those are fun to inspect.

760
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,220
Catholic supply houses?

761
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:21,680
Yeah.

762
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,580
Well, they're fun like biological teaching supply houses.

763
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,020
You know, they sell weird stuff that you don't see at Walmart.

764
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:42,120
Ladies and gentlemen, the coordinates to this is 104.56, the exact longitude of the Roswell Christ site,

765
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,360
and 33.28 multiplied by pi.

766
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,280
Results?

767
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,240
Results in that longitude.

768
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:54,680
Somebody knew, the ancients knew this, and 19.47 times 3.3.8 equals 64.80.

769
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:10,400
Between July 1947, listen to this now, between July 1947 and March 2012, there are exactly 64.80 years.

770
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:16,280
19.47 times 3.3.8 is 64.80 years.

771
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:29,980
And that's the exact date that takes you from July 1947 to March 2012 are 64.80 years.

772
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,500
This is not a coincidence, ladies and gentlemen.

773
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:42,920
This is significant that the United States recovered the debris and alien bodies of the Roswell Christ on the 4th of July.

774
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,680
Oh, now, wait a minute.

775
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,540
The 4th of July?

776
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:45,740
No.

777
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,420
The very day that we're celebrating our liberty?

778
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,700
And they sent a message that we are still enslaved to them?

779
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,120
That these mighty ones, these fallen ones?

780
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,000
They sent it on the 4th of July, 1947.

781
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:04,920
America itself was founded on the same date in 1776.

782
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,660
This year was chosen by the elite behind the formation of America for a special reason.

783
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,200
This reason being that 888 is the sum...

784
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,280
888 is the sum...

785
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,320
of the letters in Greek of the name of the Messiah.

786
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,860
Each Greek letter represents a number.

787
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:33,740
A second Messiah, 888, plus the first Messiah, 888, equals 1776, America's founding date.

788
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:42,380
1776 is a number representing a second Messiah or the king of the New World Order,

789
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,020
and it symbolizes the event of a God-man.

790
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:53,840
According to the Illuminati elite, as the first Messiah came to establish the Kingdom of Heaven,

791
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,580
the second Illuminati Messiah will establish a New World Order upon the Earth.

792
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:05,980
And that New World Order is this radio show, The Hour of Slack,

793
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:12,200
voice of the Church of the Subgenius.

794
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,560
Subgenius.com

795
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:23,280
The word subgenius does not have an O in it, by the way.

796
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,860
Friends, that clip just earlier was found by Mr. Fernand and Andy Lemur,

797
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,060
but that's all I know about it.

798
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,220
Therefore, it must be something sacred, something holy.

799
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,080
Yes.

800
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:44,140
Coming up, we also have such weird show mixes as puzzling evidence as a guest

801
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,260
on Reverend Souto's...

802
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,980
Fousey the Fousey's Bob's Slacktime Funhouse Show on WREK Atlanta.

803
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,500
Imagine that.

804
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,280
And more from our frequent caller, Bernard,

805
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:04,420
as well as a poem by Ninslow, read by Dr. Howell of AskDrHowell.com.

806
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:13,160
But now, let us return to Reverend Ken and Kim from right where you are sitting now.

807
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:21,000
Can you tell us about some of the regular activities that happen the next day?

808
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,360
Are there things that happen year by year, or is it just spontaneous?

809
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:31,560
Yeah, every year we have a baptism in the pool.

810
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,260
This campground is pretty developed.

811
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,200
It has a really nice indoor swimming pool.

812
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:42,580
And we, usually myself and some other preacher, Dr. Howell or Dr. Legume,

813
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,200
will get in the pool with all these mostly naked people

814
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,860
and dunk their heads under, baptize them against the conspiracy in the name of Bob.

815
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,880
I try to come up with a different little spiel for each one.

816
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,540
And we will go through 40 or 50 people in about half an hour.

817
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,360
It's a very...

818
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,940
It's an assembly line type of holy ritual.

819
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,040
And it's also unfilmable.

820
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,100
Because, as I say, it's a lot of naked individuals.

821
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,180
You don't have to be, but a lot of them choose to just because they can.

822
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,020
That sounds eminently filmable.

823
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,200
It was.

824
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,480
For years we did do that.

825
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,100
And if you look at our website, subgenius.com,

826
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,480
the photos of past X days up to about 2005,

827
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,560
you'll see a lot of nudity.

828
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,740
After that...

829
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,460
We discovered that the appearance of the nude photographs on the internet

830
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:52,080
was cutting down on the number of ladies who would jump into the pool.

831
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:56,860
So since then we banned cameras from certain events.

832
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:01,700
Another thing we do besides the baptism and the 7 a.m. thing

833
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,200
is we will have beer tasting parties,

834
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,120
which can last quite a long time.

835
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,200
We had a gang war last time,

836
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:12,640
which...

837
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,600
None of the subgeniuses can form gangs.

838
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,220
Each individual is a separate gang.

839
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,800
So it ended up being just a bunch of kids

840
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,240
using toy store weapons on each other

841
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,440
until they got tired of it

842
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,880
and decided to raid the beer tasting party.

843
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,600
So it's...

844
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,920
To some extent,

845
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,820
it's a bunch of grown-ups doing childish stunts

846
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:40,660
and looking for some hot action.

847
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,620
In a situation where...

848
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:42,620


849
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:42,620


850
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:42,620


851
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,940
They're likely to both get hurt and get laid.

852
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,900
And sometimes at the very same time.

853
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,320
Isn't there like a Wicker Man-style burning of Bob as well?

854
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:01,380
We have an effigy of Bob that is usually hanging by the neck

855
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:05,040
from one of the rafters where we do most of the preaching

856
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,640
and where the bands play.

857
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,940
There's a lot of rock bands at X Day.

858
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,380
There's a bonfire event at midnight.

859
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,140
There's a bonfire event at midnight on Saturday

860
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,420
where we burn a wooden symbol of Bob.

861
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,400
It's kind of a logo icon thing we developed

862
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,500
because it's easier to make than a face of Bob.

863
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,040
It's kind of a stripped-down picto.

864
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,940
And we burn that and drum and dance around

865
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,560
like the pagans do.

866
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,200
The pagans are a lot better at the drumming and dancing,

867
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,140
I'll grant them that.

868
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,800
Probably less drunk, I would have thought.

869
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,280
And we have to depend on the pagans

870
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,000
to start the fire for us.

871
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,420
We still haven't mastered the secret of fire.

872
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,320
You know, Mrs. Reverend Angry Larry

873
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,380
finally picked herself a church name,

874
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,400
Reverend Lucy Van Pelt.

875
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,440
She was so nice this past year at X Day.

876
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,200
She took that naked girl off my hands.

877
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,080
I could not get rid of that naked girl.

878
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,600
I could not get rid of her.

879
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,040
A lot of us have that problem in life.

880
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,440
You know, that girl wrote to me

881
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,660
and asked me to take the pictures of her

882
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,520
being a drunken naked girl down off the internet.

883
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,860
And I didn't do anything at all.

884
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:15,820
Woo-hoo!

885
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,420
I mean, she'd have to send another picture

886
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,660
to show which one she is.

887
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,220
Well, you know, the thing is,

888
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,600
there was already somebody up on stage

889
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,040
with a rehearsed, a naked person on stage singing.

890
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,860
A professional naked person.

891
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,520
A professional singing naked person, Fat Mandy,

892
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,280
doing her act.

893
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,600
And then this amateur naked person comes up

894
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,980
and starts, you know,

895
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,740
slurring and drooling and stumbling around

896
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,900
and flirting with the cameras.

897
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,420
I mean, she was playing to the cameras.

898
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,060
And for her to then say,

899
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,520
would you please not put my picture anywhere

900
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,140
since I got into all of your pictures

901
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,780
against your will?

902
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,280
Right, she walked in front of them.

903
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,360
It's like, no, we're going to fine you

904
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,740
by letting your boss find those on the internet.

905
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,720
What it really comes down to, though,

906
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,840
is that Reverend Lucy Van Pelt,

907
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,520
I could not get rid of Naked Chick.

908
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,660
And I went to her and I said,

909
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,000
does this belong to you?

910
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,540
Because a lot of times things that get on the stage

911
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,440
that don't belong there

912
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,060
do somehow indirectly belong to them.

913
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,320
And I said, does this belong to you?

914
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,600
And she said, who is it?

915
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,280
And I turned it around

916
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,540
because it was kind of on my shoulder-ish.

917
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,040
And Naked Girl's on my shoulder.

918
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,940
She's looking, you know, at the butt.

919
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,280
And she says, turn it around.

920
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:36,820
We turned around.

921
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,980
And she goes, no, that doesn't belong to me.

922
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:39,880
I said, will you take it anyway?

923
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,060
And she said, sure.

924
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,960
That's what they all say.

925
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:45,440
Sure.

926
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:47,920
I'm just saying.

927
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,140
Will you take it anyway?

928
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,640
I mean, how many times have you heard that?

929
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,620
Well, it's not, it wasn't my Naked Girl.

930
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,840
It's everybody's Naked Girl.

931
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,360
Officer, it wasn't my Naked Girl.

932
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,620
Honest, I don't know how she got in the car.

933
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,960
I hear that all the time.

934
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,280
Well, then we'll have to take her into custody, son.

935
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,820
It's our Naked Girl now.

936
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,340
And that would have been funny.

937
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,020
It's just not my Naked Girl.

938
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,680
You know, I think my Naked Girl's a special.

939
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,220
A special.

940
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,480
Not special.

941
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,560
Not my Naked Girl sounds like a TV show.

942
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:20,880
A special.

943
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,560
Michael J. Fox makes his dramatic comeback in Not My Naked Girl.

944
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,540
There's some really, really tasteless jokes somewhere in there.

945
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,720
And I'm not going to go there.

946
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,480
However, I did make the suggestion to the rest of you.

947
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,300
Hey, watch those horns.

948
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,140
Okay, we're reloading now.

949
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,040
Lock and load, kids.

950
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,140
Fire in the hole.

951
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,760
And they sure do, with the eagerness of the new year.

952
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,700
Just a couple of hours into July 1st.

953
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,840
Well, like I say, where I'm from, July, July.

954
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,280
I mean, January 1st hasn't even happened yet.

955
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,420
And I can cut that out.

956
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,940
How July hasn't happened?

957
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,080
How do you know it didn't happen?

958
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,240
How do you know it will happen?

959
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,480
Just because somebody told you.

960
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,800
Just because you think you looked at a calendar last night?

961
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:05,860
Date the newspaper.

962
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,740
Oh, yeah, I believe everything in the paper.

963
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:08,800
Sure, you made a lot of plans.

964
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,080
How do you know it's going to happen?

965
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,480
How do you know it even came true?

966
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,640
How do you know even X day is going to happen?

967
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,820
Well, that's one thing you can depend on.

968
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,140
And Y day.

969
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:20,320
And Z day.

970
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,580
They'll all happen.

971
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,760
And you'll be there.

972
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,220
And you'll wonder, why didn't I send that money in?

973
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,880
Oh, there we go.

974
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,160
Took care of that guy.

975
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,060
Now we're just cruising down Central Avenue.

976
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,200
Taking care of the storefront.

977
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,000
We're going to go out to Little 500 Point.

978
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,320
And relax.

979
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:41,880
Because it's...

980
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:42,680
New Year's.

981
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,860
Oh, yes.

982
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,220
Another day, another chance.

983
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,580
Another drink.

984
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,820
Oh, another bout of self-delusion.

985
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,220
Don't you just love it?

986
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,300
I...

987
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,800
Girl, I'm in it like a hot dog in the fire.

988
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,100
Oh, yeah.

989
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:02,340
Just let them pour that mustard all over you.

990
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:02,760
I understand.

991
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,920
Down here at the station, they're drinking the hair oil.

992
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,300
It's really hit the bottom now.

993
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,440
Wow.

994
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,500
It keeps our coats glossy.

995
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:12,440
Yeah, it does.

996
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,200
How do you crawl out of that skin anyway?

997
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:15,960
Ooh.

998
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,520
It's got like a big tube top.

999
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,320
Oh, yeah.

1000
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,440
See, Susie the floozy skins are over there on the other side of the station.

1001
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,580
I saved the skins I shed.

1002
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,280
That's right.

1003
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,140
It's disgusting.

1004
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,340
I can't even look over there.

1005
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,340
But they have a light on it here, so you have to watch.

1006
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,020
Wow.

1007
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,700
No one, everybody thought the cheetah was the name of the woman.

1008
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,160
No.

1009
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,740
What is the monkey name?

1010
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,280
A thousand people tried to answer that one.

1011
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:49,880
Look at them.

1012
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,460
Hey, happy New Year, YouTube.

1013
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,360
Yeah.

1014
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:57,100
We're up in the balcony here, waving to the crowds outside WREK Atlanta.

1015
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:07,100
This is being simulcast to KPFA Berkeley, KPFK, and KFCF in the wonderful Valley Mountain and snow-capped hills of Fresno.

1016
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,060
And KRAP in the Tri-City area.

1017
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,220
And KNON in Dallas.

1018
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:11,960
The city is very...

1019
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,900
I'm sure they try anything.

1020
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,200
WFMU in New Jersey.

1021
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,480
Mm, praise.

1022
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:17,860
WFMU.

1023
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:23,640
I believe the first station to play some of these foreign tones.

1024
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,140
In the contiguous U.S.

1025
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:27,780
Yeah.

1026
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,700
Yeah, we must contigue with what we're doing here.

1027
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,400
It's a show.

1028
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,160
Slogging, trudging through the trees.

1029
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,460
I could call and I could hold the handset up to the microphone.

1030
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,460
You could be on the air.

1031
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,260
I don't even know what the number is down here.

1032
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:41,940
A.

1033
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,540
8, 9, 4, 2, 4, 6, 8.

1034
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,180
The problem is they're so slack-folded, they're just lying on the couch.

1035
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,380
And they can't get up.

1036
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,040
And they can't get over to the...

1037
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,320
Because here in California, you can.

1038
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,520
But they love everybody.

1039
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:59,200
Oh, it feels so good when it stops.

1040
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,520
You can't call the WREK.

1041
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,260
You can just call 845.

1042
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:02,760
The year, you mean?

1043
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,840
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1044
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,100
Yep.

1045
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,340
It never stops.

1046
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,980
Well, last year stopped a little while ago.

1047
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,860
Oh, that's what they'll have you...

1048
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,500
It's stopping right now in Missouri.

1049
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,280
And it will stop in just a few moments in Texas.

1050
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,280
And like I said, it's so sad.

1051
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,720
In California, they have hours to go before it stops.

1052
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,020
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1053
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,040
So where is the New Year starting exactly?

1054
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,040
I don't get it.

1055
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,380
Greenwich Mean time?

1056
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,000
How does time work?

1057
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,260
Greenwich Mean is a snake time.

1058
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,780
Starting up the building and we're driving down the street again.

1059
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,380
Radio bikers.

1060
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1061
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,080
Big little...

1062
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,300
Now we have to go get our little radio tattoos.

1063
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,800
The hours are so...

1064
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,960
Christina's got her needle all set to go.

1065
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,040
Wait.

1066
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,980
Hello, this is me, Bernard.

1067
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,920
And I just want to say, you know, as a comment, you know, that I'm a...

1068
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,120
I said I know that I'm a weird, strange mutant.

1069
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,400
And that weird things happen around me.

1070
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:04,660
And they're happening around me now with the UFOs that are turning in the sky.

1071
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,860
And I just want to say, I think that it's the end time.

1072
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,600
You know, that as a subgenius, you know, we...

1073
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,940
We know that the church is a subgenius.

1074
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,960
The UFO church.

1075
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,040
The UFO cult.

1076
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,560
Or church, whatever you want to call it.

1077
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,560
Or UFO religion.

1078
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,960
And that if you haven't had a dream or two dreams that you...

1079
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,640
That this alien invasion is going to take place by now.

1080
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,440
And that you're going to be taken away from it.

1081
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:30,820
That you, as a subgenius, may be left behind with the pink to deal with the conspiracy.

1082
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:40,620
Now, here's a poem by young Reverend Nenslow, age seven.

1083
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:41,700
Oh.

1084
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:41,840
That's wonderful.

1085
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,760
From Portland, Oregon.

1086
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,780
You might want to read it.

1087
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,800
Or it's kind of long.

1088
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,000
You might want to read some of it.

1089
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:47,400
Good God.

1090
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,220
It's a Nenslow poem of endless verses.

1091
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,960
Well, it's an X-Day poem, though.

1092
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,140
I'm filled with anticipation as I wait to go away.

1093
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:03,400
I'm going home to planet X for it's X-Day today.

1094
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,900
My life is put on hold as I throw away my past.

1095
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,720
I can't go on with my life.

1096
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,560
I give in.

1097
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,240
I give in to my fears at last.

1098
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:17,820
I never tried to chase a rainbow or tried to live a dream.

1099
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,340
I made very few mistakes.

1100
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,860
My heart was right, it seemed.

1101
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,160
Never wanted to be somebody.

1102
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,100
Just a soul just passing by.

1103
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,360
I had no grandiose vision.

1104
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,580
Was not aiming for the sky.

1105
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,100
But Bob had other plans for me.

1106
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,500
He yanked my feet up off the ground.

1107
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,620
He said,

1108
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:44,220
If you want to serve me, then take a look around.

1109
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:48,820
You see, there are many people in this stupid world, you know.

1110
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:53,480
And it's up to you to tell them exactly where to go.

1111
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,300
So you made a few mistakes, as oh so many do.

1112
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:03,120
But if you can send me thirty bucks, I can still use you.

1113
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,040
Exalt yourself and tell them of the mistakes that they have made.

1114
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,500
Then tell them of my smiling face.

1115
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:10,600
Oh, my smiling face.

1116
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,700
And the price that you have paid.

1117
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:17,480
I will sell you purpose, provision, and a name.

1118
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,260
Your life will be confusing.

1119
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,700
It will never be the same.

1120
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,400
I have never been right here with you.

1121
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,820
Even when life was hard.

1122
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,300
I knew you couldn't make it.

1123
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,820
I knew it from the start.

1124
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:34,680
So keep on calling my name whenever you need a hand.

1125
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,400
And your dollars you must send to me as countless as the sand.

1126
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,400
I always will.

1127
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,400
I will forsake you.

1128
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,740
I will always leave you cold.

1129
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:48,240
Especially when you make mistakes and are growing very old.

1130
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,220
Now take my words and tell your friends of the message that I gave.

1131
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,580
And be my witness to the world.

1132
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,440
And dig your fucking grave.

1133
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,340
Reverend Nenslow, age six.

1134
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,740
Yes, that young man shows great promise in the poetic department.

1135
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,380
Yes, that young man shows great promise in the poetic department.

1136
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:16,120
And we know his poos make better Dobbs heads than the ones that little Vreede's paints with his paintbrush.

1137
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:16,200
And we know his poos make better Dobbs heads than the ones that little Vreede's paints with his paintbrush.

1138
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,940
I know. It really drives him insane, too.

1139
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,640
When we were born into this life

1140
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:29,060
We were destined to make it right

1141
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,760
And it's pretty turning

1142
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,520
And this is our fate

1143
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,240
We're singing this song

1144
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,060
So you can read later

1145
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:44,360
We are going to save the universe

1146
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,000
We are going to save the universe

1147
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,920
We are going to save the universe

1148
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,520
We are going to save the universe

1149
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,140
This time

1150
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,280
We'll take the queen

1151
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,260
We mean it, man

1152
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,060
There is no future

1153
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,220
in England's justice

1154
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:07,780
I'm screaming

1155
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:12,780
No gift shop

1156
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,060
No gift shop

1157
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:19,760
No gift shop for you

1158
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,780
No gift shop

1159
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:29,000
No gift shop

1160
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,920
No gift shop for me

1161
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,920
No gift shop

1162
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:41,800
No gift shop

1163
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,780
No gift shop for you

1164
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,440
No gift shop

1165
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,660
No gift shop for you

1166
00:58:53,820 --> 00:59:01,280
I lost the car

1167
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,100
I lost the car

1168
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,080
I lost the car

1169
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,420
I lost the car

1170
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,700
I lost the car

1171
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,760
I lost the car

1172
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,180
It's gotta be a way of killing it. How?

1173
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:17,560
How do we do it?

1174
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,160
You can't

1175
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,600
You still don't understand what you're dealing with, do you?

1176
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:25,320
The subgenius power of

1177
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,020
The subgenius power of science

1178
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,580
It's structural perfection

1179
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,420
It's natural perfection is matched only by its hostility

1180
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,800
You admire it.

1181
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,100
I admire its purity.

1182
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:42,700
By conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.

1183
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:50,100
I can't lie to you about your chances, but you have my sympathies.
