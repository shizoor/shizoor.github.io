From PR News in Washington, I'm stricken with the deadly Ebola virus.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,760
While working in Ferguson, Missouri, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reports that progress is being made.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,140
And, um, um, the, uh...

PR News, Washington.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,280
The medical staff poses public health threats.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,320
Missionary Dr. Kent says he's now alive.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,800
I'm glad for any attention.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,800
Wall Street, 1760.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,980
Bank of America will be paying nearly $17 to settle PR News in Washington.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,700
I stand here a victim of the influence of Emanuel Bobstein.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,280
Guilty on all counts.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,380
I'm glad I was caught.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,220
I was mentally deranged.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,600
Now I am cured.

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,900
I ask only for you to accept my love of...

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,800
The subgenius power of...

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,280
Swatch!

18
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,440
Bob's balls melted my garter.

36
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:01,380
Last week, Jungle Jim and Shanghai Lil went into the Afghan hills in an attempt to locate Bob and Connie.

37
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:12,140
There they encountered the Silent One, and without being seen, were able to overhear his orders that Bob and Connie, as well as themselves, were to be prevented from returning through Khyber Pass to Fort Jammer.

38
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:21,100
Later, while circling the Silent One and his men, they sighted Colonel Hammond and a detachment of troops who, with O.P. Watts, had entered the hills to aid them in their search.

39
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:28,760
Jungle Jim and Shanghai Lil told Colonel Hammond of their discovery, and the troops were sent out immediately in an attempt to capture the Silent One.

40
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:38,600
At the same time, Jungle Jim and Shanghai Lil started for the old lamissary, where, unknown to them, the wicked Maharaja of Ybor has planned an ambush to capture them.

41
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,580
And now we continue our story.

42
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:48,340
Jungle Jim and Shanghai Lil are riding northward into a trap set for them by the Maharaja of Ybor and the Silent One.

43
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,080
Lil, I don't...

44
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,480
I don't think that Bob and Connie stayed at the old lamissary last night.

45
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,420
What makes you say that?

46
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,380
This campfire and the tracks around it.

47
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,480
Look at these footprints.

48
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,280
Those are a woman's tracks, Jim.

49
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,640
Look, they exactly fit my shoes.

50
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,140
And here's something else, Lil.

51
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,800
The hoofprints of two horses.

52
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,240
Yeah.

53
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,820
A man and woman traveling on horses stopped here, Lil.

54
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,320
And that could only mean one couple.

55
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,240
Bob and Connie...

56
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,960
Oh, we only knew which way they went from here.

57
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,120
That's a problem.

58
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,640
I don't think we'll get much information at the lamissary.

59
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,680
If they wanted to stop there, they'd have done it last night instead of this morning.

60
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,080
Wait a minute, Lil.

61
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,060
I'm going to climb up that rock and see if...

62
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,060


63
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,020
I'm going to see if I can see anything with the glasses.

64
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,820
It's just possible they haven't gone far.

65
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,860
If the Silent One knows where Bob and Connie are,

66
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,520
we'll follow him to them.

67
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,720
Well, I'd like to have a talk with him

68
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,100
and find out what he means by following us into these hills.

69
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,100
Kodo, are you sure he's alone?

70
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:40,980
Yes, Missy.

71
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,900
Me see horse and man ahead and think maybe him, Twan.

72
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,460
Jim, then see him native.

73
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,100
You're sure he didn't see you?

74
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,820
No, Twan.

75
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,900
Me get close to him, but he not see me.

76
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,840
Well, Jim, it's not...

77
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,940
We're not part of the top of the hill now.

78
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,420
No.

79
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,460
Jim, look.

80
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:55,800
Huh?

81
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,020
It's the old lamissary.

82
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,520
Well, say, I didn't realize we were that close to it.

83
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,500
Quick, give me your glasses.

84
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,060
There's a man on horseback down there.

85
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:03,600
Here you are.

86
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,200
He's riding straight for the lamissary's main gate, too.

87
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,100
You see who it is?

88
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:07,320
Wait.

89
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,880
Jim, that's the Silent One.

90
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,860
Here, look for yourself.

91
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,580
Here, let me have him.

92
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,600
You're right, Lil.

93
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,080
There's no doubt about it.

94
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,900
That's the Silent One, all right.

95
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,420
I'd know that fellow anywhere.

96
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,360
And look, Jim.

97
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,820
The monks of the lamissary are opening...

98
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,160
He's opening the gate.

99
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,140
He's running right through.

100
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,820
That's just what I was watching.

101
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,800
I don't like the looks of that.

102
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,700
What do you mean?

103
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,560
Lil, the man who opened that gate was a native.

104
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,860
He was wearing a native costume and not a monk's.

105
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,280
But I thought this was supposed to be a Buddhist lamissary.

106
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,380
They'd have a monk guarding the front gate.

107
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,760
That's exactly what I was thinking.

108
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,840
There's something wrong down there, Lil.

109
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,320
And before we go any further, I'm going to find out what's going on.

110
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:01,240
I'm going to find out.

111
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,440
Yes.

112
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:08,100
An American suffering from Ebola curled heavy machinery off the factory floor and blew out walls.

113
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,440
Some people in northern Ohio could come from Lake Erie.

114
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,280
City spokeswoman Lisa says even boiling people won't make it safe.

115
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,420
Um, you boil...

116
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,380
Consuming bottled water could cause abnormal PR news and numbness.

117
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,200
So I sit in my car.

118
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,060
Having a smoke.

119
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,560
Chilling out.

120
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,120
I heard a voice.

121
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,280
Pisces.

122
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,060
Hey.

123
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,700
What's...

124
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,420
Oh, shit.

125
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,480
It's you.

126
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,980
And it was...

127
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,140
Anti-slack.

128
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,400
Anti-slack.

129
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,220
I was sitting there.

130
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,220
Staring me in the face.

131
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,200
You don't look happy to see me, dear.

132
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,100
No, I'm not.

133
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,300
I replied.

134
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,460
And then anti-slack jumped on my back.

135
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,980
She pulled and pushed until I was hunched in the most painful position possible.

136
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,300
But I had to go.

137
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,460
I had shit to do.

138
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,200
I put on my jeans.

139
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,080
Pulled on my boots.

140
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:30,900
And all the while, anti-slack hung on me like a snarky, smelling, modern Baba Yaga.

141
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,840
When I got in the car, anti-slack punched me in the gut.

142
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:42,300
For the next 20 miles, anti-slack delivered a gut punch on every mile.

143
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:49,420
When anti-slack wasn't punching me in the stomach, she was causing the big red button

144
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,680
to turn the nearest stoplight suddenly red.

145
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,540
She summoned ambulances from every cross street.

146
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,140
Conjured two speed traps and one random registration check.

147
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,200
I was in a hurry.

148
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,680
I was at the checkpoint.

149
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,520
And so I got to my destination 15 minutes late.

150
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,680
Anti-slack, of course, pointed this out to my boss.

151
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,140
And I was called into the office.

152
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:24,480
And while anti-slack punched my gut, the boss told me that my tardiness problems were unacceptable

153
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,460
and I would have to sign a form stating that I understood the errors of my ways.

154
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,180
And would have to sign a form stating that I understood the errors of my ways.

155
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,880
And then I would correct them or else.

156
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:41,620
So I went to my desk, and anti-slack removed a few screws from the chair and I found myself

157
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:48,080
on the floor but not before hitting my head squarely against the desk on my way down.

158
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,960
After reassembling the chair, the phone rang.

159
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,140
The person on the other end spoke very, very softly.

160
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:01,180
And as I tried to increase the volume button, anti-slack remembered it.

161
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,180


162
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,180


163
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,540
instead increased the volume of the person on the other line

164
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,540
who was arguing with her ex-girlfriend on her cell phone,

165
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,900
screaming about who and who was not satisfied by which action,

166
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,520
and you damn well better believe I'm taking the bedroom suite

167
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,140
because I paid for it.

168
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:23,220
Later, I get a call from a woman who believed that Nigerians from South Africa

169
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,560
were hacking the entire state of Alabama,

170
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,740
but strangely, it sounded a lot like Auntie Slack's voice.

171
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,620
Of course, the shift lasted three hours longer than it should have

172
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,200
because Auntie Slack was playing time control for giggles.

173
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,200
Just before locking up the office, Auntie Slack, of course, hid my keys.

174
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,040
Once I found my keys, which were under the desk,

175
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,120
Auntie Slack hit me in the head with a filing cabinet

176
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
and punched me in the guts again.

177
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,040
As I walked out, Auntie Slack again jumped on my back

178
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
and began kicking me.

179
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,100
I heard the sound of my feet and the kidneys screaming in my ear.

180
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:10,380
Then Auntie Slack filled my right ear with melted candle wax and a small nail.

181
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
I couldn't take it anymore.

182
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,180
I ran to the liquor store, trying to get in there before it closed,

183
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,280
hoping that Auntie Slack would appreciate getting good and drunk

184
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,620
and maybe wander off in the snow and die.

185
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,080
But as I pulled up to the alcohol beverage control store,

186
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,940
employee number 31,

187
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,180
who was turning the key and locking the door,

188
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,020
and I began to cry.

189
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,020
My head hurt. My back hurt.

190
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,320
I had to pee.

191
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,560
I was nauseated and I could not relax.

192
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,020
Why did Auntie Slack show up?

193
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,320
Why? Why does she keep bothering me?

194
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,940
Why does Auntie Slack keep bothering me?

195
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,660
Suddenly, there was a tap at the window.

196
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,740
At first, all I saw was a pipe and a smile.

197
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,960
Hello, Mr. Dobbs.

198
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,700
Call me Bob, dear child, he replied.

199
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,140
And I think, I think, Pricey, you need some FROP.

200
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,240
No, Auntie Slack screamed.

201
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,140
The FROP will kill you.

202
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,100
Kill her, Bob said.

203
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,900
Really? How many people do you know who have died from FROP, Auntie Slack?

204
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,060
Bob asked.

205
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,580
Um, well, well, Auntie Slack replied she might get drug tested.

206
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:30,920
Then she said,

207
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,760
She said she would lose her job.

208
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,880
Pisces, Bob said.

209
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,040
Do you get drug tested when you started your job?

210
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,080
Why, Bob, I replied, I sure didn't.

211
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,600
And J.R. Bob Dobbs handed a pipe through the crack in the car window.

212
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,620
Which was strange because the pipe was still in his mouth at the same time.

213
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,040
It didn't matter because I took it from him.

214
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,060
No, no, I'll call the cops, you bitch.

215
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,920
I'll call the cops if you do that, screamed Auntie Slack.

216
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,640
But instead I took a deep drag of the pipe.

217
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,540
My back stopped hurting.

218
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,360
My headache vanished.

219
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,700
I was no longer nauseated.

220
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,740
And I was completely and utterly relaxed.

221
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,940
I went to turn to thank Bob, but he was gone.

222
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,840
But I also noticed Auntie Slack was gone too.

223
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,120
I'm the Auntie Slack.

224
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,040
I choked on the pipe and drove home.

225
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,540
And when I arrived home the sky was full of stars.

226
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,620
I looked up at the sky to partake in the beauty and saw a constellation.

227
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,660
And it looked like a smiling man with a pipe.

228
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,700
And I swear I think it wept in me.

229
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,600
Not many miles from where Lil and Jim are standing on the hilltop,

230
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,500
Bob and Connie are halted in the hills studying a map.

231
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,100
No use, Connie. We're lost.

232
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,600
According to this old map of Dad's, we should have passed a Buddhist Lama, sir.

233
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,720
What do we do, Bob?

234
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,660
Turn back to where we camped this morning, Connie.

235
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,560
I think that it was after we left there that we lost our bearings.

236
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,380
Come on. I'll help you up on your house.

237
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,900
There you go.

238
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,880
That's all right.

239
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,780
I'll be right with you, dear.

240
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,440
All set?

241
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,140
Yes.

242
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,040
Bob, I'm worried.

243
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,460
Don't you think it would be better if we went back to Fort Jamrud?

244
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,940
Colonel Hammond would help us get some more native guides.

245
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,080
I'd rather not, Connie.

246
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,620
After all, this map, we should be able to locate the jewels of the Genghis Khan.

247
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,260
And when we do find them, it would be better if we were alone.

248
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,900
But why? After all, we could use a native guide.

249
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,440
If we could find one that was honest.

250
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,580
No, darling. We're better off by ourselves.

251
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,220
I didn't mind when we had natives from India, but these hillmen are the most notorious bandits in the world.

252
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,560
After we find the jewels, our lives would... they'd be in danger if any of them knew about it.

253
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,400
That's all the more reason why we should have some protection, Bob.

254
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,320
If some of the Afghan Kutluks could raid us, we wouldn't stand a chance alone.

255
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,060
Connie, darling, now stop worrying. We're disguised.

256
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,100
These natives think we're just two more like themselves.

257
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,680
We're perfectly safe. We've never been recognized.

258
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,320
I know, but just the same.

259
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,500
Bob.

260
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,200
What's the matter?

261
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,440
Look ahead there. There's a man on the ground.

262
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,680
Yes, I see him. You keep back here, Connie. I'll go have a look.

263
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,440
Now stay right there.

264
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,020
Bob, he may be injured.

265
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,940
This man is unconscious, Connie. Get me some water from the canteen.

266
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,240
Here it is, Bob. Is he alive?

267
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,680
See the way he's dressed? This man is a Buddhist monk, Connie.

268
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,840
He looks starved, poor fellow. We've got to locate that Lama Sari and get him to us.

269
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,220
Water.

270
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,800
Here you are now, old man. Here he's coming to.

271
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,240
More water.

272
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,680
That's enough for now.

273
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,640
Try to make him understand me. Listen, where is the Lama Sari? Which way?

274
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,880
If you'll tell us where it is, we'll take you there.

275
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,220
No. No. Go south.

276
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,660
What does he mean, Bob?

277
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,540
Don't know. If you'll let us take you back to the Lama Sari, you'll get back your strength.

278
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,920
It is too late.

279
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,300
Buddha has said that there is no God.

280
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,660
There is no medicine against death.

281
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,960
Buddha has gone.

282
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,180
I... I follow.

283
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,560
Bob, he's dead.

284
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,140
Within the Lama Sari, his secret mountain retreat,

285
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,960
the Maharaja of Ybor receives the Silent One.

286
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,240
You have won, Highness. The ancient dog will lead them to us.

287
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,680
Ah, yes. And the jewels of the Genghis Khan and the gold of the American will be ours.

288
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,260
Will the old monk lead the travelers into the Maharaja's trap,

289
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,720
or will he warn them of the dangers that lie within the Lama Sari?

290
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,280
The adventures you have just heard dramatized will appear in full-color action pictures in the Comic Weekly,

291
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,040
the big Comic Weekly distributed with your Hearst Sunday newspaper everywhere.

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,640

295
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,940
Barney Google, Toots and Casper, the Little King, and Flash Gordon.

296
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,500
See all these famous characters in your copy of next Sunday's Comic Weekly.

297
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,700
And don't forget our date next week, the 4th of July, at 5 p.m. on the CW.

298
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,840
Same time, same station, for a continuation of the adventures of Jungle Jim.

299
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,580
Did you put that Jim Beam in your coffee?

300
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:48,800
No, I just have that here in case I need to rely on it during an exceptionally stressful portion of this and the following programs.

301
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,560
It's good. It's good to be prepared.

302
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,540
And the program after that. And the program after that.

303
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:53,680
And the program after that. And the program after that.

304
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,640
The endless series of entertainments.

305
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,280
And then that other program.

306
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,840
Piled like Pelion on Ossa, or the impious Tower of Nimrod.

307
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,460
It makes me run around screaming with Muppet arms.

308
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,020
Right outside the used car.

309
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,200
And the Timorous Tower of Nimrod.

310
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,140
Yeah, right.

311
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,800
Yes, the shadow of which was five miles and more in length.

312
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,300
I saw some of the Timorous Towers of Nimrod last night on stage.

313
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,880
As you know, Nimrod wished to reach heaven with this incredible edifice.

314
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,480
It was a pretty incredible edifice, wasn't it?

315
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,340
Yeah, it was. And he also had sex with his mom.

316
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,440
Nice.

317
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,740
That evil queen, or some say, Semiramis.

318
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,620
Like flowers in the attic kind of stuff.

319
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,240
Well, as the ruler, he could do what he wanted.

320
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,940
Were Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John related to V.C. Andrews?

321
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:48,600
The rules that govern the common people are not for those with a high and lonely destiny, like Nimrod.

322
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,960
But, as you know,

323
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,740
Only the Lord.

324
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,320
Only the Lord.

325
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,280
The Lord scattered their tongues, and so...

326
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,800
Isn't that really what happened? They scattered their tongues?

327
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,400
They weren't able to communicate with each other.

328
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,940
Oh, it was that whole Babylon thing.

329
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,340
Babel.

330
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,340
Well, Babel, yes. The place was known as Babel or Babel.

331
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,460
Also, some pronounce it Ba-bell.

332
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,940
Ba-bell. Any relation to Ma-bell?

333
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,080
No, that's been disbanded.

334
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,300
I think that might be a connection there. Ma-bell and Ba-bell.

335
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,640
Now we're having all this...

336
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,460
Da-bell.

337
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,640
...violence in the world. Kids getting kidnapped and...

338
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,480
Naps getting kidnapped.

339
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,060
Naps getting kidnapped and people dying so other people can play soccer.

340
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,820
It's a whole...

341
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:41,960
I haven't been engaged in the news cycle while I've been out here, and many strange events and convulsions in the outer world have probably occurred without my knowledge.

342
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,400
But what are you going to do about any of them?

343
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,080
Well, I can learn if there's...

344
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,640
Someone's going to post something on Facebook about it.

345
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,620
A giant radioactive lizard in the air.

346
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,640
I can read about it.

347
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,780
And I'm going to like some of the answers.

348
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,860
I watch the TV and they'll tell you all about it.

349
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,820
And it put emoticons.

350
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,220
A blow-by-blow account.

351
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:09,560
Little pieces of digital information that leave a record somewhere stating that I didn't like that. But I like this.

352
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,300
Well, it's how you get Big Brother's attention. Everybody seems to be fighting for that day in and day out.

353
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,020
Just leaving a huge paper trail so that they can't sift through it all and find the important stuff.

354
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,540
I never use... They want Big Brother to know everything they eat.

355
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,060
The better your defense is because they don't have the time to sift through all of it.

356
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,380
All of their algorithms can't explain everything all the time.

357
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,260
Obobos can.

358
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,920
Well, sure.

359
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,420
The algorithms of Obobo can read the secret yearnings of your heart.

360
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:37,480
He's the Muslim Hippar.

361
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,640
And tell if you're a communist or something.

362
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,780
Commie pinko shears cutting everything in their wake.

363
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,900
We had some subgeniuses join the church because they thought by Pink Boy we meant...

364
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,480
Communists, which to them is the same thing as people who vote Democratic, I guess.

365
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:04,280
Well, in the 1950s, if you were a pinko or a parlor pink, it meant that you were tinged with red, don't you know?

366
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,820
I thought it just meant you were awfully rosy and glowy.

367
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:17,620
No, that you see is different. That is the problem with these slippery expressions that can slide around meaning one thing or another.

368
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,980
Nazi means National Socialists.

369
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,200
Capitalists.

370
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,740
That means they were socialists, which means they were like communists.

371
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,780
Nazis is communist.

372
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,220
The German word...

373
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,140
And you're a Nazi.

374
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,860
...Nelke, often translated as pink...

375
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,680
If you voted for Obobo or voted against him, you're a communist.

376
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,840
Commie Nazi?

377
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,280
Or a Muslim.

378
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,100
...Blushing pink rose.

379
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,080
You could tell by their beards that they're crazy, like those Duck Dynasty Muslims.

380
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,840
Them guys...

381
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,220
Oh, Duck Dynasty Talibansters.

382
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,580
Talibanies.

383
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,180
Or the Bo Bergdahl's dad who wore a bristly beard just to...

384
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,180


385
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,080
...offend the senior senator from Arizona.

386
00:24:53,100 --> 00:25:01,800
Yeah, it's not like he's... I can't believe he hasn't just been, you know, like, grooming himself and just, you know, getting to the spa on the barber this whole year his son's been.

387
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:18,040
Grooming is something that often occurs here in the subgenius camp. You can often see the she subgenius picking through the furry mat that covers the he subgenius as they peacefully forage at their campsite for roots, nuts, and...

388
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,720
...deep jerky.

389
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,260
...free drinks.

390
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,360
Yeah, beef jerky. Slim Jim's.

391
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,080
Cans of Poo-Po and ranch-style beans.

392
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,980
Beef turkey jerky.

393
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,040
Oh, yeah, I've got my can of ranch-style beans out in the van.

394
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,960
I have a shrine to the can of ranch-style beans.

395
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,940
I miss Pantyara because last year she groomed, uh, like crazy.

396
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:38,980
It's been too many years.

397
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,980
I mean, groomed others.

398
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:48,160
Well, you could spend days working just on Reverend Skull there. He's got enough lice and nets and things to feed him.

399
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:55,780
You use the small metal comb with the tines located almost touching each other. And then you pull out...

400
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,880
I'm like a man with a close set of tines.

401
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:57,900
...life on man.

402
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,800
Like a man with a nice tight, close set of tines.

403
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:08,400
Let's have a tight close-up on those tines, uh, right here. And insert them into the record later.

404
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:14,100
And we will insert that tine at another time.

405
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,500
Uh-huh.

406
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,140
That's weird. That's not the music I was looking for.

407
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,140


408
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,840
I thought I was gonna play.

409
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:30,120
This is, uh, from...it's like...this is an album of covers of the themes from my video game, Monster Hunter.

410
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,600
Hmm.

411
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,320
I don't know how that got in...I didn't mean to...oh, well, I'll just leave it on there, I guess.

412
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,040
Uh, let's see. What...okay, credits.

413
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,580
It's pretty music.

414
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,140
Before, uh, the lone cow calls, let's...what have we got here?

415
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,060
Uh, ba-ba-ba-ba...

416
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,060
Uh, well, thanks to, uh, Fat Man.

417
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,120


418
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,320
Uh, Andy and Dr. Hal there at 17X Day, uh, last summer.

419
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,820
We're getting near the end of the 17X Day material.

420
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:07,200
That we also played from 17X Day, Priestess Pisces doing her story of Auntie Slack, uh, with six-fisted tails of Connie,

421
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,960
which is the jam band that forms only at X Day, like Brigadoon.

422
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,560
It only exists for a short time.

423
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,560
Um...

424
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,120
Oh, and the Medley of Gods.

425
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,700
Great hooks.

426
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,960
I'm sure some people were wondering about that.

427
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,080
I sure was when I came upon it.

428
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,880
Uh, that was on a disc that Potter Nostril gave us.

429
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,080
Yeah.

430
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,100
It was just miscellaneous stuff.

431
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,280
Praise Potter Nostril.

432
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,500
It was labeled, Shadowy Men.

433
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,000
Uh, so I guess that was Shadowy Men doing that great guitar hook medley.

434
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,260
What else?

435
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:45,380
Oh, uh, uh, the...PR News and the titles were done by Lee Murr.

436
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,120
And I can't remember the name of the subgenius who pointed it out.

437
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,480
He pointed me to The Jungle Jim Show with Bob and Connie.

438
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,440
But, uh...

439
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,220
Uh...

440
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,940
But thanks.

441
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,240
Um, maybe I could dig that out.

442
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,760
He just sent me an email with a link and said, Bob and Connie were on The Old Jungle Jim Show.

443
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,280
Who knew?

444
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,580
So, uh, ah, yes, yes, yes.

445
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,440
Oh, that music is pretty.

446
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
It is very pretty.

447
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,200
It makes me want to play my video game some more instead of do this show.

448
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,600
Isn't that funny how that works?

449
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,440
Not really.

450
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,340
Um...

451
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,760
Ha ha ha ha!

452
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,920
Stangor fool Little Weak Glasses Man!

453
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,300
Little Weak Glasses Man not running show, Stangor run show now!

454
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,320
Ha!

455
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,900
Little Weak Glasses people call Stangor World...video game.

456
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,700
Them the ones in video game.

457
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:56,880
Them world, Little Weak Glasses world, fake, silly, stupid, waste of time.

458
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,080
No monsters.

459
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,700
Not vee...

460
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,680
Good weapons.

461
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,500
What is blinking light here?

462
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,700
What is blinking light?

463
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,900
Why is blight blinking?

464
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,680
Blinking light might be our friend Dave.

465
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,620
Huh?

466
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,220
Huh?

467
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,520
The archetype.

468
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,240
Ha ha ha!

469
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,380
The nozzle is dripping.

470
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,580
That's what's wrong.

471
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,080
He he.

472
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,980
Stangor no understand.

473
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,740
Ha ha ha ha!

474
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,920
It's okay Stangor.

475
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,680
Little Weak Man talk funny.

476
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,280
Little Weak Man talk funny.

477
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,480
Cow...

478
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,300
Who is man?

479
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,040
Who is man?

480
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,500
Man is Lone Cow Dave.

481
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,460
Lone Cow Dave kill monsters?

482
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,840
What weapon Lone Cow Dave prefer?

483
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,260
What wrong with Lone Cow Dave?

484
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,900
Lone Cow Dave dumbstruck by Stangor.

485
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:53,560
I think something has happened here again Reverend Stang is...

486
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,660
Little Weak Glasses men not here.

487
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,800
Stangor here now.

488
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,060
Video game world come real.

489
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,320
It's happening again.

490
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,040
In fake world of players and Little Weak Glasses men.

491
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,920
Stangor run show now.

492
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,480
Play good music.

493
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,820
Play good music.

494
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:09,820


495
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,280
Good music from video game.

496
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,400
What you what people call video game.

497
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,180
Little people.

498
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,180
Dave?

499
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,480
Hey what's going on?

500
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,580
Do we still have Dave?

501
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,000
Princess Wee the music just...

502
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,480
Was there a...

503
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,200
What happened?

504
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:29,980
What just happened?

505
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,760
Well um it's happening again dear.

506
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,620
What?

507
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,680
Stangor took over the show.

508
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,500
What?

509
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,340
Yes.

510
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:37,820
On the...

511
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,000
I mean I did that on the air?

512
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,660
Yes.

513
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,360
Yes it actually happened.

514
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,820
It really happened.

515
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,000
Stangor was running things not you.

516
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,980
How long did that...

517
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,000
Good lord it's almost 930.

518
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,860
What happened to Dave?

519
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,760
I don't know.

520
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,200
He was here and now he seems to be not here.

521
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,620
You know he's been...

522
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,360
Wait a minute.

523
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,300
This is all just driving me nuts.

524
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,340
Well there was some kind of a noise from Dave.

525
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,240
That's that new thing that happens with the phone here.

526
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,720
I'm gonna have to...

527
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,580
Well wait a minute.

528
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,620
My reality is falling apart around me.

529
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,800
The music.

530
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,840
That's what it is.

531
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,740
Did Stang...

532
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,460
Wait a minute.

533
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,460
Stangor must have taken over and slipped that music in there.

534
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,040
That's right.

535
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,780
How many times did I do that today?

536
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,380
Several times today dear.

537
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:29,900
Really?

538
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,420
Yes.

539
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:32,880
Yes.

540
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,820
His worlds bleed over into each other and...

541
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,220
I don't know.

542
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,220


543
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,220


544
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,220


545
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,220


546
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,220


547
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,220


548
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,220


549
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,220


550
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,220


551
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,220


552
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,220


553
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,220


554
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,220


555
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,340
It gets confusing once in a while.

556
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,240
Uh Dave if you can hear us we're not hearing you at all.

557
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,640
I'm going to drop you like a hot potato okay?

558
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,260
No offense.

559
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,260
If you can hear us call back.

560
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:55,960
Call back?

561
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,660
If you can't hear us...

562
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,860
Well I don't know.

563
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,780
Oh well there went Dave.

564
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,540
He's gone now.

565
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,160
Oh no.

566
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,520
I took him off.

567
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:04,780
I...

568
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,840
You might...

569
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,200
Maybe you should go call him.

570
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,680
Okay.

571
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,960
If he's not trying to call back in.

572
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,380
Right.

573
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,440
Listeners I must apologize for the confusion.

574
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:22,960
Not only did Lonesome Cowboy Dave, the only person allowed to call the show, disappeared.

575
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,580
But apparently I've been disappearing.

576
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,600
Dave?

577
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,960
Yes can you hear me at all?

578
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,940
Yeah I can now.

579
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,320
What happened there?

580
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,100
Well I don't know.

581
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,820
My reception of you guys got a little bit...

582
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:35,820


583
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,300
I was like yelling away and saying all kinds of really super hilarious cool stuff with

584
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,500
your Stangor routine you know?

585
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,120
I was just going on and on and on every once in a while.

586
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,600
Routine?

587
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,340
I thought you were...

588
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,720
See because you said...

589
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,460
We couldn't...

590
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,960
I thought it was part of the shtick because...

591
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:58,720
No we heard the very beginning of your call and then we couldn't hear you.

592
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,420
Yeah.

593
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,200
See and I thought that was part of the shtick because you actually sounded better.

594
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,740
It sounded like you were right in the room and I was trying to get you to hell.

595
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,240
I don't know what's going on Dave.

596
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:09,880
I've been...

597
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,520
Princess Wee has informed me that this is like...

598
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,680
How many times did that happen?

599
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,420
I'd say at least three or four times today.

600
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:17,960
I've been having these fits.

601
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,920
Stangor takeover anytime Stangor wants.

602
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,260
Little Weak Glasses man not in control.

603
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,840
Turn up background music much better.

604
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,240
Mocha Village theme.

605
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,240
Ha ha funny.

606
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,660
Music of Little Weak Glasses people stupid.

607
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,920
What are you laughing at Princess Wee?

608
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,420
Well when Stangor takes over it just tickles me.

609
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,100
I can't explain it dear.

610
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,020
What do you...

611
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,280
Well I have a special relationship with Stangor.

612
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,600
Well at least I haven't...

613
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:52,640
You shouldn't be jealous.

614
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,800
At least it only happened once.

615
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,060
You're behind Stan's back you're having it with Stangor?

616
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,740
Don't tell him.

617
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:00,900
What?

618
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,160
You don't know?

619
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,080
Ha ha ha.

620
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,540
Stangor fluff.

621
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,400
Don't laugh at Little Weak Glasses man.

622
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,000
Little Weak Glasses man have no clue.

623
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,120
Ha ha ha.

624
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,500
Stangor take funny.

625
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,020
Phew.

626
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,680
There's some dangerous water right now I think.

627
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,520
Huh what?

628
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,820
Well it's obvious you've lost your mind to a game.

629
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:23,820
What?

630
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,660
Why do you say that?

631
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,400
Look it only happened once.

632
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,620
No it's actually happened a lot.

633
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,740
Yeah.

634
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,340
I counted four times and yeah.

635
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:36,640
What?

636
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,660
Ha ha ha.

637
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,900
Are you serious?

638
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,080
Please be serious.

639
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:46,280
And then we said the same thing over and then you say the same thing over and over

640
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,760
and then I get lost.

641
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,040
Ha ha ha.

642
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,600
I guess it's like snoring.

643
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,180
I don't even know I'm doing it.

644
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,240
Princess Wee claims that I snore but I've never heard that happen.

645
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:57,860
Not Woods.

646
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,900
Well you can't smell your own feet but she can.

647
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,820
It's the heart of the matter.

648
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,880
Ha ha ha.

649
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,680
The odors we give off.

650
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,900
Yeah that's it.

651
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,120
The psychic odors we give off.

652
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,360
And you're giving off some strange psychic odors right now.

653
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,760
If I didn't know better about all these secret government programs I would say that you've

654
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,040
probably been sealed in and pasted.

655
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,540
What secret government program?

656
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,220
The one in the video game you watch all the time.

657
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,260
The one you are.

658
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,460
Ha ha ha.

659
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:29,980
What?

660
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,080
It's Japanese.

661
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,860
What would that have to do with the...

662
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,940
Our government.

663
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,800
It might have some kind of...

664
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:35,800


665
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,260
Actually I think that video game is...

666
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:48,960
I think some stoners did the translations from the Japanese because it's got all these hints about drugs.

667
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,240
You're constantly having to eat potions and it makes you strong and powerful.

668
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,740
Not like Little Weak Glasses Man who can't do anything.

669
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,560
Ha ha ha.

670
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,440
Ha ha ha.

671
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,800
Little Weak Glasses Man.

672
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,440
Ha ha ha.

673
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,520
Stangor just wait and play tricks on him.

674
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,680
Ha ha ha.

675
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,480
Stangor played trick on Little Weak Glasses Man.

676
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,360
Now turn up the music.

677
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,020
Good music.

678
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,780
See this goes all the way back to the days of Ulysses if you want to read that memory.

679
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,280
Hey how this music got so loud?

680
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,220
Suddenly the music...

681
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:18,540
See...

682
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,380
These sliders are like moving up on their own.

683
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,340
It's Stangor dear.

684
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:24,740
What?

685
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,280
Stangor.

686
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,780
Let's put it without...

687
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,240
Stangor come again.

688
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,420
Vex Stangor.

689
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:32,840
What does this game's brain?

690
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,280
Uh...

691
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,400
Do you think there might be something to what they say about video games?

692
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,140
I mean I've only been playing this game for about...

693
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,920
I've only been playing video games period for about three years.

694
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,780
Ha ha ha.

695
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,300
Ha ha.

696
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,420
And I've...

697
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,900
I mean how many hours have I got...

698
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,400
Has Stangor got in now?

699
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,820
The full three years.

700
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,200
Fourteen...

701
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,520
About fourteen hundred hours.

702
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,060
That's all.

703
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,000
Fourteen hundred.

704
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:56,980
Yeah that's all.

705
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,580
Yeah that's the full three years.

706
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,640
It's not like I've been wasting my time on that.

707
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,400
Three hundred sixty five times a day.

708
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:02,860
I'm sixty.

709
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,800
Wait a minute.

710
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,040
Yeah that's almost a full year of waking time.

711
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,540
So that's only one third of my time.

712
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,060
Ha ha ha.

713
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,720
On Earth?

714
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,520
No.

715
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:13,660
No way Fred.

716
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,160
Yeah because I've been playing for three years.

717
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:15,620
If it's...

718
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,660
You're ejaculating in the wrong soup bucket.

719
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,140
Ha ha ha.

720
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,380
This is not the way things are supposed to run or walk.

721
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,540
This is the way that things are supposed to fold and decay.

722
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,620
Understand?

723
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,100
Get away from it.

724
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,600
It's dangerous to you.

725
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,380
It's hurting you.

726
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,380
God help me.

727
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,080
I'm getting a stangy.

728
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,320
Please stangy.

729
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,160
Stangor bored by silly talk of weak glasses people.

730
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,400
Stangor have advice for many young hunters.

731
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:48,740
When monster is cold monster in tundra like Barioth, use fire weapon.

732
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,640
Cold monster hate fire weapon.

733
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,680
Ha ha ha.

734
00:37:54,080 --> 00:38:00,880
If monster is hot monster in volcano, use ice weapon or water weapon.

735
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,760
No, no, no.

736
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,840
What you need is a vagina with teeth.

737
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,820
That'll take care of all your problems.

738
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,740
You won't imagine you're anything anymore.

739
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,380
Her called Gigi Knox.

740
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:14,640
Vagina with teeth called Gigi Knox live in tundra.

741
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,680
Use fire weapon.

742
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,460
You see...

743
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,040
And take antidote and many potions.

744
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,300
Everything is interpreted according to the way that it appears in the game, Dave.

745
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,020
There really is not...

746
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,340
Take full pack of potion and antidote.

747
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,520
A lot that you can do.

748
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
And speed.

749
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,140
And argumentation and debate.

750
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,720
Dash juice.

751
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:30,860
And speed.

752
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:30,860


753
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:30,860


754
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:30,860


755
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:30,860


756
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:30,860


757
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:30,860


758
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:30,860


759
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:30,860


760
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:30,860


761
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:30,860


762
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:30,860


763
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:30,860


764
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,080
And

765
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,080


766
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,160
Oh, jeez.

767
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,080
Take dash juice.

768
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,220
Take mite pills.

769
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,820
Adamant pills.

770
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,920
Need many potions to fight Gigi Knox in tundra.

771
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,300
I would like to do a saliva swab on him right now.

772
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:44,740
Uh-huh.

773
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,320
Gum swab.

774
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:45,740
Yeah.

775
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,340
What you can do with...

776
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:52,720
Genetic information would have to change each time, you know, what... who gets over

777
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,060
the game.

778
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,000
I said I could snake all the way and clean one.

779
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,680
Meaning I could tell that you were...

780
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,740
Oh, never mind.

781
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,880
I keep meaning to turn off this music and put something else on.

782
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:15,640
Oh, Stengor making Little Weak Glasses Man play Monster Hunter music.

783
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,620
Good music.

784
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,340
Stengor turn up loud.

785
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,820
How did that music get so hot?

786
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,880
I can barely hear you.

787
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,080
God, this is...

788
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,160
Who me?

789
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,860
Am I going to have to edit this show a whole lot?

790
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:30,860


791
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:30,860


792
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:30,860


793
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:30,860


794
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:30,860


795
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:30,860


796
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:30,860


797
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:30,860


798
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,460
Or what?

799
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,360
I don't...

800
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:32,760
I'm...

801
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:39,460
Dave, I'm afraid we've fallen victim to the Stengor taking over Reverend Steng thing.

802
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,240
Right.

803
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,180
There's not a lot that we can do about it, Dave.

804
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,940
Editorially speaking, you've already made a lot of changes.

805
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,140
You don't have to worry about it.

806
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,360
You can just put it down and stop whenever you change.

807
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,220
I can't wait to listen to this back.

808
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,780
Well, I think a lot of people are pretty sad about the whole affair.

809
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,560
Maybe you should drive on the way home.

810
00:39:59,360 --> 00:39:59,800
Yeah.

811
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,780
I'm not sure if Stengor knows how to...

812
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,060
That's a definite concern.

813
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,940
There's no way he would know how to drive.

814
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,840
Well, on the other hand...

815
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,360
Especially with the beastly feet growing out from under.

816
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,460
Do I have a copy of Grand Theft Auto with me?

817
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,280
Then I could drive.

818
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,080
I could drive really good.

819
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,280
But...

820
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,940
No.

821
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,120
No.

822
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,280
You'd probably take out a lot too many...

823
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,260
You know the splat...

824
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,560
I like the splat design, like in Grand Theft Auto and stuff.

825
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,780
Like when somebody gets hit by a car real hard and they bleed a lot and there's like a splat

826
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,940
design that comes out.

827
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:35,380
And it looks kind of animated even though everything else looks like, this is almost

828
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:35,940
real.

829
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,860
You like that splat design?

830
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,560
I fell asleep at the end of...

831
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:40,780
Yeah.

832
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,360
I'm sorry.

833
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,020
I fell asleep at the end of what I was saying.

834
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,300
Well, at least you know who didn't jump out of the pig toilet.

835
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,260
I watched a...

836
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:51,700
What?

837
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,320
What?

838
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,480


839
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,000
What's a pig toilet?

840
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,860
The pig toilet?

841
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,340
What?

842
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,580
What is the pig toilet?

843
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,300
Yeah.

844
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,760
It's just another video game.

845
00:40:59,760 --> 00:40:59,760


846
00:40:59,760 --> 00:40:59,760


847
00:40:59,760 --> 00:40:59,760


848
00:40:59,760 --> 00:40:59,760


849
00:40:59,760 --> 00:40:59,760


850
00:40:59,760 --> 00:40:59,760


851
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,840
You haven't heard of pig toilet?

852
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,860
No, but we did play Goat...

853
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,300
The Goat...

854
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,380
Remember in Germany?

855
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:06,840
Yeah.

856
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,880
Bucky had a copy of that Goat game where...

857
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,100
Yeah.

858
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,860
It's like you're a goat and you just run around flying through the...

859
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,020
Flying off of rooftops and...

860
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,460
It was a very, very, very, very twisted game.

861
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,840
Would you like to hear a really, really weird one?

862
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,560
Would you like to hear a really, really, really weird one?

863
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,540
I haven't heard anything weird yet tonight.

864
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:27,880
I was at a top like...

865
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,320
Hey.

866
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,020
Hey.

867
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,560
I was at a stoplight and I had an attack of why a goat.

868
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:38,420
I started yelling it as a matter of fact, well, quietly to myself because I didn't want

869
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,820
to know the goat people, you know?

870
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:47,240
Anyway, some sort of barely recognizable utility truck with a bunch of names and stuff on it

871
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,640
that didn't seem to make any sense.

872
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:53,420
And their logo looked like the old cornice of...

873
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,700
Goat head.

874
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,000
Oh, they're just Satanists.

875
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,420
That's all.

876
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:58,760
Oh.

877
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,440
That's all.

878
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,020
So it's like, you know, with the Knights of Columbus, like if they run the company or

879
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,100
something or the evangelical...

880
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,800
Like some of these Christian churches, same thing.

881
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,300
Couldn't they be Aries or something like the ram?

882
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,160
No.

883
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,740
Well, maybe it was a ram's head.

884
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:19,860
Maybe I'm jumping over a few eons, a few centuries.

885
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:27,300
We saw an interesting logo on a truck today coming back from the WCSB open house.

886
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,980
The right hand...

887
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,980
It's a Jans Everythingness company.

888
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,300
Wasn't that it?

889
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,140
Jans Everythingness company.

890
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,680
We're doing a free ad for Jans Everythingness.

891
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:38,860
It really sounds, but...

892
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,660
Apparently it was a home decorator or a repairman.

893
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,060
It was a handyman service, I believe.

894
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,460
Right.

895
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,500
Everythingness.

896
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:45,860
They do everything.

897
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah, one of those jack-mask wall blasters and trasters of, you know...

898
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,800
I hate those people, especially when they think they know it all and they only know

899
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,620
a little bit about each particular...

900
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,540
I don't know.

901
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:58,560
I don't know.

902
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:58,560


903
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:58,560


904
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:58,560


905
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:58,560


906
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:58,560


907
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:58,560


908
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:58,560


909
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:58,560


910
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:58,680
I don't know.

911
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,760
Oh, now I got to...

912
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,720
To me thinking about the British and the American stuff again, I'm sorry, I have to go.

913
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:04,900
I'll stop.

914
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,020
Is this show more schizophrenic than usual?

915
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,100
This episode of this show, I mean.

916
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,020
I believe that it is just a tad more, yes.

917
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,180
Just a tad more.

918
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:24,220
You know, it's like, yeah, it's on the line between great art and a very, very painful

919
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,720
experience with a psychiatrist.

920
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,220
This show boring.

921
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,400
Not enough monsters.

922
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,160
Stangor, wipe out monsters.

923
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:54,560
Stangor, rid world of monsters so men can build condos in Moga Village.

924
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:58,900
Build a condom.

925
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,920
You just go to the store and buy one.

926
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,640
Put it on your head.

927
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,880
Thanks to you, you have the inner cities where it's really getting bad.

928
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:10,340
A lot of people take a super huge condom and they go and rob a bank or something.

929
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:15,360
They'll put that over their head because it makes you look like really, really, really, really.

930
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,280
Stangor now understand little weak cow man.

931
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,100
In Texas.

932
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,160
Obviously gone far around the bend.

933
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,080
What were we just talking about, you guys?

934
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,880
I got lost again.

935
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,520
I'm not feeling very good, Princess Wee.

936
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,980
Right, I was going to ask you.

937
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,060
You'll be okay, dear.

938
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,860
I can't.

939
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,000
I can't anymore.

940
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,280
I've lost the ability to do that.

941
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,820
To what?

942
00:44:59,060 --> 00:44:59,580
To evacuate?

943
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,460
I can't.

944
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:08,800
Well, when they explode the nuclear devices, you're never going to be able to evacuate, Mr. Stang.

945
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,420
I'm not talking about number one or number two.

946
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,280
I'm talking about number three.

947
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,920
I can't do number three anymore.

948
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,100
The one that smells bad.

949
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,400
That's the easiest thing to do in the world when you don't want to.

950
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,240
It's just as well.

951
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:27,480
I mean, now Princess Wee doesn't have to smell them in bed, but I don't get to experience

952
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,220
the joy of releasing them.

953
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:34,700
No matter how much beans I eat, that's the weirdest thing.

954
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,000
I go out of my way to eat beans to produce gas so I can do number three, but I just,

955
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,720
it's like it doesn't work.

956
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,220
He says it's no longer his life.

957
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,380
Broccoli doesn't do it?

958
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,240
Nothing does it.

959
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,900
I can't fart anymore.

960
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,540
I can't fart anymore.

961
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,060
It's sad.

962
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:56,600
It's sad.

963
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,460
It's sad.

964
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:57,460


965
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:57,460


966
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:57,460


967
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:57,460


968
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:57,460


969
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:57,460


970
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:57,460


971
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:57,460


972
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:57,460


973
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:57,460


974
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:57,460


975
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,040
I have to describe this medically and scientifically.

976
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,500
It's disgusting because it's obvious what it is, but you know what it is.

977
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:09,180
It's decaying material that's giving off gas.

978
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,860
Well, but it doesn't escape anymore.

979
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:17,220
It's not just like a farting wing machine that appears in your stomach because God or

980
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,040
dogs or something or nature gave it to you.

981
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:26,560
It has to be nurtured like an elegant duck, like a squirmy little piece of vacuum cleaner,

982
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:26,920
something.

983
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:34,020
You know, that we can string a horn to, something that we can shave our baboons with, like knights

984
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,900
in the wilderness with Santa around.

985
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,880
Nuke the baboons.

986
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:38,840
Huh?

987
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,560
Nuke the baboons.

988
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,840
Hey, in our time zone here, we have a holiday coming up.

989
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,560
Which one is it?

990
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,500
It's coming way too soon, too.

991
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:50,980
Thanksgiving.

992
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:51,620
That's right.

993
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:56,160
It's a student baboon, the arms registry or something like that.

994
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,780
I think it was an NR eating that we had to get with.

995
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,580
Should I do another Slack Friday sale?

996
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,080
Yes.

997
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,020
Maybe the same kind as last year, two memberships for the price of one.

998
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:09,440
Yes.

999
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,340
I think that you really, really should.

1000
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,240
It was a huge success last year, wasn't it?

1001
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:14,920
Right.

1002
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,940
But that's why I wonder if it would be again because everybody who's ever going to buy

1003
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,960
a subgenius membership did that then.

1004
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:21,600
Last year?

1005
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,160
Yeah.

1006
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,520
I don't think so.

1007
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,960
I'm not recommending that anyone do that.

1008
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,980
By the way, on this.

1009
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:27,980
Yeah, that would be.

1010
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:28,460
Support.

1011
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,580
Of course not.

1012
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:29,920
Right.

1013
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:30,440
This independent.

1014
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,500
That would be contrary to.

1015
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,860
Just having a discussion.

1016
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,740
Practices of the.

1017
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,460
Well, the National Guard.

1018
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,380
I keep remembering things I'm supposed to do.

1019
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,620
Trademark the name FROP.

1020
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:42,720
Okay.

1021
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,060
FROP doesn't mean marijuana, but a lot of people think it does.

1022
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:46,960
We move earrings and nipple.

1023
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,700
So, you know, they're legalized it in a bunch of states now.

1024
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,080
Somebody's going to market it.

1025
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,060
Somebody's going to start selling.

1026
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:03,680
Medical marijuana or just plain recreational marijuana packaged as from if I don't trademark

1027
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,080
it.

1028
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,340
The problem is it costs like 500 bucks to trademark something.

1029
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,620
And every five years you got to pay more.

1030
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,480
You are a man.

1031
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,060
It's serious.

1032
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,560
It is.

1033
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,920
It's a good thing to think about.

1034
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,020
But I don't have 500 bucks.

1035
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,940
I do.

1036
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,220
But I have to spend it on other things like FROP.

1037
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:24,600
Yeah.

1038
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,040
Yeah.

1039
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1040
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1041
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1042
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1043
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1044
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1045
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1046
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1047
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1048
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1049
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1050
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1051
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1052
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1053
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1054
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1055
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1056
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1057
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1058
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1059
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1060
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1061
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1062
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1063
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1064
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,040


1065
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,460
The trademark of the FROP.

1066
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,980
You weren't supposed to say yes.

1067
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,000
Well, it's not.

1068
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,360
I'm telling you, it's not the same thing as marijuana.

1069
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,860
I have a FROP Zipulops.

1070
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,600
Marifazolumina lupina is a plant that grows in Tibet only.

1071
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:46,480
Only on droppings of Yetis or the graves of holy men.

1072
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,560
In the form.

1073
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:54,060
And if you can get a Yeti to use a holy man's grave as his toilet regularly, you'd have

1074
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,520
the best FROP in the universe.

1075
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,420
Yes.

1076
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:56,620
Yeah.

1077
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,300
I don't think I haven't thought of that, man.

1078
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:06,440
If we could just get like, if we could get a Yeti to become a holy man and go in his

1079
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,200
same old garden that he went and where he's coming and going anyway, because, well, returning

1080
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,200
to rags and riches or dust or filth or something like that.

1081
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,740
And I don't know, you know, we're returning to it or whatever and stuff because there

1082
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,700
doesn't appear to be a start point.

1083
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,940
But if we could do that, just think of it as having some FROP Zipulops that we would

1084
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:26,040
have to use.

1085
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1086
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1087
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1088
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1089
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1090
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1091
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1092
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1093
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1094
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1095
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1096
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1097
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1098
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1099
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1100
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1101
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,040


1102
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,160
And the way they have, yeah.

1103
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:28,640
Yeah.

1104
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:29,740
That's what I say too.

1105
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,400
A hard to rock a path, well yeah.

1106
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,100
By all.

1107
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:39,400
Oh Frank, I didn't know your head was so oblong.

1108
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:43,460
What does this have to do with the Church of the Subgenius?

1109
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,680
Stagor no care about Church of Subgenius.

1110
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:53,780
It's stupid for little children, little weak glasses people, nerd, who sit and play video

1111
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,740
game all time.

1112
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,020
Not, not at all.

1113
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,560
Like manly hunt.

1114
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,100
Mighty hunt.

1115
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:12,680
Stagor make little weak glasses men work hard, fun monster hunt at Subgenius land.

1116
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:20,900
Next week, little weak glasses men be forced by Stagor to play monster hunt.

1117
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:21,860
Sure.

1118
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,220
Get a hold of yourself, man.

1119
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,880
Can't you see what you're saying?

1120
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,000
Just watch.

1121
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,480
Just write down everything you're experiencing right now.

1122
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,120
In a few short hours, I guarantee you'll feel much better.

1123
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,860
Take those notes out and look at them.

1124
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,880
I turn into Stagor.

1125
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,940
What does that mean?

1126
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,580
What does that really, really mean?

1127
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,460
Look deep.

1128
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,740
Think of what you're saying.

1129
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,140
Little weak cow man.

1130
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,220
Make him know what's going on.

1131
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,520
Little weak cow man's silly.

1132
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,120
Stagor prefer to talk with good talking people.

1133
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,120
Tarzan.

1134
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,320
Frankenstein.

1135
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,160
Tonto.

1136
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,420
Them talk right.

1137
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,740
Those guys, they gotta go.

1138
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:04,100
Yeah, especially the solacists because they think they're the only ego that is trench,

1139
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:09,900
that's beyond the superego of the, of humanity and stuff.

1140
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,260
Stagor miss Tonto, Tarzan, Frankenstein.

1141
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,580
Them talk good.

1142
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,780
Do good radio show.

1143
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:19,460
Simple.

1144
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,740
Keep thing in mind for a long time.

1145
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,180
Take out Tonto.

1146
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1147
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1148
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1149
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1150
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1151
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1152
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1153
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1154
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1155
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1156
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1157
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1158
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1159
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1160
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1161
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,300


1162
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,760
They're not just talking.

1163
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,060
No, take out Tonto.

1164
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:27,840
No, take out, no.

1165
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,420
I, I …

1166
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,380
Stagor laughed.

1167
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,300
Stagor maybe not ever let little weak glasses man come back.

1168
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1169
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,860
Kill monster all day, all night.

1170
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,840
Well, the parrots will sing in paradise tonight.

1171
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:46,800
But …

1172
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,280
Just knowing that you disemboweled yourself from that unholy, unholy game that you're

1173
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,120
playing with yourself.

1174
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,560
But Stengor lonely.

1175
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,480
Stengor no can touch Weedor.

1176
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,700
Stengor no can even take off pants.

1177
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,640
Stengor only see Weedor in arena.

1178
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,300
Only have time to fight monster.

1179
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,220
No time to make out.

1180
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,120
But when try to make out, like ghost.

1181
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,500
Stengor lonely.

1182
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,680
Stengor let little weak glasses man come back now.

1183
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:26,600
That was the stupidest thing I ever heard in my life.

1184
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:26,860
What?

1185
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,480
What are you talking about?

1186
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:34,600
Oh, you just started going on saying that you were having some kind of premature ejaculation problem.

1187
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,000
Princess Weed, did I do it again?

1188
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,500
Yes, it happened again.

1189
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:43,920
Stengor's been taking over this evening and actually all throughout the last several weeks.

1190
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,300
We definitely need to drive.

1191
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,960
Yes, I'll be driving.

1192
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:47,780
And you said you were lonely.

1193
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,900
Did that happen at the open house?

1194
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:53,100
Yes, it happened a few times during the night.

1195
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,100


1196
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,100


1197
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,240
What happened when you were really lonely?

1198
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,720
What did people do?

1199
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:01,020
Well, they just kind of look askance and, you know, they probably thought I was kidding, right?

1200
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,980
Some people think you're kidding.

1201
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,020
Some people that know you a little bit better are a little worried.

1202
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:12,500
Those who know, they beat their swords against their shields and shouted the name Stengor.

1203
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:13,520
Stengor.

1204
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:14,740
Yes.

1205
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:15,800
I'm rich.

1206
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:15,980
That's right.

1207
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,420
Dr. Slater speaks the truth.

1208
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,580
That only happens in that better world.

1209
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,260
In that world, I'm rich.

1210
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,100
Well, Stengor.

1211
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:23,100


1212
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:23,100


1213
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:23,100


1214
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:23,780
Stengor is rich.

1215
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,540
I'm proud to help Stengor.

1216
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:26,540


1217
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,380
I'm proud to help Stengor.

1218
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:35,140
And I'm not ashamed of being subservient to a great hunter like that.

1219
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:40,080
I hope you'll leave me alone now that I've said that.

1220
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:44,380
At least until we get back home and I can start up the Wii U again.

1221
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:52,920
Like what we and I just both say unanimously and with great vigor both between me and the Ashton's party.

1222
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,020
And I hope you'll leave me alone now that I've said that.

1223
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:54,020


1224
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:54,020


1225
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:54,020


1226
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:54,020


1227
00:53:54,020 --> 00:54:04,120
We mean, we'll say, me very sorry, Stengor hurt Steng or Steng hurt Stengor.

1228
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:11,960
We understand some part Stengor versus Steng.

1229
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:22,480
You know, the saddest, one thing that may be contributing to my problems is that I don't have any subgenius friends who'll play Monster Hunter with me.

1230
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,000
Except.

1231
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:23,940
Except.

1232
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,500
Lily Drummond, age eight.

1233
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,440
You want to go under the blanket to the flashlight and wear underpants.

1234
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:31,000
And people think, well, he's 73 years old.

1235
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,500
What is he going to do back for?

1236
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:38,960
It's obvious, well, a 73-year-old gentleman would like to do with a flat thing and the right batteries.

1237
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:43,320
Are you saying that I look silly in that Stengor cosplay outfit?

1238
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,720
No, you look so elegant and beautiful.

1239
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,020
You look like a diamond box.

1240
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,680
You're like a million smokoti.

1241
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,420
You are very beautiful.

1242
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,280
Yeah, yeah.

1243
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,920
What is going on with my music over there?

1244
00:54:59,160 --> 00:54:59,780
I don't know.

1245
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,780
It sounds like a rat got into the works.

1246
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:03,560
Oh, here we go.

1247
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,180
The heavy metal version of the Monster Hunter thing.

1248
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,700
Friends, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1249
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,080
Although I'm not.

1250
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:21,620
I won't know what happened until I get back and play the recording.

1251
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:30,200
If you need to know more, and you probably do, you could go to subgenius.com.

1252
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:37,620
Oh, and Ohio people might want to be aware that there is a free Subgenius Devival.

1253
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,820
I think it is free, right?

1254
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:39,220
Yes.

1255
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:39,580
In Kent?

1256
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,780
I believe it is free.

1257
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,240
On Saturday week, I believe.

1258
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:46,820
December 6th.

1259
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,300
It's right there on the posters on the door.

1260
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,080
That was the deal.

1261
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:52,520
Yes.

1262
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:52,880
It's the same.

1263
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:52,980
It's the same.

1264
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:52,980


1265
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,960
My father told me Pearl Harden exploded.

1266
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,180
Can you imagine anybody can get so fat and still think they can conquer the worms?

1267
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,440
At the Stone Tavern at 110 East Main Street in Kent.

1268
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:05,860
On which day?

1269
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:09,780
On Saturday, December 6th from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m.

1270
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:09,800


1271
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:14,340
And there's five bands including Amoeba Knievel with Tommy Amoeba.

1272
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:14,920
Yes.

1273
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:19,320
Well, friends, we have to go now because the show is over.

1274
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,940
And also, we have to evacuate.

1275
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:22,880
Yes.

1276
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,700
The light is red.

1277
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,620
It's gone from amber to red.

1278
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:27,420
And it's time to hit the beach.

1279
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,640
But there's no way to get there.

1280
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,040
It's that sad, sad time when Dave slowly fades out.

1281
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,040
Stengor, listen to good music now.

1282
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,160
Weak glasses people go away.

1283
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:45,520
Weak glasses people go away.

1284
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,060
Weak glasses people go away.

1285
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:46,060


1286
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:46,060


1287
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,760
Weak glasses people go away.

1288
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:02,180
Weak glasses people go away.

1289
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,820
But the人民 needed to go in university.

1290
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,100
Theissippi, Department of English!

1291
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1292
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1293
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1294
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1295
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1296
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:22,740
.xin

1297
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,240
guitar solo

1298
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,480
guitar solo

1299
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,740
guitar solo
