1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,420
He's coming.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,240
They don't want to shoot him.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,180
David, I'm afraid.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,060
Be quiet.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,320
There he is.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,080
Look at his face now, David.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,160
Yes.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,080
I see it.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,640
It's composed.

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,300
It looks human again.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,460
Perhaps we're not meant to tamper with the natural.

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,540
So genius.

13
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,100
Powerful.

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,800
Quiet.

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,120
He's looking this way.

16
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,760
It's me, though.

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,180
No, don't do it.

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,000
He's still coming.

19
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,360
The story of Bob goes back in time to the very beginning of time.

20
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,280
And it's a tale that keeps repeating itself throughout the centuries.

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,920
Oh, yeah, he's the worst.

22
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,420
He's the absolute worst there is.

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,440
Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him.

24
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,640
He's just a butcher.

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,560
A man's a butcher.

26
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,680
And then there's always that, make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me.

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,100
Why?

28
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,800
What's the difference?

29
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,480
He's a doctor.

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,260
What is it?

31
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,120
Oh, you know Bob.

32
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,660
Okay, I'll give you the real medicine.

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,080
I don't know.

34
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,980
I don't know.

35
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,140


36
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:18,300


37
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,140
I don't know.

38
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,640
I don't know.

39
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,320
I don't know.

40
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:22,920
I don't know.

41
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,480
I don't know.

42
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,980
I'm gonna make you want it, and then I'm gonna call it.

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,680
I'm gonna return everything, and then you'll burn it.

44
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,240
I'm gonna make you want it, and then I'm gonna call it.

45
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,760
This is not a joke, and we used to say that.

46
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,280
My friend Bob had shock treatments.

47
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,460
My friend Lars had shock treatments.

48
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,600
Uh, excuse me?

49
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,020
Uh-huh?

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,560
Do you have any condoms?

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,180
Sorry, I didn't hear what you said.

52
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:58,960
Condoms?

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,360
Oh, condoms, sure.

54
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,480
What kind you want?

55
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,000
Quiet ones.

56
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,280
Let me just get the blue.

57
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,440
Three-pack or 12-pack?

58
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,180
Three.

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,980
12-pack is cheaper.

60
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,960
Look, can you just get me some condoms?

61
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,820
I don't have change of a 20.

62
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,340
Hey, Bob, you have change of a 20?

63
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,320
You gotta have change of a 20.

64
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,100
Bob, the man needs his condoms.

65
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,540
You know what? Just keep it.

66
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,280
Just keep it.

67
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,300
Hi.

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,440
I'm Bob.

69
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,580
This is Paul.

70
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,600
Hi, Paul.

71
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,500
So, why'd you contact us, man?

72
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,980
Oh, you look like you kept shape, Philip.

73
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,100
Yeah, I work out.

74
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,380
But you know the way it is.

75
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,200
Time passes, we all change.

76
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,420
Do we ever.

77
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
Yeah, well, some more than others.

78
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,980
I don't know quite how to put this, Bob.

79
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,640
You didn't tell me anything, Philip.

80
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,100
Okay, it's Philippa now.

81
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,980
But if you still want me, I'm in.

82
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,420
Say it.

83
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,080
Say what?

84
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,080
My name is Roger.

85
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,540
I'm an addict in recovery.

86
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,180
Ha, ha, ha.

87
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,160
No, no, you say it.

88
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,800
My name is Bob, and I'm an addict in recovery.

89
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,400
And today is the first day in the rest of my life.

90
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,220
My name is Michelle, and I'm an addict.

91
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,260
Hello, Michelle.

92
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,640
My name is Anne, and I am an addict.

93
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,540
Hello, Anne.

94
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,800
My name is Chris.

95
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,740
I am an addict.

96
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,500
Hello, Chris.

97
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,480
My name is Bob, and I'm an addict.

98
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,320
Hello, Bob.

99
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,080
Secure that Bob statue.

100
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,700
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

101
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,940
Another beer one bottle.

102
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:37,940


103
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:37,940


104
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:37,980
Danke.

105
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,060
Gul Erdogan.

106
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,060


107
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,060


108
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,060


109
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,060

Danke.

114

Danke.

115
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:46,480


116
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:46,480


117
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:46,520
Danke.

118
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:46,520


119
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:46,520

Danke.

121

00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,280
Danke.

123
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,280


124
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,280


125
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,220
Danke.

126
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,220


127
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,220


128
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,220


129
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,220


130
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,220

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,520
Thank you.

132
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:52,520


133
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:52,520


134
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:52,980
Thank you.

135
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,020
Bob is the real thing

136
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,620
I really like going to church

137
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,800
but it used to be that if I didn't get there half hour early

138
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,180
I couldn't get a seat up front and then I couldn't hear anything

139
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,620
but now that I have ear zoom

140
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,120
it doesn't matter where I sit

141
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,420
I can hear everything perfectly

142
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,680
The Subgenius

143
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,060
Power of

144
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,280
Spark

145
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,180
Hey Lee, listen now

146
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,120
do me a favor will ya?

147
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,000
I got a hot date tonight with Connie

148
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,420
knock on my door, wake me up in 20 minutes alright?

149
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,740
No, no, no, this is evolutionary

150
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,020
I've been reading this book on Leonardo

151
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,940
da Vinci

152
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,600
see that means from Vinci, did you know that?

153
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,040
Must be some book

154
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,980
Yeah, well it turns out that the master slept only 20 minutes

155
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,460
every 3 hours

156
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,580
now that works out to 2 and a half extra days

157
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,540
that I'm awake per week, every week

158
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,340
which means if I live to be 80

159
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,020
I will have lived the equivalent

160
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,960
of 105 years

161
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,240
Alright people, I'd like to begin

162
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,460
with a hearty hail and well met good fellow

163
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,240
to Bob joining us from Business Affairs

164
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,180
Thanks

165
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,920
Hi everybody

166
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,500
Bob, we have a little baptism by fire

167
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,640
for you so to speak

168
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,720
Poor bastard

169
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,300
Let me speak with the manager, excuse me

170
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:17,900
Bob?

171
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,320
You might think it's lame

172
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,520
to play the rap game

173
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,340
It all sounds the same, the dummies with the fame

174
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,880
Give me half a chance to sell

175
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,920
out with no shame

176
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,300
Very, very selfish

177
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,540
My number one interest is me

178
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,780
No contest, I might sound thoughtless

179
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,840
But still you bought this

180
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,400
Some call it ignorance

181
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,580
But me I call it bliss

182
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,040
Very, very selfish

183
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,440
Very, very selfish

184
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,080
Selfish man

185
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,860
Selfish man

186
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,440
Selfish man

187
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,160
Selfish man

188
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,960
Do it again

189
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,820
Selfish man

190
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,420
Selfish man

191
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:57,860
Selfish man

192
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,100
Selfish man

193
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,360
Selfish man

194
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,800
Selfish man

195
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,040
Selfish man

196
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,040


197
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,660
Do it again

198
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,200
Do it again

199
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,880
Used to think small

200
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,180
But now I walk tall

201
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,540
I know I'll have it all

202
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,920
I heard my duty call

203
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,300
I'm sick how I rhyme

204
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,580
And I'm sick how I ball

205
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,900
Very, very selfish

206
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,580
If you listen to this track

207
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,880
And it kinda takes you back

208
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,180
To your day smoking crack

209
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,500
Trying to chase the heart attack

210
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,820
Well let me tell you son

211
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,160
you weren't accomplishing jack

212
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,620
Very, very selfish

213
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,920
Very, very selfish

214
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,760
Selfish man

215
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,520
Selfish man

216
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:27,520


217
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:27,860
Selfish man

218
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:27,860


219
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:27,860


220
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,680
Selfish man, selfish man, do it again

221
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:45,320
Selfish man, selfish man, selfish man, do it again

222
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,880
You might think it's lame to play the rap game

223
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,640
It all sounds the same, the dummies with the fame

224
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,180
Give me half a chance to sell out with no shame

225
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,920
Very, very selfish, very, very selfish

226
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,340
Selfish

227
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:09,340
That's a, um, a pink, yeah, pink, we're, uh, we're pink, yeah

228
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:12,960
Yeah

Yeah

230
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,880
Oh boy

231
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,400
Yeah, boy, boy

232
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,620
Uh

233
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:19,700
Yeah

234
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,740
Hey, Bobby

235
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,320
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using a vacation time

236
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,620
Okay

237
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,960
Good time, too

238
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,280
Everyone but the bandits will be slacking off till after the new year anyway

239
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,940
Oh, I like this

240
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,520
And it's pink

241
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,980
I'll get you a pink wherever you want

242
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,240
I had a great time

243
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,920
The whole hour just flew by

244
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,240
I'll get that

245
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,720
Oh, thanks, Bobby

246
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,080
You don't want to have any regrets

247
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,240
I should know

248
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,180
What do you mean?

249
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,580
Well, I had a dream, too

250
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,280
I was gonna be a professional wrestler, man

251
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,000
I was gonna call myself Bobzilla

252
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,740
Bobzilla

253
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,160
Give me five more minutes on the name, dude

254
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,900
Well, it all went well, I guess, but I'm not gonna be a professional wrestler, man

255
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,500
It's not gonna work out fine

256
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,400
And now for the main event

257
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,560
In this corner, he's nasty

258
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,740
He's dirty

259
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,760
He lives under the refrigerator

260
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,700
Ladies and germs

261
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,380
The Roach

262
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,920
And in this corner

263
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,200
He's the best at controlling the pest

264
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,160
The man with a plan to put the bug in the can

265
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,400
The champion

266
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,260
Bobzilla

267
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,680
Bobzilla

268
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,700
Bobzilla

269
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,820
And I crushed my dreams

270
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,760
Everything I wanted to be

271
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,160
Bob's Bugs Be Gone was the death of me

272
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,340
I'm Bob from Bob's Bugs Be Gone

273
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,100
You call me for all your pest control needs

274
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,760
I will kill your bug's dreams

275
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,520
Bob's Bugs Be Gone is not affiliated with Robert's Bugs Be Gone or Bo's Bugs Be Gone or Bob's Bugs Be Good

276
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,240
Bob is not responsible for property damage due to hive removal, pest sterilization, or larval dispersion

277
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,900
Bob's Bugs Be Gone is not affiliated with Robert's Bugs Be Gone or Bo's Bugs Be Gone or Bob's Bugs Be Good

278
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,800
Bugs Be Gone will not handle snakes longer than five and one-half feet in length.

279
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,120
Arachnids with two thoraxes, bats of any kind, or the dreaded vinegaroon.

280
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,140
Bob offers free termite inspections and $30 off for the purchase of an annual contract.

281
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,640
Bob is an Equal Opportunity Employer, Seattle, Espanol.

282
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,960

283

No me olvide.

00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,320
El se nombre Bob.

286
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,200

287
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,140

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,200
In the cannot.

290
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,100
¿Cómo se dice Bob?

291
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,780
¿Cómo se dice Bob?

292
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,480
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

293
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,160
El se nombre Bob.

294
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,260
Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob story?

295
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,960
Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants.

296
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,320
So I'm off to the store.

297
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,280
What happened to Bob?

298
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,040
Well, nothing. His part of the story is done.

299
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,640
The only one they have in stock is Pink.

300
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,480
And the Pink sent me over the top.

301
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,520
We use Pink to rehabilitate a dog today.

302
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,080
How do you like that? It's not the Pink.

303
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,520
Everybody knows that.

304
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,780
We make sure that Pink was part of the family.

305
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,220
I think that's the most important part.

306
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,900
We put a cat and a dog together.

307
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,880
We make the humans become a path leader.

308
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,420
He was communicating with them.

309
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,000
What do you think?

310
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,020
I think Rockefeller was crazy that night.

311
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,020
He got away with the money.

312
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,260
How can we stop them?

313
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,120
We can stop them by stopping the Pink Boys.

314
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:15,180
If we stop the Pink Boys, we can stop them murdering and they're killing and they're stealing and they're persifying us.

315
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,180
But it's so difficult.

316
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,880
Oh, Jerry, don't let the boy out of the house.

317
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,460
Be brave. Be brave.

318
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,880
Oh, always be brave.

319
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,100
Because...

320
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,800
The women saves us.

321
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,140
Greetings to you, Earthlings.

322
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,920
I am Princess Dragomon.

323
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,080
I have taken over this planet.

324
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,980
Now I own the Earth and you'll be my slaves for all eternity.

325
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,840
The disasters you experienced are just small examples of our great power.

326
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,120
Either surrender to me or I'll destroy all humans.

327
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,300
I've spoken.

328
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,620
It's all the warning you're going to get from me.

329
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,620
You'll be destroyed.

330
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,380
They don't sleep, either.

331
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,520
They're not emotional,

332
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,200
angels don't have any emotions.

333
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,360
Another and worse war will break out.

334
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,500
And you see a night with a strange light in the sky.

335
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,180
You will know it is a sign that the world is about to be punished for its crime.

336
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,860
Do you have an empty moment?

337
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,780

346
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:46,940
that the end of the world will come in july 1999 perhaps or is it just another of those

347
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:52,680
prognostications which have haunted man through the ages such a forewarning of ultimate doom

348
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,580
could generally be dismissed out of hand but for the fact that many of nostradamus's other prophecies

349
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:04,020
have already been fulfilled but the old ones are coming back

350

00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,480
The song,

378
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,520
the

379
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,120
Nombre Bob

380
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,800
in Spanish

381
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,420
was sung by Priestess Pisces

382
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,260
with several fisted tales of Connie

383
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,460
behind her live.

384
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,800
Including Reverend Angry Larry,

385
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,440
Suds Bichot I think, Dr. Philodrum

386
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,080
and maybe Dr.

387
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,800
Sinister on drums. I don't

388
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,380
remember.

389
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,380
The sort of anti-rap

390
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,160
song you might

391
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,300
call it. Very, very selfish

392
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,500
was by the Psychoskeletons.

393
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,980
Who can be found at

394
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,320
soundclick.com

395
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,900
slash the psychoskeletons

396
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,300
from, really

397
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,100
I think the psychoskeletons are mostly

398
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,180
Reverend Basil.

399
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,020
He's the

400
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,060
Basil part of the

401
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,200
psychoskeletons. I don't know if they're really

402
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,400
even skeletons. I don't know either.

403
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,200
That may just be a band name. Yeah.

404
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,280
I don't know. But you just, you

405
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,800
never know.

406
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,060
This music in the background is

407
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,860
the Flyin' Ryan Brothers.

408
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,860
Good musician friends.

409
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,020
They're unusual among subgeniuses

410
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,820
as is

411
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,600
this horrible character

412
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,400
here heard in the background

413
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,720
or the foreground.

414
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,860
I'm hurting in the background.

415
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,860
Rumpel Foreskin is

416
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,420
on the line.

417
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,440
Say it again

418
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,980
and have the chill bling.

419
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,420
That's what grandma used to say.

420
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,020
At least

421
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,120
somebody's grandmother said that. I don't know.

422
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,700
You had a grandmother?

423
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,300
I had quite a few grandmothers in my

424
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,540
tasty young days. I was

425
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,460
fond of elderly ladies.

426
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,520
I used to seek them out on buses and

427
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,180
tramways and various

428
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,380
means of escapes.

429
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,980
I hope they returned your love, Dave.

430
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,320
They returned my love, usually with a

431
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,100
punch in the jaw.

432
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,180
Well, that means they really care about you.

433
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,200
Yeah. That they really got off is what

434
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,060
you're supposed to say.

435
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,300
I'm not up on the hip

436
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,280
lingo these days

437
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,480
with the kids and all.

438
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,260
Yeah, I know they're hard to

439
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,320
rectify.

440
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,620
All those laws.

441
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,360
Well, speaking of rectifying,

442
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,220
the erections are coming up,

443
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,940
as it were.

444
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,220
By the time most people outside

445
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,780
of Cleveland hear this show,

446
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,400
it'll be three weeks later than we're doing

447
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,180
this show. Dave and I talked about this earlier

448
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,040
today. I said,

449
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,360
we can't be too

450
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,460
current because most people won't hear it for three

451
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,100
weeks. So if you talk about today's

452
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,300
murder, mass murder of the day,

453
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,340
nobody's going to know

454
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,100
what you're talking about three weeks from now.

455
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,980
Because there'll have been

456
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,400
three weeks worth of

457
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,520
mass murders per day.

458
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,860
You're practicing time control right now.

459
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,220
Yeah.

460
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,960
And you have to now because those

461
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,640
school murders happen every what?

462
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,480
I guess they figured out there's something

463
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,300
like that every three and a half weeks.

464
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,840
Every school day

465
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,820
at quarter of three,

466
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,020
they just can't wait that extra

467
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,120
15 minutes before the bell rings.

468
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,140
And I know just how they feel.

469
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,420
If I'd had a handgun back then,

470
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,280
ding dong. Yeah,

471
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,780
I wouldn't be here now.

472
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,160
That would have been the end of principal poop

473
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,280
and all the other lackeys who used to hang around

474
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,080
the basement making weird paddles

475
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,200
at wood design or wood shop,

476
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,540
you know, the guys

477
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,160
would give you a ride like when you're supposed

478
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,000
to be taking driver's education and they

479
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,060
forearm you right in the nose and sometimes

480
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,920
it would like splinter and go in your eye.

481
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,200
Did your

482
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,100
shop teachers drill holes in those

483
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,500
paddles?

484
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,460
Yeah.

485
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,200
Yeah.

486
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,900
Yeah, it's to snag the meat.

487
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,460
Make them go.

488
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,800
Sizzle through the air faster

489
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,620
and hit you harder.

490
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,600
It is a weird way of in a culinary way.

491
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,420
It is a weird way of looking at all

492
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,480
that meat being paddled

493
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,420
that way with so many little holes

494
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,640
making a texture. I guess

495
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,440
there would probably be like a veal dish

496
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:36,960
or something.

497
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,140
Now my mouth is kind of watering.

498
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,900
I'm thinking of some of the butts.

499
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,340
Some of

500
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,060
them. Isn't there a

501
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,300
political party of big butted

502
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,220
people, the big ass party or

503
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,060
something like that?

504
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,040
That's the gop.

505
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,080
Not always. Some

506
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,800
of the gops are skinny.

507
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,180
I know one gop who started out

508
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,000
with a gigantic huge

509
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,100
butt and now he wears about the same size pants

510
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,260
I did. Uh-huh. Which isn't

511
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,900
saying a whole lot for my butt

512
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,260
actually to tell the truth.

513
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,460
But we have, you know,

514
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,220
other cliches.

515
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,180
to cover. And it's a silly butt

516
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,260
at that. I wish I could have watched some

517
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,840
sort of like Martian political

518
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,080
campaign rally and stuff. It's like

519
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,200
I, I, did you hear

520
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,040
um, Vice-Hair

521
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,320
Prime Minister, next checker

522
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,680
um, Von Clinton speak?

523
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,280
No. I actually listened

524
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
to that like an idiot and I was like

525
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,260
boy, those are the good old days

526
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,040
and old Bill was in there and uh

527
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,260
hey, nobody cares. Mostly honestly

528
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,280
had to do with business. Didn't have to do with

529
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,440
what you did with your, uh,

530
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,080
I thought he was pretty moderate for a Republican.

531
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,640
Yeah. Clinton.

532
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,560
Yes.

533
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,960
For that matter, that's the way I think

534
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,000
about Obama, but

535
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,040
Yeah. You know, I've

536
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,840
got a whole different, a new approach. I've

537
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,660
decided, Dave, that

538
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,180
and this is why I didn't listen to Clinton's

539
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,780
speech or any of that stuff. I'm

540
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,840
gonna, from now on, I'm not gonna vote

541
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,960
I'm not gonna vote according to what

542
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,880
the candidates say, but what their fans

543
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,080
say on Yahoo News comments.

544
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,460
I'm gonna judge the political

545
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,100
parties by their representatives

546
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,860
on Yahoo News dot com.

547
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,960
Well done, my dear.

548
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,440
These changes towards mental retardation amongst

549
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,460
the whole population are coming real quickly

550
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,480
so why not capitalize on them now and

551
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,540
even be the Varfisa or the

552
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,400
Elephant Organ or some other vessel

553
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,660
you know, for such a meandering

554
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,080
you know, so to speak.

555
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,960
Well, it's kind of like a reverse

556
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,340
barometer. I'll judge if

557
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,480
if in their comments they do

558
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,740
everything they're accusing their

559
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,740
opponents of, then that's the party I'll vote

560
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,100
against.

561
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,920
Oh, if they're doing what their party

562
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,440
says they're against

563
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,880
then you will vote against

564
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,840
them. No, if they do everything they're

565
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,660
accusing their Yahoo

566
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,800
dot com opponents of, for instance

567
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,940
a typical one would be

568
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,760
lib turds are

569
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,360
so stooped

570
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,760
and ignoratious they

571
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,840
can't do anything but name

572
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,880
calling because they're all

573
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,060
lazy racist

574
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,360
communists who are childish

575
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,440
and can't

576
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,540
spiel right

577
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:18,920
right

578
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,500
so

579
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,500
or if they say, what was the other thing?

580
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,700
Nobody I know ever got polled

581
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,420
well, we're all being polled

582
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,600
all the time

583
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,440
but you can choose the way you're going to get

584
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,780
screwed. Some ways are fun.

585
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,660
You have to learn the right angle

586
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,060
to bend over. That's about it.

587
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,300
You have to produce some sort of identification

588
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,920
in your forehead usually

589
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,920
and you put a little microchip in your pineal gland

590
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,760
so you don't have to worry about the voting machine being corrupted

591
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,720
you just walk in there and stare at a blank screen

592
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,860
for a few seconds and then walk away after you've been given your commands

593
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,080
Right. They installed those things when we were little kids in the 50s

594
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,460
Yep.

595
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,640
If we were little kids in the 50s, of course

596
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,440
the ones that they put in us, our generation

597
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,840
had mercury in them and

598
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,340
and uh

599
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:11,940
uh

600
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,460

00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,580
right now. It's stalled.

618
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,820
I can hear

619
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,220
fan noise coming off of it.

620
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,600
Well, I think the battery's still functional.

621
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,300
I don't know about the ignition switch.

622
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,600
Well,

623
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,440
see, yours is the reverse

624
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,300
of mine. My battery's fine,

625
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,520
but I have trouble getting it. I have to kickstart

626
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,560
my forehead.

627
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,460
And you have to use big, big boots

628
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,700
to do it with, and you have to keep stomping

629
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,380
afterwards and saying these weird

630
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,540
clockwork orange phrases and stuff

631
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,480
like, you'll get

632
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,680
and bother

633
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,680
bugger off and stuff.

634
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,240
Well, we don't have to. You and me get paid for

635
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,380
coming up with those.

636
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,140
Oh, yeah.

637
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,340
I just got a check here,

638
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,440
and I can't find it.

639
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,700
It was somewhere. I left it next to my

640
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,840
way.

641
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,460
Do you think the currency...

642
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,480
Do you think we should take Bob's name

643
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,240
off the currency?

644
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,000
I think Bob's name should be more

645
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,480
places and more...

646
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,440
arcane number symbology across

647
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,360
all of the currency.

648
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,220
I'm with you, Dave.

649
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,200
More Bob on the currency.

650
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,320
I miss the old Bobhead

651
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,060
nickels.

652
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,920
But we cannot crucify man

653
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,580
upon a cross of Bob

654
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:57,920
as...

655
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,200
Who says?

656
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,020
We can now. No, of course, back then

657
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,060
you couldn't. You can now.

658
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,160
You can crucify a person on Bob.

659
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,320
You just nail them to Bob.

660
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,040
Just right on top.

661
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,600
Yeah. You should nail your hands

662
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,560
or your victim's hands to his

663
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,820
hands and the feet

664
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,900
to Bob's feet.

665
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,840
Bob's your uncle.

666
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,280
Or Bob's your cross to bear.

667
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,820
big bird hung around your neck.

668
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,840
What's that big old bird?

669
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,760
You know, that big eagle or a buzzard or something

670
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,520
hanging around your neck. Albatross, that's it.

671
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,800
Yes. Albuquerque.

672
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,520
What? It's like having...

673
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,080
I mean, the whole state of New Mexico

674
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,340
and the ancient mariner

675
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,120
all intertwined and stuck around your head

676
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,880
while you're on the ground and you're crying

677
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,400
and laughing at the same time

678
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,880
because, you know,

679
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,000
bowel movements have changed radically

680
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,620
over the last three minutes

681
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,760
and you just can't focus

682
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,960
or anything. I don't know.

683
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,380
Hey, hey, is Al there? I want to talk to Al.

684
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,280
Albatross. Is that Albatross

685
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,720
here?

686
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,680
Not yet.

687
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,000
Al. Albatross.

688
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,160
How'd you like...

689
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,800
Al. Is there a how'd you like it

690
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,280
kid here?

691
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,120
I've heard that tape too many times.

692
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,240
And yet, once a month

693
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,960
somebody sends me that tape.

694
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,040
The two you are called.

695
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,160
Yeah, that's why I'll cut your belly

696
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,080
open and make you look at all the black

697
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,180
stuff you got in there.

698
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,740
That was my favorite line

699
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,300
until I overused it.

700
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,300
Oh, man.

701
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,140
Nobody I know is going to vote

702
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,200
for that guy.

703
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,460
No, what you mean is

704
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,840
nobody you know has told you

705
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,220
they're going to vote for that guy

706
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,460
because you've already told them what you think

707
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,620
about those who are going to vote for that guy.

708
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,800
So they'll just keep their mouth

709
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,840
shut and

710
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,900
let you rant and rave.

711
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,760
Yes, and nod

712
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,500
their heads politely and

713
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,100
look at their watch every 15 seconds

714
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,260
and eventually go,

715
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,020
Oh, I've got to... Oh, man, I'm sorry.

716
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,240
I have to go

717
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,560
return a library bug.

718
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,780
I've got a Blockbuster tape that's overdue.

719
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,920
VHS tape.

720
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,120
It's overdue 10 years.

721
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,160
I've got to find a Blockbuster

722
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,000
to return it.

723
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,100
I'm so happy to see those guys

724
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,840
go under. I had a personal grudge

725
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,720
against Blockbuster because they had a

726
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,920
personal grudge against Bob.

727
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,600
J.R. Bob Dobbs. What did they say?

728
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,020
Well, what happened was

729
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,920
in the 90s

730
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,380
our feature,

731
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,920
our length video, Arise,

732
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,240
actually got picked up for

733
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,900
distribution by Polygram.

734
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,160
And Polygram, amazingly enough,

735
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,000
sold it to the main video

736
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,260
renters of that year, which were...

737
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,300
Remember Sound Whorehouse?

738
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,180
I remember...

739
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,340
Well, they, Sound Warehouse,

740
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,120
bought 800 copies

741
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,240
of Arise to put in

742
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,000
all their stores.

743
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,380
And then a month later, they were bought by Blockbuster,

744
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,360
which was making a big name for itself

745
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,860
as a Christian company.

746
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,540
And Blockbuster, the next month,

747
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,800
had Sound Warehouse return all their copies

748
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,760
of Monty Python's Life of Brian

749
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,740
and Arise, and probably

750
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,580
some other things. But not, you know,

751
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,340
I murdered the babysitter, or

752
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,820
I'm the serial killer.

753
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,880
I burn your skin, I eat your

754
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,040
scabs, or any of those.

755
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,180
They still rented those.

756
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
Last Temptation of Christ.

757
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,560
Oh, yeah, right, right. Well, this was

758
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,480
before that time.

759
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,520
We got in trouble for doing a remake of that,

760
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,080
actually.

761
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,840
We didn't think it was bloody enough.

762
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,180
But, yeah, Blockbuster

763
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,680
had all of those Arise copies

764
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,360
returned, and after that,

765
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,860
Polygram didn't have any hope for us,

766
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,680
and they ignored our little movie.

767
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,760
And now, the only person

768
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,020
selling it is me and my co-director,

769
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,020
Court Holland.

770
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,440
Well, you are the kind of person,

771
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,280
and you generate the kind of

772
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,740
negative energy in some of these extreme

773
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,920
types. I won't say what kind of types

774
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,720
they are. They are generally pink.

775
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,000
Type O and type A.

776
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,000
Certainly, for surely.

777
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,140
But you generate too much angst nausea

778
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,880
in them, and they want to

779
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,980
not only attack your product, they want to

780
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,840
throw you out the window.

781
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,760
Not like you.

782
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,480
Oh, well, I'm sure I arouse similar feelings

783
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,540
of angst nausea in many people, and I think

784
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,740
that's better than netiquette

785
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,700
when you're frying your own dough.

786
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,920
Oh, you're a lot better at it than I am. You can do it without even opening your mouth.

787
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,160
Well,

788
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,480
that's because that's the only

789
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,580
orifice that needs to be open at that time.

790
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,400
Right. Other times I can

791
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,320
amuse people

792
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,020
with my squeaks and

793
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,960
other noises.

794
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,160
I believe.

795
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,900
What, I'm supposed to start farting now?

796
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,140
Yeah, I was actually waiting to hear some noises.

797
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,820
I wanted to hear some funny noises.

798
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,900
You know, we used to do sound effects

799
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,620
and stuff on... Oh, no.

800
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,880
Chaz was always one of the

801
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,740
sound effects.

802
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,300
Yeah.

803
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,220
I did the Foley effects with my mouth.

804
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,920
That's what you were expecting.

805
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,880
And coffee cups. Lots and lots of coffee cups.

806
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,920
Yeah, Dave would tear the end off a coffee cup

807
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,640
and use that for his electronic

808
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,220
special effect modifier.

809
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,660
And the cellophane from the cigarette wraps.

810
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,300
Didn't it work, though?

811
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,320
Well, yeah, in a little rascals

812
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,380
kind of way, but that's

813
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,940
our way.

814
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,880
Is this our way?

815
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,900
Did you ever punch a watermelon to resemble

816
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,580
the sound of a human being struck?

817
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,440
A human's face?

818
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,720
No, but I have the sound effects record

819
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,800
that they did that on.

820
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,660
Everybody did. Everybody had that

821
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,640
sound effects record.

822
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,580
The one with the car crash. There was a car crash

823
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,700
that to this day I still hear every now and then

824
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,220
in the movies.

825
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,680
It's got kind of an... noise just before

826
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,360
the crash.

827
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,640
It sounds like a human voice and it ends

828
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,860
with a rolling

829
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,360
wheel or something.

830
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,180
You hear something roll away afterwards

831
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,120
which has become kind of a cliche.

832
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,820
So now whenever there's a crash

833
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,780
you have to end it with one little piece

834
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,560
rolling off to the side.

835
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,980
This does a punctuation at the end.

836
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,860
And if you're into the audio business

837
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,180
of the end of the spectrum, you'd like to hear

838
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,940
the sound of a little clink or a clank

839
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,960
as the wheel goes by.

840
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,060
Sometimes you'd like to see a gnome, you know, like one of those

841
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,780
garden gnomes, expose

842
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,020
themselves in the most absurd

843
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,060
fashion, the most disgusting

844
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,040
little type of way

845
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,260
you could possibly imagine.

846
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,920
You're talking about

847
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,140
garden gnomes exposing themselves?

848
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,120
Dave?

849
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:36,780
Dave?

850
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,760
Yes, it is.

851
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,400
You can tell what he's got on his mind.

852
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,060
You can tell what he thinks about

853
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,220
day in and day out from dawn to dusk.

854
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,840
As a member of the

855
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,880
Communist Party, I'd like

856
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,260
to thank the delegates from Eurasia,

857
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,120
Oceania,

858
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,880
and also the rest

859
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,620
of the delegates there.

860
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,860
This wonderful brunch

861
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,700
before we begin our

862
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,080
convention.

863
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,800
The Reverend

864
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,760
Thomas Luther of the Church of God.

865
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,540
...pickle, and

866
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,960
the Reverend Ivory

867
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,400
Ivan Stang

868
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,560
of the Church of the Subgenius

869
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,540
He pronounced it right.

870
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,340
...will deliver the

871
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,760
pre-campaign

872
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,060
networking Sphinx Prize

873
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,560
annual D-Drop Award.

874
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,720
Reverend Stang?

875
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,440
My fellow heads of

876
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,160
cabbage, come let us

877
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,380
reason together

878
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,100
and call the flowers

879
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,520
together upon this great

880
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,740
garden of

881
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,620
filth, which we

882
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,660
fertilize by osmosis.

883
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,520
Just lay down

884
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,260
and leak all over it, friends,

885
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,380
and your garden will grow.

886
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,800
It's hard for me

887
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,780
to be in this world lately, Dave.

888
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,880
I understand.

889
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,700
I have a better world at home.

890
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,780
If I was a kid,

891
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,740
I wouldn't have to do it at home.

892
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,560
I'd probably have a

893
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,500
miniature, portable

894
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,880
game player device.

895
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,680
Yes.

896
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,140
But I'd rather, frankly,

897
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,540
I'd rather be slaying

898
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,200
jaggies or lewdrothes.

899
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,180
These are monsters in this

900
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,840
my first video game.

901
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,980
I could totally understand.

902
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,040
Did I tell you about that?

903
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,700
How I started playing a real video game

904
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,940
just like people do?

905
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,780
Yes, and you created your own

906
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,940
sick world.

907
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,340
No, no, no.

908
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,360
I paid money.

909
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,040
I actually bought this game

910
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,980
and I entered a sick world

911
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,260
that some Japanese company created.

912
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,960
But they're pretty good.

913
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,240
The graphics are really nice.

914
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,020
It's a kid's game.

915
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,420
It's not really, it's no Skyrim

916
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,420
or Call of Duty.

917
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,180
But is not Stangor a rather

918
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,700
what else should we say

919
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,820
type of character

920
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,680
not very cosmopolitan?

921
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,260
Perhaps not.

922
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,580
Oh, he is now.

923
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,600
He is now.

924
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,020
When Stangor first awoke

925
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,540
in Moga Village,

926
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,120
he was a naked barbarian

927
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,440
with a little good-for-nothing

928
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,260
sword made out of popsicles.

929
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,760
I thought you were going to say something else.

930
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,100
In his underwear.

931
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,660
Yeah, he was in his underwear.

932
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,700
We don't actually know if he can take that underwear off.

933
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,020
And he is built

934
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,460
in the Mimitoni.

935
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,480
What a six-pack.

936
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,000
A prehistoric human being

937
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,580
with a caveman with a very small organ

938
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,720
is still quite a...

939
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,360
a delightfully...

940
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,880
I don't know, stupid, maybe.

941
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,180
Well, he's not a caveman.

942
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,800
That's what people get Stangor wrong.

943
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,660
He's more like Conan,

944
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,960
who, if you recall,

945
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,060
you're Robert E. Howard, Dave.

946
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,860
Conan became an emperor

947
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:52,820
eventually.

948
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,760
And Stangor has that possibility recently.

949
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,740
In fact,

950
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,020
there's one reason nobody's heard from me

951
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,200
in about two weeks

952
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,340
is we got an improved internet connection.

953
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,620
And I was able,

954
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,980
we'll start playing the game online,

955
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,180
which meant that Stangor

956
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,060
could go into the big city.

957
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,740
If you crossed through the magic window

958
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,960
into the bigger world

959
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,340
beyond Moga Village,

960
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,660
you can go to this big city.

961
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,320
And from there, if you're good enough,

962
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,740
you can eventually go sailing

963
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,820
all over the desert

964
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,360
and sand sails.

965
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,840
But Stangor actually

966
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,060
bought himself a tuxedo

967
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,100
made of giant bug wings

968
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,700
and things.

969
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,020
Man, it's cool.

970
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,480
Yeah, he looks very slick.

971
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,040
He doesn't even,

972
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,020
he can walk around in the city

973
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,900
wearing what looks like a tuxedo.

974
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,240
He doesn't even have a helmet on.

975
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,040
And he does look a little bit like me.

976
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,300
He's got a long ponytail

977
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,900
and a white goatee

978
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,400
and mustache.

979
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,320
And he's handsome, like I am.

980
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,180
Yes, and he's very regally drawn.

981
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,820
Yes.

982
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,860
Regally drawn.

983
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,040
What an eloquent statement.

984
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,820
Now, he also has some armor

985
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,200
that makes him look like a clown

986
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,080
wearing a bathysphere

987
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,660
over each body part.

988
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,320
Oh, that's so elegant.

989
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,340
He does have that.

990
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,780
But all of this is actually

991
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,820
just an excuse for me to play a song

992
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,100
that Pisces and Reverend Angry Larry

993
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,320
and them whipped up at X-Day.

994
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,900
And they mean that

995
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,800
in the extra meditating way, too.

996
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,320
Well.

997
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:25,960
They whipped it up.

998
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,460
Well.

999
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,980
Like a frosty cone in their mind.

1000
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,360
Yeah.

1001
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,660
I suppose so.

1002
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,100
Actually, you guys don't know,

1003
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,180
but we discussed that.

1004
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,720
We discussed that on the previous hour of Slack,

1005
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,200
the frosty cone extra meditation stuff,

1006
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,900
which we probably shouldn't dwell upon.

1007
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,720
But as a frame of reference,

1008
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,280
you know, like,

1009
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,000
where did I hear that?

1010
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,060
Well, I said that.

1011
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,900
No, Stank said that.

1012
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,520
But why did we say it?

1013
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,760
Did I say it?

1014
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,840
Why did anyone say such a stupid thing?

1015
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,460
Why are you asking that?

1016
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,820
I don't know.

1017
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,020
Because we're subgenius.

1018
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,000
Because they were there?

1019
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,940
Because we were there.

1020
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,800
Because those stupid things to say

1021
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
were there to be said.

1022
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,180
If only rockers,

1023
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,720
if they had been there,

1024
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,020
there would be 20 times as many stupid things.

1025
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,340
That's what I needed to hear.

1026
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,460
I feel so relieved now.

1027
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,100
No, I'm going to play this song.

1028
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,800
The best thing about it is its length,

1029
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,720
which is short.

1030
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:24,840
Yeah, they were jamming on stage on July 5th,

1031
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,740
but we were all sad because, you know,

1032
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,880
it turned out not to be 1998 again.

1033
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,900
And they were jamming on stage,

1034
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,680
and suddenly,

1035
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,420
I don't even know how Reverend Angry Larry

1036
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,980
even knew about Stangor,

1037
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:39,980
but he,

1038
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,880
well, I guess I'd been walking around

1039
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,300
dressed as Stangor.

1040
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,720
That's an embarrassing thing.

1041
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,280
I'd rather not dwell on it.

1042
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,900
Oh, I don't know if I'd want to admit that.

1043
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,060
But they,

1044
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,120
suddenly he was talking about Stanguar,

1045
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,320
and they did a Guar-like song

1046
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,340
about Stangor,

1047
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,100
and Pisces made up the lyrics,

1048
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,120
which started with the word,

1049
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:01,760
Ah!

1050
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,460
So,

1051
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,200
here it is.

1052
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:05,880
Ah!

1053
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,660
Stangor!

1054
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:19,880
Stangor!

1055
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,380
We need Steve Gordon Gordon up here to sing this!

1056
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,620
One, two, three, four!

1057
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,140
Stangor!

1058
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,920
Stangor!

1059
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:54,340
Stang터 사라졌 let Washyourawan

1060
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,800
Stangor!

1061
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:55,900
He's Stanko!

1062
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,120
His name is Stanko!

1063
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,960
Daddy's a fat, funny, and a killer

1064
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,620
He's a great, stanko killer

1065
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,900
He'll save them with his might

1066
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,860
He can hit them good, hard, and quick

1067
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,640
He's Stanko!

1068
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,560
Stanko!

1069
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,080
Stanko!

1070
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:30,260


1071
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,020
He's a great Stanko!

1072
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,640
He's a great, awesome, and a killer

1073
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,840
He'll save them with his might

1074
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,760
He's a great, powerful, and a killer

1075
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,620
He's a great, awesome, and a killer

1076
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,100
He's Stanko!

1077
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,440
Stanko!

1078
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:54,640
Stanko!

1079
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:03,620
Well, I won't subject everybody in the listening audience to this vanity song about my video game character.

1080
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,700
Yeah, I'm grooving on it!

1081
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:10,540
Those were some very, very mighty nice licks that were just extemporaneously boireized.

1082
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,880
Yeah, it does sound pretty boireized.

1083
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,160
You must tell Reverend Angry Larry that I appreciate from the bottom of my...

1084
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,420
You know...

1085
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,660
I'm sorry.

1086
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,020
I'm so sick of you!

1087
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,980
I'm so sick of you!

1088
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,040
For sure.

1089
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,100
Anyway, um...

1090
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:36,520
I think there's an interesting little recording that comes up right after this,

1091
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,440
which I may...

1092
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,300
I may leave on, or turn the sound up for.

1093
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,460
This was off of...

1094
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:49,260
This was one of the few songs that sounded better off my location recorder,

1095
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,640
and not off the board.

1096
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:54,900
On the board version, all you hear is Pisces, and it hurts.

1097
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,660
That scream at the beginning.

1098
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,420
I saw the... I'm sorry.

1099
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,220
I didn't mean to break the interlude, and the...

1100
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:03,820
Um...

1101
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,600
Did you see the... I saw the fish kill.

1102
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,060
I saw the fish kill.

1103
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,500
What? Huh?

1104
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,840
I saw the fish kill.

1105
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,040
What are you talking about, man?

1106
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,640
Well, I guess I was listening to Canadian radio,

1107
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,240
and they said, oh, there's been a massive fish kill in Lake Erie,

1108
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,940
and the Ontario Ministry of...

1109
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,260
See, Reverend Angry Larry reminded me of this Canadian crap,

1110
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,300
but, um...

1111
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,640
I'm not following.

1112
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,160
So I went down to the beach today, and it's on this side,

1113
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,360
but there's no reportage of it on this side.

1114
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,620
I'm not following.

1115
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,920
We've been to that beach that Dave goes to.

1116
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,620
Well, it's...

1117
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,720
Dave took us to that beach once in Eshtabula.

1118
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,620
Oh. It does not have snow on it.

1119
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,380
Now it has lots of sand and dead fish,

1120
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,960
is what I was trying to say.

1121
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,400
Oh, so there's been a die-off, another die-off.

1122
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,100
There's been a mass...

1123
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,060
And the Ontario Ministry of Fisheries in Wyethleif

1124
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,720
said that, um,

1125
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,600
there was a massive drop in the oxygen

1126
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,480
through some machinery that we have to divulge later.

1127
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:05,920
through some machinery that we have to divulge later.

1128
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,020
through some machinery that we have to divulge later.

1129
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,640
Well, you know...

1130
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,580
That's not good.

1131
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,540
The little spineless things,

1132
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,920
not politicians,

1133
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,380
the invertebrates,

1134
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,700
like the vertebrates,

1135
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,560
are estimated to be

1136
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,060
one in five species

1137
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,880
is about to be gone.

1138
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,020
And a lot of people go,

1139
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,700
well, who cares about a bunch of worms

1140
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,920
and germs? What do they do for us?

1141
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,860
Oh, well, they allow the plants to grow

1142
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,780
and make oxygen.

1143
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,400
They allow the roots to

1144
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,800
suck germs out of the sand

1145
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,620
and use them.

1146
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,360
All they do is cause...

1147
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,000
They're the bottom of the food chain

1148
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,520
that allows all larger things to live

1149
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,720
one after another.

1150
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,040
And they're in no better shape

1151
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,480
than the mountain gorillas

1152
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,140
and the chimpanzees.

1153
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,000
And the, uh...

1154
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,320
Well, it used to be starving Armenians

1155
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,280
when I was a kid,

1156
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,460
and then it was starving Chinese.

1157
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,340
Now it's the starving Americans.

1158
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,700
Eat your dinner!

1159
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,500
Think about the starving Americans!

1160
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,260
Don't clean your plate!

1161
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,060
Think about the starving Americans!

1162
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,980
That's why I both want to eat dinner

1163
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,020
and I wept and laughed

1164
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,920
during the Republican convention

1165
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,940
because they were both silly,

1166
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,260
I must agree with you,

1167
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,560
and I completely and heartily.

1168
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,000
But the Republican one was so absurd

1169
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,400
that I couldn't believe

1170
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,880
there was such a leap backwards

1171
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,440
in the American people.

1172
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,620
in the American people.

1173
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,320
I felt so sorry for Mrs. Romney

1174
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,760
because they were poor.

1175
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,300
They had to eat off of an ironing board

1176
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,080
and they had to eat canned food

1177
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,980
and they had it so expensive.

1178
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,740
It was so hard because

1179
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,420
all they had to live on was the dividends

1180
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,400
from his stocks.

1181
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,880
Just the dividends from their daddy's stocks.

1182
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,600
That's all they had.

1183
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,580
I think most people can identify with that.

1184
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,340
Most people know how that feels

1185
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,560
to have nothing but the dividends

1186
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,480
from your dad's stock to live on.

1187
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,340
And trying to live just on tuna fish?

1188
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,700
I mean, come on, that's really Spartan.

1189
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,040
Unfortunately, it was Maimai

1190
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,520
from the Cayman Islands.

1191
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,320
She has been admitting both.

1192
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,480
Well, we didn't really have

1193
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:13,880
financial hardships,

1194
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,060
but we had health problems.

1195
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,280
Even rich people can have health problems.

1196
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,180
Don't you feel sorry for me?

1197
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,100
What are you, a racist?

1198
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,860
Then she's going to walk into

1199
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,480
the boondoggle of healthcare

1200
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,960
and she's going to say,

1201
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,820
no, no, no, no, no,

1202
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,380
what I meant was healthcare.

1203
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,740
And then there's going to be an immigration problem.

1204
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,220
No, but she doesn't talk about things like that.

1205
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,020
She's already said.

1206
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,280
In fact, both of them have said,

1207
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,260
no, no, we're not going to talk about that kind of thing.

1208
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,320
The stuff that concerns you people.

1209
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,860
I think their mistresses should come out.

1210
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,760
The biggest, the hottest ones

1211
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,280
with the most largest

1212
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,980
Cajunas and the Bazongas

1213
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,120
and the Cazordanas and all those other names, you know.

1214
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,660
Comes out there and just goes,

1215
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,960
oh, this is so great.

1216
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,280
I love being here.

1217
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:01,880
Oh.

1218
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,200
And that'd be it.

1219
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,280
That's kind of what everybody does anyway, right?

1220
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,620
Oh yeah, that's right.

1221
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,260
I'm so happy to be here.

1222
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,340
You're all so wonderful.

1223
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,360
Let's all just

1224
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,040
masturbate each other.

1225
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,920
I'm getting scared.

1226
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,140
I'm getting really, really scared.

1227
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,000
Actually, Philo does that hysterical tittering

1228
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,160
a lot better than I do.

1229
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,120
He's crazier.

1230
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,540
He's even crazier than me.

1231
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,520
Well, Philo's kind of a conservative,

1232
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,480
but he lives in Berkeley.

1233
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,140
So he's surrounded by people who would make me feel

1234
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,660
like a conservative, relatively.

1235
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,560
You know, it's all relative.

1236
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,660
It depends on where you are.

1237
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,660
If I'm in Stangsville, Texas,

1238
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,060
why, I might as well be Chairman Mao.

1239
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,020
Communist.

1240
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,500
If I'm in Berkeley,

1241
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,360
I might as well be Rush

1242
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,020
Adolph Limbaugh.

1243
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,800
You know, I mean, it really is.

1244
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,200
And that's

1245
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,000
as it should be.

1246
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,780
The subgeniuses have to be

1247
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,360
the opposite of what most people are doing.

1248
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,740
That's their job.

1249
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,960
And the eventual

1250
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,160
extermination of most people.

1251
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,260
Well, except that it's not up

1252
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,900
to us to do that. That's the important thing.

1253
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,060
We're not so proud

1254
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,340
that we think we can destroy the Earth.

1255
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,080
We feel

1256
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,860
that that's best left up to

1257
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,400
giant corporations and aliens

1258
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,360
from outer space.

1259
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,940
And their flatulence.

1260
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,620
And their customers.

1261
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,440
Actually, all you really need to destroy a planet

1262
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,900
is a lot of customers.

1263
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,220
A hell of a lot.

1264
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,700
Malleable customers.

1265
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,100
We're not, you know,

1266
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,440
specifically collectivists.

1267
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,220
But by the same token,

1268
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,460
if you bite my shoe, I'll take a hammer

1269
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,040
to your foot.

1270
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,660
Yeah, it's every yard a kingdom.

1271
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,820
Get off of my lawn.

1272
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,840
Okay, Squire.

1273
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,380
That's the new make my day.

1274
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,200
Get off of my lawn.

1275
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,480
Fill up my empty chair.

1276
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,800
Sit in my chair.

1277
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,260
Sit in my chair.

1278
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,640
You feeling like a punk?

1279
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,840
Sit in my chair.

1280
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:14,700
Try it.

1281
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,840
I actually got a nice cut up of Clint Eastwood's speech

1282
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,280
from

1283
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,940
I think Reverend Wilhelm

1284
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,980
Stahlhelm.

1285
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,120
But I pronounced his name wrong, so he changed his name

1286
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,640
to the way I mispronounced it.

1287
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,680
He changed it to

1288
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,280
Wilhelm von Stroheim.

1289
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,040
I think we saw greed the night before

1290
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,000
or something and I got mixed up and said

1291
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,600
Stroheim instead of Stahlhelm.

1292
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,640
When I said uh, it was like uh, Clem.

1293
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,440
And he thought that was the name

1294
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,840
I was giving him, so he's

1295
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,580
Reverend Wilhelm von Stroheim.

1296
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,460
Anyway, he did a nice cut up

1297
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,980
but I've already used it

1298
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,100
on a canned hour

1299
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,360
of Slack, which

1300
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,080
everyone outside of WCSB Cleveland broadcast

1301
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,340
has already heard or will hear

1302
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,620
before they hear this.

1303
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,200
So it's time decontrol.

1304
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,580
And speaking of time control,

1305
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,080
I was going to play another little bit.

1306
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,300
And this little bit is funny

1307
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,240
because, well first

1308
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,980
there's a preacher talking about getting high off

1309
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,240
drinking blood, because Stangor does that.

1310
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,200
But it's a

1311
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,620
recording, friends,

1312
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,180
of, well it's actually, you might

1313
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,960
call it the very first subgenius

1314
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,820
recording. It was the first

1315
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,620
transmission from the Exists.

1316
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,900
I've never played it on the air

1317
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,120
ever, I don't think.

1318
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,280
I found it at the very end of a really old

1319
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,920
special media barrage

1320
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,200
preliminary tape. I'm going to play

1321
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,960
this. It's kind of short, but you'll actually

1322
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,320
hear, we had a, Philo

1323
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,040
and I were driving around out in the country late

1324
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,120
at night, and we were abducted

1325
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,020
by UFOs. I know that

1326
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,040
sounds silly, but you can listen to this

1327
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,480
recording, you can tell that we're

1328
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,340
sincerely terrified, and one of the aliens

1329
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,000
sort of took control

1330
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,360
of my brain,

1331
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,720
such as it is, and spoke

1332
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,000
through me. And

1333
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,480
so I'm going to play this historic subgenius

1334
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,180
recording, like I say, first

1335
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:08,520
of all.

1336
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,680
Yeah, okay, here,

1337
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,520
first there's a preacher talking about

1338
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,460
Stangor, okay.

1339
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,460
Uh, no, this one.

1340
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,800
Stang-quarr, Stang-quarr,

1341
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,120
I don't know what we were singing.

1342
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,100
Okay, okay, come on, come on.

1343
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:23,600
Stang-quarr.

1344
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,940
Some of these people I have been

1345
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,100
told can get high off of

1346
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,880
human blood, or can get high off of

1347
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,120
animal blood. But they feel

1348
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,780
very strongly that the blood from certain

1349
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,120
animals at certain points in time, and the things that are done

1350
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,840
at certain points in time, give them strength.

1351
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,980
Give them power

1352
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,080
over certain things.

1353
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,860
This man says no.

1354
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,900
It's all a myth. A crazy hoax

1355
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,180
dreamed up by somebody, and built into a national

1356
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,120
fixation by a sensation-seeking press.

1357
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:57,920
Get up there! There's something in the sky!

1358
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,260
Dr. Drummond, get a hold of the wheel!

1359
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,020
I can't!

1360
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,640
I feel...

1361
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,140
Oh!

1362
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:03,700
Oh!

1363
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:08,460
Get out!

1364
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:10,580
Get out!

1365
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,260
This is Antron.

1366
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,380
This is

1367
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,440
Antron.

1368
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,880
Attention, humans!

1369
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,800
I am speaking

1370
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,140
to the medium of

1371
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,020
Ivan Stang!

1372
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,480
To you, humans!

1373
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,380
We planted the seeds of life on this planet

1374
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,840
ten billion

1375
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,900
years ago!

1376
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,140
Seeds of

1377
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,300
atomic testing!

1378
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:43,920
Seeds of

1379
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:43,920


1380
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,040
Shut up, Pink Boy!

1381
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,960
Shut up, Pink Boy!

1382
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,480
Shut up, Pink Boy!

1383
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,640
Shut up, Pink Boy!

1384
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,980
Shut up, Pink Boy, kill me!

1385
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,440
Shut up, Pink Boy, kill me!

1386
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:58,400
What's going on?

1387
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,140
Dr. Drummond!

1388
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,600
Dr. Drummond, wake up!

1389
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,400
That was 1977.

1390
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,440
Wow.

1391
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,020
That was so prophetic.

1392
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,640
That was the beginnings of the...

1393
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,200
You can see why we take the X-Day prophecy so seriously.

1394
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,140
Right.

1395
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,920
They are to be taken seriously.

1396
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:28,200
I practically had a few tears there just thinking of what a horrible scene

1397
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,560
and how much you guys must have been changed forever.

1398
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,900
The poignance.

1399
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,940
In so many different ways.

1400
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:39,020
I just can't imagine the kind of psychic trauma that you go through every night,

1401
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,160
perhaps every day.

1402
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,960
That was the first time the phrase,

1403
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,400
shut up, pink boy, was ever heard on the planet.

1404
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,360
And it wasn't even a real phrase.

1405
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,280
It was an alien speaking through you.

1406
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,800
Shut up, pink boy.

1407
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,280
Seize all atomic testing.

1408
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,700
They called it atomic testing, I noticed,

1409
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,780
as if it was some 1950s thing.

1410
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,800
Probably that was the last.

1411
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,920
That was the last TV transmissions they'd been able to get.

1412
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,740
They'd been watching the same old monster movies we did,

1413
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,760
so they were using the language from that.

1414
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,100
Well, the thing is, these people shave their eyebrows

1415
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,080
and look like they're living in some kind of astral dimension

1416
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,420
between those two places you were talking about.

1417
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,240
They don't really know what's happening, man.

1418
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,700
I sure don't.

1419
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,660
I don't either, but they don't.

1420
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,720
Not as far as I'm concerned.

1421
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,620
I get no real message from them.

1422
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,300
I just get this.

1423
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,520
Looks like Brando in an apocalypse now or something.

1424
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,740
I just want to urinate in their shoes and run away

1425
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:41,060
and shout foul epithets to the wind and things like that.

1426
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,260
I'm sure you speak for every listener when you say that, Dave.

1427
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,740
I can't do more than coax them, I suppose.

1428
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,540
If I were like you, if I was like you,

1429
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,040
and I could get them to do my bidding.

1430
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,560
Well, yeah, I'm real good at getting people to do my bidding.

1431
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,060
I can clean up my driveway.

1432
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:02,440
Stuff like that.

1433
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,220
I've got a mess in the basement.

1434
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:07,720
I can't even get myself to do that.

1435
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,060
It's funny you should mention that.

1436
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,280
Yeah, funny you should mention some of those things.

1437
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,380
Oh, well.

1438
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,680
Well, that's what social media is for.

1439
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,960
Just call, you know, just wig out on all your friends.

1440
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:19,860
Daddy-o.

1441
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,800
Well, I'm getting all excited because...

1442
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,100
Clean up party at my pad.

1443
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:28,140
The next best holiday to X-Day is coming.

1444
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:28,740
Halloween.

1445
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:29,520
Yeah.

1446
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,180
Yeah.

1447
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,800
And WCSB will be...

1448
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:35,820
Having their big Halloween party, or costume ball.

1449
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,060
Which is really...

1450
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:39,300
We went to the last two of those, and they're great.

1451
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:44,960
In fact, last time I was given the job of projecting monster movies

1452
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,820
on the walls and ceilings, and I actually brought trailers, you know,

1453
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,580
because then you get...

1454
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,620
It's just the good stuff.

1455
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,680
Women screaming, monsters coming, women screaming, monsters coming.

1456
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,240
Monsters carrying beautiful...

1457
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,700
Women coming, monsters screaming.

1458
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,240
Just, you know, that's...

1459
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:00,960
And, uh...

1460
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:04,540
And they make WCSB beer, too.

1461
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,400
Uh-huh.

1462
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,280
And, uh...

1463
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,280
And they let me have that for free, I think.

1464
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:10,820
They're all...

1465
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,840
Since we were working.

1466
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,880
I was one of the workers.

1467
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,840
Princess Wee was the main worker.

1468
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,280
She did a lot.

1469
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:17,940
In fact, there's...

1470
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,620
Some of her work is in the station.

1471
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,760
There's several monster silhouettes in the station studio windows.

1472
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,380
She was the monster commissar.

1473
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,780
She's the screaming woman.

1474
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,780
I'm looking at a creature from...

1475
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:37,120
From the Black Lagoon silhouette attacking a buxom silhouetted woman,

1476
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,860
and that's actually Princess Wee.

1477
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,520
And you can tell by the giant hair.

1478
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,640
Her hair is bigger than the whole creature.

1479
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,340
Bigger than the buxom part?

1480
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,000
Oh, yeah, a lot bigger.

1481
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:53,080
Well, you know, she's got that special hippie girl hair.

1482
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,340
Anyway, it's...

1483
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:58,840
Dave, we have to go because I'm going to play a song at the end.

1484
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:59,980
In fact, I'm going to play...

1485
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,040
The Duke of Uke at X-Day doing Cult of Personality.

1486
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,420
I love that way he does that there.

1487
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,780
I was going to say, you know, it's all right,

1488
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,660
because I'm decomposing anyway right now.

1489
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:16,820
No, no, Dave, don't decompose.

1490
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,100
Please don't decompose.

1491
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,040
He does that every night.

1492
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:20,820
That's the word.

1493
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,780
Where do you think his compositions come from?

1494
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:23,300
I guess.

1495
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,360
I'm going to have to bring him a ball.

1496
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,000
I think it'll hardly work without me.

1497
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,600
Well, friends, this has been the hour of slack.

1498
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:34,260
But number 1,379, that's how many of these shows we've done,

1499
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:39,180
fewer reruns, from the Church of the Subgenius,

1500
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:42,000
and you can find all the information about that

1501
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,420
and all past shows back to about number 200.

1502
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,280
They're downloadable.

1503
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,720
And even some books that are out of print.

1504
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,780
They're on the web now.

1505
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,700
And all the pictures of X-Day that are not safe for work.

1506
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:59,080
And even worse things, it's subgenius.com.

1507
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,960
If you were interested.

1508
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,760
And meanwhile, now I'm going to go back to what?

1509
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,280
Oh, whoa, we've got to do the news and then cult of personality.

1510
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,840
Thank you, Dave, for calling in.

1511
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:14,060
Thank you for being so square and so restless.

1512
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,680
And thanks to the Flying Ryan Brothers for playing music in the background

1513
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,440
here in the studio with us.

1514
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,740
And thanks to Princess We for being Princess Lee

1515
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,140
and making everything else possible for me.

1516
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:29,260
So, okay.

1517
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,360
The type.

1518
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:31,720
Yeah.

1519
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:32,160
Sacrament.

1520
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:32,840
Sacrament.

1521
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,400
Sacrament.

1522
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:33,840
Okay.

1523
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,260
Sacrament.

1524
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,700
From PR News in Washington, I'm considered dangerous.

1525
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:43,340
American cycling star Lance Armstrong says he's going to prison,

1526
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,680
not a mental institution for his crimes.

1527
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:51,140
New York City officials say a gunman is outside the Empire State Building.

1528
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,360
And that's PR's Janine Herbst.

1529
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:58,420
Stock prices are down, down, down, down, down, 16 since November.

1530
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:03,020
As Tropical Storm Isaac bears down on the Dominican Republic in Haiti,

1531
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,500
one humanitarian organization says it has PR news.

1532
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,280
PR news is flawed.

1533
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:08,980
PR is bad.

1534
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:14,840
One witness tells Fox 5 News this is PR news from Washington.

1535
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,660
Thanks for having me.

1536
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,500
I'm the Duke of Uke.

1537
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,220
And thank you for choosing the Church of the Subgenius,

1538
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,420
the cult with personality.

1539
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,680
Look in my eyes, what do you see?

1540
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,260
The cult of personality.

1541
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:44,340
I know your anger, I know your dreams.

1542
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:48,660
I've been everything you want to be.

1543
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,400
I'm the cult of personality.

1544
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,980
Like Mussolini and Kennedy.

1545
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,700
I'm the cult of personality.

1546
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,080
The cult of personality.

1547
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,400
The cult of personality.

1548
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:13,160
Neon lights, Nobel Prize.

1549
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:18,000
When the mirror speaks, the reflection lies.

1550
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,580
You won't have to follow me.

1551
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,600
Only you can set me free.

1552
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:32,300
I sell the things you need to be.

1553
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:36,520
I'm the smiling face on your TV.

1554
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:41,500
I exploit you, steal you of me.

1555
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:45,840
I tell you one and one make three.

1556
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,860
I'm the cult of personality.

1557
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,220
Lake Jeroboam's like Connie.

1558
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,400
I'm the cult of personality.

1559
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,620
What was that in your childhood,

1560
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:10,920
talking about how I came back here,

1561
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,160
with J. Robin enticing me to

1562
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:19,800
serve the army and all the pinned워 MBs get oil.

1563
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,620
And the doubled, fitted off,

1564
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:22,800
uprooted adesso Don Quixote,

1565
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:22,800


1566
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:22,800


1567
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:22,800


1568
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:22,800


1569
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,420
the crown of power,

1570
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:35,440
I'm the cult of, I'm the cult of, I'm the cult of, I'm the cult of, I'm the cult of,

1571
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,840
I'm the cult of, I'm the cult of, I'm the cult of, I'm the cult of, I'm the cult of

1572
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,060
personality.

1573
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,740
Red Bob, my work here is done.

1574
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,480
Sire, there is no more money.

1575
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,920
We gotta get some money.

1576
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:53,480
That dirty, purgish, hark-a-back, flackin', whartin', filibunker, burton, purkaluma, burton,

1577
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,720
durton, bostonite, oh!

1578
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,240
B-O-B.

1579
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:02,080
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show, and we're even more glad that some listeners

1580
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:06,000
have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1581
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:11,020
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1582
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:19,000
But if you truly love Bob, and want some of that slack back to rebound to you, you should

1583
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,700
go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page, or the catalog page, and you

1584
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,940
can go to the store pages, and help out financially as best you can.

1585
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:34,720
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty, and we don't want any subgeniuses

1586
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,940
to make their own situations worse.

1587
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,920
But some of you still have jobs.

1588
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:46,540
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month, from enough of

1589
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:46,780
you.

1590
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,220
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1591
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,580
All we're saying is that...

1592
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:58,000
Blowjobs could go the way of Stevejobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1593
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:03,440
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1594
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:05,180
P.O.

1595
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:15,940
Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1596
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:21,160
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1597
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,440
Imam Shaikh Ali

1598
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,180
ruffia

1599
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:44,180
S freedoms

1600
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,760
Dubliminal tramplers

1601
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,640
Money Bob

1602
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,600
Free pills

1603
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:53,740
Stag money, Bob!

1604
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:54,660
Free pills!

1605
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,660
Stag money, Bob!

1606
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:57,560
Free pills!

1607
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,380
Stag money, Bob!

1608
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,040
Kill me!

1609
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,140
Stag money, Bob!
