1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Every student of human behavior knows that women like masculine things.

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,280
The rough caress of a tweed shoulder against a soft cheek,

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,520
the gleam of fine polished leather,

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,520
the look of a pipe in a man's mouth.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,740
However, if you delve a little deeper into feminine psychology,

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,560
you will find that the appeal of that pipe sometimes drops way down

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,060
when its smoke meets dainty feminine nostrils.

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,820
What can you do about it?

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,780
That's easy.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,200
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,220
Its fragrance, its grand aged in the wood aroma,

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,520
will complete your pipe appeal with the lady you wish to impress.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,580
And that wonderful flavor too.

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,020
Rich, full-bodied, yet mild.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,440
And what a bargain.

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,280
Bush is viral in nature.

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,980
This bush, viral in nature.

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,760
Another bush.

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,400
Getting sick, getting sick system.

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,920
The system is causing a stomach bar system.

21
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,240
The system is causing tension, tension, tension, tension, bush bar.

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,660
The disaster status quo.

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,000
We are, we want to, we are committed.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,720
We believe we have the ability.

25
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,560
We believe we're committed to work on it.

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,180
And we'll continue to do that.

27
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,560
That we can, and I say again, let's have President Bush.

28
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,600
Eating small children and harming small animals.

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,240
Oh, he's back from the dead.

30
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,300
That's right.

31
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,180
His grinning skull floats ever in front of your eyes.

32
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,700
And Jesus brought him back.

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,540
And he's lusting for the flesh of the living.

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,620
And these things are coming and coming.

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,940
They need to be replaced.

36
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,480
That is exactly what we must do.

37
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:44,880
I tried to explain, sir.

38
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,420
This is a true story, a true story.

39
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:48,720
And I'm sorry, that anything can be repaired.

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,400
But God forbid, you know what I mean?

41
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:50,460


42
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:50,600
That is not a best thing in life, do as he says.

43
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:50,980
Grass is not killed.

44
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:50,980


45
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,540
It was autes, me.

46
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:51,700
Not because I killed them.

47
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:51,700


48
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:51,960
Yeah, well.

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,240


50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,320
We're allados, there you go.

51
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,620
The way he did it, there you go, yes, there you go.

52
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:55,820
Again, it does happen.

53
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:55,820


54
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,260
Again, as you heard.

55
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,260


56
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,780
Did God tell us?

57
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,640
for that. That was San Andreas' fault.

58
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,520
That shows the endless connection, how one

59
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,700
crime succeeds another, for he says the land

60
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,500
is full of bloody

61
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,560
crimes and the city is full of

62
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,420
violence. Therefore, God

63
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,640
says, I will bring the basis,

64
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,740
the worst, of heathen

65
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,500
Gentile people, and

66
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,600
they are going to conquer you and

67
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,400
drive you out and move into your

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,620
houses and your holy places will be

69
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,620
defiled. Destruction comes, God

70
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:24,980
says.

71
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,280
Oh, good God, we're

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,220
doomed. No!

73
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,340
We're out of

74
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,320
Jonah! One could go on and on

75
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,340
with reports of this nature. Week after week

76
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,220
we get letters to our office and it'll

77
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,280
say, Brother Smith, it saved my

78
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
life. You don't realize where I was

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,340
headed. A farmer awakened one morning

80
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,940
and the clock struck one,

81
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,380
two, three, seven,

82
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,100
twelve, thirteen,

83
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,240
fourteen. His wife said, Honey, wake

84
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,360
up. He said, What time is it? She said, I don't know.

85
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,860
But it's later than it's

86
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,440
ever been before.

87
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,900
World leaders are indeed

88
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,600
pessimistic. They should be.

89
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,180
I guess you can pull the ballad of Bob

90
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,020
Dobbs' music down in the background. Everybody

91
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,120
here has seen that on

92
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
YouTube by now, I hope.

93
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,760
And you can creep the music back.

94
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,520
Back up when you need to because that

95
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,780
creeps everybody up or out

96
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,400
or something. Anyway, friends,

97
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,800
thanks. That was a wonderful moment of noise.

98
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,680
I want to do it again, friends. If we can

99
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,600
get in the mood for this

100
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,740
religious, finally

101
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,660
something, you know, religious and

102
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,700
superstitious out here at Starwood.

103
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,620
If you could open your heart,

104
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,700
close your mind, lock

105
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,800
it up, unzip your lips

106
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,860
and bend over and pull out your wallet

107
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,720
and let's have that moment of noise,

108
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,600
friends. Praise Bob! Praise

109
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,320
Bob! Praise God damn

110
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,720
Bob!

111
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,440
Don't hurt yourself.

112
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,820
That takes practice.

113
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,600
Oh, and to do things, this is

114
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,440
a real traditional

115
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,540
style one, friends. This is a U.S.

116
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,320
dollar bill, which I'm going to

117
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,240
illegally burn right now.

118
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,960
And it's not

119
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,640
because we don't love money.

120
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,600
It's to prove to the aliens that

121
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,660
they're still, when they smell the smoke

122
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,680
from this burning U.S. dollar,

123
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,440
they'll know that they're still

124
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,440
something down here on Earth worth saving.

125
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,620
Actually,

126
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,320
probably still spend that last

127
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,460
50 cents. You notice

128
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,980
I didn't use a 20. We're

129
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,020
religious, but we're not that

130
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,720
nutty.

131
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:39,820
And

132
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,380
for those of you who don't know a

133
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,500
damn thing about the church of the subgenius,

134
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,440
there's only three things you need to

135
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,220
understand about it. That's

136
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,540
Bob, the face that you will never

137
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,480
be able to etch out of your mind again.

138
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,480
Slack, which

139
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,160
is what you want and

140
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,000
probably already have,

141
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,740
but you may not know it yet.

142
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,380
And the conspiracy,

143
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,400
which is everything that takes away

144
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,080
your slack. And

145
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,380
I guess I can just shut up

146
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,460
there, because those who know don't say

147
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,820
and those who say don't know, and

148
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,140
here, bye.

149
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,540
That's really the way

150
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,540
we should do it. The subgenius thing

151
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,740
is best encountered

152
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,400
when you find one of those little muddy

153
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,220
pamphlets that we have over on the

154
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,580
sales table in a gutter.

155
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,720
When you're in the gutter,

156
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,500
and you're on your last

157
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,560
rope, you're like, you know,

158
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,520
and you find that little picture

159
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,520
of Bob, and you go,

160
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,640
here is an answer. Actually,

161
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,600
Bob is not the answer,

162
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,400
but neither is anything

163
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,520
else. And that is

164
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,660
the point of the church of the subgenius.

165
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,520
You have to, sure, you've got to dig

166
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,560
into your wallet to buy

167
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,540
the answers that Bob

168
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,980
provides, but we don't really,

169
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,920
expect them to last very long.

170
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
That's why Bob is what we call

171
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,180
a short-duration personal

172
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,520
savior, or in the Tibetan

173
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Shordirper Sav.

174
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,080
This is a

175
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,200
world of planned obsolescence,

176
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,400
and like, you know,

177
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,160
if you tell a joke too many times,

178
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,880
it loses its power.

179
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,540
So you may have to move on to, I don't

180
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,980
know, sure, the flying spaghetti

181
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,260
monster, or Scientology,

182
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,480
or Jesus, or whatnot.

183
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,740
We don't really care.

184
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,880
We don't care where you go after

185
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,560
you spend that 30 bucks.

186
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,600
But it's not like we're just

187
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,740
after your money.

188
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,980
We also want your belief.

189
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,560
And there's lots of belief

190
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,700
here at Starwood.

191
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,720
Although, as Bob said,

192
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,700
believe me out of it.

193
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,920
We don't want to get into arguments

194
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,720
with people about which is the one

195
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,740
true religion, because we already know.

196
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,620
Oh, and there's one rule,

197
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,700
for those who don't know anything

198
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:53,960
about religion, and that is,

199
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,060
we have a lot of laws about the church of the subgenius.

200
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,920
We have zillions of laws, and thou shalt's

201
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,260
and shalt not's, but those are just for fun.

202
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,300
There is one that is real,

203
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,880
and that you can really live your life by,

204
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,900
and I think some of my fellow subgeniuses

205
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,800
know what that rule is.

206
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,700
It is, friends, fuck them if they can't take a joke!

207
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,420
Fuck them if they can't take a joke!

208
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:15,420


209
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,640
Are there any children here?

210
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,160
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

211
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,100
The other way you can say it is,

212
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,960
if they can't not take a joke,

213
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,860
then let them mount up upon themselves.

214
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,180
That's the polite Irish Celtic way of saying it.

215
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,080
That's the polite Irish Celtic way of saying it.

216
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,080


217
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,800
Ladies and gentlemen,

218
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,200
we're about to begin the portion of the program

219
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,900
called the Ask Dr. Howell Show.

220
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,660
I,

221
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,640
Dr. Howell and Howell,

222
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,940
will now, during this next period,

223
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
answer any questions

224
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,840
which you, the audience,

225
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,740
have to pose.

226
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,280
These questions, and my answers,

227
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,580
will be made a part of

228
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,900
the recording and later podcast

229
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,440
of this broadcast.

230
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,960
And finally,

231
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,160
added to the ultimate

232
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,960
aditum of subgenius

233
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
storage

234
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,860
in the master computer

235
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,960
known as MWOM.

236
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,420
Ladies and gentlemen,

237
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,120
although I may

238
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,740
perform this

239
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,720
tawdry nightclub act

240
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,680
on a weekly basis in my

241
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,020
own home town,

242
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,020
what I do here

243
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,480
has a more

244
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,900
theologically defined purpose.

245
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,720
To come

246
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,000
closer and closer

247
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,540
to the true and perfect knowledge

248
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,220
of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

249
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,680
And of course,

250
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,700
Dobbsian

251
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,460
philosophy is not necessarily

252
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,900
something that one has to

253
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,740
learn like some college course.

254
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,080
One learns

255
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,820
from Dobbs in a visceral way.

256
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,360
Kind of like being

257
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,780
kicked in the stomach.

258
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,800
For all you

259
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,260
male subgenius fans.

260
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,900
So, while we're

261
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,580
getting ready, I'd like to

262
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,080
describe how this works.

263
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,760
You simply write down on the slips

264
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,360
that we've provided, whatever

265
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,900
question is unburdened

266
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,940
or needs to be

267
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,760
unburdened.

268
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,800
Something you might have

269
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,960
wondered about for a while.

270
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,480
Now, questions of

271
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,340
quantity and quiddity

272
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,900
have limited interpretations

273
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,580
and answers. Far

274
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,860
better to ask

275
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,860
something with a philosophical

276
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,720
dimension. Well, we

277
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,660
already have a question and so

278
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,720
I will answer this first

279
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,860
question while the rest of you are filling out your slips.

280
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,720
Are we ready, Reverend

281
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,700
Stang? Yes, yes.

282
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,740
Thank you for... Should I present

283
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,800
the question? Yes.

284
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,540
I'm ready. The first question.

285
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,540
Why didn't this goddamn

286
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,440
segment start at 1pm

287
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,660
as scheduled?

288
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,940
A most interesting and pertinent

289
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,660
question. Because it

290
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,640
implies that there's

291
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,920
something a little hinky in subgenius

292
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,780
land. A little wonky.

293
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,380
A little off about

294
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,440
our scheduling service

295
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,480
and systematics. Well,

296
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,740
if this were so,

297
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,840
let us indulge in

298
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,220
hypothetical speculation,

299
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,840
would it necessarily be a bad thing?

300
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,400
Are we out here

301
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,580
punching anyone's time

302
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,680
clock, even Bob's?

303
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,660
Or are we relaxing

304
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,680
in the balm

305
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,820
and benign benison of

306
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
slack? I think you know

307
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,460
the answer of those two choices.

308
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,840
But there is another answer to that question I could

309
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,880
give. And that is, we did

310
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,760
begin at 1. We were

311
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,880
right here. We started

312
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,720
but there was no one present.

313
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,420
Nonetheless, we

314
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,740
soldiered on. And

315
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,380
so, I must say

316
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,800
to the questioner, where were you?

317
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,500
Not where were we.

318
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,760
Actually, I might also add that if

319
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,700
you look at the schedule, it says hour

320
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,240
of slack started at 1,

321
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,760
and that Ask Dr. Howell starts at

322
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,260
3, which is in

323
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,700
two more minutes. Yes, we're actually

324
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,600
jumping the gun and providing

325
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,880
two extra minutes of Ask Dr. Howell

326
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,800
as a special subgenius

327
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,640
radio premium.

328
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,360
Ah,

329
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,740
yes, yes, yes. And so we have

330
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,180
new questions coming in.

331
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,240
This question from

332
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,920
the anonymous user.

333
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,440
So, how many

334
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,660
subgeniuses does it take

335
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,620
to change a mini

336
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,840
disc? You know,

337
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,800
let me preface this one

338
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,680
by saying, there's something

339
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,500
in my nature which

340
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,740
bristles and bridles at

341
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,620
any sentence which begins

342
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,920
with the word, so.

343
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,660
You know, it seems

344
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,820
that something is about to be presented to one

345
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,160
in less than a friendly conversational

346
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,700
fashion.

347
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,540
It is as if

348
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,940
one is accused,

349
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,640
without having said anything, of having

350
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,180
previously submitted

351
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,660
an untenable proposition which

352
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,020
needs to be rudely

353
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,540
challenged, without even

354
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,720
the slightest kindness of

355
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,560
polite discourse. However,

356
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,880
this is perhaps only one

357
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,520
of my own tropes.

358
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,640
Anyway, the question was,

359
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,500
so,

360
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,200
what?

361
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,720
So, how many subgeniuses does it take

362
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,860
to change a mini disc?

363
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,880
It takes, of course,

364
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,180
the master subgenius

365
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,500
to change the master

366
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,580
disc. We are dealing here

367
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,780
with the matrix upon which the

368
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,020
impressions are recorded.

369
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,660
Any subgenius may diddle around

370
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,660
with any little dubious diddly

371
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,820
squat disc, but the master disc

372
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,680
is, of course, the disc which records

373
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,660
these sacred

374
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,300
prononcementos,

375
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,980
and are stored in the master

376
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,660
computer, there to

377
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,240
abide until the end of time.

378
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,240
It also

379
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,620
helps for there to be at least one

380
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,520
subgenius who knows

381
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,560
where the other mini discs

382
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,580
are. And that requires

383
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,700
a level of interest that we have never

384
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,160
yet encountered in our

385
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,300
many years of history.

386
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,820
But, of course, we are hopeful.

387
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,600
That the sunrise will

388
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,660
someday illuminate

389
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,680
those dark and shadowy realms.

390
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,380
Oh, I might add that the

391
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,640
another thing that's almost as

392
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,800
annoying as starting a question with

393
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
so, is starting it with

394
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,340
um.

395
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,400
That is tentative. And um is in fact

396
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,800
much worse. So is impudent

397
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,540
and um, as you say, is

398
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,740
so tentative that it is far

399
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,700
worse, because it implies a

400
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,720
lack of spirit. And one knows

401
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,500
that what one will

402
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,600
probably be confronted with

403
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,780
that follows the um, is

404
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,020
a triacally

405
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,200
wandering, wistful,

406
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,760
warbling piece of

407
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,340
insupportable

408
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,780
trivia. But, perhaps not

409
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,940
in this case. Let's see. Well, let's move on

410
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,480
to a more elevated question.

411
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,540
What is

412
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,820
the nature of nature

413
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,700
itself?

414
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,800
Well, that's a fine

415
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
question. It's good that we

416
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,300
get them like that.

417
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,660
Yes, what is the nature of

418
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,640
nature? Nature might

419
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,100
be described as

420
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,500
physics or the state of

421
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,800
the universe. Most of us think of

422
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
nature as the subset of the universe

423
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,520
involving growing

424
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,260
things and life.

425
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,740
Life and life's effluents.

426
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,540
Cloud at once and shower.

427
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,680
Unfortunately, any

428
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,660
rational picture of the universe

429
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,040
shows a gigantic

430
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
canvas splashed

431
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,580
with nothing.

432
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,620
There's nothing there.

433
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,380
Nothing, nothing,

434
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,760
nothing, nothing at all.

435
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,820
Only a few

436
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,440
atoms here and there.

437
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,800
Or maybe a few galaxies.

438
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,780
However, actually

439
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,940
there are infinite number of galaxies

440
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,040
but still

441
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,820
mostly what

442
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,340
you have there is nothing.

443
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,640
And then what is happening

444
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,680
with this little bit of matter?

445
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,140
It is becoming

446
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,820
disordered. And yet,

447
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,760
how did it get there in the first place?

448
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,100
Within matter,

449
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,640
there is a tendency to organize.

450
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,880
And matter, especially

451
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,560
in our neck of the woods,

452
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,160
in our system, in the Sagittarian

453
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,240
arm of the Milky Way

454
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,000
galaxy, has that curious propensity.

455
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,800
Even non-living matter

456
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,120
has a principle of self-organization

457
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,700
within it. Thus we see

458
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,820
crystalline forms emerging.

459
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,320
Complex molecules

460
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,260
even in the mineral realm.

461
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,520
Many of you may have seen on the internet

462
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,120
the discovery of the vast

463
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,300
underground crystals in the Mexican

464
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,640
cavern going on and on

465
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,760
down through layer upon

466
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,920
sub-layer of a knighted abyss.

467
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,700
Huge pillars and

468
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,720
have you seen that staying?

469
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,820
No. I can send you some

470
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,600
what is it, JPEGs?

471
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,860
What do you call them? Anyway.

472
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,720
Pictures. The pictures are there.

473
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,820
So let us then answer

474
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,700
this in the stereotypical

475
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,860
form of nature as representing the lush

476
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,680
planet Earth with

477
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,380
its oceans and sighing

478
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,520
winds, its rich soils

479
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,760
and squirming microorganisms

480
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,920
and of course the inhabitants

481
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,100
of the sea, land and air.

482
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,520
What is the nature

483
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,660
of that nature? Well here

484
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,340
the organization of matter

485
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,300
takes place at an

486
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,700
incredibly furious pace.

487
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,600
Far faster than the

488
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,300
stately growth of crystals

489
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,020
or the accumulation and accretion

490
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,420
of geological columns,

491
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,840
nature is a flying

492
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,040
fly-by-night operation.

493
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,820
Here today, gone tomorrow

494
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,200
or perhaps even

495
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,500
within an hour.

496
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,620
Some things like the damsel fly

497
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,280
exist for the various

498
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,660
brevity of time, but even

499
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,740
shorter than that the microorganisms

500
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,700
sport in their fluid

501
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,860
medium forming and

502
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,520
reforming. But it might

503
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,200
be added that the microorganisms

504
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,820
themselves know not

505
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,780
death in the sense that the

506
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,280
more complicated things do.

507
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,800
And indeed in the beginning

508
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,420
they had to wait for death,

509
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,300
that useful invention, to be

510
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,600
invented. I don't have time to go into

511
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,780
that here. So nature itself

512
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,900
continually evolves

513
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,900
and organizes.

514
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,740
I think we all agree upon

515
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,900
that. Now when you ask what is the nature

516
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,200
are you asking about a purpose?

517
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,080
Because I will tell you that too.

518
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,680
And in nature's embodiment

519
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,500
as that section of the universe

520
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,400
we will speak of the ultimate purpose

521
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,440
of the universe. And that

522
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,760
is this. If the universe may be

523
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,600
considered as an oblong body

524
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,740
something more than an

525
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,060
oblate spheroid,

526
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,720
its ultimate purpose

527
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,640
nature and result

528
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,760
of all this organization is that it

529
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,420
may extend a pseudopod

530
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,960
with an eyeball in it at the end

531
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,500
which it can turn back

532
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,320
to view itself.

533
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,760
Good lord

534
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,700
man, so that is the ultimate

535
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,500
fight and destiny.

536
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,800
Well, some say one thing, some say another thing.

537
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,240
But thanks for your question.

538
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,780
I almost did decide to not even

539
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,640
set the pulpit up here because

540
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,080
normally I work from

541
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,620
complicated notes so I don't forget

542
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,700
anything important. But I've realized lately

543
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,980
I've been serving Bob so damn long

544
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,720
I can't forget even if I

545
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,420
wanted to.

546
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,300
But the pulpit looks nice.

547
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,720
And so we went ahead

548
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,860
and assembled it. Plus I have a few

549
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,580
things I wanted to show off.

550
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,720
Friends, not just the

551
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,440
subgeniuses but all of us

552
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,680
recently made the weekly

553
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,760
world news, the world's only reliable

554
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,640
newspaper, Freaks,

555
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,000
Geeks, and Weirdos.

556
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,500
That's

557
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,140
headlong.

558
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,520
And it shows several of our

559
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,460
number. Here's a four-legged babe

560
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,000
and some kids with tentacles for arms

561
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,760
and a woman who's had her

562
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,620
third nostril replaced with a third

563
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,560
eye and a flying

564
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,140
hamburger. Isn't that nice?

565
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,200
They even snuck in, I swear,

566
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,500
you know, they photoshopped some of these

567
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,660
pictures. I don't know if you knew that.

568
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,320
But one of them,

569
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,760
my wife says this is not me,

570
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,640
but I swear they stuck my face

571
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,660
on this old, this is a man

572
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,320
in Israel who sweats

573
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,120
when a ghost is around.

574
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,920
And they show this guy

575
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,200
with a very sweaty shirt

576
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,760
rolling some dough and he looks

577
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,440
just like yours truly, Reverend Stank.

578
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,660
I was really proud of,

579
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,440
that's the second time we've made

580
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,040
weekly world news that way.

581
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:51,880
And I'm so happy to be here.

582
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,940
I was going to let others come up

583
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,040
and use these limited microphones.

584
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,900
That's right. We're going to invite you

585
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,680
to come right up here and testify

586
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,440
for Bob.

587
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,980
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy

588
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,180
happens to be here.

589
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,700
This is his first X Day,

590
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,720
but it's sure not his first

591
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,220
subgenius campout,

592
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,480
you might say.

593
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,620
He's been announcing

594
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,420
the Hour of Slack since before

595
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,720
he does the voice.

596
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,380
There's a phrase at the beginning

597
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,280
that says, it's

598
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,980
the subgenius

599
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,840
hour of slack.

600
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,820
Remember that old timey

601
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,020
radio voice, friends?

602
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,440
Well, we peeled

603
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,400
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy

604
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,720
off of the wallpaper and brought him in

605
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,280
this time.

606
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,920
You know the most important thing, I think,

607
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,400
about everything subgenius,

608
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,520
Reverend Stank, if I can be so bold,

609
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,380
is that

610
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,980
it appears to be

611
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,560
always something

612
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,180
that knows what it's doing.

613
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,660
Even when it has no idea what it's doing.

614
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,760
The direction of

615
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,640
subgenius rhetoric is

616
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,940
always directed directly

617
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,780
at a thought or vision

618
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,680
that may or may not be occurring

619
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,740
at any given time and or

620
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,020
not time.

621
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,260
Well, we just follow where they

622
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,680
take us. The wind almost took

623
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,060
us in Fultimus'

624
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,140
go-rilla away.

625
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,880
Yes, in fact, Reverend Slough...

626
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,300
I'm insulting...

627
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,000
This go-rilla is saying,

628
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,680
Now that you finally brought your wife to

629
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,640
X-Day, you no longer need to

630
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:29,940
come.

631
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,460
Finally, my

632
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,460
Princess Wee's been at X-Day

633
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,240
since 1999.

634
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,040
I'll be right with you.

635
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,440
Go stick your head in the fence

636
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,040
over there.

637
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,100
That's what she said.

638
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,820
It's impossible to look

639
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,500
at those pictures and not think

640
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,940
of, you know...

641
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,720
The bullies that picked on me

642
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,640
in elementary school. Actually,

643
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
I wasn't the kind that got picked on. I was the kind

644
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,840
that was invisible. I hid

645
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,940
well. Or I would make them laugh.

646
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,680
That always would

647
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,520
work for me, if I possibly could.

648
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,900
I thought that only worked in the movies.

649
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,920
It did until I was 13.

650
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,820
And then, you know, when you had that weird

651
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,820
shift of hormones and stuff.

652
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,740
Then it stopped

653
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,680
working at school and only worked when I was with

654
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,600
my weird Unitarian summer camp friends.

655
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,520
But...

656
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,500
That's a true

657
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,400
revelation there.

658
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,260
We don't need to hear about all the

659
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,800
childhood traumas that turned you into

660
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,680
a subgenius. For some of us,

661
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,980
all it is is being nearsighted and having to get glasses.

662
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,840
Then for

663
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,740
others, it's the urge to kill

664
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,720
and kill and kill and

665
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,240
kill and kill

666
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,920
and kill and kill

667
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,440
and kill!

668
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,680
Well, I'm not...

669
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,800
I personally don't understand where those people

670
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,680
are coming from. I might...

671
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,860
What attracted me to the church was the

672
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,800
promise of infinite riches

673
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,580
and sex and slack

674
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,840
and so forth. I think that's what most

675
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,360
of us are... That and the

676
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,740
thought of everyone else burning in

677
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,860
hell. In that respect, we're like any

678
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,120
other religious...

679
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,300
Can I ask you something that I think I've never asked you?

680
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,720
That is...

681
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,740
Where's the derivation of your

682
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,200
name?

683
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,140
Of your subgenius name?

684
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,360
Well, obviously, Stang is an

685
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,800
anglicized version. The original name is

686
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,100
Stankovich, but that was...

687
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,240
That's really

688
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,660
a made-up name, too. I'm

689
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,920
a direct descendant

690
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,260
of the Tsarina

691
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:32,900
Alexandra

692
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,680
and her illicit affair with the

693
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,740
mad monk Rasputin, thus making

694
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,060
me the lone

695
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,740
sole heir to the jewels of

696
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,620
the Russian throne.

697
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,580
People laugh and mock, and

698
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,680
I don't expect anyone

699
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,780
to believe me. A lot of kooks and nuts

700
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,880
saying that they're heirs to the...

701
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,560
crown jewels of

702
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,720
all the Russias, but what

703
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,920
can I say? If you study

704
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,780
Rasputin's history and look at me

705
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,860
real close, you'll see... That wasn't a real laugh. That was just a sound

706
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,800
effects laugh. Yeah, it was a sound effects

707
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,680
laugh. I've heard that one in

708
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,400
cartoons. I just quote them.

709
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,980
Yeah. I never laugh

710
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,080
in real life.

711
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,800
Well, speaking of cartoons, you know,

712
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,040
I look out upon this

713
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,840
vast audience, and what I see

714
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,540
are human

715
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
cartoons. That's what

716
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,200
we find among... The subgeniuses

717
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,960
have very little in common with each other.

718
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,920
As we say, all we have in common

719
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,760
is that we have nothing in common with the conspiracy

720
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,140
of the normal people, but

721
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,800
everybody's got this completely

722
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,900
different exaggeration about

723
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,840
them. And sometimes

724
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,740
it's a feature that everyone regards

725
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,880
as good, and sometimes it's a feature that

726
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,300
everyone regards as bad.

727
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,660
Alex over here, for instance.

728
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,400
So, you know,

729
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,780
you get all kinds. We

730
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,840
have to live with each other and tolerate

731
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,720
each other, except that

732
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,760
there's always one other

733
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,520
subgenius who

734
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,760
appears to have been put on this earth for

735
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,500
no other reason than to piss

736
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,060
you off.

737
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,500
You're anti-subgenius.

738
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,720
Now, unfortunately, I feel like

739
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,160
I've got dozens of those.

740
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,640
But they feel the same way. It's a

741
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,280
mutual thing, usually.

742
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,540
I'd still rather have an anti-subgenius

743
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,560
bothering me than, like, an anti-

744
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,900
normal. Rather have the right people

745
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,480
laughing at you than the

746
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,840
wrong people laughing with you. And just

747
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,480
because you're anti-normal doesn't mean you're

748
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,480
subgenius, too. Oh, God.

749
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,680
God forbid, because there's so many,

750
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,080
we run into so many of these

751
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,320
gimme bobs that,

752
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,860
they're the first one to point the finger

753
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,540
and go, oh, that guy's pink.

754
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,740
I can't believe there's

755
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,480
these pinks here. And they're

756
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,720
jabbering in pink, bobby

757
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,680
jargon about who else is

758
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,560
some sort of cultish bobby

759
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:47,880
pink!

760
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,760
So, I wouldn't want to call those people

761
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,720
pinks, because then I'd sound just like

762
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,460
that. But I am, anyway.

763
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,840
They don't

764
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,560
know who they are.

765
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,820
I think of pinks as talking like

766
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,820
this. Pinks are

767
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,860
really cute and pudgy, and

768
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,800
you could squish their cheeks,

769
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,800
and they sort of just talk like this,

770
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,680
and they do what we say.

771
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,300
Those are happy pinks.

772
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,620
The kind of happy pinks, the happiest

773
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,900
kind of pink is the pink that will tell you

774
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,440
what you're gonna do and smile

775
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,640
while he's like, you know, telling you,

776
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,040
clean up that vomit.

777
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,660
Yeah! Because I'm pink.

778
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,720
And you want to be like

779
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,660
me, so if you want to succeed, just

780
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,760
clean up lots of vomit, because that's

781
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,780
how they talk, and they've got big pudgy

782
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,720
cheeks. That's what I think of when I hear pink.

783
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,800
I hear that voice. Well, it's funny. I had a

784
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,700
boss who was short and

785
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,540
pink and had pudgy cheeks

786
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,440
and told me to clean up

787
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,640
his vomit. Well, I, and

788
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,820
that was actually a vision that I had. But he kind of

789
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,760
talked like this. When I was back in the

790
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,640
80s, when I was living in Boston with all these

791
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,480
subgeniuses,

792
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,240
Dr.

793
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,280
Ahmed Fishmonger and

794
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,840
others, you know, I was like in

795
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,860
college at the time, and I was struggling to work

796
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,740
and stuff, and I had this long

797
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,120
conversation with my dad about

798
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,320
how I had to earn a living.

799
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
Well, you might as well, you know,

800
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,120
get a job at McDonald's,

801
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,780
is what he said.

802
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,580
You know, even just for a little while,

803
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,800
because you've got to make some money.

804
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,880
And I was like, job at McDonald's?

805
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,780
And that night,

806
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,620
I had a dream that

807
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,180
I went to,

808
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,620
that I was like, I'm driving on the highway,

809
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,820
and I had to go to a place called

810
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,040
Pwodzaburger to eat.

811
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,640
And Pwodzaburger was

812
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,820
basically run by a man who

813
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,800
looked like Shoney's Big Boy. And he talked

814
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,940
like this. He's like, come on in to Pwodzah's.

815
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,140
And, and,

816
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,880
and I was like, well, I'm not sure I

817
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,680
really want to. And he's like, well, come on in and,

818
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,840
you know, have a seat.

819
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,540
And if you, you know, if

820
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,820
you behave yourself, maybe you could get your

821
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,580
very own job here at Pwodzah's.

822
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,500
And I was like, well,

823
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,780
I don't really want a job at Pwodzah's.

824
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,980
And he started giving me the tour of the place.

825
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,480
This is a real dream I had.

826
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,440
Pwodzah's was spelled

827
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,400
P-W-D-G-A

828
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,680
apostrophe S.

829
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,280
And, um,

830
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,960
as I went through it, I started to realize

831
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,520
this was like a Soylent Green

832
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,840
operation. And that everybody wanted

833
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,420
to be happy and please Pwodzah.

834
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,580
Because they had a statue of Pwodzah. It was sort of like

835
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,760
between Buddha and a pig

836
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,480
and Shoni's big boy

837
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,700
was the statue. And I'll never

838
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,700
forget, I couldn't draw what it looks like. Maybe Dr.

839
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,900
Hal could draw it someday.

840
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,780
But if you took those three elements, that would be

841
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,800
Pwodzah. And everybody wanted

842
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,580
to please him and be happy so they could, you know,

843
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,740
rise up in management. And

844
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,860
then I started to realize

845
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,880
that the workers who weren't

846
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,860
doing well, as well as the other workers, were really

847
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,640
scared. And they had this extra

848
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,120
scared look on their face.

849
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,840
And then I realized why.

850
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,740
It was because the workers who

851
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,060
couldn't keep up the happy pace of Pwodzahs

852
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,020
would of course be sacrificed

853
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,540
and thrown into the grinder

854
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,840
and become Pwodzahburgers.

855
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,740
And that was how they maintained their

856
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,880
big profits. And everybody loves

857
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,840
Pwodzahburgers.

858
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,880
And yeah, so that was my real dream.

859
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,820
And that's what made, another

860
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,180
thing that cemented,

861
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,560
cemented my

862
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,840
wanting to be a subgenius and exploit

863
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,380
my abnormality to get

864
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,980
where I wanted to go. That just made

865
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,780
me say, no, you know, I understand

866
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,740
Dad's thinking he came from the depression, but

867
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,660
no, I've got to, if I

868
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,880
possibly can, I've got to exploit

869
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,800
my abnormality. Get this.

870
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,160
I worked there.

871
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,780
I had a job there for

872
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,140
two hours.

873
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,360
The guy said,

874
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,680
you're going to have to get a haircut to work here,

875
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,820
so come back tomorrow.

876
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,620
Well, he said it in that way, I can't imitate him.

877
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,560
Oh, you have to come back tomorrow. Come back tomorrow

878
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,200
after you get a haircut. And

879
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,720
I didn't get a haircut.

880
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,440
My hair was about as long as yours.

881
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,460
But that was long then.

882
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,900
And then I came back

883
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,420
without the haircut and got to work

884
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,660
swabbing the toilets.

885
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,520
And just when the little

886
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,440
squeaky man showed up, so did the

887
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,600
corporate inspector.

888
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,780
And got the creepy,

889
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,160
got him in trouble

890
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,740
because he had hired a long hair.

891
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,800
And then I got fired.

892
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,700
And boy was I happy.

893
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,540
No, and the other,

894
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,380
just the other part of the dream was,

895
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,560
I'll never forget what he said, because I

896
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,060
made it into a radio skit later.

897
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,020
He said,

898
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,980
just maintain group growth status production quotient

899
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,600
on a viable categorical basis within your

900
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,260
substrata, and you can have all the

901
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,900
podger burgers and real taste pies

902
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,580
that you can muster.

903
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,380
That's what he said.

904
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,900
And that's when I woke up, I think.

905
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,660
It's when I hear about things like that

906
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,540
that I'm glad that I'm a slave for

907
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,660
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

908
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,260
So am I. Listen. Because he's never around.

909
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,680
That's the nice thing about having

910
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,040
him for a boss.

911
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,460
Yep, yep. I mean, let's face it,

912
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,440
I do work for the conspiracy.

913
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,100
And yet, you know, for a conspiracy job,

914
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,680
it's the greatest conspiracy job I could possibly ask for.

915
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,660
And it sucks, right?

916
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,460
No, it doesn't suck. No, no, no.

917
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,400
Luckily for me, you know, I mean, sure,

918
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,480
you know, podger's always on the horizon

919
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,400
at any corporation, they always are.

920
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,300
But, you know, what's good for me is that,

921
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,820
you know, they let me do what I like.

922
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,960
And I can still

923
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,320
explore Bob, I think.

924
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,900
I think I'm safe to do that.

925
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,280
And the other thing is,

926
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,720
that, uh, we've

927
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,460
tried to get the word across,

928
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,780
but it's hard to do. It's just, it can

929
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,340
be hard to directly inject

930
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,400
Bob's word into the conspiracy.

931
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,800
But I still do it. You're not hammering hard enough,

932
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,880
boy. You sharper nails in

933
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,480
their heads.

934
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
That's what you gotta do.

935
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,080
You know, I just thank Bob for,

936
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,740
you know, giving me the microphone, basically.

937
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,780
If it wasn't for Bob, I wouldn't have the microphone.

938
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,640
Well, Bob is my gorilla.

939
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,440
Yeah.

940
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,360
This is Just John with a message for whoever

941
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,360
wants to eat the ham out of my hellburger.

942
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,720
Whoever you are, I have to think you got the

943
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,040
concept exactly wrong.

944
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,960
Or maybe you're operating under a different concept entirely,

945
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,060
one I haven't heard of.

946
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,700
Or maybe you're just a jerk.

947
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,800
Are you a member of one of those religions that banned the eating

948
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,980
of pork products and you felt like breaking a commandment

949
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,900
and a dietary law at the same time?

950
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,000
Regardless,

951
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,860
you can eat the rest of the hellburger for all I care.

952
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,700
I have obtained a

953
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,660
new hellburger, and I will not be

954
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,240
leaving this one unattended.

955
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,780
We're in a deep, deep

956
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,320
deep deep deep....

957
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,680
deep, deep deep deep deep

958
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,180
deep deep deep deep deep ....

959
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,120
...

960
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:28,120


961
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,660
into the Jimmy Jones cult!

962
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,940
Jimmy Jones logical

963
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,420
section!

964
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,180
Yeah!

965
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,360
He had a very large,

966
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,440
and what happened?

967
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,240
Now, Jimmy Jones, he was absolutely no stranger.

968
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,720
Could we follow Jimmy Jones?

969
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,240
Become a part

970
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,840
of the cult!

971
00:32:51,900 --> 00:33:01,340
Jimmy Jones. Well, how do we keep false teaching? How did you receive, Jimmy Jones, so something

972
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:06,100
else? A cult? Something else. You need to do this and that and the other thing. A cult

973
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:12,040
is important. Go downward. Go downward. Blowing down for nourishment. Now we're building,

974
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:20,800
okay? We're building a cult. I have bad, empty philosophy. Ignorant? Ignorant. You really

975
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:26,920
can't know anything for sure. You're ignorant. Of course, think about that. You can't know

976
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:32,340
anything for sure. Can't know anything for sure. Twist that around. Okay. I have more

977
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:39,700
bad. It's about that thick. Now, you're coming and there's a building. You're coming on your

978
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:50,160
left. And the shadow of someone coming. There's a person coming. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And so

979
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,540
the person coming.

980
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:50,780
The person coming. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And so the person coming. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And so

981
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:59,020
the person comes for a moment. Donuts, thank you. Okay, good. Oh, the fullness. Marshall

983
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,940
come. And this happened at the very moment. Getting sucked. Getting sucked. Getting sucked.

984
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,340
Cult. Cult. Sucked. Into the Jimmy Jones cult.

985
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,820
Oh boy. Sucked into a cult. That would be terrible, wouldn't it?

986
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:28,140
That, as well as the viral Bush piece at the beginning, was by Reverend Norell Preff of

And almost always are. And the nice big end of the world collage at the beginning and

991
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:04,900

992

And now the news.

1012
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,600
To maintain a healthy discussion, we suggest a steady diet of PR news.

1013
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,360
PR news.

1014
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,820
Broad from the BBC.

1015
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,280
From PR news in Washington, I'm battling a blaze between January and March.

1016
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:18,420
The man who touched Pope Benedict's Peter spoke at a ceremony in Normandy, France today.

1017
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,200
It's a lie.

1018
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,600
The Vatican says a German man turned up dead on Wall Street 14455.

1019
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,000
A police spokesman says this is PR news in Washington.

1020
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,400
Hey, there's a lot we all agree on here.

1021
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:38,320
The government says the Labor Department says productivity measures how much one worker can kidnap and beat two young men in one hour of PR.

1022
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,540
PR comes from com.com.

1023
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,060
Trailer for sale or rent.

1024
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,660
Rooms to let 50 cents.

1025
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,340
Here comes Peter.

1026
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,820
Peter Cottontail.

1027
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,380
No phone, no pool, no pets.

1028
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,320
Hopping down the bunny trail.

1029
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,040
I ain't got no cigarettes.

1030
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,080
About two hours of push and broom.

1031
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,060
Buys a 8x12 4-bit room.

1032

Hippity-hoppity, Easter's on its way.

1033
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,280
I'm a man of means by no means.

1034
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:16,300
Bringing every girl and boy a basket full of Easter joy.

1035
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,000
King of the road.

1036
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,660
Here's the next question, Dr. Howell.

1037
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,440
I'm ready.

1038
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,580
And it's a rough one.

1039
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,280
Has Bob forsaken us?

1040
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,660
How do we know?

1041
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,700
Did you ride a bike when you were a kid, Ivan Stan?

1042
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,960
Why, yeah, sure, Dr. Howell.

1043
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:42,040
I think we all have that memory of riding a bicycle through sunlit streets of summer.

1044
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,320
Maybe carrying something in our bicycle basket.

1045
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,520
But there was a time when we had, uh,

1046
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,840
training wheels and it, we might have feared falling over and getting a skinning.

1047
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,940
Because, uh, the bike takes a little bit of mastery to learn.

1048
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,380
And who often helps you learn?

1049
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:05,500
Sometimes you do it yourself, but sometimes your dad helps, doesn't he?

1050
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,260
Sometimes Wilford Bramley has to help.

1051
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,740
Yes, that old, uh, pensioner has to come stumping down and take a few palsied feeble steps,

1052
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,500
holding your handlebar and supporting your body vertically up.

1053
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,860
And he's got a little bit of a

1054
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,100
But then he lets go.

1055
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:32,560
And either you land in a humiliating heap or you scud down the street, enormously aware of infinitely unfolding possibilities.

1056
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,860
Would you say that Wilford has left you?

1057
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,080
Well, you might if you were incredibly insecure.

1058
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,520
But the fact is, Bob has not forsaken us.

1059
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,480
We have forsaken all of you.

1060
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:48,480


1061
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:48,480


1062
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:48,480


1063
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:48,480


1064
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:48,480


1065
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:48,480


1066
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:48,840
Bob.

1067
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,980
But don't worry.

1068
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,280
Bob is bringing up the rear.

1069
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,840
Bob is going to be along.

1070
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,340
Any day now.

1071
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,440
Dr. Howell, that makes, that's so reassuring to me.

1072
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,760
Well, it shouldn't be.

1073
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,480
I'd rather have Bob in front of me myself.

1074
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,720
Anyway, uh, let's go on.

1075
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,500
We still have a few more of these to answer.

1076
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,100
This is one I know that you've gotten before.

1077
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,700
Because it's the same kind that, that, that,

1078
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,840
Blame me. I've seen them all.

1079
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,460
There's always the smart aleck in the, uh, corner.

1080
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,680
That comparative religion class.

1081
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,280
Thank God for that smart aleck.

1082
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,060
That asks the priest this question.

1083
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,540
Yep.

1084
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:32,380
Father, could Bob give it, could God give himself a dick so big even he couldn't suck it?

1085
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,460
That's the classic atheist's question.

1086
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,360
Uh, and we get it.

1087
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Uh, we certainly do.

1088
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,400
Over and over again.

1089
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,200
And in another sense, we also get it.

1090
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,760
The question really boils down to, parsed another way,

1091
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,980
would God make rules and then disobey them?

1092
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:59,540
And, uh, since God is infinitely plastic and can stretch into all dimensions and places,

1093
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:06,340
no twisting or torsion of the continuum is beyond his malignant efforts.

1094
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,760
But would God do that?

1095
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,580
It might be said that the almighty spirit is in some senses lazy.

1096
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,740
And only does the easy things.

1097
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,020
Follows the straightest of lines.

1098
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:28,380
No, for that sinuous, uh, sinusoidal sinuosity, we need Satan and his barbed tail.

1099
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,780
Then we get the interesting curved path.

1100
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,240
The, uh, spirals.

1101
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:40,420
The strange configurations which are the essence of kicking against the traces.

1102
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,640
That's positively satanic, Doctor.

1103
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,640
Dr. Howell, thank you.

1104
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,360
The sum of Satan percolates and drips into the church of the subgenius, but only the good part.

1105
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,440
Good in a utilitarian sense.

1106
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,080
Well, this is a related question.

1107
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:02,360
Is it possible to get sick of Bob?

1108
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,640
And if so, what should be done about it?

1109
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:10,080
That recalls to me that, uh, that old subgenius hymn, Sick of Bob.

1110
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,160
Well, and that is the, uh, genesis and seedbed of the answer.

1111
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,620
Because what one does when one is sick of Bob,

1112
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:23,420
is create a song or a statue or a poem or a pile of stinky laundry

1113
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,680
to commemorate that self-same sickness.

1114
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,060
The nausea of existential understanding.

1115
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,720
This is a positive development.

1116
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,900
You should be sick of Bob.

1117
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,420
If you eat, sleep, live, and breathe Bob all the time,

1118
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,520
then how can you appreciate Bob

1119
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,160
when he comes upon you like a thief in the night?

1120
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,680
Uh, here's one, uh, Dr. Howell, that I think you'll enjoy

1121
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,940
because it's a, sort of a scientific related question.

1122
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:58,980
Well, let's have it.

1123
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,080
If one were to travel very near the speed of light and survive,

1124
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,500
what would it smell like?

1125
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,720
Well, um, you can travel near the speed of light

1126
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,500
as long as you control your exhalation.

1127
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,840
And, uh, your deceleration particularly.

1128
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:24,300
Um, and, uh, all you need to do is approach within, uh,

1129
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,760
the smallest fraction of that speed.

1130
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,680
Like Achilles' tortoise.

1131
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:33,700
Ever severing the distance but, uh, coming a microscopic

1132
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,900
and yet diminishing distance closer.

1133
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,980
But what would it smell like?

1134
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:42,320
It would smell like your own stressed out blood, sweat,

1135
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,260
lymph, entrails, and slime.

1136
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:51,060
Little human, you were not meant to travel very near the speed of light.

1137
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,520
Or anything like that speed.

1138
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,580
You already travel at thousands and thousands of unseemly miles per hour

1139
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:03,580
through the universe's enfolding cloak of mystery.

1140
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,240
Be well satisfied with that.

1141
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,900
And seek not to dispute your place at hyper-relativistic velocities.

1142
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,560
The angels were created to do that,

1143
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,220
and even they got sick of it.

1144
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,480
Praise Bob.

1145
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,960
Perfect time to switch me.

1146
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,940
Ah, time to flip the old tape.

1147
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,340
Yep. We're still flipping.

1148
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,140
Well, uh, while we're doing that...

1149
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,360
We're still flipping. No, we're done.

1150
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,500
Let's announce that...oh.

1151
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,660
We're all done. Go ahead and announce stuff.

1152
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,340
Well, I was going to announce that we were doing the Ask Dr. Hal show,

1153
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,740
uh, for the broadcast tape, but if we're done,

1154
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,160
I should announce that we're done.

1155
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,400
No, no. We're not...we're not nowhere near done yet.

1156
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,880
Oh, you're done flipping the tape.

1157
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:41,840
Yes, I'm done flipping the tape.

1158
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,540
We've just flipped the tape in the middle of the Ask Dr. Hal show.

1159
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,000
Flipping the tape, uh, of course, is a metaphor

1160
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,940
from a quainter, earlier technological age.

1161
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,400
Um, do we want to, uh, interrupt the proceedings

1162
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,160
to read, um, gorilla and demon statements?

1163
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:58,640
Certainly.

1164
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,240
Before we come back?

1165
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,740
Well, here's another one.

1166
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,900
Oh, okay. This, uh, the gorilla in this person's...

1167
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,060
Oh, we've already done this one.

1168
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,600
This is for use when the show gets slow or retarded.

1169
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,240
All right. Well, do this one, then.

1170
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:12,620
I...

1171
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,520
Because I trust we haven't been slow at all.

1172
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:14,700
Oh, okay.

1173
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,540
And retarded so far.

1174
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,260
I...I...wow, what amazing handwriting.

1175
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,920
It looks like a professional cartoonist or...or calligrapher did this.

1176
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,420
The gorilla says,

1177
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:30,700
I gets all confused and anxious about the protocol among the humans.

1178
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:37,860
I just want slack, but no want you be uncomfort...

1179
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,820
want...no want to be uncomfortable.

1180
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,300
Want...I just want slack, but no want to be uncomfortable.

1181
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,880
They no care about gorilly gorilly.

1182
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,620
No care about gorilly gorilly.

1183
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,720
Gorilly no mean make bad smell.

1184
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,300
Scrum all.

1185
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,900
That last probably is pronounced screw em all.

1186
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,600
Screw em all.

1187
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,620
Okay, I'm sorry.

1188
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,920
Well, what about the demon, Reverend Stane?

1189
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:10,540
The demon, uh, says, why don't every one of you self-satisfied little pose your twerps?

1190
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:14,520
Admit your inadequacy as representatives of your feeble mind.

1191
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,540
And kill yourselves now, squirming bags of unfulfilled appetites.

1192
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,840
I disdain your foul tasting blood.

1193
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,800
That's a S. Clay Wilson demon, isn't it?

1194
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,580
If only we had Mavridis here to fill that out.

1195
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,020
We should save one of those for him.

1196
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:35,760
Well, let's get back to the Ask Dr. Hal show because we still have a few questions to answer.

1197
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,600
The...the gorilla in this one is clutching a...a distressed naked blonde woman.

1198
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,820
Very well rendered.

1199
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:47,060
And yet he expresses unsatisfaction.

1200
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,200
Not good.

1201
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:48,660
Not an ape.

1202
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,800
All right.

1203
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,780
Is New Orleans safe from future flooding?

1204
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,300
Will the levees be adequate?

1205
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,400
Is New Orleans the future Atlantis?

1206
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,220
Let it go.

1207
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,520
New Orleans is simply the future.

1208
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,920
The inundation will eventually roll over most of the cities.

1209
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:19,020
Because most cities are built at the mouths of rivers and watercourses.

1210
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,840
Or on oceans themselves.

1211
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:29,000
If the water level rises sufficiently in the oceans, the rivers will not flow into them.

1212
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,340
And they too shall rise and back up.

1213
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,320
And the great flood shall roll over the land.

1214
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:40,500
The quaking cities of man shall be smote down.

1215
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,220
By the waves of doom, justice and vengeance.

1216
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:48,660
But on the other hand, all the earth will not be covered.

1217
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,000
And this is what God promised.

1218
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,060
He said, don't worry.

1219
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,340
There's never going to be a flood as there was in Noah's day.

1220
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,760
This is in the Bible.

1221
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,320
Unfortunately, then he said, no, there won't be a flood.

1222
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,800
Instead, there will be a fire age coming.

1223
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,660
And that too will come to pass.

1224
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,360
Too quickly to avoid.

1225
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,060
Avoid regret.

1226
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,840
When that flood comes, I'm going to join the smokers and find dry land.

1227
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,820
You can find dry land.

1228
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,120
That's the thing about this flood.

1229
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,140
You can find dry land.

1230
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,680
But then the heat will come.

1231
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,160
And will Kevin Costner be there?

1232
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,840
That great Costner to himself.

1233
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,000
So we're living in a real crazy world, my friend.

1234
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:38,340
We're living in a world where everyone is crying out for deliverance.

1235
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:46,640
Now, many times you will see the president standing there in the Rose Garden with two of these smiling men from the east on each side.

1236
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,520
One has got a tablecloth on his head.

1237
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:53,940
And he told them they smile and then they put there in the newspaper, uh, peace.

1238
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,480
I've got no problem with the peace treaties that they sign.

1239
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,080
I have a problem with the people who sign the peace treaties.

1240
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,620
Uh, that's, that's reality.

1241
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,500
George, you should be ashamed of yourself.

1242
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,060
And how.

1243
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:08,320
Recently, another 400 scientists, scholars, businessmen, and political leaders have been

1244
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:08,320


1245
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,400
met in Texas to ponder the problems facing mankind.

1246
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,340
They said it is a gloomy world indeed.

1247
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:23,100
The energy crisis, famine, the financial problems of New York City, drug abuse, and other unrelated problems are all portents of the present darkness.

1248
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,380
And the Bible says,

1249
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,860
I am the God of hell fire, and I bring you fire.

1250
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,120
Sudden destruction comes upon them, and they shall not escape.

1251
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,480
That's what the Bible says here.

1252
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,300
There shall be famine, pestilences, and different things.

1253
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,320
And I don't have to tell you these things.

1254
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,720
You know, if there ever is a time that Bible prophecy is confirmed right before our eyes

1255
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,020
of mouth.

1256
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,840
Plagues, pestilences, and things like that.

1257
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:50,720
Yeah, right.

1258
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,180
Yeah.

1259
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,520
Now, the boss says this is a very bad thing for the country.

1260
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,880
See, because this contract starts after the war.

1261
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:05,200
Now, the boss has got an idea with all this Nazi and Jap money that, uh, well, I haven't

1262
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,280
got it quite straight, but anyway, the boss says it's a bad thing for the country.

1263
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:08,280


1264
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,320
So far, you've told me what the boss has found out.

1265
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,400
What did you find out?

1266
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,680
I don't need the terrorists.

1267
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,740
Boy, you're hotter than a firecracker on the 5th of July.

1268
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,880
Who is it?

1269
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,020
All right.

1270
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,120
Listen up, everyone.

1271
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,420
I want you to calmly file towards the exit.

1272
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,440
That's it.

1273
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,240
That's it.

1274
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,440
Nobody runs.

1275
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:28,180
Just walk.

1276
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,400
Single file.

1277
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:30,720
That's it.

1278
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,680
Now, if we just stay calm, no one's going to be harmed by the huge bomb that's going

1279
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,740
to explode any minute.

1280
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,360
I'm sorry.

1281
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,100
I'm sorry.

1282
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:45,840
It's a cookbook!

1283
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,520
It's a cookbook!

1284
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:52,760
It's a cookbook!

1285
00:49:52,760 --> 00:50:06,360
A world is getting out of hand, all what's removed from me, so what else, some nameless

1286
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:07,340
face.

1287
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,340
controls my destiny

1288
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,760
Is it the man who's doing research

1289
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,000
or the man who's out in space

1290
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,880
There's something that's controlling me

1291
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,780
Some silent, nameless space

1292
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:26,400
Is he an IBM computer

1293
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,940
or an electronic brain

1294
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,640
And if I cannot find him

1295
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,720
Where do I come from

1296
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,400
Where

1297
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,360
Yes?

1298
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,000
Excuse me, I believe I left a pipe and some books

1299
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,180
Oh, they're right here

1300
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,880
This is my lucky pipe

1301
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,180
and I didn't want to leave it behind

1302
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,000
I understand you're going away

1303
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,040
That's right, I've got to start packing right now

1304
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,540
You're a blithering coward

1305
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,600
Bitch, I'll f*** your ass up

1306
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,700
Is all that?

1307
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,980
Are you sure you're discussing my departure?

1308
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,800
Oh no, no, no, don't worry about that

1309
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,940
You are miserable because you don't know how to say goodbye

1310
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,220
But danger has come sooner than you expected

1311
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,220
and now you are making up your mind to go at once

1312
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:18,120
The secret won't keep for long, of course

1313
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,280
but at present it is, I think

1314
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,220
known only to us, conspirators

1315
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,300
and we're not going to let you escape so easily

1316
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,220
But I must go

1317
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,480
It cannot be helped

1318
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,260
It is wretched for us all

1319
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,520
but please help me and don't hinder me

1320
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,280
You don't understand

1321
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,480
You're lying

1322
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,760
Maybe he's not

1323
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,020
I know him

1324
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,640
Look at his face

1325
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:34,700
Look at his face

1326
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,280
He's lying

1327
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,220
Hey, Bob is my only hope

1328
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,980
Back off and give him some room to think

1329
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,000
All right

1330
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,720
This place is going up

1331
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,200
Well, if I'm going out, I'm going out happy

1332
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,060
Before we're all blown to bits

1333
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,600
Mind if I pull the underwear out of my crack?

1334
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,300
Man's got to go comfortable

1335
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,440
All right, but that's it

1336
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,420
God, I hate that guy

1337
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,980
I don't believe it

1338
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:57,780
Tell him the truth or not

1339
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,820
Didn't the police mention it?

1340
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:00,780
Say anything about it?

1341
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,140
Bob, no

1342
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:03,880
No

1343
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,060
What did he look like?

1344
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:07,740
Looked like what?

1345
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,640
He looked like a man, of course

1346
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,300
What do you suppose?

1347
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:10,960
Uh-huh

1348
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,260
Oh, yes, yes

1349
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:15,060
He looked like a man

1350
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,260
Yeah, yes, I know

1351
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,680
He looked like a man

1352
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,800
He's a queer bunny

1353
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,200
Nobody believed me

1354
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,320
Even my colleagues wouldn't believe me

1355
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,280
Poor man

1356
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,540
Poor man

1357
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,100
He's insane, that's what he is

1358
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:33,860
He believed me

1359
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,080
He believes it

1360
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,180
He must be insane

1361
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,060
For fools

1362
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,660
Can't they understand me?

1363
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:43,540
Tell me something

1364
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,060
Am I mad?

1365
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:45,800
Tell me

1366
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,680
Here's somebody's gorilla

1367
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,980
Oh, can I read it?

1368
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:51,300
Yeah

1369
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,960
The gorilla is one

1370
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,940
And the demon is the other

1371
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:56,660
Okay, yeah

1372
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,720
These are again anonymous

1373
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,220
But

1374
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,360
I just want to eat Froot Loops

1375
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,960
I don't want to do housework

1376
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:03,840
Housework?

1377
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,280
That's the inner gorilla

1378
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,720
He's got the same problem as all of you slackers

1379
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,080
Oh, shut it, gorilla

1380
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,280
You damned dirty ape

1381
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,900
Says the demon

1382
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,960
It's a pretty simple one

1383
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,700
But, you know, they're elemental

1384
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,840
This is all very elemental

1385
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,620
And very therapeutic

1386
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,980
I think already five people now

1387
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,080
Have been helped

1388
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,040
Third box star, midnight train

1389
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,700
Destination Bangor, Maine

1390
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:31,580
Things to make your Easter bright and gay

1391
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,840
Old worn-out suitors

1392
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:34,400
And shoes

1393
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,260
I don't pay no union dues

1394
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,620
He's got jelly beans for Tommy

1395
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,180
Colored eggs for Sister Sue

1396
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,740
I smoke old stogies I have found

1397
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,140
Short but not too big a round

1398
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,540
Here's an orchid for your mommy

1399
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,760
And an Easter bonnet too

1400
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,280
Oh

1401
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,100
Bob has a secret number

1402
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,020
You know, just like the Antichrist

1403
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,660
Bob's number is 999

1404
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:00,600
Ha ha

1405
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,380
Figures

1406
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,540
The anti-Bob's number is 333

1407
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,080
Bob is not the Antichrist

1408
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,340
But he's sort of like the anti-Antichrist

1409
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,580
He's buddies with Jesus

1410
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,680
There's always just been their fan club

1411
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,900
That bothers us

1412
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,260
I don't know where I was going with that one, actually

1413
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,060
What was that?

1414
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:21,080
Oh, well

1415
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,980
It's in there somewhere

1416
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,180
Friend, are you sick of flibberty gibbish

1417
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,620
News-groping yobers

1418
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,600
Yoked to insaneness?

1419
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,160
Hate to have to work

1420
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,640
In a herd of turds

1421
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,300
And tards

1422
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,420
And not a fleet of eagles?

1423
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,240
Are your cow orkers

1424
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,940
A bunch of shit-offs

1425
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:43,300
With the hundredth lemming syndrome?

1426
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,560
Low Mudville joy quotient

1427
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,860
And a thousand idiot synchronicities

1428
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,260
Rendering you a mongoose of panic?

1429
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:58,260
Are you a crazed diuretic constipationist

1430
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,880
Faced with overwhelm-tion

1431
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,620
Who can't get your favorite nose reticence

1432
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,520
In her quickly enough?

1433
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,680
Well, bum and bummest

1434
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,600
That's a bunch of jabbermacky and cockabucky

1435
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,440
Fuck it or fuck with it

1436
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,240
Be spurky, not chumpy

1437
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,060
Neither hard-faced nor ab-mul

1438
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,560
Nor all flibby and jibby

1439
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,540
Don't worry one wheat nor twittle

1440
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,420
About every little ninny-picking

1441
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,500
Hood and winker

1442
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,400
Every whim and quigger

1443
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,840
We are on it 23-7

1444
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,880
I am, we are

1445
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,620
We're the 12th

1446
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,860
We're the 1200th monkey

1447
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,680
So get off your bohunkus on us

1448
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,140
And start flinging the gungawackum back at em

1449
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,680
Get back your funanity

1450
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,700
Learn to laugh at yourself

1451
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,320
And you'll always be amused

1452
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,860
Actually, I think her grandpa said that

1453
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,660
Or as Pogo said

1454
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,220
Don't take life so serious

1455
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,400
It ain't no way permanent

1456
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,540
Friends, you could be getting slack

1457
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,020
So good-looking it'll get you leaking

1458
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,340
Cause it's un-really good

1459
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,360
It's god-shittingly good

1460
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,400
So put your frock where your mouth is

1461
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,560
Repent, quit your job

1462
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,440
Slack off while you still know how

1463
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,840
Question authority

1464
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,980
Why?

1465
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,160
Bob is not the answer

1466
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,340
And neither is anything else

1467
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,040
Fuck them if they can't take a joke

1468
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,520
And praise Bob

1469
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,860

Praise Bob

1476
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:33,620


1477
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:33,620


1478
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:33,620


1479
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:33,620


1480
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:33,620


1481
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:33,620


1482
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:33,620


1483
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:33,620


1484
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:33,620


1485
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:36,460
Praise Bob

1486
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:36,500

1487
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,400

Praise Bob

1491
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:38,160


1492
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:38,160


1493
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:38,160


1494
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:38,160


1495
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:38,160


1496
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:38,160


1497
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:38,160


1498
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:38,160


1499
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,340
Don't try that at home

1500
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,020
And you need an Adam's apple

1501
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:47,780
Okay, I think I can go to the Q&A

1502
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,060
Oh, we did have one new

1503
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,220
We have a new church

1504
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,100
We just invented

1505
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,680
You know, we don't actually make giant bucks doing this

1506
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,180
Bob started this

1507
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,600
It's like an art project that's

1508
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,600
It's anti-art

1509
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,620
And it's a new piece of art

1510
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:09,980
anti-business business and it's an anti-science scientific project and most

1511
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:17,020
of all it was a club for non-joiners and it has not made us rich so we were

1512
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:22,660
thinking about starting a new one for normal people called Bob's Club for

1513
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:28,600
Joiners. What do y'all think of that? I mean probably you may not be up your alley but

1514
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:32,980
don't you think that would work better at the point of purchase at the stop and

1515
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:45,440
go you know Bob's Club for Joiners people go whoa yeah I'm a joiner. Let me have one of those and one of those energy pills and a lottery ticket. That would be so cute.

1516
00:57:46,440 --> 00:58:02,580
I know every engineer on every train maybe if you're extra good he'll roll lots of Easter eggs your way all the children and all of their names look at him hop and listen to him say and

1517
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:02,960
every train will say Bob's Club for Joiners.

1518
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:20,940
hand out in every town and every life that ain't like when no one's around when you find those chocolate bunnies that he's hiding everywhere I'm a man of means by no means you wake up in Easter morning and you'll know that he was that king of the road.

1519
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:31,060
King Peter by Reverend Just John of just-john.com

1520
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,940
and this is the end of the show.

1521
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,380
This is the 1111th hour of slack.

1522
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:42,820
Before Just John we heard subgenius preaching from the Starwood Festival.

1523
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:46,800

1541

Just maintain group growth status production quotient on a viable categorical basis within your substrata,

1542
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,880
and you can have all the Pudger burgers and real taste pies that you can muster.
