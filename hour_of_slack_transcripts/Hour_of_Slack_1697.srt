1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,160
Hey everybody!

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:01,800
Huh?

3
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,980
Moment of truth is here.

4
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:04,340
Really?

5
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:04,920
Yes.

6
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:05,680
No.

7
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,140
The Self Genius Power of Swag.

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,500
I'm gonna be sick.

9
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,680
Well how about that?

10
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,320
Oh god.

11
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,580
I've let us all down.

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,120
Wow.

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,860
My lighter went out and I thought I could frantically find one.

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,840
Your lighter?

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,660
My lighter.

16
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,440
Your lighter went out.

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,740
My soul mind, it's the Ikram Atman lighter.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,780
How can you possibly combust the frop if you have no lighter?

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,120
I'd have to use my hoary breath, spelled H-O-A-R-A-E-Y, and then pronounce it slightly

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,900
sparingly.

21
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,480
I mean.

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,100
Well it's not a lisp but it's kind of close enough to pass mustard.

23
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,660
You can light that little pipe with your breath?

24
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,100
Yes.

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,440
And I can do all kinds of tricks.

26
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,900
I was thinking of joining the circus.

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,960
You know?

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,220
Why hide all this?

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,060
What would your act be?

30
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
Well that would be it.

31
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,740
It would be like a kind of surrealist thing where people would be compelled to wonder

32
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,760
what the hell is he doing?

33
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,540
It doesn't make any sense at all, you know?

34
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,680
And then I come out at the very end of it and I just ignite a bunch of extreme inflation

35
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,720
and leave the stage for permanently.

36
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:47,040
Dave, a lot of our friends and us have been doing that for years and we never managed

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,420
to make a living at it.

38
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,140
Sod Show marvels.

39
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,780
It just.

40
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,060
It used to pay back before they outlawed it.

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,740
But it's kind of hard to pay.

42
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:57,740


43
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,500
It's hard to get by on a Sideshow Marvels salary now.

44
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,580
I remember the days.

45
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:03,960
Last I heard.

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,060
I remember those not too distant days when you would like chew up a light bulb and a

47
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,460
banana and expect everything to come out correctly without singeing your posterior parts and

48
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,840
look where we've gone today.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,760
Just like when Hitler was born.

50
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,040
I think you've got me confused with Andrew.

51
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,860
Well, my mentor, Andrew the Impaled.

52
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,720
Well, tell me.

53
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,400
See, mentor to me is a place near Cleveland.

54
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,860
It's kind of a high buck neighborhood, isn't it?

55
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,980
They wouldn't let us live there.

56
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,040
No, probably not.

57
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,000
But you're paying Cleveland High property.

58
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,580
No, I was talking about my mentor in light bulb eating, Andrew the Impaled.

59
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:50,840
Oh, he's from Pittsburgh.

60
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,660
Yeah, right.

61
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,820
And it's true.

62
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,780
If you eat a banana.

63
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,780
Before and after you eat the light bulb glass.

64
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,920
You might not die.

65
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,340
Yeah, you probably won't die.

66
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,340
It'll all just smoothly banana out.

67
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,940
Kind of a glassy little banana shaped thing will emerge.

68
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,020
Your son or daughter, as it were.

69
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,800
Whichever.

70
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,360
Oh, you're calling the the the flotation device that emerges after the massacre.

71
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,680
After the meal.

72
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,280
Yeah.

73
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,780
After the meal is either your mommy or your daddy.

74
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,200
My son.

75
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,140
My son hated when I would.

76
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,960
I'd come out of the bathroom and go, I just passed another one of your little brown brothers.

77
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,740
My kid hated that too.

78
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,200
He did not like that.

79
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,760
He didn't think it was funny.

80
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,180
When my old man said it to me, I didn't think it was funny either.

81
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,200
I hated him for it.

82
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,800
Just think, Stang.

83
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,120
You're calling your.

84
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,640
I have a phone line.

85
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,520
You're saying your brother to a manure wagon.

86
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,260
It's a German word.

87
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,900
No.

88
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,220
Misquoting.

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,800
Now what?

90
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,400
Schopenhauer.

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,960
Oh, Schopenhauer.

92
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,900
I've been trying to study Schopenhauer.

93
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,060
You know, the German philosopher was real difficult.

94
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:12,980
Schopenhauer.

95
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,960
Well, actually, I'm kind of confused.

96
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,360
Now, who's the 12 tone German composer who does anti music?

97
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,520
Well.

98
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,660
I thought that was Stoppenhouser or Schopenhouser or Wolfenstein.

99
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,200
Schopenhauer.

100
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,080
Yeah.

101
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,020
One of those.

102
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,600
Was there two of them?

103
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,260
Was one of them a philosopher and the other one Schopenhauer?

104
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,560
For all I know, they're both the same.

105
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,820
I don't know.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,880
I don't know anything.

107
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm all mixed up.

108
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,840
Dave, I think I'm losing it, man.

109
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,020
Honestly.

110
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,140
You've already lost it.

111
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,720
I've been cooped up.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm not.

113
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:52,700
I'm not.

114
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,200
I'm just so long and so dark here.

115
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,380
Everything's so old.

116
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,120
You're in the closet with the light turned off and that's why it's so dark where you

117
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,320
are.

118
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,480
It has nothing to do with the exterior shape of the universe at large.

119
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,540
I'm penned in.

120
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,500
I'm trapped, man.

121
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,440
I can't get out into the universe.

122
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,340
I'm stuck.

123
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,920
Being a penned in has no excuse for any other kind of articulation if you ask me.

124
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,420
I want to live, man.

125
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,160
I want to get loose.

126
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,160
I want to move.

127
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,440
I want to fly.

128
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,480


129
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,480


130
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,480


131
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,480


132
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,480


133
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,480


134
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,480


135
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,480


136
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,280
I want to fly away.

137
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,860
I'm very—

138
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,260
Bad chance of that, Stangy.

139
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,760
Well, because I have to just—

140
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,460
All moan on all you must and all you may.

141
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,820
Nothing's going to change me in any way.

142
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,200
Everything's just going to grind us into the dirt like a lowly sack of smoke.

143
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,760
My guru—

144
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,960
It's going to pound us and pound us and pound us until we no longer exist.

145
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:46,780
Really?

146
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,560
Really.

147
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,460
I hope not, but that's what I've been doing all this time.

148
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:52,460


149
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:52,460


150
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:52,460


151
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:52,460


152
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:52,460


153
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:59,440
been warned of the last 25 years i think we we've been warned of and we've both been warning of for

154
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:09,620
the last i'm afraid it's more like 40 years dave maybe 50 oh god man i keep reading these magazine

155
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:20,800
articles in the uh uh retired person's journal about great rock stars and movie stars and they

156
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:29,980
their career has spanned 50 years and i think to myself wait a minute that they didn't even come

157
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:38,960
out with their first album till i was 30 what are they telling me they're trying to tell you things

158
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,380
that are not good for your health that's the first thing you have to remember is

159
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:48,660
all these messages from other people because it's not going to be good because people complain all

160
00:06:50,800 --> 00:07:07,360
the time i don't give a shit anymore yeah yeah yeah so i think there's that that's true

161
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,380
um i think i have no idea what i'm watching bruce look it's awesome usually you get 17

162
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:15,700
films a year that uh co-writer kim scott amazing and you see how busy he is

163
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,600
at videotape last year yeah

164
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,780
if i was editing a horror movie eh

165
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,240
it was good

166
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,240


167
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,340
i'm kind of carefully

168
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:19,760
he had the

169
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,320
time

170
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,780
and

171
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,520
from the Crimea.

172
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,260
So she's hot to detect her surface valve.

173
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,940
Right.

174
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,780
Probably not my type.

175
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,880
The Playboy type, not my type.

176
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,000
No, not my type.

177
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,440
The dumpy, bespectacled, middle-aged ones, my type.

178
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,640
My type too.

179
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,140
Well, I mean, let's be realistic.

180
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,100
We're in our 60s or something like that.

181
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,840
Let's just be realistic.

182
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,320
Anyway, I don't want to be accused of some kind of Me Too thing.

183
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
I didn't do it.

184
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,960
I didn't do any of it.

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,740
I never even thought about it.

186
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,700
Well, I thought about it.

187
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,320
Yeah.

188
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,440
But I didn't do any of it.

189
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,120
I was always too polite.

190
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,760
And my friends kept telling my male friends, said,

191
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,440
Stang, don't you get it?

192
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,900
No doesn't mean no.

193
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,760
No means keep going.

194
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,980
Until I say, well, just keep going.

195
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,080
And I thought, well, you know what?

196
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,660
That just doesn't seem right.

197
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,020
Yeah.

198
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:33,300
I sort of halfway tried it once.

199
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,580
I said, okay, I'll give you a ride if you give me a kiss.

200
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,700
And the girl looked at me like I was the most disgusting pervert she'd ever seen.

201
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,360
And I don't blame her a bit.

202
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,860
But honest to God, I was just, I was doing what?

203
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,040
What my male peer group was telling me was okay.

204
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,860
And I went to the same kind of school as Brett Kavanaugh.

205
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,020
So I really, I didn't go to the same kind of school as Brett Kavanaugh.

206
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,060
But I had an interesting thing happen to me in the liquor store.

207
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,120
There's a, there's a liquor store lady there.

208
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,520
And she's rather attractive, but I'm not, you know, trying to get into her

209
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,780
gumshoes or her Bollywink or any of those other private parts.

210
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,760
But anyway, I'd noticed I'd seen her in my neighborhood.

211
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,120
I said, oh, do you live near me?

212
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,080
And I went on about paranoid look on her face.

213
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,600
Like, why do you want to know where I live?

214
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,560
And I got the baddest vibe from that.

215
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,020
I've had, you were just being friendly, but she got the wrong idea.

216
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,900
I was like drooling around the corner, you know, where you go, which

217
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,340
house is yours and made me cry.

218
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,200
Well, it's a tender.

219
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,580
Young.

220
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:46,860
Babe.

221
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,560
It's a tricky, tricky situation.

222
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,180
I remember one time my, my good buddy and over man, Dr.

223
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,540
Philo Drummond.

224
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,560
Uh, he w he came to an X day drill one time and just like a werewolf.

225
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:08,520
Uh, well, he went driving around with his video camera poking out the window

226
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,260
because this was fun.

227
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,520
It was being, well, it still is being held at this hippie campgrounds and

228
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,340
there's.

229
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,600
Colorful tents and colorful artwork and stuff.

230
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:27,100
And he was just driving randomly drunk with a, did you hear my dog?

231
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,000
Bart just in or shake his collar.

232
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:35,500
Anyway, Philo Philo, uh, was just randomly videotaping the scenery.

233
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,960
Well, suddenly the campground gets called from a hideous old woman who

234
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,060
says this man been videotaped me because I was walking around with topless with my.

235
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,660
Things.

236
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,560
My, my, uh, pendulous is out.

237
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:50,960
Right.

238
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,500
Her pendulum.

239
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:51,980
Yeah.

240
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,960
And, and this man, I saw a car just drive by with video cameras.

241
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,300
You need to sue him and arrest him and kick him out.

242
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,220
She was so vain that she thought he even saw her.

243
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,520
And, you know, I swear, I think that same person complained later on at a

244
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,000
starwood or something, because I was walking around with the camera.

245
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,720
Uh,

246
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,820
at one of Chaz's crazy sex orgy parties.

247
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,420
And she was thinking, oh, the only reason that man's got cameras

248
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,180
to film me with my pendulous.

249
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,960
My 59 year old giant pendulous.

250
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,980
We just, well, in the south of Spain and other places where we come from,

251
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,160
we just call them gigantic basoons.

252
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,200
And everybody seems to know.

253
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,060
The zoom.

254
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,380
Yeah.

255
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,260
And there are Broncos also because they are related to an

256
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:45,580
exterior.

257
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,260
Form of lung, like a block, like broccoli is.

258
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,300
So this is, they can get your vegetables 10 times a day, each and every way.

259
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,360
If you just suckle like a young babe to a mother's breast.

260
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,580
See today, I met two women who were both breastfeeding, like it was very

261
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,180
important and they got, they have things now like, well, the one lady who quit

262
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,720
to get a cheaper job, but she was still more friendlier than the other people

263
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,420
and stuff like that every day at 10 o'clock and at two o'clock, she would go

264
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,280
to a special room.

265
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,220
And collect her milk from her bosom.

266
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,260
And that's what they fulfill her child's Bubba with was mother's milk.

267
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,860
And it's been two years now.

268
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,640
And she's still doing the mother's milk routine.

269
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,060
I'm wondering if it's all right.

270
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,160
Don't interfere with parenting.

271
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,140
That's something I learned that the don't, even if I know people, I knew a lady who

272
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,520
was breastfeeding her six year old.

273
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,120
Okay.

274
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,180
She happened to be a, yes I did.

275
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,420
She happened to be a very traditional Lakota native woman.

276
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,280
I hope I'm using the correct terminology.

277
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,340
Very sweet.

278
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,200
Gave my wife and I a star blanket that she made.

279
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,820
And a wonderful milk cake.

280
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,200
I guess she thought we were nice, but she, no, she didn't give us any of her milk, but

281
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:23,000
she, yeah, her kid was upright and running around and shooting play guns and he was

282
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,260
still getting, you know, breastfed.

283
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:33,460
Now I thought that was a little weird, but as a parent, I've learned that you don't

284
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,460
tell parents how to parent.

285
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,620
You just don't, they're going to do it their way, no matter what.

286
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,180
And no one knows what goes on behind her.

287
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


288
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


289
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


290
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


291
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


292
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


293
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


294
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


295
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


296
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


297
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


298
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


299
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


300
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


301
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


302
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


303
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


304
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


305
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


306
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


307
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,020
They're going to close doors.

308
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,720
They could anger and obsequiously come and anger on you and enjoy the rump diminish slash

309
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,600
you like a dog.

310
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,980
Oh, people, people, people that have never been parents blame parents for their kids.

311
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,140
They're the most opinionated.

312
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,260
The ones who haven't had kids.

313
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:02,520
No kidding.

314
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:02,900
Yeah.

315
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,300
The ones who never had kids.

316
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,100
They know exactly how to.

317
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,460
They know everything about it and why there should be or should not be abortion.

318
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,460
You noticed that.

319
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,920
They probably never even had sex to begin with and wonder what to do afterwards.

320
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,920
You noticed that, did you?

321
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,680
As a father.

322
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,580
I noticed that guy I was telling you about earlier today who was in a diner usually calling

323
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,560
people bad names and stuff like that.

324
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:26,960
Yeah.

325
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,540
Yeah.

326
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,160
You told me that.

327
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,580
Well, I just forgot the rest of the story, which was even funnier.

328
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:42,540
Well, it was a fellow customer of a diner that you frequent and he was loudly and belligerently,

329
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,900
uh, yeah.

330
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:52,560
He was, uh, proclaiming the N word about black people and he was loudly and belligerently

331
00:14:52,560 --> 00:15:01,540
even insulting your ethnicity, the Italians talking about dagos and wops and, uh, so forth.

332
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,700
Pardon my language.

333
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

334
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,300
You got that right.

335
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,740
Where I come from, we didn't have Italians, so we didn't have any slur names for them.

336
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,440
So you made soup instead.

337
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,320
Yeah.

338
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,120
Well, we picked on everybody that we had around here.

339
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:23,860
Germans, Mexicans, of course, uh, and needless to say, black people.

340
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,920
When I was growing up.

341
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:33,520
Oh, I know what the fifties were like and I know what the early sixties were like and

342
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:39,340
I'm very, very sorry that our present government is trying to return us to that time.

343
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,040
It does seem like it.

344
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,940
It does indeed.

345
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:48,500
It seems like they're trying to return us to around 1939 and not this country.

346
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,280
But another highly technically advanced country in Europe.

347
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,540
That's why he's been lately, he's been forced to calling himself hair chancellor.

348
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,460
Now what the hell does that mean?

349
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,540
I mean, is that an American word or is that too feisty for a hair chancellor?

350
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,400
Does it have something to do with his haircut or?

351
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,840
It doesn't matter.

352
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,900
It doesn't matter.

353
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,320
That's the horrible nightmarish thing.

354
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,420
It doesn't matter what he does, whatever he does.

355
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,200
They love it.

356
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,440
They eat it up.

357
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:30,180
They bend over, unzip their pants, pull them down and say, come on and give me more.

358
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,420
I'm sorry, but that's, that's the way I see it.

359
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,520
That's the story today.

360
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,840
I just heard something.

361
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:46,020
Somebody say, well, if he lies every day, what, what lie did he say today?

362
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,180
And I couldn't remember.

363
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,720
He had me on his stump.

364
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,920
You know what I mean?

365
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,980
There was surrounded by searchlights and Nazi soldiers, everything.

366
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,060
There's too many.

367
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,280
Even it was like, well, which one do I land on?

368
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,320
I'm a self made millionaire.

369
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,800
I made my own.

370
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,820
I'm I'm not, I wasn't just some, some, uh, fund kid.

371
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,300
I, I, I made my way on my own.

372
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,200
Well, do you hear he's, he's, he's friends with Prince, Prince Zalman.

373
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,960
Is that the one who has a real bad dementia?

374
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,520
Somebody in the, Prince Valiant with the bad haircut.

375
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,860
That's what they used to call him Prince Valium sometimes.

376
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,400
Cause he was scared.

377
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,460
Now who, what?

378
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,820
Prince Valium.

379
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,800
He was a, he was a sore begotten son who never learned to trot and so on and so forth.

380
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,800


381
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,800


382
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,280
Forever.

383
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,740
He was just no good.

384
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,280
That's the only way around it.

385
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,700
But I was talking about something else.

386
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:49,840
Yeah.

387
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,520
So was I.

388
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,160
How do we even, how do we even know what the show is about, Dave?

389
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,120
How do we.

390
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,060
How do we focus.

391
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,200
Focus.

392
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,600
If we can't take a joke.

393
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,280
Oh my God.

394
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,260
I heard the most horrible, horrible subgenius joke today.

395
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,260
Let's hear it or see it.

396
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:09,780
See what's coming next.

397
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:09,780


398
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:09,780


399
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:09,780


400
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:09,780


401
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:09,780


402
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:09,780


403
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:09,780


404
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:09,780


405
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:24,760
I can't say it at all on the broadcast radio because it's a variation of our church's, the church of the subgeniuses, most sacred motto.

406
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,640
The one that has the F word in it.

407
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,740
Yes, blank them if they can't.

408
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,160
Right, blank them if they can't take a joke.

409
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,260
It's a variation on that.

410
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,820
And of course, I'm really polite.

411
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,220
So it's hard for me.

412
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:52,440
And the minute I heard it, I said, don't ever say that on your radio show because it was the younger subgeniuses with their younger podcast radio shows.

413
00:18:52,660 --> 00:19:05,420
It was Reverend Fid Chooley and Reverend Fox and Reverend Cat Feather with the Time for the Show show.

414
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:18,180
And he, Fid, I think, uttered the phrase, F word them if they can't escape.

415
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:26,660
We were thinking about the Kavanaugh hearings and so forth.

416
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,040
But it was one that, and see, Daryl went and did it.

417
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,900
I just went and uttered that phrase.

418
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,220
And.

419
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,040
But that's not where we're coming from.

420
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,760
That's not what we mean, friends.

421
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,340
Really?

422
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,580
We want freedom and peace for everyone.

423
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,780
For every living being.

424
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,280
Not necessarily beings like pork and beans.

425
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,360
Human beings.

426
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,900
Yeah, human beings.

427
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,440
Like French style.

428
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,820
French style beans.

429
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,360
Or Szechuan style.

430
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,240
That's another flavor we could have too.

431
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,220
We could have five different flavors.

432
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,120
Think of it, Stang.

433
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,700
And of course, we'll have natural chocolate.

434
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,380
Every day of the week, it'll be available.

435
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:15,760
And any other times during the lunar holidays, we'll come down and have our own festival.

436
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,580
You know?

437
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,540
I dream of those days to come.

438
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,120
You mean you're dreaming of the future?

439
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,880
Halcyon, Halleycon days to come.

440
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,180
However you say that.

441
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,560
Why is this fast forward button?

442
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,000
How do you say that?

443
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,620
Say Halcyon or Halcyon or Halcyon.

444
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,280
I guess.

445
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,300
I don't listen to the radio or watch TV, so I don't know how things are pronounced.

446
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,480
I just read stuff.

447
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:51,380
For five years when I was a kid, I thought the word examine was examine.

448
00:20:52,660 --> 00:21:02,760
I read flighty, highbrow books by H.G. Wells and Jules Verne when I was 10 years old.

449
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,680
And they were always examining.

450
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,620
I think I was probably 13 before I realized what they meant was examine.

451
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,140
Yeah, I had similar things.

452
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,120
I read the classics at an early age and all that stuff, too.

453
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,760
And I always had one particular pet word.

454
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,340
I don't know.

455
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:28,300
Somebody might have even told you I get obsessive compulsive thing when I'm typing or writing or something like that.

456
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,420
I'll misspell something.

457
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,800
I know I misspelled it.

458
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,460
No way.

459
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,380
And tell myself that the next time around, I won't misspell it.

460
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,580
And I keep misspelling it over and over again the same way.

461
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,200
Now, that's a sure sign that somebody's not minding the store.

462
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,380
Your mind is not minding the story.

463
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,920
My mind is not my mind.

464
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,360
Not if mine.

465
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,880
Those were the days, my friend.

466
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,020
I thought you'd stop saying that once in a while, but instead you have to keep on reminding us.

467
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,720
My mind is not my mind.

468
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,100
It's not my own.

469
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,780
It's a really old subgenius saying.

470
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,140
I have no mind.

471
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,540
I have no mind.

472
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,660
My mind is not my mind.

473
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:26,640
Cast off the imperial brains of normalcy.

474
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,860
What?

475
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,260
My mind is not my own?

476
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,160
My mind is not my mind.

477
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,280
My mind is not my mind.

478
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,480
Ha ha.

479
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,440
See, now that has a little bit more kind of like a silly twist to it.

480
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,660
I don't know if you'd call it a post-nuptial entrail device.

481
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,060
It has to be said in a high voice.

482
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,480
My mind is not my mind.

483
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,820
My mind is not my mind.

484
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,480
And then there would be an answer like a choral, like apostrophe or whatever his name was, or antipasto.

485
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,600
Like in those Greek plays about the frogs and stuff like that.

486
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,760
That would be the chorus.

487
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,980
It would answer back, my mind is not my mind.

488
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,080
Like that.

489
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,600
And everybody.

490
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,400
We'd get real goosebumps and quivers running up and down their spines.

491
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,780
My mind is not my mind.

492
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,100
See, now you sound like Dostoevsky or Schoenberg.

493
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,580
Schoenberg.

494
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,680
That's the poet of magnificence of the 12-tone music.

495
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,540
Schoenberg.

496
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:35,020
Yeah, not Stockhausen or Schoenberg or Schopenhauer.

497
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,300
Schopenhauer.

498
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:36,940
Schopenhauer.

499
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:37,680
Schopenhauer.

500
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:37,780
Schopenhauer.

501
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:37,780


502
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,140
Philosopher.

503
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,500
You're a nine-to-five man.

504
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,120
He was my favorite fly character back in the days

505
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,920
when I used to dress up like a pimp and soul.

506
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,220
Man, the girls would see me coming.

507
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,680
They'd just rush to my arms and say stuff to me and everything.

508
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,820
I couldn't often understand what the hell they were talking about.

509
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,340
But boy, I made quite an impression.

510
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,080
And just think of today's modern days.

511
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,920
I'm taking all kinds of selfies of myself,

512
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,740
and I'm JPG-ing them right back home.

513
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,540
Immediately.

514
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,980
Oh, I can hear that little froggy right now.

515
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,740
Yeah, I hear it too.

516
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,820
Now, what's that?

517
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,160
Is that a Buddhist gong bell?

518
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,020
It's very faint.

519
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,680
I think it's a frog.

520
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,520
Well, I hope it's like a Rastafari set or one of them guys.

521
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,140
I'm trying to get my...

522
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,000
That's quite a melodic.

523
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,400
That's quite a melodic frog.

524
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,400
There we go.

525
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,220
Oh, my God.

526
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,660
There's the frog.

527
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,620
For the last five minutes, I have to admit to you, Dave,

528
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,860
I've been half listening, half participating in the show,

529
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:57,840
and half trying to operate this DVD player to run my background CDs.

530
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,360
And it's not cooperating with me.

531
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,720
It just keeps sticking on this...

532
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,300
I don't know what this background...

533
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,340
You can't hear it.

534
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,900
But it was Captain Beefheart Instrumentals.

535
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:16,340
I had 20 minutes of Captain Beefheart Instrumentals

536
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:23,900
followed by a five-minute recording of my little new pit bull dog, Claudia,

537
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,720
licking her fundament.

538
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,440
It was just a really unique sound,

539
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,840
and I wanted to share that with the audience.

540
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:34,960
Okay.

541
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,160
I can always do that in editing, I suppose.

542
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:45,040
But it's distressing to me that I've lost control of my faculties here

543
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,260
at Tarzan's radio station,

544
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,700
my home studio,

545
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,220
where I can only take one caller,

546
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,540
and it's you.

547
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,160
I've been thinking...

548
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,780
Why do you call it Tarzan, anyway?

549
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,100
I'm trying to figure that out.

550
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,460
That doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

551
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,300
Well, Dave,

552
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,140
you've seen it.

553
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,280
It's like this 20-year-old radio shack mixer

554
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,320
and microphones that have windscreens

555
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,900
that are eaten away by disease.

556
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,640
The foam rubber is just, you know...

557
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,180
It's coming out.

558
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,540
It's putting pox in them.

559
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,080
And, yeah, it's all analog.

560
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,300
It's not digital.

561
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,760
And it's old.

562
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,800
And we're...

563
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,300
Even older.

564
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,880
Much, much older than any of this equipment.

565
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,640
Which just is so sad.

566
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,840
But, hey, most people don't live as long as we have.

567
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,780
It seems like.

568
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
Oh, my God.

569
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,940
Dave, I've got yet more of my old friends

570
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,440
who are coming down with the horrible cancers

571
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,580
and the diseases and all the crap

572
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,500
that...

573
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:03,620
That...

574
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,280
That...

575
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,260
That afflicts large mammals.

576
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,340
Not just people.

577
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,700
I've never licked a large mammal in my whole life.

578
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,980
It's a miracle that we're still alive.

579
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,140
It is a damn miracle.

580
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,740
Yeah, but I don't understand why you said

581
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,600
I had to lick an animal and I never did.

582
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,820
You know I never did.

583
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,720
No, you misunderstood.

584
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,280
I'm saying I wish...

585
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,480
I wish you'd had the opportunity

586
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,960
to lick an animal like I have.

587
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,460
And the audacity to think of it beforehand.

588
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,940
Oh, my God.

589
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:40,400
You know, when a dog licks your neck, you just want to lick her back.

590
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,440
Well, if it's a girl dog, you wouldn't want to do that with a boy dog.

591
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:51,240
If you're a boy, unless you're gay, then you're probably having more fun than anybody.

592
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,980
I wish I knew, but it's too late for me.

593
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,240
I wish you did, too.

594
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:10,180
Maybe in subgenius heaven, we'll find out how fun it is to be bisexual, for instance.

595
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:16,720
Because I don't really have any way of knowing that in this life.

596
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,740
I'm just old. I'm just old. I'm stuck in my ways. I'm stuck.

597
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,580
Then there was quadrosexuals. I can't remember.

598
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,220
I can't either.

599
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,800
I can't even begin. How do you even approach that?

600
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,860
You didn't dally around. You were like me.

601
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:40,180
You believed in medium relationships, much like a steak.

602
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,240
I was so square. Oh, my God.

603
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,980
I was this long-haired hippie, and I was so much more square and reserved

604
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:56,180
than any of my employers who were burr-cut Texans

605
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,140
that were...

606
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,180
Cheating on their wives and bragging about it and showing us Polaroids of it.

607
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,900
And I just...

608
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,960
Everything is upside down.

609
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,560
I don't think the Baptists are always that honest.

610
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,240
I just don't know how to put it.

611
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,620
That could be what they say in the Me Too movement.

612
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,800
They used to say, you know, take a man and hang him upside down.

613
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,260
It all looks like the same thing.

614
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,600
No, wait a minute.

615
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,700
Did I say that right?

616
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,280
No. I'm not sure. I don't know.

617
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,300
But...

618
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:26,920
It was hashtag...

619
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,460
Once dot, dot, dot, enough.

620
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,140
That's kind of like our guiding light.

621
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:38,840
We didn't want to procreate and flat slate with every other abnormal person there is that walks the earth.

622
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:39,700
Oh, I did.

623
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,540
When I was younger. Oh, my God.

624
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,180
Oh, when I was younger, yeah.

625
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:52,020
I feel like now that I'm so old that I've lost most of my chemicals,

626
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,460
it's like I've surfaced from a swamp.

627
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,160
I've been...

628
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,800
I've been living in a dim, dark swamp underwater my whole life.

629
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,280
And I...

630
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,300
You know, all I could think about was, you know.

631
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:14,460
And then I guess my testosterone levels dropped a lot.

632
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,280
And it's as if I'm a brilliant mathematician by comparison now, you know.

633
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,380
But have no numbers to deal with, right?

634
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,540
Well, sure, I can deal with anything.

635
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,520
I don't have the poison of the doonads anymore.

636
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,360
I was poisoned for most of my life.

637
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,580
You sound like some famous 19th century yogi.

638
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,140
If we do too much doodledoodle, we will not be able to fly.

639
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,440
Right.

640
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,820
If you live in lust, you will not be free.

641
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,540
You have to free yourself from desire to truly rise above and all that.

642
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,580
Well, I don't have any choice.

643
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:03,120
I would just as soon wallow in the earth plane and the mud and the sex.

644
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:10,640
But I've just gotten so damn old, I don't think about it as much.

645
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,800
Me too.

646
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,460
I kind of miss it.

647
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:24,020
But at the same time, I feel like I've finally achieved a slightly higher level of intelligence.

648
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,560
Because the poison...

649
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:31,200
The poison of the flunads is no longer affecting me like it used to.

650
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:37,780
It's not dictating how I direct my attention.

651
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,120
It's sad.

652
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:48,500
Once again, Dave, here we are, a couple of old guys talking about our physical limitations

653
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,520
on a show called The Hour of Slack that's supposed to make everybody feel like slack.

654
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,260
Well, the old ones...

655
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,280
Probably do.

656
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,920
Because they're going, well, I sure hear you, buddy.

657
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:10,360
And they're a lot of our audience because baby boomers are in the majority for a short time here.

658
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,380
Wow, you certainly said a mouthful.

659
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,180
I have no idea what the hell you're talking about.

660
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,940
But that was a lot of words jumbled up together.

661
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,600
Well, what I was saying is us old people got to stick together.

662
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,340
But at the same time, I have to hope that the young people are...

663
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:31,880
gleaning some tiny bit of warning about what is to come.

664
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:40,840
And the true message is live your life to the fullest as much as you can while you've still got it.

665
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,540
Because it's going to dwindle away and you're going to shrivel up.

666
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,880
So go for the gusto.

667
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,260
Don't get locked into some slave job where that's...

668
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:53,460
That's...

669
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:59,240
All your best energy is locked into serving some other master.

670
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,040
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

671
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,900
I don't know how to tell people to do that.

672
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:13,940
I had to serve masters in nine to five jobs for most of my career.

673
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:23,080
But you never know when some crazy thing you did when you were a kid might catch on.

674
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:31,780
And pay the rent in a crappy apartment for one person.

675
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,520
But what's important, you know?

676
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,280
Slack or things?

677
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,060
Why not both, of course?

678
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,040
We must say, why not both?

679
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,280
I'd love to have Slack and things.

680
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,520
But that equals $1,000.

681
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,180
I mean, that's how I get...

682
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:05,760
You know, we're doing this radio show that at least 1,000 people download every month.

683
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,180
That's not very big numbers.

684
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,000
But...

685
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,680
Well, I wish they would go and get Neighbor World by Dave.

686
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,260
I wish they would, too.

687
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,920
We're doing it on equipment that costs a total of $40.

688
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,360
And...

689
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,760
Neighbor World was done on equipment that cost a total of $5.

690
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,460
That means it's even better.

691
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:37,340
So, friends, you need to get out and think about Dave's book, Neighbor World.

692
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,680
By the way, my sister has Neighbor World.

693
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,720
She just got her...

694
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,420
I ordered it for her.

695
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:51,500
And she's finishing up Neal Stephenson's Baroque trilogy.

696
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,280
Which she loved.

697
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,120
And the next thing she's going to read is Neighbor World.

698
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,860
Well, that's nice.

699
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,940
And she'll probably like it.

700
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,140
Most people do.

701
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,920
Most people do.

702
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,440
Well, if they can read.

703
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,960
That cuts out about two-thirds of our audience, at least.

704
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,060
Some people have their eyeballs and their ear balls disconnected,

705
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,700
so they can only hear things that other people can normally see.

706
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,940
Why not both?

707
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,980
Why not both?

708
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,940
If only we could all do both.

709
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,440
That's synergy.

710
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,520
That's synergy.

711
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,940
Synesthesia.

712
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:32,920
Like our friend Dr. Sinister named his shows.

713
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,180
You mix up your...

714
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:40,640
You take enough LSD or have enough post-traumatic stress syndrome,

715
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:47,360
and you develop an ability or a disability to...

716
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,440
Actually, disability.

717
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,920
To mix up sound.

718
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,620
Sight.

719
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,020
Smell.

720
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,800
And feeling.

721
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:01,540
So that you smell colors and hear pain.

722
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,320
That's the way you want it.

723
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,540
That's the way you'll get it every time.

724
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,560
Guaranteed.

725
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,700
There's no round-the-block roofers.

726
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,020
There's no engine capacitors.

727
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,060
There's nobody trying to get away with nothing.

728
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,500
Nobody.

729
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,080
This is the real, real, real, real, real...

730
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,980
Real, real, real, real...

731
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,600
Oh, man.

732
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,340
Yeah, that.

733
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,420
Yeah.

734
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,260
That.

735
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,740
That.

736
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,180
There.

737
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,640
Hey, can you hear my dogs?

738
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,060
No.

739
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,720
Yeah.

740
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,060
Yeah, they sound like they're in heat already.

741
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,060
I've been...

742
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,960
I've been sitting here with background music on,

743
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,540
but Buddy and Claudia want to play fight,

744
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,600
and they're dueling.

745
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,540
They're doing that thing where they pretend,

746
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,880
okay, I'm going to bite your face.

747
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,920
No, you're not.

748
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:51,920


749
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,960
Yes, I am.

750
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,580
And then they go chasing around.

751
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,140
Okay, listen.

752
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,160
Well, that's very playful and puppish

753
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,960
and quite exuberant.

754
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,800
As I told you last week, Dave,

755
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,620
I've been talking to the dogs.

756
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,100
It's just...

757
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,320
They're my...

758
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,860
I've been having long conversations

759
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,400
with these animals that can't answer me

760
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,900
and don't understand a word I'm saying.

761
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,420
I think they're like that.

762
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,160
Much like our audience, probably.

763
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,900
Well, they understand a lot more than you think.

764
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,020
Well, they feel the vibes of friends.

765
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,280
Right.

766
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,900
We start right off with the vibes.

767
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,100
They're much better at that than we are anyway.

768
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:37,860
Yeah.

769
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,440
We can hardly, hardly imagine

770
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,240
how far they can go with vibes.

771
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:41,880
Oh.

772
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,820
They can probably smell a difference in your skin

773
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,160
when you're uptight or nervous or frightened

774
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,560
or something like that.

775
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,380
I swear to God,

776
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,040
I think they can tell from the smell of my skin

777
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,900
whether I'm planning to go to the fight.

778
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,320
I think they can tell from the smell of my skin

779
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,320


780
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,320


781
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,320


782
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,320


783
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,320


784
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,320


785
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,540
or do something fun.

786
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,920
Yeah, it's weird how they read your mind

787
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,400
and smell you at the same time.

788
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,880
Yeah, they really do.

789
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,500
Don't you wish we could do that as human...

790
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,880
as subgeniuses?

791
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,480
If we could just get on the bus

792
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,120
and when a guy says,

793
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,120
$0.50, please,

794
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,660
you just go...

795
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,760
and you can tell this guy's lying

796
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,260
to you it's really $1.27

797
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,900
or some other...

798
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,200
You know, we can imagine all kinds of...

799
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,280
And then you lift your leg

800
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,620
and pee on the thing where you put your coins in.

801
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,100
Right, and you make a face like you're chuckling,

802
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,560
like...

803
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,720
Then they kick you off the bus

804
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,520
and you have to walk to your job.

805
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,720
Yeah.

806
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,820
That's the problem.

807
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,300
It's fascism, man.

808
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,160
Fascism is coming back.

809
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,340
They're screwing us up.

810
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,440
They're taking away all our freedoms

811
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,720
in the name of freedom.

812
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,780
The name of the American flag in the Bible

813
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,420
and freedom,

814
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,820
they're wrecking our freedoms.

815
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,300
To not have babies, for instance.

816
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,560
Yeah, who wants them anyway?

817
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,080
Everybody's got special babies.

818
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,540
Lots of people want babies.

819
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,320
I love babies.

820
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,740
I want the subgeniuses to have a lot more babies.

821
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,700
If they're ready for it.

822
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,040
I'm not trying to tell every millennial

823
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,420
that they should do the thing

824
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,380
that they're going to be terrible at

825
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,300
because of the destruction to their instincts,

826
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,400
but...

827
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,240
the ones who still have instincts,

828
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,080
we need to stick together.

829
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,880
Somebody's got to keep the human race going

830
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,980
besides the idiocracy people.

831
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,100
Yeah, because they're saying

832
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,480
that most of the men's testosterone levels

833
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,460
are extremely low.

834
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,300
We could have whole bamboos and fortresses

835
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,200
and forests full of people that have no...

836
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,920
get up and go, if you know what I'm saying.

837
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,800
That would be a horrible thing

838
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,720
because that...

839
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,560
I don't know why it would be a horrible thing

840
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,040
because I personally could use less human beings around me.

841
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,240
But that's just my own personal thing.

842
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,180
I'm not one of those people

843
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,880
who want to push calling the herd

844
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,960
or calling the herd

845
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,540
or down anybody's throat

846
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,420
because I don't believe in that kind of stuff

847
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,840
because I'd be one of the first ones that they'd call.

848
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:02,880
Right.

849
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,460
And it wouldn't be on a telephone either.

850
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,460
No, we'd be...

851
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,660
Yeah, they'd take us in the...

852
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,520
Well, not the first sweep.

853
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,300
Probably the third sweep.

854
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,080
There's people with much higher profile.

855
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,420
They'd take us.

856
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:19,500


857
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,400
And us, they'd take first.

858
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,440
Yeah, their names are...

859
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,480
We'd probably actually...

860
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,060
We'd be more like in the 18th sweep.

861
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,460
Yeah.

862
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,440
We'd be thinking we were going to be okay.

863
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,840
Oh, good.

864
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,160
They only took the Jews and the queers

865
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:38,260
and the registered Democrats this time.

866
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,120
But any minute now, it's going to be us.

867
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,600
Yep.

868
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,480
The undefinables.

869
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,400
Okay, next sweep.

870
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,060
The undefinables.

871
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,640
The undefinables.

872
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,340
Those who didn't fit into any category.

873
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,260
Killed them all.

874
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,580
Or at least, you know, put them to work in Trump's stop.

875
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,520
Yeah.

876
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:05,200
I think I'd trade a cholera blanket.

877
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,160
I don't think we'd merit...

878
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,960
I'd trade a cholera blanket for that.

879
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,440
We probably wouldn't merit execution

880
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,640
in the New World Order, but...

881
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,260
But who can tell?

882
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,000
You know we'd be in the re-education camps.

883
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,220
Yeah.

884
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,220
For all the law.

885
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,120
I don't want to be re-educated

886
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,340
because I don't like being educated to begin with.

887
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,360
So harmful.

888
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,160
It made me feel...

889
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,700
The punishment permeated my entire body.

890
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,720
I know.

891
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,800
Like, I'd get there in the morning,

892
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,520
8.30, 7 o'clock in the afternoon,

893
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,960
or whatever number it was,

894
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,660
and I'd just, like, feel like

895
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,020
they were like these slingy bats

896
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,620
and other things.

897
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:46,620


898
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:46,620


899
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,980
All kinds of congruent creatures

900
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,100
hanging around me,

901
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,220
trying to square me up

902
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,880
and freak me out and stuff.

903
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,980
If you had never educated yourself so well, Dave,

904
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,460
you'd probably be happy to show up at work at 8.30.

905
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,660
It would make sense.

906
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,980
It would all add up.

907
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,800
It would be a simple answer

908
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,920
to a complicated question.

909
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,660
I'd feel happy for a half hour

910
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,380
after getting paid

911
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,280
and then go back to feeling like crap again,

912
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,500
and that would be wonderful.

913
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,320
Just simply wonderful.

914
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,920
Yeah, but you're doomed.

915
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,080
Because you know too much, Dave.

916
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,220
You know too much.

917
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,640
You're like a sub-genius.

918
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,040
It may not all be right,

919
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:32,460
but there's a lot of it that you know.

920
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:34,660
Yep.

921
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,160
It's just like Stephen Kavanaugh's notebook

922
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,200
or his catalog,

923
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,620
whatever he was keeping there.

924
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,120
His calendar.

925
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,540
His calendar.

926
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,640
Don't forget to pinch Betty on the rectum

927
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:46,620
and give her a kiss.

928
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:46,980
diciendo Duet.

929
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,360
Get into a tic baccharge.

930
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:47,360


931
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:47,360


932
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,520
an argument with her father

933
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,480
about being physical,

934
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,380
you know,

935
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,920
remind us like that,

936
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,900
like ooh, my head's not screwed on right.

937
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,060
I hate when they do that.

938
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,280
Especially when they have a role

939
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,660
like Russian egg baskets

940
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,580
that just keep getting

941
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:04,060
smaller and smaller the more resume.

942
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,440
The sad thing is,

943
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,900
I have a calendar kind of like Cavanagh's

944
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,260
from my high school years, my college years.

945
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:16,520
I kept my calendars, and I did keep some rudimentary notes,

946
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,320
and a lot of them are kind of like his.

947
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,720
They were like, how much drugs did I take that weekend?

948
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,280
How high did I get?

949
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,480
How much beer or alcohol of whatever?

950
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,220
How stupid did I get?

951
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:42,140
Yet I even filmed some of it sort of in Super 8 film,

952
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:47,020
and all I can think is, thank God the Internet wasn't around then.

953
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,900
Thank God.

954
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:55,440
Thank God and Bob and Gobs and all of the euphemisms I can think of to thank.

955
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,080
Thank the euphemisms.

956
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,680
The fates, luck, and everything.

957
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,460
The Internet didn't get invented

958
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,200
until I was a kid.

959
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,360
I was in my 30s.

960
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,000
Thank the euphemisms for that.

961
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,540
Man, because otherwise I'd be guilty, guilty, guilty.

962
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,280
So would you, Dave.

963
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,980
You would have splurted out wrong things.

964
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,280
I know.

965
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,380
I have for a long time.

966
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:31,820
I made a 16-millimeter, 45-minute movie when I was in college.

967
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,080
It's the most.

968
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:37,440
It's the most un-PC thing hippies ever saw.

969
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:41,720
It was kind of influenced by underground comics and punk.

970
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,240
It was just pre-punk.

971
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,600
But in some ways it was a rebellion against the peace and love stuff

972
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,820
because I saw the flaws in the peace and love philosophy,

973
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,480
which is that the war and hate won't go away.

974
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,880
You can't wish it away.

975
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,980
And I,

976
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:06,520
I had a vision of the future as an 18-year-old

977
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,580
that I articulated,

978
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,880
I must say, fairly well in an underground movie

979
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,940
before I quit trying to make movies

980
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:21,740
because they're too expensive for me.

981
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,280
Well, I did it.

982
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,560
When I was about the same age and the same period of time,

983
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,240
I wrote me a play, too,

984
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,560
and it was actually performed.

985
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,880
And the teacher thought,

986
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,080
Oh, that's very imaginative, Dave.

987
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,500
Yeah.

988
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:32,980
I got that.

989
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,000
Same reaction.

990
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,880
And some of the names that I thought were like monster names

991
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,360
and were real mean and everything,

992
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,140
I thought I dreamed up people.

993
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,440
It's common usage now,

994
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,880
and a bunch of that stuff is, too,

995
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,160
especially the part I stole from you.

996
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,920
Ahead of your time, Dave.

997
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,600
Ahead of your time.

998
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,060
It's like Bob himself.

999
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,140
He's a head,

1000
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,640
a single, floating, disembodied head

1001
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,740
of his time.

1002
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,880
Lucky for Bob,

1003
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,260
he's timeless.

1004
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,800
You and me,

1005
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,540
we're 65 and older.

1006
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:09,100
Yeah.

1007
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,360
And doing our best.

1008
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,120
We have to sit in a special choo-choo closet

1009
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,900
where they have the raising nets.

1010
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,400
Oh, we're going to have coffee at 7 o'clock in the morning

1011
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,660
because we never sleep anymore.

1012
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,700
Just sit around waiting for the old examiner to come by

1013
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,280
and scythe them asunder.

1014
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,740
You know what I mean?

1015
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,340
No.

1016
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,380
Oh, I ain't got nothing to live for.

1017
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,700
This is the old,

1018
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,260
old woman died,

1019
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,080
and I just have to go and have coffee

1020
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,260
with the railroad guys every morning at 10.

1021
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,020
Well, yeah.

1022
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,220
Actually, I can understand that.

1023
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,000
They never get enough pi, either.

1024
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,400
Even if it is square.

1025
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,120
You know, like the number...

1026
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,060
Is there ever enough pi?

1027
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,000
Can there ever be enough pi?

1028
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,620
R squared.

1029
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,860
That's the root number

1030
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,320
that everybody's so fondled of.

1031
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,680
Pi R squared.

1032
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:01,680


1033
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:01,680


1034
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:01,680


1035
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,040
Pi R squared.

1036
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,520
Oh, my God.

1037
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,880
While we were doing this show...

1038
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,620
The dog urinated on your shoe.

1039
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,940
Yeah, he kind of did.

1040
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:16,200
He ate the fancy doggy bed

1041
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:21,240
that my son gave us.

1042
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,560
My son had a giant dog.

1043
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,280
It died.

1044
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,020
His new dog didn't want to sleep on the dead dog's bed,

1045
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,480
and we ended up with this giant...

1046
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,920
dog bed in the house.

1047
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,500
It's great, but...

1048
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,460
I see you...

1049
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,420
Buddy just disemboweled it

1050
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,780
while I was doing this stupid show.

1051
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,440
Right behind me.

1052
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,160
I mean, right behind me he was doing that

1053
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,540
because I had music...

1054
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,980
Background music was up, see?

1055
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,340
I didn't hear anything.

1056
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,760
I'm like deaf.

1057
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:52,900
I'm like...

1058
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,440
Bud, knock it off, man.

1059
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,600
Yeah.

1060
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,320
I hope I haven't been torturing you here.

1061
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,540
It's too much because...

1062
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,440
No, no, it's not...

1063
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:03,780
I have the phone...

1064
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,580
No.

1065
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,340
Not right now, it's not,

1066
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,500
but earlier I could hear...

1067
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,660
Oh, listen.

1068
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,700
In the background.

1069
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,060
You can't hear it, Dave.

1070
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,480
But what the audience was hearing...

1071
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:17,560
For a second there.

1072
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,460
It's gone now.

1073
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,840
What the audience was hearing

1074
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,160
was the licking of the fundament

1075
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,240
of the pit bull by the pit bull.

1076
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,440
Oh, that is great stuff, man.

1077
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,040
It was urgently...

1078
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,080
licking its exit wound

1079
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,080
last night.

1080
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,700
The sound was so vivid

1081
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:47,120
that I felt like I had to record it.

1082
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:50,660
I put my phone cam down there.

1083
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,520
It was just a dark picture.

1084
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:57,120
But you can hear the licking

1085
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,800
and the urgent grunting.

1086
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,780
Because don't you wish

1087
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,220
you could do that, Dave?

1088
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:07,800
Yes, I can.

1089
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,140
I was doing an imitation of many dogs

1090
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,280
that I've known in my pretty nature.

1091
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,660
Yeah, that was actually

1092
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,860
a pretty good copy.

1093
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,020
But see, because I can't control my...

1094
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:19,940
After the lick, you know,

1095
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,780
you get a lick in there

1096
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,240
and then you get a little chew.

1097
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:23,800
Oh, there we go.

1098
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,160
Now I got it back.

1099
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,460
Well, I told you

1100
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,700
that was going to happen

1101
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,160
if you continued to bother her

1102
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,780
about, you know what, you know...

1103
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,940
The audience, but not you,

1104
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,240
can hear the licking of the...

1105
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,180
of the dog's own...

1106
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:45,800
Imperfection.

1107
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,100
...itchy part, I guess.

1108
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:49,820
Itchy part.

1109
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,220
Well, if that doesn't sound

1110
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,540
like a sign out of me,

1111
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,500
I don't know what...

1112
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,140
Well, you can...

1113
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,480
Yeah, it is kind of.

1114
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,160
You can hear a faint grunting.

1115
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:01,140
It's a good thing.

1116
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,340
She grunts in the most faint and...

1117
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:04,920
I can hear...

1118
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,180
I could hear some licking there

1119
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,600
for a while right now.

1120
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,000
There's no way you can hear

1121
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,320
what I'm playing in the background.

1122
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,860
Is it going like

1123
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,500
click, click, click, click, click, click?

1124
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,340
Yeah, yeah.

1125
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,480
Yeah, I can hear that.

1126
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,080
You must have the monitor up too loud.

1127
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,240
Can you hear any music

1128
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,320
when I play music?

1129
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,660
I just heard some music just before

1130
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,820
and as you said that,

1131
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:26,180
it was...

1132
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,880
No, I can't hear that.

1133
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,160
Oh, but damn.

1134
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:30,700
Well, you know,

1135
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,540
they updated the iPhone.

1136
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,140
Maybe it changed something.

1137
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,380
Anyway, yes, you're right, Dave.

1138
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,240
We've actually been talking

1139
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:43,700
for not quite a full hour

1140
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,920
and that means we're free.

1141
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,680
We could be free

1142
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,540
from Bob's slavery

1143
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,600
once again for a little while

1144
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,040
if we want.

1145
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,420
Yeah.

1146
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,160
If we want to be.

1147
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,320
Well, I think I'm just going to go

1148
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,200
and sit my posterior down

1149
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,800
and take a relaxing break.

1150
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,300
Perhaps you can get this

1151
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,240
frop whistle to work.

1152
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,260
You know, my problem is

1153
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,620
once we finish recording

1154
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,760
one of these things,

1155
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,100
I can't...

1156
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,220
I always think...

1157
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,620
I always think,

1158
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,920
well, that was pretty bad.

1159
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,120
And then I get home

1160
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,780
and listen back to it

1161
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,360
and go,

1162
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,160
oh, that's not so bad.

1163
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,220
No, it's usually...

1164
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:38,980
It's not...

1165
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,420
No.

1166
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,420
What?

1167
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,520
Did I say that?

1168
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,520
I don't remember that.

1169
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:43,640
Well, that's pretty good.

1170
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,580
If I listen to Dave,

1171
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,620
I thought he was making nonsense

1172
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,640
when he was doing it in real time.

1173
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,280
Now when I play the tape back,

1174
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,120
he sounds like James Joyce

1175
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,860
doing beautiful word splicing

1176
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,700
and cross juxtaposition of meaning.

1177
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,180
Yeah.

1178
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,820
Like Fireside Theater

1179
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,760
or Monty Python

1180
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,460
just off the top of his head.

1181
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,820
I am Fireside Monty Python

1182
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,940
and all them guys.

1183
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,220
You know, Monty Python's

1184
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,320
been around for 50 years today.

1185
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:13,860
Yep.

1186
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,420
50 years.

1187
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,640
I seem to remember

1188
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,000
seeing him when I was 20.

1189
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,760
What does that say about me?

1190
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,800
We're old, man.

1191
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,800
Just think of the cheese shop

1192
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,680
and the guys playing...

1193
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,600
and the bouzouki in there.

1194
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,340
One of these days,

1195
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:33,920
we're going to have

1196
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,360
our own little cheese shop.

1197
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,540
Just like Mom wanted us to.

1198
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:38,020
She'd look,

1199
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,160
well, you're good old John

1200
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,380
and I want you to own

1201
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,300
the whole store.

1202
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,200
We got all kinds of Philly Bertons

1203
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,480
and Scrammin' Bears

1204
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,960
and all kinds of wonderful cheese

1205
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,000
for you to enjoy

1206
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,200
along with that shiplick,

1207
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:51,760
slap it,

1208
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:52,420
let's call it,

1209
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,100
your wife.

1210
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,680
Yeah, except the store

1211
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,720
is always out of all those things.

1212
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,460
Well,

1213
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,860
that's because, you know,

1214
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,400
they just don't want to obey

1215
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,360
our beloved leader.

1216
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,320
That's why we have a beloved leader

1217
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,120
is so that we can obey him or her.

1218
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,580
I thought it was so

1219
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,020
we could disobey him.

1220
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,120
We can neither disobey

1221
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,440
nor disallow the leader.

1222
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,300
We can only accept the leader

1223
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,180
as our leader.

1224
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,320
And his name is Bob

1225
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,900
in quotes.

1226
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,260
Quote, B-O-B, unquote, Bob.

1227
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,600
Capital B.

1228
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,680
Not like, not like.

1229
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,560
There you go, capital B.

1230
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,380
But not all caps.

1231
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:35,980
It's not,

1232
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,440
he's not the Facebook Bob

1233
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,600
who's just B-O-B in all caps.

1234
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,060
That's the idiot Bob.

1235
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,100
That's the pink Bob.

1236
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,400
The true Bob is,

1237
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,140
quote,

1238
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:52,300
Big B, little O, little B,

1239
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:53,780
end quotes.

1240
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,640
That's it.

1241
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:56,760
Yep.

1242
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:57,920
There's no other way

1243
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,360
and anything else is fake.

1244
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:01,500
That's sub...

1245
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,580
And what else could you want?

1246
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,040
Everything's right there

1247
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,120
in that solemn package

1248
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:05,760
right for you.

1249
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,460
There it is.

1250
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,560
There it is.

1251
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:08,520
You don't need anything

1252
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,500
more than that face.

1253
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,540
It's a face-based religion.

1254
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,300
The face of Bob.

1255
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,200
There but for the face

1256
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,100
of Bob Goy.

1257
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,280
See, the Goy is another part.

1258
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,700
Have you ever noticed, like,

1259
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,880
if you look into Bob's eyes

1260
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,540
for long enough

1261
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,520
and you go,

1262
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,100
hey, I, I, I, I, I.

1263
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,180
If you look in Bob's eyes

1264
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:28,660
long enough,

1265
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,020
you see your own death.

1266
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,860
You see how you're gonna die.

1267
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,340
So don't do it.

1268
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,580
It's too heavy for me, man.

1269
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,600
I didn't want to say that

1270
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,360
because, you know.

1271
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,420
You don't want to do it.

1272
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,000
Well...

1273
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,340
I did.

1274
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,320
I know you didn't,

1275
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,480
but you couldn't speak

1276
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,520
coherently for weeks afterwards.

1277
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,520
Those were our best shows.

1278
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,420
Yeah, but from what

1279
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,480
I heard from Wheeler,

1280
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,280
you were kind of hard

1281
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:52,860
to be around.

1282
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:53,620
You had your hair

1283
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,040
frazzled out like Einstein.

1284
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,140
That's normal.

1285
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:56,760
You had like...

1286
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,260
Yeah, to whom?

1287
00:54:58,780 --> 00:54:59,220
Her.

1288
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:00,400
Oh.

1289
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,460
Yeah, I forgot that part.

1290
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,400
I guess it's not important.

1291
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,360
I miss her so much.

1292
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,020
She still has to be in Ohio

1293
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,820
and I have to be here in Texas

1294
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,200
until she finishes her job

1295
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,240
and I finish mine,

1296
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,540
whichever comes first.

1297
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,380
I miss our mom.

1298
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,440
Our old mom.

1299
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,980
She was like a guiding,

1300
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,900
positive beacon.

1301
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,840
A beacon of positivity.

1302
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,300
And we used to call her

1303
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,900
Sweet Mammy Jane

1304
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,880
or something like that.

1305
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,040
Well, we still do.

1306
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,000
She's still alive,

1307
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,420
but she's 88

1308
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,580
and I want her back here.

1309
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,940
I need to go back there first,

1310
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,040
pack up a moving van

1311
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,860
with what's left of our stuff,

1312
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,800
which actually includes

1313
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,260
the cassette tapes

1314
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:55,180
of all hours of slack

1315
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,320
that were done on cassette

1316
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,180
for 20 years.

1317
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,000
And then bring...

1318
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,920
Them and that

1319
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,640
and all that stuff back here

1320
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,560
with the dogs.

1321
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,420
And then everything will be fine.

1322
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,840
I just know it will.

1323
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,640
I know it will once that happens.

1324
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,140
But in the meantime,

1325
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,720
it's just...

1326
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,620
Where's the...

1327
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,700
The hour of slack

1328
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,580
just isn't the same

1329
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,760
without Princess Wee's

1330
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,820
lilting laughter

1331
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:23,740
in the background.

1332
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,600
Right?

1333
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,880
Or the foreground either.

1334
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,260
Normally, we would have her...

1335
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,020
She'd be cackling.

1336
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:30,680
She'd be cackling.

1337
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,640
And we have no laugh track.

1338
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,820
Or we would say something

1339
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:35,540
so oblique

1340
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,820
that neither one of us would be like,

1341
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,220
wow.

1342
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,760
Man, it just ain't fair.

1343
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:40,720
It ain't...

1344
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,280
It is.

1345
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,320
It's all so oblique.

1346
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,300
What is fair, Stang?

1347
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,740
There's no fairness anywhere

1348
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,840
in the doctrine

1349
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,520
of today's modern agendas.

1350
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,420
That's my...

1351
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,240
There's no fairness.

1352
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,520
Everything is skiltered

1353
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,200
and quandered

1354
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,460
and stranded in one direction

1355
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,240
for the ruling class.

1356
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,560
The 1%.

1357
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,040
The ones who...

1358
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,020
Not the petty...

1359
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,800
Very bourgeoisie.

1360
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,380
But the acclimated clamboats

1361
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,160
at the very, very top of the heap.

1362
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,240
Yeah, and that's who

1363
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,060
the poor people vote for.

1364
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,340
Well, because they're all

1365
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,100
so much alike.

1366
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:12,760
Like, just think,

1367
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,420
when you were three years old,

1368
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,860
you already had $200,000

1369
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:16,640
in the bank.

1370
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,540
By the time you were 21,

1371
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,400
you already had $200,000

1372
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,040
in the bank.

1373
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,660
What are they talking about?

1374
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,660
Or maybe I got those figures wrong.

1375
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,880
No, you're...

1376
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,080
I was just reading

1377
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,180
similar figures

1378
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:30,660
for...

1379
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,080
for our president

1380
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,620
who worked his way up

1381
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,760
from his bootstraps

1382
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,420
with $100,000

1383
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,460
when he was five years old

1384
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,580
and a million dollars

1385
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,780
when he was eight

1386
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,700
and so forth

1387
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:48,080
because tax fraud

1388
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,340
and...

1389
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,320
Yeah, that's...

1390
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,160
Okay.

1391
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,720
And with that, friends,

1392
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,580
it's the end

1393
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,960
of another hour of Slack,

1394
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:00,580
I guess,

1395
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,740
of subgenius.com.

1396
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,000
That's the only thing

1397
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:06,920
you need to remember,

1398
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,120
but you need to remember

1399
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,340
that subgenius

1400
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,440
is spelled without an O.

1401
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,280
subgenius.com.

1402
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:17,780
The show is the hour of Slack.

1403
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,660
There are other subgenius shows,

1404
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,480
so don't get hooked on this one.

1405
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:27,580
And...

1406
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:28,660
Yeah, you could get sick

1407
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,520
pretty easy.

1408
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,360
You don't watch...

1409
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,040
Look at us.

1410
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,360
Just look at us.

1411
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,140
Just mirror hundreds of him.

1412
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,820
Yeah, just look at us.

1413
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,400
Mirror shadows

1414
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,520
for shadowiness.

1415
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:45,920
Yeah.

1416
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,980
Previous incantations.

1417
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,020
Shadows for former shadowiness.

1418
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:55,980
Shadows for former shadowiness.

1419
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:55,980


1420
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:56,980
You...

1421
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:57,560
You...

1422
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,520
You...

1423
00:58:59,100 --> 00:58:59,340
You...

1424
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,480
Hey, you damn kids.

1425
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,160
Get off my lawn.

1426
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:03,160
You're gonna...

1427
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,740
You'll find out if you're lucky

1428
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,320
to live long enough

1429
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,220
to be measurable.

1430
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,420
You kids...

1431
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,160
Damn kids.

1432
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,240
Okay, Dave.

1433
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,240
Okay, I'll go check some squids now.

1434
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:21,180
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1435
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,540
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1436
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,620
I know what I'm gonna do.

1437
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,780
Whip that dog for biting up his...

1438
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,000
eating his own bed.

1439
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,320
Okay, Dave.

1440
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,260
See you later.

1441
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:30,980
Okay, you got it.

1442
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:31,980
Mm.

1443
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,800
Wow, he hung up.
