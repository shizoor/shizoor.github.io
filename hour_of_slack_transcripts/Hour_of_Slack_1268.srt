1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's see, which one will I have for breakfast?

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,600
Oh, it's probably the first breeze you've had all day.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,080
Good salesman.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,220
Yeah, thanks.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,480
Better get ready.

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,720
It's gonna be late for the show.

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,300
Kids ready?

8
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,840
But I'm thirsty.

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,620
I want some water or some summer pot.

10
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,500
Forget it.

11
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,780
Oh, now, Brown.

12
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,660
You are gonna wow Brown Cow.

13
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,800
With indecision, ladies and...

14
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,100
And that's how I solve the problem of indecision.

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,400
That's it.

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,360
For you.

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,900
That's after only one broadcast.

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,680
Why, there's no limit to it.

19
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,080
That's good, because we're running out of pickles.

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,380
Okay, let's blast off.

21
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,680
Just a minute, ma'am.

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,260
You knew that ham was salty.

23
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,240
You shouldn't have let him eat five sandwiches.

24
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,300
Four!

25
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,080
The way I see it, somebody's gonna have to phone for help.

26
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,060
What do I do with the children?

27
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,140
Vultures!

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,120
Be careful what you say around here.

29
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,200
Yes!

31
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,420
Is that really what happened in the Bible?

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,380
It's a sick and twisted book of holiness, all right.

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,940
Then we'll write our own Bible.

34
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,240
With less Sodom and more good.

35
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,040
The Mara.

36
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,900
Let's do it!

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,360
The subgenius power of Slack!

38
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:45,940
Slack!

39
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,360
Because after all, however boring this may seem, it's for radio,

40
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,240
and it can be edited.

41
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,240


42
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,240


43
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,240


44
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,580
It's edited by Reverend Stang.

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,580
I got them all here.

46
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,640
Bob was one of the first to take university courses while serving time in prison.

47
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,660
Bob works with women at the local prison behind bars.

48
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,880
Bob has a lot of experience with prison.

49
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,180
Welcome to the show, Bob.

50
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,160
Thanks for joining us.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,620
So you were one of the first people in prison to take PP.

52
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,060
What was it like trying to set that up as a prisoner back then?

53
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,740
They just had their lights blown.

54
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,700
So, and...

55
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,980
You know, there were situations where everybody's drunk,

56
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,240
and somebody would wake up,

57
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,240
and in the morning there's a body.

58
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,460
People don't even know who did it.

59
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,180
We all make mistakes.

60
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,220
And I know that, you know, I was seen as a member of the walking dead.

61
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,640
That and, you know, this lingering, this lingering...

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,200
What word do I use here?

63
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,200
Spasms of violence.

64
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,800
We have been speaking with Bob Bob's personality on prisons in Canada.

65
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,340
Attention, subgeniuses.

66
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,160
Ask Dr.

67
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,040
Howell.

68
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,080
Yes.

69
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,420
You can ask Dr.

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
Howell anything.

71
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,560
Do you dare ask Dr.

72
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,180
Howell?

73
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,900
Do you have enough of a ball to ask?

74
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,540
A big, fat, hairy ball.

75
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,160
Dr. Howell.

76
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:36,020
Do you have fat enough hair in a ball to ask of Dr. Howell any question you can think of?

77
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,000
Can you be the first person in history to stump Dr. Howell?

78
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,240
Listen up, y'all.

79
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,020
It's D-E-V-O.

80
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,520
Listen up, y'all.

81
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,040
It's D-E-V-O.

82
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,200
Three,

83
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,880
two,

84
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,260
one...

85
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,280
zusammen,

86
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,280


87
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,640
Wake up.

88
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:14,860
Candidate for the next position of choices.

89
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,540
Dr. Nothing but fear.

90
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,980
Everyone's on a waist of fear.

91
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,460
People get up.

92
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:17,460


93
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,720
Don't気in'.

94
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,220
No one says anything.

95
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,040
Each has a family's own destiny.

96
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,100
You know,

97
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,820
my brother has never been afraid of anything.

98
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,940
He was in prison,

99
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:22,940


100
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,020
Or Sk homeless.

101
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,040
Fly, learn to stay high

102
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,960
Above the stormy sea

103
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,700
They say the new age

104
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,240
Is the big rage

105
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,900
And the next stage

106
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,860
Will bring us to the edge

107
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,200
Now escape from your golden cage

108
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,280
Then turn the page on

109
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,220
The demons in your head

110
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,980
Step off, get to the bottom of it

111
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,540
Dig deep, go behind the scenes

112
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,100
You gotta step off

113
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,440
Get to the bottom of it

114
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,920
Go deep, show them what it means

115
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,480
You gotta step off

116
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,280
Pull down and take a number

117
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,320
Hold firm, nip it in the bud

118
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,900
You gotta step off

119
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,720
Pull down and take a number

120
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,220
Be firm, figure out what's wrong now

121
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,040
Step off

122
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,060
They say the right time

123
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,600
Is the night time

124
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,280
So it's about time

125
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,080
To do what you please

126
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,500
Before they drive by

127
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,040
Look tight and steer right

128
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,580
Into some fine wine

129
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,540
Till you're buzzed and feeling free

130
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
When it's not over

131
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,460
Till the girls come home

132
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,960
It's not over

133
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,520
Till the fat lady says

134
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,240
It's never too late

135
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,860
To grab some gold

136
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,360
It's never too late

137
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,080
To shake that thing

138
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,160
Change

139
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,020
Change

140
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,840
Change

141
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,460
Change

142
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:02,940
Nice

143
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,180
Let's go through this again

144
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,000
Step off, get to the bottom of it

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,560
Dig deep, go behind the scenes

146
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,060
You gotta step off

147
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,420
Get to the bottom of it

148
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,980
Go deep, show them what it means

149
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,600
You gotta step off

150
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,280
Pull down and take a number

151
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,280
Be firm, figure out what's wrong now

152
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,720
Pull down and take a number

153
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,620
Be firm, figure out what's wrong now

154
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,020
Step off

155
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,580
Pull down and take a number

156
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:36,580


157
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:36,580


158
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:45,540
And so, through epicycles of cosmic time, all that has originally transpired has come

159
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,660
to bring about this moment.

160
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,160
So I ask you to come in close.

161
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,500
If you are with me.

162
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,360
Please stand within the sound of my voice and prepare to ask any question.

163
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:08,560
The answer of which might raise you up and lighten, to some degree, your burden.

164
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:17,460
Going from town to town, locale to locale, municipality to municipality, the Ask Dr.

165
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,480
Hal show beats its drum and erects its battered weather beat.

166
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,480


167
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,480


168
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:30,260
beaten sign, a sign that is known by all for miles around, a sign which unfortunately the

169
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:38,100
local authorities will not allow us to display. But they come, rich or poor, young or old,

170
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:45,200
flocking to this sign to answer by being answered.

171
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,860
From PR News in Washington, I'm killing at least three people.

172
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,880
During a ceremony at NATO headquarters in Kabul, Vice President Joe Biden said to help pay for

173
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,840
relocating Amila Ghanoua. Biden is reneging on his pledge to get off the island. He was known

174
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,900
for his strong anti-American views. Vice President Joe Biden is in straight sets at Wimbledon today

175
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:14,000
to win his second singles eighth Grand Slam championship. Vice President Biden said the

176
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,400
country is slowly moving toward a lasting political stalemate. Last month, Al Biden claimed

177
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:19,840
responsibility for the U.S. military's efforts to stop the U.S. military from taking over the

178
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,200
country. He claimed responsibility for suicide attacks on two main banks. And on Friday, a senior

179
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,420
cleric in Anbar. Iraqi police said PR is bad. PR is bad. Vice President Joe Biden blew herself up

180
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:38,100
after a long PR news from Washington. We were all fired up to tell Bob about our Vegas trip,

181
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,860
but we weren't really too sure exactly how he was going to react to the whole thing.

182
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,460
Hey, let's just not tell him.

183
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,200
What are you talking about? Tell him anything. We go back to work.

184
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,820
We told Bob that we're going to Vegas. I don't think he was too happy.

185
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:05,960
Once in Bob's writing, so Bob died. And so Bob's writings really speak.

186
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,400
And all that nonsense that they finally said, okay, to heck with that.

187
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,220
Like this thing with the eye, like, uh, yeah,

188
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:14,440
you have to do this. You have to do this. You have to do this. You have to do this. You have to do this.

189
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,180
You have to have a complete, uh, well-formed eye for it to do you any good.

190
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,320
Oh boy. What a shame.

191
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,680
Bob built his own gravity engine. What was that? Like a joke?

192
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,840
Well, yeah, it runs on gravity. And, um,

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,800
that was the theory behind Bob's perpetual motion machine.

194
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,580
And Bob.

195
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,020
Oh boy.

196
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,840
Uh,

197
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,400
just individual articles that Bob had written.

198
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,540
He wrote books about physics.

199
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:03,060
He didn't think that there was gravity and he had a,

200
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,400
I think a religion called law sodomy.

201
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,040
So he had a lot of nutty ideas.

202
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,020
That was Bob's first article.

203
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:18,680
Bob had written some articles about pyramid power and the search for Noah's Ark,

204
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,100
the Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot.

205
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,320
Um, some articles about Tesla and yeah.

206
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,260
Yeah.

207
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,040
Thanks for enlightening us.

208
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,260
Thank you so much.

209
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,240
It was really fun.

210
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,520
And thank you for giving me this opportunity to talk about Bob.

211
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,680
I really enjoyed it.

212
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,520
And, uh,

213
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,860
thanks to go Drex,

214
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,880
who did that amazing,

215
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,160
mashup there,

216
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,720
the long discussion about Bob.

217
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,420
And before that,

218
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,740
the large did Bob Vegas.

219
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,220
Uh,

220
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,500
lemur is PR news.

221
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,300
Uh,

222
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,440
the song step up was from Devo's new album,

223
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,420
heart ignition,

224
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,700
and lemur did the opening collages.

225
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,860
And this is the,

226
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,740
the hour of Slack number 1,268 from the church of the sub genius.

227
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,460
Uh,

228
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,020
half of it was recorded at the 13th.

229
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,120
Well,

230
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,140
actually the 15th X day drill during the ask Dr.

231
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,620
Howell show with Dr.

232
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,820
Follow Drummond as MC.

233
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,980
But first heart ignition will show us what it's about.

234
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,320
The agents who enabled that earthly,

235
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:39,860


236
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,540
uh,

237
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,560
and,

238
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,340
and,

239
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:42,920
uh,

240
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,240
and,

241
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,840
uh,

242
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,600
I think I am doors.

243
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,820
This lie.

244
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,020
I thought this is an error,

245
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,720
but this is a grave error.

246
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,160
God wandering about,

247
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:53,840
uh,

248
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,080
without me,

249
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,800
it's useless revelation.

250
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,900
And I'm sick of it.

251
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,280
Uh,

252
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,380
you see what I'm saying?

253
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:01,800
No,

254
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,020
no.

255
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,220
You know,

256
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,560
folks,

257
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,840
the existence of the,

258
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:09,840


259
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:09,840


260
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,460
of a question implies the existence of an answer,

261
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,660
but both are simply skeletal contrast struts,

262
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,300
which we,

263
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,600
um,

264
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,720
which we apply to the face of nature.

265
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,460
Now that we do have questions.

266
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,360
And so we'll want the background down.

267
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,980
I will do my introductory poem and then one by one,

268
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:37,460
Philo Drummond will fish the questions from the very bosom of priestess Pisces.

269
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,820
And what is more entertaining than that?

270
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,180
So,

271
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:40,800
uh,

272
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,820
I can't do a long poem as I w would like,

273
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,340
like one of Milton's allegorical poems.

274
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,020
Uh,

275
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,660
one of those takes eight minutes.

276
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,940
Another one takes 10 minutes entirely too long.

277
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,260
I,

278
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,260
so I'm going to go to something modern by the American poet,

279
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,640
uh,

280
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,600
XJ Kennedy.

281
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
The moment I finished saying this poem,

282
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,720
ask Dr.

283
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,780
How will be in session,

284
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,120
but at any time you can submit a question.

285
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:04,820
Okay,

286
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,800
here's the poem in a prominent bar in Seacost.

287
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:09,800


288
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:36,580


289
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,600
Oh,

290
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:25,780


291
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,040
Tom.

292
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:37,820
sit down by a tumble down drunk if it wasn't my dears for the high cost of junk all the gents

293
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,660
used to say that the white of my calf beat the down of the swan by a length and a half

294
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:51,740
in the kerchief of linen i caught to my nose ah there never fell snot but a little gold rose

295
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:58,940
i had seven gold teeth and a toothpick of gold my virginia cheroot was a leaf of it rolled

296
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:05,340
and i'd light it each time with a thousand in cash why the bums used to fight if i flicked them

297
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:12,520
an ash once the toast of the biltmore the bell of the taft i would drink bottled beer at the drake

298
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:20,460
never draft and dine at the aster on salisbury steak with a clean table cloth for each bite i

299
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:28,700
did take in a car like the roxy i'd roll to the track a steel guitar trio a bar in the back and

300
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:28,820
the

301
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:28,920
and the

302
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:28,920


303
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:28,980
,

304
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:36,600
wheels made no noise they turned over so fast still it took you ten minutes to see me go past

305
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:43,060
when the horses bowed down to me that i might choose i'd bet on them all because i hated to

306
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:50,340
lose now i'm saddled each night for my butter and eggs and the broken threads race down the

307
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:58,580
backs of my legs let you keep in mind girls that your beauty must pass like a lovely white

308
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:58,920
cross

309
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,880
all its colours Philips

310
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,440
bridging while you're stuck in the rain

311
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,860
Miracle tide

312
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,620
where do you go

313
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,600
all inking

314
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,960
fi ha gl'

315
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:18,960


316
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,560
the

317
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,300
doom

318
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,960
buzz

319
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,560
sand

320
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,620
this is a

321
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:25,660
way,

322
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,100
o

323
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,080
ma

324
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,380
sure

325
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:28,640
you

326
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:28,660
just

327
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:28,900
swear

328
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:28,900


329
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:28,900


330
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:28,900


331
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:28,900


332
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:28,900


333
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:28,900


334
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:37,580
a cheer, but the man at the bar made a phone call and up pulled a red patrol car, and she blew us a

335
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:44,580
kiss as they copped her away from that prominent bar in Secaucus, N.J.

336
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:54,940
Special scientific electronic bob installed in our vehicle. The big evil. Is this okay? No.

337
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:04,580
This is the city, Los Angeles, California. They feed on the sorrows, ignorance, and superstitions

338
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:12,880
of others. Special scientific electronic bob installed in our vehicle. The big evil. Is this

339
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,700
okay? No. It was warm in Los Angeles. We were working the day watch out of juvenile bunco section.

340
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,700
Would you go ahead, please? I'm a silly old fool. You're a chicken embryo.

341
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:24,660
Yes.

342
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,760
We know how you feel. It's happened to a lot of people. Oh.

343
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,080
Flush it down the commode. Oh, no. Do you want to tell us about the $15,000?

344
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,880
That $15,000? Flush it down the commode. You're right, Sergeant.

345
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,880
Go on, please. Yes, sir.

346
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,160
All right, come on out of there. I'm a police officer, ma'am. Can I help you?

347
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,340
Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. Right out of your money.

348
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,380
But first, Whippet, New York.

349
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,940
That's right. In style.

350
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,380
Perky ruthless.

351
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,320
I know. A finger in the pie. I think I'm ready for the Senate.

352
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,500
You want to be me.

353
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,180
Pink one.

354
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,460
And she's a bit oomph, too. People like it. She's a lesbian.

355
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,720
Who's obese.

356
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,280
A tasty snack. She cracks me up whenever I say her face.

357
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,520
It was guttural. It was primal. It felt like...

358
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,000
You can practically smell her.

359
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,400
Delicious.

360
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Wow, that hit a note.

361
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,160
And horribly abused tonight.

362
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,120
By her father. Repeatedly.

363
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,620
I'll get that.

364
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,260
She was naked. She came to my...

365
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,620
And sexually.

366
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,700
Reality did some damage to me.

367
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,000
And I like donuts.

368
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,460
And he comes from a broken home.

369
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,460
You know, I'm really glad you came in with your helmet.

370
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,380
Might be his tomb as well.

371
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,020
It was just total convenience.

372
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,680
It was really easy.

373
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,780
And the conscious mind starts to... is occupied.

374
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,280
Starts to see things and then they start to fit together or not.

375
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,980
Euthanize it. It's time.

376
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,700
It's like slipping into your pajamas when you go to work. I love it.

377
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,780
Sexually frustrated.

378
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,320
I miss it.

379
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,740
Alright, Clarence.

380
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,520
Okay, Dr. Howell.

381
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,160
Lay it on me.

382
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,060
Dr. Howell, what is more important to Bob?

383
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,520
Our sex god?

384
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,740
Sex or his pipe?

385
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,200
Oh, and there's a second part here. Or does he...

386
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:16,660
Sluh...

387
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,960
I don't know what that word means, but it looks like...

388
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,580
Sluh...

389
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:22,980
No, oh wait.

390
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,120
It's...

391
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,080
Does he give the pipe?

392
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,760
I can't...

393
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:29,920
It's...

394
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,540
After sex.

395
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,360
After sex or during.

396
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,340
Does he give the pipe?

397
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,300
Give doesn't make sense.

398
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,860
Does he save the pipe?

399
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,080
Save the pipe for after sex or during.

400
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Save the pipe.

401
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,060
It's not...

402
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,600
Save the pipe.

403
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,300
It's not...

404
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,140
Yeah, save the pipe. That's a very...

405
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,700
Does he save the pipe for after sex or during?

406
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:54,060
That implies that the pipe needs to rest when actually, of course, the pipe is asleep.

407
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,100


408
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,100


409
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,100


410
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,820
It's a source of Dobsian energy in itself.

411
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:02,680
But you know, Philo, I feel kind of bashful and shy here, like a young maiden who has

412
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:09,600
just hung her clothes on a hickory limb, because this is a question about Dobsian nature.

413
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,400
I'm sitting right next to you, the overman, and trying to answer it.

414
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,400
So if I am wrong, please don't hesitate to correct me.

415
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,260
I will blunder forward in my humble way, but, you know...

416
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:22,820
Take a shot.

417
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,440
Yeah, I'm going to have to do that.

418
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:33,980
So when you say, what is more important to Bob, our sex god, sex or his pipe, you're

419
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,500
asking, you know, what is more important to you, your arm or your leg?

420
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,000
You know, the pipe is a part of Bob, a piece of Bob.

421
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,140
Without the pipe, Bob is not Bob, not the Bob that we know.

422
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:52,740
Furthermore, there is that strange, persistent legend that the pipe itself has life.

423
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:58,280
And even, according to some, pilots or dictates the course of Bob.

424
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,080
Now, if it does that, then it leads him right into the bedroom, doesn't it?

425
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,200
Stands to reason.

426
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:12,980
And leads him on into the most outrageous sex fancies which legions of panting, scrofulous,

427
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,580
subgenius scribes have been writing down since the beginning of this whole subgenius thing

428
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,540
came about.

429
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,800
In reams of all but unreadable.

430
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,280
Bob pornography.

431
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:30,040
But they never leave out the pipe, nor do I think should they.

432
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:37,500
Now as for the second part of this entirely unpaid question, does he save the pipe for

433
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,800
after sex or during?

434
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:45,860
The only part of this worth answering is that the pipe has multiple uses, including those

435
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,520
which might be employed after sex.

436
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,380
That's a pretty good answer, Dr. Howell.

437
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,040
Okay, now you set me straight here.

438
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,940
But I would say that the pipe precedes Bob to a certain extent.

439
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,320
Oh, it does.

440
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,260
It does precede him just as the...

441
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,080
Why wouldn't Bob want to have the pipe with him while having sex?

442
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:07,680
Exactly.

443
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,640
And so I said the pipe leads Bob on.

444
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,920
Just as in an air crash, the pilot is always first at the scene of the accident.

445
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,100
You know, and Bob is ever vigilant with the pipe.

446
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,760
That's right.

447
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:24,300
That like, you know, a good pilot should go down first, right?

448
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,420
Absolument, mon general.

449
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:32,800
But Bob is ever vigilant to make sure the pipe is always still smoking, you know?

450
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,480
So he's got to have it close by all the time.

451
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,040
Or it's got to have him close by.

452
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,960
It's got to have him close by to materialize him.

453
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,920
They are so close that you can't really say which is pushing and which is pulling.

454
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,740
Where the universe ends and, you know, begins and is thrust through in a, like, a...

455
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:56,840
But it is right there at that point, you know, because that is the nature of the supernatural.

456
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,920
We can't answer too much.

457
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,500
This is an unpaid question, but it is true what you're pointing out.

458
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,980
So I guess that is the answer to this is true.

459
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,260
Yes.

460
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:07,900
Okay.

461
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,480
All right.

462
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,620
T, not F.

463
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,200
You have to go a little deeper now.

464
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,380
There's less questions.

465
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,500
You can go to the next one.

466
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:19,500


467
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:19,500


468
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,620
So I sit down on the couch.

469
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,500
It was really soft and smooth and I liked it there.

470
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,760
It was so nice.

471
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,840
I couldn't believe it.

472
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:42,560
I just laughed and stand up for like days and days and days and days and days and shit.

473
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,980
It must have been weeks.

474
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,000
Now I was doing okay sitting there.

475
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,720
I was like, I'm going to go to the next one.

476
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:48,720


477
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:48,720


478
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:48,720


479
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,180
I'm doing real good now.

480
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,980
Oh, it felt fucking wonderful, dude.

481
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,060
Oh, I'm doing real good.

482
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,980
First, back to the question of underwater oil plumes with which we began this hour.

483
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,820
On the Today Show this morning, BP COO Bob Suttles would not concede their existence

484
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,520
even when presented with testimony from a government scientist.

485
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,820
Instead, Suttles defended his position by saying, quote, it may be down to how you define

486
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,040
what a plume is.

487
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,700
It is that kind of a thing.

488
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:18,700


489
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,240
It's a kind of evasion in the face of hard evidence, a hallmark of so many BP executives

490
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,500
in these past 51 days, which reminded us of another infamous flack.

491
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:32,060
Here now is the verbal swill from BP CEO Tony Hayward and his friends juxtaposed with a

492
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,120
guy named Bob.

493
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,460
Don't worry.

494
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,220
You'll recognize Bob.

495
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,780
They say Bob's behind the times.

496
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,320
They say Bob can't relate to the X generation.

497
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,220
Well, you know what Bob says to that?

498
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,720
To horse hockey.

499
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,000
Bob's here to set the record straight.

500
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,760
Bob has his finger on the pulse of American youth today.

501
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:57,260
If Bob was an old fart, could he pound this much Jagermeister this fast and not drop dead?

502
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,560
Unos.

503
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,320
Dos.

504
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,520
Drills.

505
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,500
Zubottles.

506
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,720
Bob's hip.

507
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,820
Bob's with the times.

508
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,140
Bob lives up on Capitol Hill, but he'd rather be in the mosh pit with you.

509
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,840
Bob knows what it's like to be young.

510
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,500
To be alienated.

511
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,880
Disenfranchised.

512
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,580
And hassled by the man.

513
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,040
Bob knows who the man is.

514
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,620
And Bob's not afraid to take the man on.

515
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,240
Running against the Democrats is a death trap.

516
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,860
It's a suicide rap.

517
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,840
We gotta get out while we're young and baby, Bob was born to run.

518
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,620
Run this country.

519
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,640
Can pop legend Peter Townsend do this anymore?

520
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,120
No.

521
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,300
He's finished.

522
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,800
Bob rocks.

523
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,480
Bob rocks.

524
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:46,480


525
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:46,480


526
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:46,880
He's a fucking ass.

527
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,340
Where are you going, baby?

528
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,120
Bastard.

529
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,660
Bitch.

530
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,560
Pig.

531
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,560
Whore.

532
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,720
Bob's gun turret can swivel faster and longer than any Republican since Ike.

533
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,080
Can flaccid Pat Buchanan say that?

534
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,860
Can limp Lamar Alexander pass muster?

535
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,900
Come on, baby.

536
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,280
It's time for another caucus.

537
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,440
Not again.

538
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,380
How many times?

539
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:16,980
Two times is enough.

540
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,300
Wouldn't you like to know?

541
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,040
Bob doesn't endorse extramarital sex, excessive drinking, or rock and roll.

542
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,120
The proceeding was for promotional purposes only.

543
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,520
Bob 96 presidential tour.

544
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,720
Get fooled again.

545
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:38,760
Bob.

546
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,240
Bob.

547
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,280
Bob.

548
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:40,980
Bob.

549
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,460
Bob.

550
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:41,880
Bob.

551
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:43,860
Bob.

552
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:43,860


553
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:43,860


554
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:43,860


555
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:43,860


556
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:43,860


557
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,780
97 8So what do we have now?

558
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,600
Okay now here's one of those questions that seems like it's a perpetual kind of a

559
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:55,620
Ask Doctor How question that comes from the base of individuals that wants to give

560
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,380
money that doesn't have an adequate question.

561
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,140
But here's an answer to that, it's so sad.

562
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,060
It is sad.

563
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,920
Because here's the question they ask Doctor How.

564
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,900
Let's have it.

565
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,240
What should I ask you?

566
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,460
Ah, yes.

567
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,960
Remember that question, Dr. Howell?

568
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,860
I remember it from so many seasons, so many seasons ago and so many recent seasons.

569
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,100
Yes, what should one ask?

570
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:27,380
When one has the opportunity to ask, and one can ask something gross, common, and ordinary,

571
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:34,960
something scatological, something humorous, something humorous, scatological, mythological, mythologico-scatological,

572
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,720
or one can ask of the very secrets of time and the cosmos itself.

573
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:47,620
What song the sirens sang, or the name Achilles used when he hid himself among women,

574
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:55,660
or who killed the toads in the rice that themselves ate the poppy coccolorum and the coccahupatrice.

575
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,360
My friend, you have missed it.

576
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,880
You missed this great opportunity by yourself, referential postmodern question,

577
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,440
but I don't think there was any money in there anyway.

578
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,620
Well, there might have been. I lost the...

579
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,060
I think there's some free-floating bills.

580
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,760
It might be floating around in the utterly wonderful realm of priestess Pisces.

581
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,060
There's some free-floating bills in here.

582
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,700
All right, well then I shall not assume that you attempted to short sheet Dr. Howell

583
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,720
without moving any other parts of my body.

584
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,800
Um, um, um, um, um, um...

585
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,000
Oh, you did?

586
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,180
Well, no.

587
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,840
Um, almost godlike orgies.

588
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,680
Just burger-eating wife sex.

589
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,880
Here's Pornos and the sex lives of the creatures on this planet.

590
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,800
Let me stay in the middle!

591
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,460
Sex!

592
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,440
Wasn't that fantastic?

593
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,240
Yeah, so what was this, in the 70s?

594
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:55,860
Um, well, uh, yeah, they, they, they, they thought it, well, I, well, uh, I, you know, I didn't know.

595
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,680
Um...

596
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,580
Thanks for being here.

597
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,240
Um...

598
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,240
Okay, Dr. Howell, this is a good question.

599
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,300
Very well.

600
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,500
How did dinosaurs make babies?

601
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,880
Babies?

602
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,380
How did they make babies, Dr. Howell?

603
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

604
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,840
Okay, all right, calm down. We're gonna have the answer.

605
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,120
It's that bad boy on the spike again.

606
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,060
How did dinosaurs make babies? Is that it?

607
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,500
That's the question, Dr. Howell.

608
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,120
How did dinosaurs make babies?

609
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,260
Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth.

610
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,640
Uh, I think we can all agree on that.

611
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,000
There were lizards, kind of like, did they lay eggs, or did they have...

612
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,620
They were ovaries.

613
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,200
Ovipo, vovipo, viviparous?

614
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,000
Ovipo, voviparous, yes.

615
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:13,260
They laid eggs, unless there were some, like the garter snake, and certain boas, most boas, bore their young alive, bored them to tears.

616
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,040
But then they took care of the little chappies.

617
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:23,980
However, this is all somewhat by the board, although I shall return to it in the course of time.

618
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,060
Uh...

619
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,160
The question is, how did dinosaurs make babies?

620
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,080
Not how did they make little dinosaur chicks, but how did they make babies?

621
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,080
Human babies.

622
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,080
And generally they did so by getting out of the way.

623
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:47,760
By turning turtle, by dying, with their feet sticking up straight, with their characteristic three toes clenched in a gesture of ultimate surrender.

624
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,260
Because it was only after these giant reptiles passed away that, uh,

625
00:29:54,260 --> 00:30:06,280
our own antecedents and ancestors could develop enough to generate or decant the first squalling human infant.

626
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:16,540
Now, this was more direct than you might think, because the primate order was represented in the Mesozoic era.

627
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:22,040
You might think this early-er primate looked something like a little scrambling rat.

628
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:26,140
And maybe you'd be right, because there was a certain similarity.

629
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,260
Similarity caused by a process we know as convergent evolution.

630
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,140
Convergent evolution should always be factored into evolutionary theory.

631
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,380
Without thinking of it, one can make mistakes.

632
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:46,300
Particularly since classical paleontology is being overwhelmed by the cladistic science,

633
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,380
where data is fed into computers,

634
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,100
and a mathematical preponderance is considered to be the answer.

635
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:59,720
This has led many investigators into a sucking, boggy swamp of error.

636
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:06,860
Chasing foolish fires away into ultimate incomprehensibility,

637
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,040
and the degradation of what was once a noble scientific endeavor.

638
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,600
So, back to dinosaurs and the care of their own young.

639
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,500
Well, they did.

640
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,600
They did their best.

641
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,740
To bring them up right.

642
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,260
Do we know this because of the avian similarity of dinosaurs?

643
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,080
Partly.

644
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,200
We know birds raise the chicks in the nest and feed them.

645
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,840
So did the primitive ornithischians,

646
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,700
discovered by Dr. John Horner,

647
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,340
who shouldn't be entirely trusted,

648
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,700
but sure enough, they did.

649
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:45,280
In vast, communist-like breeding, brooding sites,

650
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,480
take care of hordes of,

651
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,680
tiny dinosaurs.

652
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,740
If they stepped on one every now and then,

653
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,660
they were very sorry.

654
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:59,500
Today, alligators and crocodiles also take good care of their young.

655
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,380
We'll carry them in their mouths without eating them,

656
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,420
unless they are exceptionally forgetful,

657
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,860
and in all ways behave as model parents.

658
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,240
Thus, the other side of the dinosaurian origin,

659
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,020
the one which is shredded in mystery,

660
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,420
but reflected in the ancient crurotarsals,

661
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,220
or early archosaur-like reptiles,

662
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,960
given that strange name because of a skeletal peculiarity

663
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,080
of the ankle bone which so identifies them.

664
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,020
Back in the days of the great red sandstone,

665
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,020
and even earlier in the misty jungles,

666
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,520
when it was never all that certain whether the amphibians

667
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,980
or the reptiles would prevail through the annoying,

668
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,740
and apparently endless age of giant insects,

669
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,200
which took forever to get out of the way.

670
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,740
When it did, our planet changed permanently,

671
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,020
so insects can no longer be giant.

672
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,060
But other things could and did,

673
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,780
and these were those famous reptiles.

674
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,420
It was only when their bloated bulks

675
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,620
were finally booted from the stage,

676
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,880
that the humus could ultimately rise to the top

677
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,960
of the squirming, swarming mammalian heap,

678
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,540
and start producing rugrats.

679
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,600
Incidentally, mammals existed long before dinosaurs

680
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,880
came on the scene, and were suppressed,

681
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:28,380
held down from radiating into all the juicy evolutionary niches

682
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,540
by these self-same dinosaurs,

683
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:36,400
which did it so well that there wasn't really much larger

684
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,060
than a poodle around for millions of years

685
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,380
on the mammalian side of the ledger.

686
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,840
Thanks for your question.

687
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,080
Alright, thanks Dr. Howe.

688
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,020
Traffic Bureau.

689
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,720
17th of 03 PM.

690
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,500
It didn't look too good.

691
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,440
Complaint board, please.

692
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,380
Right.

693
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,600
Right.

694
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,360
I've been involved in a shooting.

695
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,300
You okay?

696
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,940
I'm at a laundrette.

697
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:11,840
What's the story?

698
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,100
I just shot Bob.

699
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,220
I commend you.

700
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:14,620
Thank you.

701
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,400
But he got away.

702
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,300
I see.

703
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,540
Yeah, Bob.

704
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,460
He seemed fine.

705
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,480
He looked like a man who enjoys pulling the trigger.

706
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,020
Sometimes it's part of the job.

707
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,120
Oh, we understand that.

708
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:23,760
No, sir.

709
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,120
Yes, sir.

710
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,520
No, sir.

711
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:24,840
Yes, sir.

712
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:24,920


713
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,140
Yes, sir.

714
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:25,880
Yes, sir.

715
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:26,820
Yes, sir.

716
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,140
Yes, sir.

717
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,480
Yes, sir.

718
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:27,480


719
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:27,480


720
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:27,480


721
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:27,480


722
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:27,480


723
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:27,480


724
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:27,820
Yes, sir.

725
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,200
Yes, sir.

726
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:35,720
You really care a lot about that guy.

727
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:35,720


728
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:35,720


729
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,800
It gets really quiet here where the caller joins us.

730
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,720
I know what you're thinking.

731
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,500
Did he fire six shots or only five?

732
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,120
Please do tell me what I'm thinking right now.

733
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,020
Well, to tell you the truth and all the excitement, I kind of lost track myself.

734
00:34:54,260 --> 00:35:01,620
But seeing that this is a .44 Magnum, the world's most powerful handgun, it can blow

735
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,020
your head clean off.

736
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,180
You can ask yourself a question.

737
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,560
question.

738
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,180
Do you feel

739
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,500
horny?

740
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,800
No, actually, that was not the question.

741
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,840
Yeah, no, it's actually, do you want to do the Pacific

742
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,240
elections?

743
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,540
Yeah, wrong question. Yeah, no,

744
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,960
right question, wrong universe.

745
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,780
It's a right question at some time, but

746
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,660
at this time, it's the wrong

747
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,800
question. How do you know?

748
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,740
It's all about the

749
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,820
timing, man. Ah.

750
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,880
Oh, okay, let's call him.

751
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,700
Damn, damn, damn.

752
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,820
Let's call it down.

753
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,540
Hello?

754
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,640
The thing that you have told me

755
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,460
that they formed, they did it, but the customer

756
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,340
stood tired. Well, uh,

757
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,860
yes, yes, uh.

758
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,640
You take this and give it to him.

759
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,900
Yes, yes, yes. Very well.

760
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:14,440
Well, I don't know if that concludes

761
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,780
our, uh, question. No, he seems

762
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,920
to... There's still plenty in there.

763
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,300
All right. Keep a-fishing,

764
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,440
Philo. Because

765
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,540
after all, uh, however boring

766
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,480
this may seem, it's for radio, and it can be

767
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,020
edited by Reverend Stang.

768
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,360
I got them all here. You got them all?

769
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,680
I got them all. I'm gonna stack them up here.

770
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,680
Okay, uh... Okay, now this is

771
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,720
what we'll call the, uh,

772
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,460
this next three questions will be

773
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,780
like the lightning round.

774
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,040
We call it the speed round. Speed round.

775
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,420
Generally, we play the speed round music. I don't know.

776
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,280
But we could do it. Yeah, yeah.

777
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,780
It's just fast music, and then I answer

778
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,400
them real fast, and that's what we do.

779
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,900
Okay. Since chimps

780
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,700
now use tools, when will

781
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,800
they master politics?

782
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,140
They already have.

783
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,400
They already have. All right. Okay.

784
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,780
What is

785
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,480
the square root of

786
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,960
the isosceles

787
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,340
right triangle, that

788
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,200
one triangle? Remember that one?

789
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,500
That would be one side

790
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,460
of the triangle. One side

791
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,460
of the triangle would be the square root of

792
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,840
the, isn't it the, uh, hypotenuse?

793
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,640
That is the square of the opposite

794
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,600
two sides. Oh, the hypotenuse.

795
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:24,920
Yeah.

796
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,180
That gives me the...

797
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,540
What sort of sickness am I

798
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,260
going to get from doc

799
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,340
frop teabagging my schwin?

800
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,020
Stingray.

801
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,540
A terrible

802
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,460
condition known as

803
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,760
Sherman's disease.

804
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
However, there is hope for

805
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,000
Sherman's sufferers, and

806
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,640
I'll accept

807
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,020
a consultation on that. Wait a minute.

808
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,220
You're sitting on that schwin, that stingray.

809
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,440
As schlick as a schwin.

810
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,900
That schwin

811
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,500
teabag. Did you wash it?

812
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,960
Okay, good.

813
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,400
Let us hope so.

814
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,720
I have to go to the bathroom. Don't make me think about it.

815
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,280
I don't want to think about that.

816
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,480
And one of the demons is,

817
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,260
one of the demons that will arise is

818
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,340
preschool, no, daycare demon.

819
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,380
Like, huh?

820
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,720
How come they

821
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,660
have friends? I go to the bathroom

822
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,360
or something like that and recover for a while.

823
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,400
Oh my god. And then

824
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,880
they're coming from you, completely stupidly.

825
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,180
And you just dummy up

826
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,900
to feeling like they screwed you.

827
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,800
And by the way, that bathroom thing is really important

828
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,480
for number one.

829
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,360
Karma. That's a demon, okay?

830
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,160
Money from a pension. Dollar. Money. Dollar.

831
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,100
Money. Then. The dollar. Dollar.

832
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:06,740
Money. Now.

833
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,480
Income.

834
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,220
What the hell is wrong

835
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,160
with them? That's the

836
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,640
question.

837
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,240
That's a good question. What the hell is wrong with them,

838
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:18,920
Dr. Howell?

839
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,300
They're still asleep. They're still sleeping.

840
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,680
Hmm.

841
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,440
They just need to wake up

842
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,320
and notice that they're

843
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,060
hurtling over a cliff onto a

844
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:30,540
field of upright knives.

845
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:34,180
We're down to the second to the last question.

846
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,260
Oh, this is appropriate for the...

847
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,480
We're starting to get really philosophical here.

848
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,920
Alright, let's... What is

849
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,820
it?

850
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,560
In quotes.

851
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,280
What is it?

852
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,920
It is the

853
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:51,920
answer.

854
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,100
You know. It is the

855
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:54,940
real

856
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,240
subject.

857
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,260
The subject of that sentence

858
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,400
is not what.

859
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,260
It is what.

860
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,460
It is what.

861
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:04,580
It is what.

862
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,160
It is.

863
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,960
And for a subgenius,

864
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,920
it is what lies at the end.

865
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,320
We speak of the end

866
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,400
here as though

867
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,380
it were boarding the escape

868
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,640
vessels of the space

869
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,860
goddesses, so-called.

870
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,860
I wish I had time to

871
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,300
explain that particular delusion.

872
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,060
But

873
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,540
this is just the beginning.

874
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,120
The beginning of a lengthy

875
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,080
journey. Assiduous readers

876
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,360
of Revelation X,

877
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,380
the Bob Apocryphon, may have noticed

878
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,880
the entire itinerary is planned out,

879
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,800
starting from the landing,

880
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,900
the process at the port authority building,

881
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,940
and so forth and so on.

882
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,840
Ultimately, by ascending through multiple universes,

883
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,040
you get to it.

884
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,200
You arrive at the punchline.

885
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,560
The punchline of the joke.

886
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,560
This is what we're all traveling toward.

887
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,400
What we all hope to receive.

888
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:04,460


889
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:04,460


890
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,720
And attend.

891
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,340
So we will not be it.

892
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,440
And that's

893
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,520
it.

894
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,160
All right. Thanks, Dr. Howell.

895
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,600
Sure thing, Father.

896
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,080
And now, from PR News in Washington,

897
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,580
I'm the 10th in 11 months, but not by much.

898
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,200
President Obama says

899
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,900
residents and workers are already

900
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,040
radioactive off the Atlantic coast.

901
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,140
He says cesium-137

902
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,000
is more dangerous than tritium.

903
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,120
He was talking to BSTV.

904
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,780
The National Guard troops say

905
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,200
this is

906
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:34,720
PR news.

907
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,080
PR's bad.

908
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,000
Forecasters say the worst is yet to come.

909
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,120
I didn't know.

910
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,440
That's good news.

911
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,080
Weather is keeping 46 Koreans from searching

912
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,640

00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,180
From Seoul, Cao Dixi, Duoltao reports

914
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,240
South Korea sank last week.

915
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,380
Seoul went down five days ago

916
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,100
after falling unconscious during a rescue mission.

917
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,160
Vermont's Health Department says tests show

918
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,040
presence of PR News in Washington.

ashod device

920
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:14,460


921
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:14,460


922
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,700
participated

923
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:17,960
in developing bas Michaela

924
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:17,960


925
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,600
has a

926
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:23,960
test

927
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,060
house

928
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,060


929
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,060


930
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,380
happened at

931
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,900
Well, fish around and Pisces bought us some more.

932
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,220
She's already fished it all out.

933
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,460
Oh, well, all right then.

934
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,760
Well, one never knows.

935
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,800
That was a free answer.

936
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,920
Okay, here it is.

937
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,240
Here's the final and last question.

938
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,000
We saved the best for last.

939
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,080
All righty.

940
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,560
What does a booger smell like?

941
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:04,380
And the second part, how do you know?

942
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:11,460
You know, someone is attempting to trap me here

943
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,600
in the heresy of Janerism,

944
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,740
which is very difficult not to answer,

945
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,820
and to answer properly,

946
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,360
and is a heresy even to mention,

947
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,820
so I have to drop this.

948
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,900
But I just wanted to point out,

949
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,480
I'm not going to be entrapped in that standard way

950
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,700
talking about how you can't run from your own legs and all that stuff.

951
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,780
You can't bite your own teeth.

952
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,500
Yeah, right.

953
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,700
So you can't smell your own booger.

954
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,620
You can't watch your head.

955
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,680
How are you going to watch your head?

956
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,040
But that is incorrect, because you can.

957
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,580
So a booger can smell like anything then,

958
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,620
is what you're saying, right?

959
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,780
Well, the problem is...

960
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,280
And who would know?

961
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,560
Who would dispute it?

962
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,720
The discrete mass of useless tissue,

963
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,600
former living self,

964
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,580
has a life cycle, if you want to call it that,

965
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,300
of its own,

966
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,860
and will indeed, ultimately,

967
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,440
after the necessary separation and extraction,

968
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:15,240
reach a point where it may be sensed with anyone,

969
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,300
with even rudimentary olfactory equipment.

970
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:24,940
And this is when the purported booger is overripe,

971
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,180
has been too long since,

972
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,320
having been decanted.

973
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,320
This is when it has a smell.

974
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,000
But ideally, of course, it should not smell,

975
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,120
because ideally it should be a comfortable,

976
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,520
friendly, familiar thing,

977
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,860
so recently part of you,

978
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,080
so recently sundered from you,

979
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,960
that one cannot help but feel a little bit of solicitude,

980
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,580
even as one casts it off,

981
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,360
as part of the necessary business

982
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,560
of going about one's life

983
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,140
and separating that which is used up

984
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,780
from that which may,

985
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,320
yet, be employed for some useful,

986
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,640
even, in some cases,

987
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,100
nutritive purpose.

988
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,540
So, there you go.

989
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,120
Okay, that's the end of our question and answer period.

990
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,100
And you know, the Ask Dr. Howell show very often descends

991
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,680
to lengthy discussion of farts and boogers and things like that.

992
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,380
This is because of the way humans generally frame the questions.

993
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:49,100
And I should say, Stephen,

994
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:49,600
I actually hoquiera'ed that.

995
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:49,600


996
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:49,600


997
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:49,600


998
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:49,600


999
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:49,600


1000
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:49,600


1001
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:50,440
So, obviously!

1002
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:50,440


1003
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:50,500
for your morning.

1004
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:50,500


1005
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:58,060
out to a tabii day after milking but to sell and punch someça perven shouting,

1006
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:58,160
whilst...

1007
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,880
People are scum, you men, and he sucks how you care about your neighbors.

1008
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,800
Who he fucks, I know about you.

1009
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,860
You think you're tough snot deep in your heart.

1010
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,760
You know you're not.

1011
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,720
You're just like the next guy, full of shit.

1012
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,820
You know it's true, but you can't face it.

1013
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,640
Just like you and the crap that you spew in your high-minded tripe makes me want to puke.

1014
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,500
Think about you, what you think about me.

1015
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
I'm king of the scum because that's all I can see.

1016
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,100
But I love you anyway.

1017
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,060
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1018
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:34,060
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1019
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,960
People are scum and humanity sucks.

1020
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:51,100
All you care about your neighbor is who he fucks.

1021
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,340
Yes, I know about.

1022
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,880
You think you're tough snot deep in your heart.

1023
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,740
You know you're not.

1024
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,700
You're just like the next guy, full of shit.

1025
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,660
You know it's true, but you can't face it.

1026
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:14,580
Just like you and the crap that you spew in your high-minded tripe makes me want to puke.

1027
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,380
I think about you, what you think about me.

1028
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,400
King of the scum because that's all I can see.

1029
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:52,520
I'm king of the scum.

1034

There was a string of collages by the great subgenius graphic and audio artist

1035
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,540
known as Heart Ignition.

1036
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:27,140
And collages by The Large.

1037
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:32,520
Coming up, The Large, Lee Murr, Dr. Howe, Puzzling Evidence, and The End.

Fun Bobby, your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?

1077
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:31,880
Yeah.

1078
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,840
You know more than one Fun Bobby?

Slightly over a year ago, smart teens came into existence.

Ladies and gentlemen, next week most of you will think for a moment of the next week.

1098
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,240
Hello, Dorothy.

1099
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,540
Hello, Dorothy.

1100
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,260
Dorothy?

1101
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:04,940
Dorothy?

1102
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,760
He's just saying those things without proof.

1103
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,340
Oh, well.

1104
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,440
Dorothy, get on the phone right away.

1105
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,100
Dorothy?

1106
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,020
With a bottle.

1107
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,840
All right.

1108
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,840
That isn't the real Dorothy.

1109
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,100
dinon.

1110
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:36,420

00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:41,460
This time, I'm Hammer.

1112
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:41,460


1113
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:41,460


1114
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:41,460


1115
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:41,460


1116
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,300
Don't worry.

1117
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:42,620
I'm a girl.

1118
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:42,620


1119
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:42,740
I speak as you've been told!

1120
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:42,740


1121
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:44,920
ensies.

partrarata.nerV

1123
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:46,440


1124
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:46,540
No problem!

1125
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,040
Do you.

1126
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,480
I'm coming.

1127
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:47,020
Everybody's supposed to be last...

1128
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,380
toothsome models for the cheesecake shots he wants to arrange

1129
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,900
with the special J.R. Bob Dobbs jacket

1130
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:00,240
worn or semi-worn by these models

1131
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,240
in the idealized setting that

1132
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,980
he has formulated. Please don't hesitate to talk to him about that.

1133
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:12,020
And more fun will be projected and

1134
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:16,040
broadcast from the Rushwood stage. At this time, the Ask Dr. Hal show goes off

1135
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,560
the air. The final poem comes from Percy Shelley,

1136
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,840
one of our favorites. Worlds on worlds

1137
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,880
are turning over from creation to decay. Like

1138
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,080
the bubbles on a river, sparkling, bursting,

1139
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,940
born away. But they are still immortal

1140
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:39,720
who through birth's orient portal and death's dark

1141
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:44,080
chasm, hurrying to and fro, clothe their eternal flight

1142
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,640
in the brief dust and light gathered around their chariots

1143
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,580
as they go. New shapes they still may weave.

1144
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,980
New laws, new gods receive.

1145
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:59,580
Bright or dim are they as the robes they last

1146
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,820
on death's bare ribs had cast.

1147
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,260
A power from the unknown god, a Promethean

1148
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:11,880
conqueror came. Like a triumphal path, he trod the thorns

1149
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,380
of death and shame.

1150
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:21,080
mortal shape to him were as the vapor dim which the orient planet animates with light hell sin

1151
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:30,840
and slavery came like bloodhounds mild and tame nor prayed until their lord had taken flight

1152
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:40,760
the moon of muhammad arose and it shall set as while blazoned on heaven's immortal noon

1153
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:49,680
the cross leads generations on swift as the radiant shapes of sleep from one whose dreams

1154
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:59,200
are paradise fly when the fond wretch wakes to weep and day peers forth with her blank eyes

1155
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:09,520
so sweet so faint so fair the powers of earth and air fled from the folding star of bethlehem

1156
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,680
apollo

1157
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:21,760
pan and love and even olympian jove grew weak for killing truth had glared on them our hills and seas

1158
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:30,440
and streams dispeopled of their dreams their waters turned to blood their dues to tears

1159

There's no words.

1180
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,700
There's no words.

00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:17,560
Later.

1182
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,980

Go, Colin, go.

1184
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,240
You've got to live now.

1185
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:26,340
Go, voodoo, and do your things that they do.

1186
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:28,660
Now stay tuned.

1187
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,100
Hooray for everything.

1188
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,460
Don't forget to...

1189
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,280
Yay, says the call.

00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,400

And my dear, before you late.

1193

I put my arms around his neck.

1194
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,140
He is quiet.

1195
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,020
Not bad for a space plane.

1196
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,680
A whisper of evil.

1197
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,260
Evil.

1198
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:02,940
They're neat.

1199
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:03,560
Yes.

1200
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,020
But they're neat with teeth.

1201
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:06,960
Yes.

1202
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:07,920
They've become...

1203
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,000
An undiscovered swamp species with turns fingers.

1204
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,040
Jesus Christ.

1205
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:12,480

Stop.

1232
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:40,680
