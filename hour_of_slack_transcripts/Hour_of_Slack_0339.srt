1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,280
Come, fly the teeth of the wind, share my wings.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,180
You know, of course, that you are living in a power age.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,740
What are you doing with it?

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,440
I call this power TNT because it is dynamite.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,320
Use it rightly, and it can bring you anything you want.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,560
Use it wrongly, and it can eventually produce for you what you don't want.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,500
But you cannot get away from this power.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,260
Just listening to what I'm telling you now can be the turning point in your life.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:35,940
Yes.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,680
Join us now as we rocket away out of normal time into showtime

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,380
with your favorite horrifying horror host, Mobius Rex.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,980
And you'll hear the voices of puzzling evidence, Gary G. Bofram,

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,060
live in a cast of thousands more.

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,740
It's mysterious, evil, spooky, eerie, creepy, wacky, kooky, fun.

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,640
It's the subgenius.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,280
Power of the Watch.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,860
And here we've got the brains of the whole operation.

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,560
The faster the signal goes out from here to the satellite,

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,440
we bump it out all over the world.

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,160
Pretty fancy, huh?

21
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,420
Not too flaky with it myself.

22
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,520
Thank you, Pentagon.

23
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,520
You're welcome to board.

24
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,200
Spell satellite program.

25
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,540
Welcome potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

26
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,260
Bob?

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,540
Bob?

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,020
Bob?

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,700
Your message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

30
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,460
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,120
sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius,

32
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,360
with Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,440
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

34
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,940
Before the sermon,

35
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,240
before the sermon,

36
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,880
before the sermon,

37
00:01:59,880 --> 00:01:59,960
before the sermon,

38
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


42
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


43
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


44
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,980
before the sermon,

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,340
A message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack, and saint of saints.

46
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,500
You're buying time.

47
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,480
Time, friends.

48
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,080
Time.

49
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,600
All the time.

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,780
Mr. Moneybags.

51
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,260
He's paying a salary.

52
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,420
A salary.

53
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,720
He throws in a hundred bucks a week, and consequently, I can't preach against drinking

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,020
because his icebox is full of beer.

55
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,280
I hope he's talking about you, my friend.

56
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,920
Pay us to fill our beer.

57
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,540
Iceboxes with beer.

58
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,260
I have to let him out for 15 minutes between Sunday school and worship service,

59
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
so then go out and light up a Chesterfield or something.

60
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,220
What kind of Jesus smoke, friends?

61
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,200
It's time to open your heart.

62
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,340
Close your mind and zip your lips and bend over

63
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,500
because you're about to receive the word.

64
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,480
I heard of Bob.

65
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,280
Well, of Bob?

66
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,320
Of Bob.

67
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,780
Ah, yes, dear, dear friends, Hour of Slack listeners.

68
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,100
This is a special message I'm making to you.

69
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,100
To you.

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,880
To explain what this particular segment of the show is all about.

71
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,060
Now, as you may have suspected,

72
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,980
the Hour of Slack is actually produced in the gleaming, futuristic, mechanized metroplex

73
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,700
of Bob.

74
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,080
Dallas, Texas.

75
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,620
And the specially edited holy tapes are prepared

76
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,740
at the Subgenius Foundation skyscraper headquarters

77
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,660
on, well, on church equipment.

78
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,780
And then the show is ranted and the tapes played live

79
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,920
at the studios of a little station called KNON,

80
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,240
a public-supported station, dear friends,

81
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,180
a station run by a bunch of weird geeks and hippies

82
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,700
and rednecks.

83
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,260
And weirdos and religious nuts out of this haunted house

84
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,300
in the scariest neighborhood in town.

85
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,500
And then the tape of that is sent to your local station

86
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,760
at a very low cost with all the local Dallas and Fort Worth information edited out.

87
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,880
Sometimes we have to edit out more than usual.

88
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,700
Because, you see, the Hour of Slack depends on this day and time.

89
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,440
Dallas station, KNON, and K-NON depends on listener support,

90
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,520
which is drummed up, as you might guess, by pledge drives.

91
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,820
In fact, one in every 6.5 Hour of Slack shows is a pledge drive show,

92
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,000
which you non-Texas listeners do not hear.

93
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,980
For, uh, on pledge drive shows, we say the Dallas phone number over and over

94
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,680
and beg, threaten, and wheedle for money.

95
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,960
And generally act like the ordinary run-of-the-mill Christian evangelist.

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,180
And these are some of our very best shows,

97
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,980
but we don't normally send them out of town

98
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,520
because, well, they're idiots.

99
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,180
You know, pinks might get the wrong idea about their local station

100
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,700
and might get to dialing that number, which in Dallas reaches us.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,140
But in your town might reach some poor innocent old lady

102
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,680
who doesn't know what to do.

103
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,900
And since she might be a little old subgenius lady,

104
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,940
we don't want to pester her needlessly.

105
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,720
So, usually when we do pledge drive shows in Dallas,

106
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,560
we just send out old show tapes to the affiliate stations.

107
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,240
I mean, after all, this one is show number 339,

108
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,580
and nobody but a few Dallasites ever heard the first 150.

109
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:05,620
But in this case, we had a very special guest for our pledge drive show.

110
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,700
Dr. G. Gordon Gordon, Bob Dobbs' personal bodyguard

111
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,660
and master of the Dobbstown 2 and 3 compounds in South America.

112
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,140
And, well, it's just such a statement on televangelism and all, you might say,

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,280
that I decided to go ahead and send out this show

114
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,680
only to the Dallas community.

115
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,120
Only with the phone numbers and certain other things edited out.

116
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,900
Therefore, what you are about to hear

117
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,040
is an edited version of a Dallas pledge drive show

118
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,180
intercut with an older hour of slack show

119
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,460
also starring G. Gordon Gordon as guest expert.

120
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,220
Praise Bob, let there be slack.

121
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:50,780
Huh!

122
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,080
Uh, yes, dear friends, and thanks to those who pledged in last week's pledge drive show,

123
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,360
which, by the way, is not played on the sister and brother stations

124
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,540
to which we send the tapes of the show for later replay.

125
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,400
Well, let's put on some, like, churchly music.

126
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,520
There we go, and we'll bring it up.

127
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,240
Ah, yes.

128
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,460
It's perfect music for a pledge drive.

129
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:19,500
A lovely pledge drive on the hour of slack.

130
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,880
Ah, yes, and I know that you are good, good, good friends

131
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,240
or are going to want to...

132
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,320
You're going to...

133
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,660
You're welcome this time, this chance

134
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:36,640
to give unto Bob Dobbs that which is Bob's.

135
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,000
And we know that you're going to do it of your own free will.

136
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,900
That's right, friends.

137
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,660
And we won't have to sack Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

138
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,180
I don't want to have to come looking for you

139
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,540
to make sure that you fulfill those pledges that you make to this station.

140
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,880
Anybody can call up and say,

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,260
Oh, yes, I pledge.

142
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,920
I'll give my money to Dobbs and K-N-O-N.

143
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,960
Oh, yeah, here you have put me down for a million dollars.

144
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,100
And when time comes for that check to arrive,

145
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,580
does it ever arrive?

146
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,900
No, dear friends,

147
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,240
because you either sobered up or you got scared

148
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,780
and you didn't pledge.

149
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,360
Oh, they believe in faith, not works.

150
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,620
Faith is enough for some of these, dear friends.

151
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,180
Do you wear designer jeans?

152
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,060
Do you feel like in your teens?

153
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,260
Are you more than a man of means?

154
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,200
Is everything less than rough?

155
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,280
Are you middle class enough?

156
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,880
Are youcor概?

157
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,380
Tell me, Ranch.

158
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,440


159
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,980
Yes,ou.

160
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,360
You know that 在這елоまで

161
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,360


162
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,980
I'll always be your friend.

163
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,460
No I'll never be

164
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,400
But you're dead as a beaver hat.

165
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,720
But you're dead as a beaver hat.

166
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,260
But you're dead as a beaver hat. But you're dead as beaver hat. But you're dead as a hold jelly beaver hat. But you're dead as a beaver hat. But you're dead as a beaver hat. But you're dead as a bea-

167
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,280
beaver hat. But you're dead as a

168
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,100
beaver hat. And why

169
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,440
look at these lovely ministers

170
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,180
manning the phone banks. They're standing by

171
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,060
with a bank of phones, friends,

172
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,440
waiting for your pledge. Ah, yes, there's

173
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,940
another faithful

174
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,960
flock member. Look at that.

175
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,020
Look at those. All those operators

176
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,340
tied up. Look at that. Look at those numbers

177
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,180
going around, Reverend Stank. Can you

178
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,500
believe that? Look at that.

179
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,100
Why, that big thermometer

180
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,340
thing is just... We started it.

181
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,180
Of course, we have to raise a thousand

182
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,000
dollars tonight.

183
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,220
Dear friends... A thousand?

184
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,260
A thousand dollars? What is that? That's just

185
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,240
not even a weekend in Las Vegas,

186
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,200
friends. That's two pledge drives worth

187
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,080
for us. Unless we manage to get all the money

188
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,200
tonight, then we won't have to do this again next

189
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,100
week. It'll just be back to the pure

190
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,160
dogma. The pure... The pure

191
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,940
essence of the church, yes.

192
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,180
Not this hard commercial side that's

193
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,140
required for us to bring this

194
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,920
word of Dobbs to you, friends.

195
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,960
You think this comes for free? We hate

196
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,020
to have to act like Christians. We really

197
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,840
do. And sit here and beg for money.

198
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,680
Let's get it over with quick. Call that number

199
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,020
and help us smash the false

200
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,500
cults who have

201
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,720
whole radio stations that belong to

202
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,520
them. We only have one hour.

203
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,100
All we've got is this one hour of slack,

204
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,860
friends, to raise that money

205
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,800
to keep the word of

206
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,220
Dobbs broadcasting

207
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,720
through the air. But you know,

208
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,920
like the ladies say,

209
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,640
when it comes to the hour of slack,

210
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,900
if you're listening, you'll soon...

211
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,860
be glistening. That's right.

212
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,940
And I know that

213
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,720
you don't want to miss us.

214
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,840
Think how you'd miss

215
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,960
hearing the word of Bob and Connie

216
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,740
Dobbs on the radio

217
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,300
every Sunday night to

218
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,920
bolster you, make you ready to go face

219
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,860
that mundane world

220
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,740
of the others on

221
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,940
Monday morning. Friends, we've been

222
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,840
your support system long enough.

223
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,900
We've been here. We've

224
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,400
always been here for you,

225
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,680
generating that slack you need.

226
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,640
But now, now, well,

227
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,820
it's the end times and even

228
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,940
Bob Dobbs is going to pay his electric

229
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,040
bill, or at least

230
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,660
part of it.

231
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,220
We're gonna think

232
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,400
you're insane.

233
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,760
These people want to

234
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,400
hypnotize us into

235
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,600
cutting their brains out with chainsaws.

236
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,320
I mean, I don't see how we're

237
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,960
responsible.

238
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,600
I swear.

239
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,940
It's Subgenius Bootcamp.

240
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,400
Drinking coffee and staying awake?

241
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,440
Stand up there.

242
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,580
Here, have some old Bob Cologne.

243
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,500
Do you call yourself a subgenius coming to drill

244
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,300
with a beard? That's two demerits.

245
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,000
Alright, Mr. Hughes.

246
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Three more demerits and I'll get that new baseball glove.

247
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,100
Look at the knees of your uniform pants.

248
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,620
That's disgusting. I'm docking you five more demerits,

249
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,060
Mr. Hughes.

250
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,360
What are you smiling about?

251
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,440
I hate Bob.

252
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,580
My Bob made

253
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,860
my daddy go crazy.

254
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,180
My daddy used to make money, but now he just sits around all day.

255
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,920
I hate Bob. He's a bad man. I wish he would die.

256
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,740
He's part of the conspiracy.

257
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,000
And they say, they say, oh, Bob, we, we love what you're preaching, Bob.

258
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,420
And we want to give you up our children.

259
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,200
We want to give you our minds.

260
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,700
We'll give you our cars and our homes.

261
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,920
And Bob says, well, I don't want your mind.

262
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,400
I don't want your kids, your home.

263
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,400
I want your money.

264
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,860
I want your money.

265
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:33,960
I want your money.

266
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,380
Pledge.

267
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,320
But that's when they go, oh, but we don't trust you that much, Bob.

268
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,700
Oh, no, we'd give you our brains or our kids, but not our money.

269
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,420
No, that money, that's too important to us.

270
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,980
You can get into our souls, Bob, but just stay out of our wallets.

271
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,480
That's what you're saying, isn't it?

272
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,000
But you know, when you give money to Bob, when you call that number,

273
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:00,260
it helps you to slide through the automatic sandpaper machines of justice and karma.

274
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,560
You know, when you die and go to heaven,

275
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,020
there's those two giant sandpaper machines ready to grind you down.

276
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,300
But when giving money to Bob slickens you up, it kind of greases you.

277
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,240
That's right, makes you glisten.

278
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,280
So you can glisten, you listen, you'll glisten.

279
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:16,680
That's right.

280
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,180
And you'll slide straight through that tunnel of white light.

281
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,800
With Mary a scratch upon your really incorporated form.

282
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,380
And when you get into that, when you get right up near the light,

283
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,360
that way, rather than getting stuck at the end of the tunnel,

284
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,740
pop right out into the before life.

285
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,440
And they don't have to snip the end of the tunnel.

286
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,160
It doesn't hurt.

287
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,920
So it greases you up.

288
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,460
It's like sliding to heaven.

289
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,040
It's like going down that chute at Wet n' Wild.

290
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,720
Pull the lever, down you go.

291
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,160
Just like the medicine fish hole, friends.

292
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,700
Well, actually, it's up you go.

293
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,220
I mean, we're talking about sliding up to heaven.

294
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:54,920
Well, that's true.

295
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,320
It may seem hot and stuffy.

296
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,240
It was really just a metaphor.

297
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,880
I mean, when you get to...

298
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,300
I wouldn't get picky about it.

299
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:02,740
I mean...

300
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:03,840
When you get to...

301
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:03,840


302
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:03,840


303
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,160
When you get to the subgenius heaven,

304
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,580
it may seem sort of hot.

305
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,580
Friends, just ignore everything.

306
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,080
With those flames around you.

307
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,160
Just pledge your money to that.

308
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,700
Just let him babble quietly in the background, friends.

309
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,960
And those guys with the tails, those are angels.

310
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,300
Money is what we need, friends.

311
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,240
Those things with the tails are angels.

312
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,540
And everything's fine.

313
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,300
It's a uniform.

314
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,140
That's what it is.

315
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,900
Keep the word of Bob going.

316
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,700
It's to scare the false Christian.

317
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:23,920
And to keep you going.

318
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Because when you put your money in dogs,

319
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,140
this is kind of a big joke down there.

320
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,760
They just want to scare the false Christians.

321
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,060
And your money flows towards Bob.

322
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,480
Oh, Lord.

323
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,640
Oh, I sinned.

324
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,240
I sinned.

325
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,220
I've gone to hell.

326
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,720
Flow out to you, friends.

327
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,520
Whereas the subgenius will go...

328
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,900
He'll say, well, I'm good.

329
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,900
I sinned enough.

330
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,060
I made it to hell.

331
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,940
I sinned enough.

332
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,780
Oh, yes.

333
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,740
Oh, yes, friends.

334
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,120
So send that money.

335
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,280
You've sinned enough.

336
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,740
You've had enough free show.

337
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,760
Now it's time to pay for a little of what we've been given.

338
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,960
You know, if you believers aren't giving money,

339
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,420
then all you're doing is believing.

340
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,680
That's all you're doing.

341
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,440
You're not committing yourself.

342
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,260
You're sure not calling.

343
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,960
That's right.

344
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,620
I don't see...

345
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,260
Willa Dobbs sitting there?

346
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,440
Sitting there, picking his head.

347
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,020
Yeah, I know.

348
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,080
And then Pope S. Cecilia, well, she's getting...

349
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
She's winking at us.

350
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,960
She's getting excited because she doesn't have you to talk to.

351
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,000
Talk to Pope S. Cecilia.

352
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,580
Call the number here.

353
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,480
And talk to the Reverend Trickster Shaman.

354
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,120
He's an evil, evil man.

355
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,420
He'll give you the creeps just talking to you.

356
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,220
Just...

357
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,140
Just...

358
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,140
And give these people your name and address.

359
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,940
And your credit card number.

360
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,600
Boy, what kind of a leaf of faith does that make?

361
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,280
What does that take, huh?

362
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,600
It would appear that the government at the moment

363
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,600
is practicing a lot of this religion in absentia for many folks.

364
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,820
It was a trendy thing.

365
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,500
We're actually the conspiracy...

366
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,620
You've always heard of the conspiracy, right?

367
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:51,960
Yeah.

368
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,780
Well, we're the conspiracy behind the conspiracy.

369
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,240
And we've decided to come out in the open.

370
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,380
You're the unnamed source.

371
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,500
That's us.

372
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,480
One of them.

373
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,080
Well, you've certainly heard of the Public Critanization Society.

374
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,460
Ask not what you can do for the conspiracy, friends.

375
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,760
Ask what the conspiracy can do for you and for KNON.

376
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,520
And Bob.

377
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,880
But you know what they're doing?

378
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,000
They're waiting for Bob to forgive them.

379
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,060
Then they're going to pay up.

380
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,400
They'll pay up one.

381
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,840
But Bob won't forgive them.

382
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,180
Because he doesn't think they've done anything they need or deserve to be forgiven for.

383
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,560
Bob won't even notice them if they haven't paid.

384
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,420
That's right, friends.

385
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,800
You won't get Bob's attention when the end times come and the saucers start to descend.

386
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,180
You haven't tithed.

387
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,760
If you tithe your $20, you're going to fry.

388
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,880
That's just the way it goes.

389
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,300
Oh, it's so beautiful to think of you frying.

390
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,520
All you pinks out there that have not tithed your money to Dobbs, you're sizzling right now.

391
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,220
You know, you can do a free tow in the skillet of Hades.

392
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,260
Yes, dear friends.

393
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,720
Sizzling and popping and screaming as your little soul bounces around that red hot sheet.

394
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,080
Oh, look at those phones.

395
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:03,840
Light up.

396
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,880
They're getting scared, Reverend Stank.

397
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,720
They're getting scared out there.

398
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,160
Bob's been giving it away, friends.

399
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,620
He's been giving it away for free, and you've probably been using it.

400
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:12,960
Spreading it around.

401
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,960
That's right.

402
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,120
But it's going to backfire on you.

403
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,160
It's all over.

404
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,740
The free ride's finished, friends.

405
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,960
The end times are near.

406
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,980
They're getting nearer with every second.

407
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,740
And every second that we're broadcasting in the red,

408
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,760
that means that we're going to have to pay more to Bob to negotiate for us when the end times come.

409
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,020
Every second we're paying in the red, that's another nail.

410
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:40,120
And you're back in hell if you haven't lined Bob's poor pocket with that love offering.

411
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,580
Just that small offering, friends.

412
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,860
$20, $30, $50.

413
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,860
A measly old cone.

414
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,520
You know, one of them pictures of Benjamin Franklin, friends.

415
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,960
Just put it in a plain brown envelope and write Bob, K-N-O-N, and mail it to us.

416
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:02,740
And when Bob notices you, that's when you're drawn into the matrix of the world.

417
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,160
A whirlpool of pure luck that surrounds Bob.

418
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,960
Bob is the singularity in the midst of the luck plane.

419
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,620
That's right.

420
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,340
All luck flows towards Bob.

421
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,280
It goes in his mouth through that pipe and goes out his...

422
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,020
Yes.

423
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,540
And we...

424
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,720
And that creates this vortex.

425
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,980
It's sort of a whirlpool.

426
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,000
You've seen those graphs of black holes.

427
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,880
Well, that's what it's like going in and out of Bob.

428
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,420
That's right.

429
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,360
And it's not like you're going to get sucked through Bob.

430
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,080
That's right.

431
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:42,740
You're just going to orbit Bob in that tiny knife edge where the luck plane falls into the essence of Bob.

432
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:48,460
And if you're lucky, if you've tithed enough, you'll be close enough for just the good luck to hit you.

433
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,040
That's right.

434
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,480
Stick to you.

435
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,180
But if you're out there orbiting, oh, far away on the distant edges of this great luck vortex...

436
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,520
You'll be buffeted by both kinds of luck.

437
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:57,860
Oh, yes.

438
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,980
Negative luck and positive luck.

439
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,040
Disruptive luck and slack luck.

440
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,160
That's right, friends.

441
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,360
Bad luck.

442
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,700
The evil luck.

443
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,640
The left-handed luck.

444
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,100
The dark luck.

445
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,580
Yes, friends.

446
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,220
So pledge that money.

447
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,880
If you can see fit.

448
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,840
And I ain't seeing very fit so far.

449
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,240
You know what?

450
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,140
I'm sick and tired of this stupid...

451
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,840
Church music.

452
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,620
Put some...

453
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,800
Maybe if we put some decent music...

454
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,720
Pull out that wallet, friends, because it is pledge drive time.

455
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,380
Yeah, no.

456
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,160
Not that one.

457
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,800
Here we go.

458
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,240
There we go.

459
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,700
Now you're energized.

460
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,720
Now you feel like you want to pull out that wallet.

461
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,260
You feel that check.

462
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,820
You feel that checkbook levitating off the table and moving towards you as you direct your will towards your ballpoint pen.

463
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,300
Yes.

464
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,620
Or your felt-tip pen.

465
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,220
We don't care.

466
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,300
Go for it.

467
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:41,860
Go for it.

468
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,360
Here we go.

469
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,520
Sign that check.

470
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,560
Reach out with that stubby index finger and dial that number.

471
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,880
Just write K-N-O-N on that line.

472
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,520
Pay to the order of, dear friends.

473
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,760
Pay to the order of.

474
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,000
Before the conspiracy orders you to spend it on something else like a cage, another bar on the...

475
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,360
Another nail in the coffin that you're building for yourself.

476
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,940
Life is a cage, friend.

477
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,840
That's right.

478
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,980
As long as you're helping them to build it.

479
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,920
But if you're helping us to feed the termites that eat away at that cage...

480
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,680
If you're helping us to slip you the grease that lets you slide between the bars of this cage...

481
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,840
You're investing in your own future, friend.

482
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,320
And the future of your own future descendants, dear friends.

483
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:30,860
That's right.

484
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,240
Help make the world genetic.

485
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,160
And make it genetically safe for you and your kind.

486
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,580
We can do it.

487
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,160
That's the thing.

488
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,360
That's why we're down here every week preaching to you.

489
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,440
We want to make sure you remember that it is possible.

490
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,260
We can triumph.

491
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,180
Your kind can win, bud.

492
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,720
If you understand only the hate and never the slack, then you're as pink as those pink boys.

493
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,420
You're just a pink Bobby if you don't believe the slack is possible.

494
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,200
If you can understand only the hate...

495
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,960
If you can understand only the hate and therefore pledge no money...

496
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,420
Fine.

497
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,080
I will remember you that way.

498
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,000
And not on the other hand.

499
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,900
But if you are one who can reach out and believe.

500
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,240
If you can truly, truly believe.

501
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,000
Yes, friends.

502
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,300
And prove your belief.

503
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,380
And if you're just one of those kind that sucks up that slack but can't be bothered to hate because,

504
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,660
Oh, I'm so full of slack.

505
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,040
I'm just so wonderfully smooth and level and balanced.

506
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,240
I don't want to fund their hating.

507
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,680
Why should I join up with a fringe group of extremists when I can get their slack without paying?

508
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,400
Well, friends.

509
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,320
That's over.

510
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,920
Bob will notice.

511
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,960
Bob knows.

512
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,040
Bob knows everything.

513
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,180
You can't hide from Dobbs.

514
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,800
You cannot hide from that man, Bob.

515
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,560
You cannot hide.

516
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,740
You cannot hide from Bob.

517
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,660
You can run.

518
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,180
Oh, yeah.

519
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,480
You can try to run.

520
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,120
You can hide.

521
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,300
But the man dressed in blue is on the inside.

522
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,740
And he's gonna know.

523
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,180
He's gonna make you hurt for passing up this chance to help Bob.

524
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,740
This is chance for your salvation.

525
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,260
We're not talking about much.

526
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,380
We're just talking about whether you're going to free yourself from this.

527
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:10,860
You're gonna fry painfully with every nerve in the surface and interior of your body hooked up to some vast cosmic yakatisma pain amplifier.

528
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,560
Is that what you want?

529
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,600
Do you really want the pain amplifier, fat man?

530
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,920
Do you want to be reduced to screaming nerve tissue?

531
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,300
Then don't pledge.

532
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,300
If that's what you want, don't pledge.

533
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,280
Don't subsidize the word of Dobbs.

534
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,260
And we'll just see how well you do come next day.

535
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,160
Yeah, go ahead.

536
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,360
If you want to be transformed into a pain cell the size of a snake.

537
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:31,440
You're gonna have to get that sun.

538
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,500
Oh, that's not no skin off a RT.

539
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,740
Oh, they'll arrange it for you.

540
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,140
That's not gonna chap my butt none, no, sir.

541
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,200
We'll just stand there and watch you twitch.

542
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,400
We'll watch you flip around.

543
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,420
We'll watch you scream.

544
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,340
I mean, there's enough of this kinder, gentler, subgenius church.

545
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,260
What is the point of a religion that mollycoddles the devil?

546
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:55,820
That's right.

547
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,120
Unless you're a Satanist, of course.

548
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,340
We are through with mollycoddling the devil.

549
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,180
We want your money.

550
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:05,820
We want to fight that devil. We want to bring that devil down. We want to take that conspiracy pyramid apart.

551
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:14,080
If you want the establishment of this kinder and gentler, Dobbs-administered way of life of a thousand dots of light,

552
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,620
then very well. Pledge your money. Because without your help, we can't do it alone.

553
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,640
We've done it alone for all these years, but now we're tired of doing it by ourselves.

554
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,760
We want to do it to somebody else.

555
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,760
And if we don't pay up, the Skull Bankers are going to do it to us.

556
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,160
The Skull Bankers are willing to, they're ready to cash in our chips.

557
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,320
That's right. And you know what they are? They're just like those guys you saw in that silly little Hollywood movie.

558
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,540
Them guys that collect that section of backbone, apart with all the crystals in it.

559
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,060
Yeah.

560
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,360
And there are darker and uglier things, my friend.

561
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,180
Yes.

562
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,660
Because?

563
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:10,740
Because only Bob can save us from the dark ones that inhabit the frigid, nonexistent regions of none space and none time and none entropy.

564
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:17,660
There is not none of nothing there in their hearts. No mercy for ye.

565
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:24,140
No regard for your petty woes and troubles. They want only your pain.

566
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,780
Your pain.

567
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,400
And they will collect your pain.

568
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,260
They want to feed on your pain.

569
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,820
They will administer things that will cause your pain to increase.

570
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:50,180
And when the level of your pain has reached a threshold that you feel that your very self, your fibers, your nerves are screaming, then they will harvest you.

571
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,180
Unless, of course, you send that money to dogs.

572
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:03,660
They get they, the evil ones, the dark ones on the other side. They get high from your pain.

573
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,500
Your pain is their pain killer.

574
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,500
That's right.

575
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,720
They leech your slack.

576
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,620
Your agony is their endorphin.

577
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:19,780
They are leeching away your, they are trying to steal away, prevent you from reaching and experiencing those phylos upon phylos of slack.

578
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,440
Yes.

579
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,160
And in turn will sap from you and imbue you with it.

580
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,280
Stang upon stang of pain.

581
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,900
And Gordon upon Gordon of terror.

582
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,100
Yes, friends.

583
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,860
Which do you want? The stangs and gordons of pain and terror or the...

584
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:43,960
Or do you want those phylos of all-encompassing, glowing, rhythmic, rippling slack?

585
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:53,380
Those cleaves of sex hurt, of sweaty, squishing, mew, mushy, smelly sex hurt.

586
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,420
Or those...

587
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,080
But you can't have that if you don't pledge to Bob.

588
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,300
Oh, no, no, no. None of that pleasure. None of that pain. None of that.

589
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,880
You just don't get anything but the pain of the dark one.

590
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,360
And the confusion, the confusion of Jane-er.

591
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,480
Jane-ers and Jane-ers of confusion, dear friends, can be swept away if you will but one.

592
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,060
Call in and pledge. Save your soul.

593
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:22,660
Oh.

594
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,240
You don't want to end up in Christian heaven, do you?

595
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,700
I didn't pledge to die.

596
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,060
Listen to those souls howling away.

597
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,980
Those pathetic, abandoned homes.

598
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,540
All ye who enter here.

599
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,940
Oh, save me, Rembrandt, save me.

600
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,180
Gee, Gordon, Gordon.

601
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:52,640
The Book of Life states here that you served Bob in many ways.

602
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,660
But never paid your twenty dollars to KNON.

603
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,700
I was going to pay sooner or later.

604
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,220
It's too late, Gee, Gordon, Gordon.

605
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,300
I didn't get around.

606
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:13,720
Even one as faithful as you who have killed so many paints for Bob.

607
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,680
I was meant to give you the twenty bucks, you pipe-wielding geek. I'm sorry. Help me, Bob.

608
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,320
Oh.

609
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,320
Being sorry is not worth twenty dollars to KNON.

610
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:33,480
Now, Gee, Gordon, Gordon, you have failed to pass the test.

611
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,680
Throw him into the Lake of Fire.

612
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,960
No, no, not the Lake of Fire.

613
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,480
Along with all those other KNON listeners who never paid up.

614
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,320
Not the Lake of Fire. Never in staying. I'll be good. I'll pledge. I'll pledge.

615
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,920
Here, my checkbook. Here's all those emeralds you wanted.

616
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,260
So I take it all back.

617
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,620
I'm sorry. Just don't put me in that box again. Please, I'll pledge.

618
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,020
Money means nothing to us.

619
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,400
Your soul was lost the day you didn't dial that number.

620
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:04,660
And now learning to apply creative and corrective procedures and to bring back to normalcy and a state of perfection

621
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:12,600
any abnormality or imperfection found within any given manifestation of matter, any given plane, any given depth.

622
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,020
I can easily do anything that I want to do.

623
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:21,000
I can. I can. I'm a winner.

624
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,900
Reverend Stang, please let me off the hook.

625
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,160
I'm not Reverend Stang. I'm God or somebody.

626
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:33,040
Well, anyway, uh, that, well, our sound effects ran out and no one's calling.

627
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,440
And there's no pledging.

628
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,500
There's no pledging.

629
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,700
Well, let's just not say anything. Let's just give them dead air until the phone rings, I say.

630
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,720
Give them the old, uh...

631
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,920
Bob Larson thing.

632
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,700
Oh.

633
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,180
Oh, is it Bob, well, or, or, uh, Dr. James?

634
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,000
Well, let's give them live air.

635
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,260
Live air, then. Let's give them church air. No, no, that's not...

636
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,660
I know what they really don't want. I know what they really don't want.

637
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,760
I'm sure they'd hate the old pledge drive tapes.

638
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:05,140
Well, doctor, I really don't know if they're ready for the church air.

639
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,160
It's either the last pledge drive for a while or the last hour of slack.

640
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,360
This could be your last chance.

641
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,500
I thought you boys understood. It's business. That's all it is.

642
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,120
You still don't get it, do you, boys?

643
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,820
There ain't no countries anymore. No more good guys.

644
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,580
They're running the whole show.

645
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,020
They own everything, the whole damn planet. They can do whatever they want.

646
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,040
What's wrong with having a good for a change?

647
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,500
Now, they're gonna let us have a good if we just help them.

648
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,280
They're gonna leave us alone. Let us make some money.

649
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,140
You can have a little taste of that good life, too.

650
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,620
Now, I know you want it. Hell, everybody does.

651
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,100
You're gonna make a million dollars.

652
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,260
And you could call in and you can talk to the...

653
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,880
There's some sexy ministers on the lines tonight.

654
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:07,900
Your prayer partners are here, ready to receive your promise.

655
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,860
Your covenant with Bob, friends.

656
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,800
Why, the...

657
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,300
The evil Dr. Zaphod here picked up...

658
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,180
He got one from Joseph Prowl for 200 bucks.

659
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,400
And I happen to know that that one's not a joke.

660
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,020
Now, I know that, you know, not everybody can give that much.

661
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,760
You know, Dr. Drummond and I once talked about, you know, who means the most to Bob?

662
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,880
Is it the little old lady who can...

663
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:40,460
Who, you know, doesn't have anything at all to her name, but she donates a quarter, her last quarter?

664
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,320
Or does...

665
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:47,120
Or is Bob more impressed with the rich man who could give a million dollars, but only gives 10,000?

666
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:55,100
We prayed on that, friends, and we realized that, in Bob's eyes, that rich man is the only one that's gonna get to heaven,

667
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,400
because he paid more money.

668
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,020
So I want you to call.

669
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,460
We gotta sell you, friends. You're not just gonna...

670
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,340
Oh, yes.

671
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:08,260
Oh, yes, dear friends. You're reaching the end of slide one of your subgenius radio ministry hour and slideshow.

672
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,300
Please be prepared to switch your tape over to...

673
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:20,320
Oh, yes.

674
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,700
Oh, yes, friends.

675
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:34,160
Well, let's see what this little tape from the Arcata show by Jesus Harvey Oswald here, this little tape called, I Didn't Inhale.

676
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,620
I didn't inhale.

677
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,440
I didn't inhale.

678
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:40,600
I didn't inhale.

679
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:40,880
I didn't inhale.

680
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,300
I didn't inhale.

681
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:41,300


682
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:41,300


683
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,900
I didn't inhale.

684
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,600
I didn't inhale.

685
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,800
I didn't inhale.

686
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,200
I didn't inhale.

687
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,200


688
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,200


689
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,200


690
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,200


691
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,200


692
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,200


693
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,880
I didn't créer until I feel great.

694
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,200
Because so much has been gathered up I have been just thinking about it.

695
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,840
But is that what I feel?

696
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,820
I don't want anybody to argue right now.

697
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,560
And if Iater else can bring me to a higher level in All Land as they're says, there's

698
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,140
going to be a dance party going on, but I still wanna get dressed, and I want everyone

699
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,140


700
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:01,620
You know what I do think, I think.

702
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,580
He didn't kill anybody, he didn't lost a child, he didn't rape someone.

703
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,440
He was just 7 years in jail, and the rape is sick.

704
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,340
Sick.

705
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,680
He'll serve the rest of his life.

706
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,260
ственe

707
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,360
They've fallen and they can't get up

708
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,700
Yes, dear friends

709
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,920
Listen to those

710
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,080
The people manning the phone

711
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,260
Screaming with boredom in the background

712
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,220
Remember what the immortal

713
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,060
Cyrano de Bergerac said

714
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,800
Perish the universe as long as I have my revenge

715
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,640
And I can give my money to K.N.O.N.

716
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,920
Yes, dear friends

717
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,720
Cyrano de Bergerac said that?

718
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,320
Cyrano de Bergerac said that

719
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,160
Right here in this book of deep thoughts

720
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,480
And deep, deep thoughts they are indeed

721
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,560
Yes, indeed, Dr. Stang

722
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,300
But we're going to be in deep

723
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,740
Something deep besides thoughts

724
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,640
If we don't raise some more money

725
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,520
Hey, come on, didn't you hear us?

726
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,140
Assumed to Section 28A, Article 4B, Paragraph 2

727
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,520
Of the Internal Security Regulations

728
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,600
I now hand over to you rejected applicate number

729
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,180
578-293-BO21

730
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:09,900
Yes, sir

731
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,500
And...

732
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,220
The light on his face

733
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,220
Hey, I'm going to Margo to get paid

734
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,560
I hate myself

735
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,980
I hate everyone else

736
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,840
Can you hear me?

737
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,000
What the heck is going on out here anyway?

738
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,140
I need to talk to Bob

739
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,380
Bob, Bob, Bob

740
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,360
Bob, Bob

741
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,560
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

742
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,840
There are weapons that are simply thoughts

743
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,700
Attitudes, prejudices

744
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,500
To be found only in the minds of men

745
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,220
There is no typical subgenius

746
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,980
And negotiable

747
00:35:47,980 --> 00:36:02,200
It is the influence that

748
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:08,940
Should give us judges

749
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,200
One traditional phrase

750
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,200


751
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,200


752
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,200


753
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,200


754
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,200


755
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,200


756
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,200


757
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,200


758
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,940
100. Big one.

759
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,180
Ben Waller has always packed a wallet.

760
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,280
Ah, yes. Thank you, Ben. Thank you.

761
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,300
You are now one of the beloved of Dobbs.

762
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,340
And David Grosjean.

763
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,180
Yes, indeed. A $30 pledge. Thank you, David.

764
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,440
Sally. Ah, yes.

765
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,600
Oh, we love you so, dear friends.

766
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,660
Good Sally. Thank you.

767
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,380
Thank you, Sally, for your pledge.

768
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,980
And Tracy. Tracy got all shook up and sent us some money.

769
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,640
Thank you, Tracy.

770
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:38,480
Why, listen, you can hear Tracy's soul already bubbling away in the vats,

771
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,980
ready to be sent to the men from Planet X.

772
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,680
Yours can, too, dear friends.

773
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,100
Your mental life stench can be extracted, purified, filtered and packed

774
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,760
and chopped and macerated and put into a small special metallic cylinder

775
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,520
and thence hide hence to the dark, cloudy, nebulous regions of space

776
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:02,060
where scions of the elder gods yet gibber and laugh and giggle

777
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,580
in blind amorphous, blind amorphous boredom

778
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,200
like that being experienced by our phone crew.

779
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,780
And you have nothing to do.

780
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,140
So please, friends, pledge.

781
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,200
Please, friends.

782
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,860
Remember that.

783
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,920
...tear and talk.

784
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,240
Bob said we had to party.

785
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:18,680
Didn't he?

786
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,500
That's what he said.

787
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:19,640
Didn't he?

788
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:19,900
Yes.

789
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,620
He said we had to party.

790
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,280
He didn't say we could.

791
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,960
He said we had to.

792
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,500
That's right.

793
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,520
And so...

794
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:25,940
We did.

795
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,100
...we must also sell.

796
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,460
Praise Bob and thank you.

797
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,860
Thank you, Reverend Stank.

798
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,260
Thank you.

799
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:31,680
Thank you.

800
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:31,900
Thank you.

801
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,120
Come on!

802
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,580
Oh, yes.

803
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,980
Get up off that chair!

804
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:36,900
Yeah. What?

805
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,140
Tell me!

806
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,900
What's the matter with you, Reverend Stank?

807
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,740
Get off that chair.

808
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,920
...something to sell.

809
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,440
We all know we're in the art of selling.

810
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,140
We create a mental and an emotional climate of unconscious selling.

811
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,580
Right in your own home.

812
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,780
In your own living room.

813
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,240
Yes.

814
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,640
When everybody sells, we all have something to sell.

815
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:03,360
We all have one of the sex goddesses from Planet X in your own living room.

816
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,620
And remember, it's better to sleep with a drunken...

817
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,020
...cannibal than with a sober Christian.

818
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:09,760
Yes.

819
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,060
That's a great thought, Dr. Dool.

820
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,880
A truly great thought.

821
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,360
And...

822
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,720
Have you any other...

823
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,200
Oh, there's some great thoughts in King Menander.

824
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,200
Oh, yes, sir.

825
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,300
Oh, dear.

826
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,980
I love...

827
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,360
Oh, yes.

828
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,920
There are certainly queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life,

829
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:36,600
when a man takes his whole universe for a vast practical adventure.

830
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:36,600


831
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:36,600


832
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:36,600


833
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:36,600


834
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:36,600


835
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:36,600


836
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:36,600


837
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:43,100
Oh, but we wouldn't think of life as a practical joke.

838
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,800
Not us.

839
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,900
No, nay, nay.

840
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,500
Oh, nay, nay, nay.

841
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,680
Oh, we take it all seriously, like grownups.

842
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,280
Like pink boys, right?

843
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:49,940
That's right.

844
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,660
Take it real serious.

845
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,520
Oh, yes.

846
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,640
Well, you never find us laughing about the inequities of life.

847
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:54,900
No.

848
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,540
We take our security and our jobs seriously.

849
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,420
Empty your golden glasses to the dregs.

850
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,620
We take our retirement leash seriously.

851
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,100
Life is dark, so is death.

852
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,660
I remember that, Doctor.

853
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,580
Oh, dear.

854
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:06,580


855
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:06,580


856
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,140
Death.

857
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,040
Oh, I love those little snatches of sleep.

858
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:23,160
I smell doom afoot as the phones clunk into their resting positions and don't ring again.

859
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,340
All right, people.

860
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,660
I'm tired of this.

861
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,880
I've had it.

862
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,560
I want to see those phones light up.

863
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,440
I know what's going to do it.

864
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,280
I know what'll do it.

865
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,120
Play us some of that cool music, Reverend Sting.

866
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,480
No.

867
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,460
I'd like to hear it.

868
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,980
We're going to play the Church of the New Faith until the phone rings again.

869
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:48,460
If you do not start calling in, we are going to start calling you individually in your homes, and you don't want us to do that.

870
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,660
We know where you are.

871
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,340
And we know who you are.

872
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:51,600
Be aware.

873
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:56,160
Only your knowledge of this fake invasion and fake rapture can prevent it from happening.

874
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,400
Ah, yes.

875
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,520
The Greys.

876
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,780
We must talk about them.

877
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,400
Demand the truth from your government.

878
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,300
That's right, dear friends.

879
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,580
Tell them you know about the aliens and the subjugation.

880
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,080
And that there are good aliens and bad aliens.

881
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,820
And that MJ-12 is promoting the bad aliens.

882
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,560
And good subgeniuses and better subgeniuses.

883
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,220
There are no bad subgeniuses.

884
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:14,740
Just remember that.

885
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:14,800
And the one world government.

886
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,660
And remember, when you pledge to Bob, you're pledging to the good side of the force.

887
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,420
The good side.

888
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:26,020
When you pledge to the conspiracy, you are pledging to the bad side.

889
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,140
Yes.

890
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,700
Does Adam sin and kill Cain?

891
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,260
Christ did to pardon our sins.

892
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,780
Who condemned man to death?

893
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,820
Adam did.

894
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,520
Who killed himself to free us?

895
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,580
Jesus did.

896
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,540
Who's blood did he spill?

897
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:36,540


898
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:36,560
Who's blood did he spill?

899
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,180
Why do we drink and spill on the ground to vindicate our sins?

900
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,760
We drink from the blood of Christ.

901
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,520
Whose flesh do we consume so that we may become him?

902
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,260
The body of Christ.

903
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,540
Give me a sign so that I can walk through the gates of heaven.

904
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,100
Give me eyes so that I may see his city.

905
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,180
Bodies at my feet as I walk toward God's military city.

906
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,980
Charitories of Satan's army.

907
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,940
Even Christians die before reaching the gates of the city.

908
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,740
The Christians urged Satan lay siege to the holy city of God.

909
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,540
The city walls are impervious to all the laws of God.

910
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,240
The city walls are impervious to all the laws of Satan's monsters.

911
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:11,660
Angels throw bibles and even the gargoyles try to evade the airspace over the city of

912
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:11,960
God.

913
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,940
The word of God rips the limbs off of Satan's invaders.

914
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,860
This is why hell smells of rotting flesh.

915
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,960
This is why hell is thick with the wailing screams of libelous callers.

916
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,540
This is why in hell none can ever die.

917
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,940
This is just a tiny bit of what it's going to be like.

918
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:32,840
This is a hint of what the radio airwaves would be like if there were no hour of slack

919
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,080
and KNON.

920
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,040
Just remember that.

921
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,340
This is the total takeover of the world by Christian radio.

922
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,780
As much as we love the church of the new faith heard here in the background.

923
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,300
Oh, well, they were heard.

924
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,740
Church of the new faith.

925
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,660
Had you heard them before, Dr. Gordon?

926
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:52,060
No, and I must say that I'm quite pleased to hear that sort of horrible repulsive sound

927
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,280
going out over the air.

928
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,360
It makes me realize just how eloquent and smooth the word of gobs can be in comparison

929
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:04,400
to this sort of impassioned, mad, animalistic ranting on behalf of fundamentalist people

930
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,060
who worship the dead guy on the stick.

931
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,740
I'm just not sure that I've heard those guys before, but I know the type.

932
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:15,060
Some of you people are just sitting there on your butts.

933
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,780
You're just sad, sacked butts.

934
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:24,860
It's a sad day that a doctor comes all the way from the third world to Dallas to sit

935
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:29,420
in on a radio show, and I come here to raise some money for gobs, and what happens?

936
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,860
You sit there on your big, great, comfortable ass.

937
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:44,960
Well, sure, I'd rather make $2.35 an hour washing these cars than invest $1 for eternal

938
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,360
salvation for J.R. Bob.

939
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,760
I don't like them sub guys.

940
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,400
I don't like that radio show they do.

941
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,520
They think they're so smart.

942
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,840
Well, let me ask you this, mister.

943
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,020
That's why they call them sub genius.

944
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:56,780
Excuse me, sir.

945
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,820
Doesn't that mean super smart?

946
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,660
No, it doesn't.

947
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,000
Sub genius?

948
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,300
Doesn't that mean super smart?

949
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:00,820
Sir, please.

950
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,600
Here, sir.

951
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,080
Sir, excuse me, sir.

952
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,600
I'm going to take this pamphlet and look at this man's face.

953
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,860
I've seen that man before.

954
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,560
Well, now tell me.

955
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,100
Look at that man.

956
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,160
Doesn't he not instill confidence in you, sir?

957
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:11,760
Look at that, please.

958
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,740
Examine it carefully.

959
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,460
Doesn't it make your wallet kind of startling?

960
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:15,480
Well, he's all right.

961
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:15,520
I don't care.

962
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,440
Well, you do.

963
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:16,820
You do.

964
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,480
Look at that man.

965
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,120
Look at that man again.

966
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,900
He looks like he could give me slack in eternal salvation.

967
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,460
Yeah, he will.

968
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,980
And give me a new job that would work better, that I'd love.

969
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,520
That's right.

970
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,340
And lots of women.

971
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,160
All you got to do is give me your wallet, sir.

972
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:27,400
No.

973
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,600
Just give me your wallet.

974
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,900
I don't like them sub dumb guys.

975
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,140
You can do it.

976
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,740
No problem.

977
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,260
I don't like that silly sub dumb stuff.

978
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,180
It's not silly, sir.

979
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,000
It's salvation.

980
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,360
Yeah, they think they're so...

981
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,560
Wouldn't you like to ride on the sex saucers of the goddesses?

982
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:41,840
No.

983
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,980
Wouldn't you like to be saved and whisked up?

984
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,420
No, I don't want to be saved.

985
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:45,800
I...

986
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,060
Well, in that case, we'll just have to kill you if you don't give us our wallet.

987
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,660
I want to stay everything the way it is.

988
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,840
I want to keep everything just like it is and stagnate.

989
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,020
Oh, yes.

990
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,400
That's all I want to do is just stagnate.

991
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,040
Stagnate, yes.

992
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:56,940
I'm just going to listen to this.

993
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,540
I'm going to stagnate.

994
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,580
I understand that.

995
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,160
I'm going to listen to this top 40...

996
00:43:59,160 --> 00:43:59,660
I understand.

997
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,760
I'm going to listen to this.

998
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,160
Stagnating, yes.

999
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,480
Right this other radio station.

1000
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,440
You can hear him stagnating right now.

1001
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,780
I'm going to listen to Superstar 90.

1002
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,100
It's made the phone rings, dear friend.

1003
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,380
That's my favorite radio station, Superstar 90.

1004
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,380
They play that Rod Stewart song every hour.

1005
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,660
I love that Rod Stewart song.

1006
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:13,980


1007
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,080
Every bit you tell is a story, right?

1008
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:15,420
I listen to it every hour.

1009
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,140
That's the one you like, right?

1010
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,240
Yeah.

1011
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:16,500
It's modern.

1012
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,140
It's on the edge.

1013
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:18,760
I love it.

1014
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,240
They never...

1015
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,580
It's always something new and different...

1016
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,120
Well, friends...

1017
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:21,720
...that I've never...

1018
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,520
You see, this is...

1019
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,620
...well, I've never heard in a whole hour...

1020
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,360
People that stang me.

1021
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,940
...I ain't going to help them sub gum guys.

1022
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,300
That show gave me a headache.

1023
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,180
Them sub gums.

1024
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,640
I'm a pole, pole bucker.

1025
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,420
I like to smoke, cuss, and drink.

1026
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,320
But there's one thing that makes my head hurt.

1027
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,980
Just don't ask me to thank.

1028
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,200
That's the song of the pole bucker.

1029
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,220
Are you singing that song?

1030
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,340
Are you going to...

1031
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,300
No, they're not.

1032
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,760
Actually, they're going, well, I kind of like this show when they're not doing a pledge

1033
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,040
drive.

1034
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,100
But somebody else is going to pledge for me.

1035
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:51,860
I mean...

1036
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah, so I don't have to pledge.

1037
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,400
I need my money.

1038
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,540
I need my money.

1039
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,140
I need that $45 for a hamburger.

1040
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,000
I got to go down to Greenville Avenue and have me a fancy little nifty little food for

1041
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,200
water in a bottle and a hamburger.

1042
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,220
Yeah, I need that $45 for a special suit I can be seen in by the others so that they

1043
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,560
won't think I'm too different.

1044
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,940
What kind of suit you going to get for $45?

1045
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,300
You can't even get a lawsuit for $45.

1046
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,400
What are you talking about?

1047
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,680
You can't even get a hamburger in this town for $45.

1048
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,280
This place is the only place I know where they give you a credit check before you go

1049
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,600
in McDonald's in this town.

1050
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,660
What are you talking about?

1051
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:30,380
Okay, well, as far as I can tell, judging by the activity on the phones, we've only

1052
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,000
raised about a third as much money as we need.

1053
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,540
This is probably going to be the last time you'll hear this show, so we're going to reveal

1054
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,580
what we were hoping we'd have a bigger audience to reveal these things.

1055
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,100
This is probably the last time we'll be on.

1056
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,920
We're going to tell you the answers to the meaning of life, the secrets of the universe,

1057
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:45,900
and the key to success.

1058
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,860
The ruling powers decided that one means of funding the alien project was to corner the

1059
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,240
illegal drug market.

1060
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:53,660
Okay.

1061
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,540
The first member of the Council on Foreign Relations was approached.

1062
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:04,180
His name is George Bush, who at the time was president and CEO of Zapata Oil Company based

1063
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:04,800
in Texas.

1064
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,660
Zapata Oil was experimenting with offshore oil drilling, and it was arranged that the

1065
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:14,160
drugs would be shipped from South America to the offshore platforms by fishing boats,

1066
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,280
then transferred to the US shore by normal transportation, avoiding search by customs

1067
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:18,620
agents.

1068
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,920
The plan worked better than anyone expected, and today the CIA controls all the world's

1069
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,580
illegal drugs.

1070
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:24,960
It's just like a drug market.

1071
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,800
One should remember it was George Bush who first started selling drugs to our children.

1072
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:36,260
The drug money was used to finance the deep underground alien bases.

1073
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,940
They sell drugs to support the alien bases.

1074
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,220
Conclusions?

1075
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,320
The Bilderbergers, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission

1076
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:51,740
are the secret government and rule this nation through MJ-12, and the study group known as

1077
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,820
the Jason Society.

1078
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,800
Just sit back and relax.

1079
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,580
And I'm going to tell you the secret.

1080
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,220
Just pay no attention to this hysterical outburst.

1081
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:02,900
In fact, if you will pledge to gain a rein, we will take this man outside and summarily

1082
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,700
shoot him.

1083
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,280
So contribute to the death of Ivan Stang.

1084
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,140
You put us over the top tonight, and we'll put him out the window 30 seconds later, dear

1085
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:12,440
friend.

1086
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,060
Help us sink a Stang, yes indeed, friend.

1087
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:23,360
Don't let this bitter, impassioned, vitriolic, nasty-tongued little man sit here and rant

1088
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,140
at you forever.

1089
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:24,560
I'm going to tell you the secret.

1090
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:24,560


1091
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:24,560


1092
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:24,560


1093
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:24,560


1094
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:24,560


1095
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:24,900
The truth.

1096
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:25,660
Shut him up.

1097
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,700
Send your money.

1098
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,000
MJ-12 presented it to each president with a picture of a lost alien culture seeking to

1099
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,000


1100
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,100
Keep Kano going.

1101
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:37,460
We pledge that if you send five times what we are only required to make, if we can raise

1102
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:44,040
$5,000, friends, we will have seats for you at the public execution of Ivan Stang.

1103
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,840
Innocent people continue to suffer unspeakable horrors at the hands of alien and human scientists

1104
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:54,540
growing engaged in barbarous research that would make the Nazis pay for their lives.

1105
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:54,540


1106
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:54,540


1107
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:54,540


1108
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:54,540


1109
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:59,680
We'll even sell you parts of his body after we've finished with him.

1110
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,100
Yes, you see, he's weak.

1111
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:03,920
He's old.

1112
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,160
It won't take much to push him over the edge, friends.

1113
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,800
So send that money in.

1114
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:12,880
Keep those phones lighting up and help us work Stang to death.

1115
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,440
Yes, there it goes.

1116
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,140
You hear it.

1117
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,240
You hear the kind of stuff we have to put up with, sir.

1118
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,540
Give us a break, friends.

1119
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,860
Send the money in and help us get rid of this nasty little man.

1120
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,640
This nasty common man.

1121
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,140
You can't shut me up.

1122
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,100
This is one little man.

1123
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,960
And every 40 Americans has been implanted with alien devices that are used to control

1124
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:29,960


1125
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:29,980


1126
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,060
You see the kind of things?

1127
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,720
This is the way it's been lately because we just simply don't have the money to keep the

1128
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,640
man sedated properly.

1129
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,340
So please.

1130
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:36,900
I refuse.

1131
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:37,960
I must be.

1132
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,640
Send us your money.

1133
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:38,900
Let me.

1134
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:39,980
No, no.

1135
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:40,200
Ow.

1136
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,040
Sit on him.

1137
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,640
Sit on him.

1138
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,260
Ow.

1139
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:42,420
Ow.

1140
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,140
Kick him.

1141
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,180
One more.

1142
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:44,500
Yes.

1143
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,120
Thank you.

1144
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:45,860
Okay, friends.

1145
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:51,300
It's KNON Spledge Drive and we'll keep Ivan Stang sedated and tied up if you will just

1146
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,580
keep those phones lit up.

1147
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:52,900
Oh.

1148
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:57,220
See, this, Willa Dobbs is picking his nose again.

1149
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,320
Come on, friends.

1150
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,760
We need your pledge.

1151
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,200
We take you to the Hotel Martinet in Brooklyn where Bobby Millett and his orchestra are

1152
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,600
offering a program of dance music.

1153
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:14,860
Lesson two.

1154
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:20,000
I'd like to know, are you really ready for some super dynamite soul?

1155
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,520
Introducing the world's greatest dance music, the

1156
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,520


1157
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,520


1158
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,520


1159
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,520


1160
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,520


1161
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,520


1162
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,520


1163
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,520


1164
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,520


1165
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,520


1166
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,520


1167
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,520


1168
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,520


1169
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,100
greatest entertainer, Mr. Donnie Mike, the amazing Mr. Please Please himself, the

1170
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:33,800
hardest working man in show business, ladies and gentlemen, the star of the show, James.

1171
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,920
Brown, brown, brown, brown, brown, brown, brown.

1172
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,540
Get up.

1173
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,580
Get on up.

1174
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,880
Get up.

1175
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:42,900
Get on up.

1176
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,180
Stay on the scene.

1177
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,200
Get on up.

1178
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,240
Like a sex machine.

1179
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,460
Get on up.

1180
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,820
Get up.

1181
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,780
Get on up.

1182
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,100
Get up.

1183
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,060
Get on up.

1184
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,320
Stay on the scene.

1185
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,360
Get on up.

1186
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,440
Like a sex machine.

1187
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,620
Get on up.

1188
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,400
Wait a minute.

1189
00:49:59,200 --> 00:49:59,720
Funk.

1190
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,160
Yeah.

1191
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:01,840
Funk.

1192
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,420
Yeah.

1193
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,100
Funk, funk, funk.

1194
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,140
Yeah, yeah.

1195
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:05,980
Funk, funk.

1196
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,380
Yeah.

1197
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:06,520
Yeah.

1198
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:06,520


1199
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:06,820
Yeah.

1200
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,320
Look at your pants.

1201
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,100
I thought I saw a pudding can.

1202
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1203
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,320
Yeah.

1204
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:19,700
Yeah.

1205
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,180
Yeah!

1206
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:24,980
Yeah!

1207
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,260
Popcorn!

1208
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:27,920
Ha!

1209
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,780
Ah!

1210
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,520
Hey!

1211
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,540
You've got to ask yourself one question.

1212
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,820
Do I feel lucky?

1213
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,140
Well, do you, punk?

1214
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,580
Excuse me, y'all!

1215
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,400
Yeah!

1216
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,020
Yeah!

1217
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:16,940
Yeah!

1218
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:16,980
Yeah!

1219
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,160
Yeah!

1220
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:29,860
Yeah!

1221
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:30,060
What...

1222
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:30,620
what...

1223
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,520
I don't get it.

1224
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:33,920
I don't get what they're saying.

1225
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,660
They're saying pledge the drive.

1226
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,380
Pledge the drive is what they're saying.

1227
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:39,720
Pledge the drive.

1228
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,600
I mean, I don't understand it.

1229
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:45,920
Is this like the have-nots complaining about the haves or the nots?

1230
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,000
And the don'ts.

1231
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,500
And I...

1232
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,920
The do-nots complained about the have-nots.

1233
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:50,400
You don't know what a have-not...

1234
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,460
And the will-nots complaining about the may-nots who don't really care too much about the...

1235
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,200
Don't know what...

1236
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,220
What-nots, you know? I mean, what difference does it make?

1237
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:00,900
You'll know not...

1238
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:06,080
All I know is that they're not pledging, the lights aren't flashing, and I'm getting really tired of it.

1239
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:12,420
Listen, you hip wimps, you little bobbies out there sucking up our slack on the airwaves and not pledging.

1240
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,120
Here's a quote for you. Here's a good quote.

1241
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,700
Belief in and dependence on God is absolutely essential.

1242
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,460
It will be an integral part of our public life as long as I am governor.

1243
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,560
That was said by Ronald Wilson Reagan.

1244
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,520
Ah, yes, and he pledged to Bob, and look what it got him.

1245
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,900
Eight years in the White House and a good time.

1246
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,200
That's right, you'd think he'd have made it without Bob's approval.

1247
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,160
Because, oh, my listeners, just think of it.

1248
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:46,680
Is it not so?

1249
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:53,460
That scrupulous fear of Bob is the very thing that keeps the United States together.

1250
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,580
That's right, friends.

1251
00:52:54,860 --> 00:53:03,820
To such an extraordinary height is this carried among Americans, both in private and public business, that nothing could exceed it.

1252
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,260
Many might think this unaccountable, but in my opinion, you have a...

1253
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,320
Catch 22.

1254
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,220
That's right, you're all fired.

1255
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,540
Oh!

1256
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:16,340
Oh!

1257
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:17,380
Oh!

1258
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,460
You can kill yourselves off or not.

1259
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,360
Don't make no difference, Doug.

1260
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,620
There's nothing you can do about it.

1261
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:25,460
Ah!

1262
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:31,140
You can hear what's in store for you in the background here, friends, if you don't call.

1263
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,040
How would you like to have a noise like this in your head all day?

1264
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:42,700
How would you like to feel like you had your stereo earphones on 24 hours a day?

1265
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,760
Well, that's what'll happen to you if you don't pledge.

1266
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:47,000
We'll send them spy beams into your ears.

1267
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:51,400
Your skull will beam this music to you and you'll hear it in your dreams.

1268
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,880
You'll hear it in the extra meditation chamber.

1269
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,500
You'll hear it at work.

1270
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:59,040
You'll hear it while you're trying to think.

1271
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,560
We will fight them on the beaches.

1272
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,140
We will fight them in the K-marts.

1273
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,120
We will...

1274
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,820
I give up. I give up.

1275
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,280
It's no good, Reverend Stanton.

1276
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,860
So far, we've made...

1277
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,300
Okay, let's just get serious here.

1278
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,380
$2.85.

1279
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,040
No, it's not that bad.

1280
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:16,820
But we haven't...

1281
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,220
We're gonna have to...

1282
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,440
$3.85.

1283
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,160
We've made about $300.

1284
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,540
We're supposed to make $1,000.

1285
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,820
And you people are not cooperating, friends.

1286
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,800
We're gonna have to do this again next week.

1287
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,500
And again the week after that.

1288
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:36,060
Instead of playing the wonderful tapes and music and being able to just sit down and just do a show.

1289
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:36,720
No, no.

1290
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,560
Instead, we have to act like Bob Teltner and Jimmy Swagger.

1291
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,140
Oh, send us money.

1292
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,380
We don't care about healing you.

1293
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,240
All we care about is staying on your ear.

1294
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,560
We have to berate you.

1295
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,540
We have to belittle you.

1296
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,620
We have to taunt you.

1297
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:54,100
Jeer at you before we can get you to get up off your attitudes and send us some money.

1298
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,820
And that's a disgrace, friends.

1299
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:02,660
This, the very center, the very nerve center, the birthplace of Bob and the Church of the Subgenius.

1300
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:06,020
And we're having to whine at you to get a little money out of you.

1301
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,720
And you people, it's just...

1302
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,400
I'm ashamed, Reverend Stanton.

1303
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,200
It makes me want to go back to the...

1304
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,740
Go back to green hell and just stay out there.

1305
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:15,860
Don't believe me.

1306
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,500
I'd go with you if I possibly could.

1307
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,020
There's nothing holding me in Dallas.

1308
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,040
When was the last time you saw me preach in Dallas, Texas?

1309
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,480
When was the last time you saw me?

1310
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,000
There's not a club here that'll have me.

1311
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:25,780
I go to Cleveland.

1312
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,040
I go to San Francisco and go to New York.

1313
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:29,400
Oh, yeah.

1314
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,620
They'll pay for you to go to London, Reverend Stanton.

1315
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:33,300
Oh, yeah.

1316
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:34,040
London, sure.

1317
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,800
They want us to come back in June.

1318
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,920
I'm not going to be able to preach.

1319
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,840
It's going to be too late pretty soon.

1320
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:45,300
And Dallas doesn't care because, oh, well, it started here, so we must be protected because Bob began here.

1321
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,220
Oh, well, everybody's safe in Dallas.

1322
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,520
We don't have to pledge.

1323
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:56,420
I'm done with the monster of we, the word of serfdom, of plunder, of misery, falsehood, and shame.

1324
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:05,840
I see the free face of God now, and I raise this God Bob over the earth, this God who men have sought since men came into being.

1325
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,160
Help us stop this sort of excess in radio, dear friend.

1326
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:09,220
This God who will grant them joy and peace and pride.

1327
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:12,000
This God, this one word, is me.

1328
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,420
Please, friends, help us send little Ivan to his summer camp.

1329
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:15,280
I, the true Ivan.

1330
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:15,280


1331
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,520
I, I'm done with the monster of we.

1332
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,200
Little Ivan's been under a lot of stress lately, friends.

1333
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,240
The new God is I.

1334
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,300
We could just take Reverend Stang off to some nice, quiet, little, specialized world.

1335
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:28,060
If any civilization is to survive, it is the morality of altruism that men have to reject.

1336
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,920
That doesn't mean we don't want your money.

1337
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:35,120
You know, just something nice and quiet for Reverend Stang, just so he'll be more relaxed, you know.

1338
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,380
Help send Reverend Stang to summer camp.

1339
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:36,520
Hey, check this one.

1340
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,020
Here's another one from Ayn Rand.

1341
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,520
The cross is the symbol of torture.

1342
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,640
I prefer the dollar sign, the symbol of free trade.

1343
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,420
There it is.

1344
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:44,840
There it is.

1345
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:45,460
There's the cross sign.

1346
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:49,440
Praise St. Ayn Rand, the crazy fascist.

1347
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,360
I love her.

1348
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,600
Ah, yes, friends.

1349
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,140
Even as she hates me for being a subgenius.

1350
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:54,440
Help send the lion off, friend.

1351
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,640
We'll pack him in cotton wool.

1352
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:55,800
He's a genius.

1353
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:01,120
Put him in a nice little padded box and send him to that little happy place where Ivan can relax.

1354
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,000
The devil was sick.

1355
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,040
The devil was sick.

1356
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,620
The devil a monk would be.

1357
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,980
But we've only got six minutes to raise that money.

1358
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:07,320
The devil was well.

1359
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,300
The devil a monk was he.

1360
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,760
Speak the truth and shame the devil, friends.

1361
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,300
Come on.

1362
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,280
Wisdom entereth not into you.

1363
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,640
You are a malicious mind and science without conscience is but the ruin of the soul.

1364
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:24,120
The rule of their order and our order had but one clause.

1365
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,340
Do what thou wilt.

1366
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:29,300
Yes, but Mrs. Celia is tired of sitting here waiting for you wimps to dial.

1367
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,500
So get on the phone.

1368
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:30,960
Let's go.

1369
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,300
I am going now to seek a great...

1370
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:33,420
Six minutes, friends.

1371
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,120
Perhaps.

1372
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:40,540
Cheaper than a 1-900 line and far more satisfying, dear friends.

1373
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,260
Pledge your money to Bob and K-N-O-N.

1374
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,340
You won't regret it.

1375
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,320
We'll guarantee it.

1376
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,080
The hour of slack is an indecent exposure of the consciousness.

1377
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,780
Don't you just love it?

1378
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,900
Look, man, we've only got five minutes worth of money raising time.

1379
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:00,260
Please, if you have any, any slack in your heart, share some of it.

1380
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,080
Don't beg them, Reverend Stang.

1381
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:01,720
Don't beg them.

1382
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:02,720
Don't beg.

1383
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,540
Yeah, you're right.

1384
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:03,920
I probably should.

1385
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,660
Just ignore them.

1386
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,120
Just ignore them.

1387
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:05,440
Let's just leave.

1388
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,200
Let's go on strike.

1389
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:06,720
Okay.

1390
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,420
We'll stop the motor of the world.

1391
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:09,300
I'm unplugging my earphones.

1392
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:09,800
That's it.

1393
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,020
We'll just walk away from it.

1394
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:12,560
That's right.

1395
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,280
I've had enough of it.

1396
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,940
I've had enough of their mewling and puking, their sad whining.

1397
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:17,120
Whining.

1398
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,400
Oh, entertain us.

1399
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,220
Calm and entertain us.

1400
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,160
Oh, please, send us some radio.

1401
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,720
We hate the pink radio.

1402
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,380
Let's get ...

1403
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,040
Oh, I don't like ... Oh, well, hour of slack's really cool, man.

1404
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:25,880
You ever listen to it?

1405
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,440
Oh, I just love the hour of slack.

1406
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,760
But do you send your money to the hour?

1407
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:30,820
No, of course not.

1408
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,720
You'll spend your money on condoms and things like that.

1409
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,040
You owe it to us, Reverend Stang.

1410
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,780
But you will not send it.

1411
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:40,920
You owe it to us, K-N-O-N, because we need the hour of slack.

1412
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,000
It's not that we deserve it.

1413
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:42,000


1414
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,040
We deserve it or earned it.

1415
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,360
No, we want it.

1416
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:44,760
It is because we need it.

1417
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:45,500
We want it.

1418
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,340
It's because we are important.

1419
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:51,320
From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.

1420
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:55,000
So K-N-O-N and the subgeniuses are able to do this.

1421
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:59,740
Therefore, since you need it so bad, we're supposed to owe it to you.

1422
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,660
Oh, Reverend Stang, I can't bear you.

1423
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:01,960
I just need it so much.

1424
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,100
What if we decided that we just had enough insults from you?

1425
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,000
Yeah, you.

1426
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,820
I have had ...

1427
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:08,280
Flippertits.

1428
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,020
According to subgenius subjective objectivism,

1429
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,000
you owe it to us.

1430
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,500
You people make me sick.

1431
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,360
That's right.

1432
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,340
You make me absolutely want to ...

1433
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,360
You make me want to toss my lunch bucket.

1434
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,860
You make me want to ...

1435
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,660
You whining, mewling little wimp.

1436
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,380
... disgorge my spaghetti.

1437
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:24,720
Really.

1438
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,200
It's just disgusting.

1439
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:27,720
Dallas, Texas.

1440
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:35,300
We're having a puke for Bob just to get a little ... just to get a measly 40 or 50 bucks out

1441
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:35,580
of you.

1442
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:35,620


1443
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:36,340
What's the matter?

1444
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,420
Haven't you got any money?

1445
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,700
Or did you spend it all ...

1446
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:38,920
Tastes of bile in my mouth.

1447
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,640
Did you spend it all on hip videos?

1448
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,000
Did you use it to make a movie?

1449
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,000


1450
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,000


1451
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,000


1452
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,000


1453
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,000


1454
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,000


1455
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,000


1456
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,000


1457
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,280
Did you use it to rent slasher movies?

1458
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,040
Is that what you wanted?

1459
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:45,440
Huh?

1460
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:46,380
You creep.

1461
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:46,400
Oh, man.

1462
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,360
Let's switch over to like one of the other stations and like listen to ...

1463
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,920
Yeah, they're being mean to us, man.

1464
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,340
... or something like that.

1465
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:53,800
Yeah.

1466
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,600
Like Billy Idol, you know.

1467
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,160
I want to hear ...

1468
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:56,360
Oh.

1469
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,260
I want to hear crisscross, man.

1470
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,400
I want to hear some killer rap music, man.

1471
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:04,420
Those sub gum guys, like they're just ... it's like ...

1472
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:05,760
They always want money, man.

1473
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:06,340
It's so negative.

1474
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,700
They're always bitching about like money, you know, the same.

1475
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,020
You got to send in and all that stuff, man.

1476
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:11,880
It's like they forgot.

1477
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:11,980
They forgot.

1478
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:11,980


1479
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:11,980


1480
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:11,980


1481
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:11,980


1482
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,760
They forgot like what it's all about, you know.

1483
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,500
It's like it's supposed to be free, you know.

1484
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,140
It's like they're so negative.

1485
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,240
It's like the word of Bob, man.

1486
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:22,240
You know, there are those out there who have faith in their heart, those who hope, those

1487
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:29,140
who act, those who are doers, like Eric Glover of Plano, Texas, like Herman Deskins and

1488
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,020
Dr. Luke Anthony.

1489
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:32,360
Praise Dr. Anthony.

1490
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,440
People whose pledges ...

1491
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:33,980
Praise Herman.

1492
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,120
Praise everybody.

1493
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:35,920
It is for ...

1494
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:36,620
What?

1495
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:37,060
What?

1496
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:37,380
Two minutes left.

1497
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,080
They were willing to pay for it.

1498
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:41,960
Two minutes and the phones are sitting here looking like ...

1499
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:41,960


1500
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,320
Two minutes and the phones are sitting here looking like something left out of a bad

1501
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:48,340
sci-fi movie when it's the end of the world and everybody's dead and nobody's calling

1502
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:48,700
anybody.

1503
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,580
Oh, it's sad, Reverend Stang.

1504
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,120
You're going to have to play the subgenius leaving theme in just a minute here.

1505
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:58,000
The subgenius funeral march would be more like it.

1506
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,760
Pope Cecilia is getting extremely aggravated.

1507
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:04,320
They're making obscene Gnostic symbols in our direction.

1508
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,280
Well, I guess I've ...

1509
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,360
Well, I like that.

1510
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,860
I'm not going to hang around.

1511
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:15,640
I'm not going to hang around Dallas that much longer, I don't guess.

1512
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:19,620
I think we just need to move the whole church headquarters to Cleveland or somewhere like

1513
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:19,680
that.

1514
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,580
Yeah, you know ...

1515
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:22,520
The faithful pledge in Cleveland.

1516
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:23,660
Yes, indeed, friend.

1517
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:27,320
Bower Slack is on in Cleveland every Sunday night from 9 to 10 just like here.

1518
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,720
They pledge in Madison, Wisconsin too.

1519
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:32,840
They've got a much nicer studio up there too.

1520
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,900
Yeah, and in Madison they keep ...

1521
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:34,920
Madison.

1522
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:35,820
They pledge.

1523
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,900
They don't pay K and O M. They pay the stations there that pledge.

1524
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,840
Yeah, they pledge to their stations that play the Hour of Sin.

1525
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:41,840


1526
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,660
They pledge to their stations that play the Hour of Sin.

1527
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:42,660


1528
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:42,660


1529
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:42,660


1530
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:45,260
They're supporting their Hour of Slack, but we don't get any support.

1531
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:49,800
Well, that's why I've been spending more and more time up there.

1532
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:50,640
There's not much point in dealing with it.

1533
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,340
Yeah, I think it's just ... It's a sad moment.

1534
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:56,940
You know, I guess the Subgenius are all saved here.

1535
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:57,220
Yeah.

1536
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,040
We're just preaching to save.

1537
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,600
I guess we've done our job already.

1538
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,900
I'm just unplugging my earphones and going home.

1539
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:02,500
Yeah.

1540
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,220
They're satisfied.

1541
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,120
They've had enough.

1542
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:08,360
Well, let's just ... Yeah, let's just put on another Subgenius show.

1543
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:09,220
Let's leave.

1544
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,020
Let's leave.

1545
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:10,580
Let's leave.

1546
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:11,280
So long.

1547
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:11,700
Bye.

1548
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,200
All right.

1549
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:13,120
Goodbye, you ...

1550
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:18,600
Flies.

1551
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:19,740
Millions of flies.

1552
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,780
Get them off me.

1553
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,420
Get them off me.

1554
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,320
Get them off me.

1555
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:23,320


1556
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:23,320


1557
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:23,320


1558
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:23,320


1559
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:23,320


1560
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:23,320


1561
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:23,320


1562
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:23,320


1563
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,140
Get them off me.

1564
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,140
Flies.

1565
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,240
Get them off.

1566
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,180
I'm breathing them.

1567
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:38,880
Oh, my god.

1568
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:40,560
Is this for real?

1569
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,400
Insane.
