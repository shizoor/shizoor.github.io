1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
You can stay tuned for hours slack.

2
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,940
And this is KNON 89.3 FM in Dallas, Texas.

3
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:29,980
KNON 89.3 FM

4
00:01:59,720 --> 00:01:59,980
KNON 89.3 FM

5
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,980
KNON 89.3 FM

6
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,520
Ah, White Christmas.

7
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,120
You know, it reminds me, I don't know if you heard this or not,

8
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,100
but supposedly last week, Bing Crosby's youngest boy

9
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,660
put a gun to his head and blew his brains out.

10
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,720
That song just happened to remind me of that.

11
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,260
I understand Bing, the derbingle,

12
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,980
was kind of an orator.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,760
He was an abusive father.

14
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,420
He was into strictness with his children.

15
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,560
You know, he was...

16
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,280
Boy, don't make me get the belt out now.

17
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,500
Make me beat you black and blue now.

18
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,460
I don't want to be doing that.

19
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,900
It has nothing to do with anything at all

20
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,720
with what to do with what this show is about tonight.

21
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,560
And the show tonight is about Christmas.

22
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,980
A subgenius Christmas.

23
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,640
And we're going to be getting to it in just a minute.

24
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,760
If you have any questions about Christmas

25
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:29,980
or...

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,400
for that matter, the Church of the Subgenius

27
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,660
and its avatar of Slack, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

28
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,480
feel free to call the radio station here tonight

29
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,900
at 823-7490

30
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,100
and we'll sit around and yak about Bob or something.

31
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,600
So, uh...

32
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,440
see if the cassette decks are working any better

33
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,820
than the turntables here.

34
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,940
Hold on, please.

35
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,420
The Subgenius Radio Ministry.

36
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,980
All Slack.

37
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,040
All Slack.

38
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,700
One, two, Santa's coming for you.

39
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,700
Three, four, you better lock your door.

40
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,400
Five, six, grab a crucifix.

41
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,740
Seven, eight...

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,460
You better stay out late.

43
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,680
Nine, ten...

44
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,860
Santa's coming again!

45
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,620
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

46
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,140
Daddy, when's Santa be showing with his big red sack?

47
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,660

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,680
Ready St. Nicholas here

85
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,620
This is the story

86
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,820
Of old St. Nick

87
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,500
With his big red sack

88
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,920
And his candy stick

89
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,560
Flying back home

90
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,040
With his beer so ice

91
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,980
I've been licking

92
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,820
That prune tang

93
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,080
All Christmas night

94
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,620
Oh it's Christmas time

95
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,980
It's my time of year

96
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,300
Get your sweet thoughts

97
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:49,680
Moving

98
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's get into gear

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Seven seconds

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Back in

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Ready to go

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,320

To the toe

105
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,800
That was Christmas time

106
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,120
It's my time of year

107
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,460
Get your sweet thoughts

108
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:01,820

00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,520
Let's get into gear

110
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,160
Seven seconds

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,060

116
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,300
That was Christmas time

117
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,320
It's my time of year

118
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,660
Get your sweet thoughts

119
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:13,980
Moving

120
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,580
Let's get into gear

121
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,360
Seven seconds

122
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,240
Back in

123
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,460

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,540

To the toe

127
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,060
That was Christmas time

128
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,160
Get your fine boys

129
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,600
Moving

130
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,240
Let's get into gear

131
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,120
Get your fine boys

132
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:53,300
Oh, so nice to hear Reverend Yukon Jack's Christmas themes again from his kitty cat singing to you, dear friends.

133
00:07:53,300 --> 00:08:22,940
Yes, this is, uh, listen, for those of you doubtful about the hour of slack, stay tuned because I'm going to be playing a Christmas carol so horrible, so anti-human, so absolutely, I mean, believe me, you want a tape of the song, the Christmas carol, that I'm, recorded right here in Dallas, by six sick minds, friends, that I'm going to play about halfway into the show, about 9.30, I guess.

134
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:39,900
Uh, please do stay tuned and keep those recorders running because it's a Christmas show, it's a combination of old Christmas shows, but it's also got a lot of new Christmas because Christmas is fun! Yes, fun! We're having fun, aren't we, Will?

135
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,160
Fun!

136
00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:04,400
And especially the horrible, horrible, horrible hymn, and the Christmas carol is what it is that will come up. Dear, dear friends, it's so purty.

137
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:19,420
Everybody worried about that Tommy Bond, but no one worried about the day my Lord shall come, but he'll hit like an atom bomb when he comes, when he comes.

138
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,360
Well, well, in 1945...

139
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:43,300
The atomic bomb became alive. In 1949, the USA got very wise. They bombed out a country across the line. Had an atom bomb of the very same kind. People got worried all over the land, just like the people got in Japan. But God told Elijah he'd send down fire, send down fire...

140
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,620
Ching, no, no, no. You see these television screens? I'll turn on number one. What do you see?

141
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,600
The White House, the Christmas tree on the lawn.

142
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,460
And here's number two.

143
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,380
Now, what do you see?

144
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,360
I'm not sure. Looks like, yeah, a missile at a rocket site.

145
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:10,720
Very good. That rocket, by the way, is ready for immediate launching and carries a payload of five nuclear warheads, each 100 times as powerful as the Hiroshima bomb.

146
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,360
But what has this got to do with...

147
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,600
Patience, young man. Patience. And now, screen number three.

148
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,860
Another rocket.

149
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,780
And four. And five. And six.

150
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,040
There you are. The whole picture.

151
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,060
Five multiple-head rockets.

152
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:32,200
All tied to the controls in the war room of the Pentagon and targeted on our enemies.

153
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,980
But the only person authorized to push the button is...

154
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,320
Yes?

155
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,360
The President of the United States.

156
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,480
Precisely.

157
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,160
But we're not at war. He's not about to push that button.

158
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,920
Quite right. Not that button. And not knowingly. But there are buttons and buttons.

159
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,640
I still don't...

160
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,760
Like the button that will turn on the lights on that day.

161
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,240
That beautiful Christmas tree.

162
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
On the White House lawn?

163
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,220
Right.

164
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,100
You mean to say that button is tied into the rocket launch system you just showed me?

165
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,500
Now you're getting it. It's tied in by a remote control circuit I secretly installed.

166
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,800
And when the President pushes the button that lights the tree...

167
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,880
Good Lord.

168
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:19,900
For a brief moment, the lights will go on. And then a bomb concealed in one of the tree ornaments will detonate,

169
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,920
destroying everyone in the immediate area.

170
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,540
Including the President?

171
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,120
Especially the President.

172
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:33,520
And simultaneously, five beautiful rockets will soar like avenging angels through the night sky.

173
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,360
And when they reach their targets, they will light up the whole world.

174
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:46,520
Now the passion dissolving and cleansing flame of divine love through this room, building, city...

175
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,680
Even dove nods, even dobbed by...

176
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,840
And through the minds of all beings...

177
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,740
Let's penetrate the sacred radiation.

178
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,880
With your fiery incendiary missiles of mercy,

179
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,760
burn out the hate and normalcy which has sought to subdue our church and our abnormality.

180
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,840
Sure, let's go in.

181
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,640
Purify them with your cleansing radioactive breath till nothing human exists.

182
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,440
And now...

183
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,920
The snow-carrying duck flew off into the air and charged into a million energy-efficient particles

184
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,580
that spread across the entire universe just like their show used to.

185
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,900
And everyone is worried...

186
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,200
My lord about the atomic bomb.

187
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,160
No one is worried, об этом вором

188
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,140
...about the Day my Lord shall come

189
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,420
but he'll hit...

190
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,840
and when he comes...

191
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,720
When he comes...

192
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,200
うた

193
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,820
Subtitle translation by H 도

194
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:49,820


195
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,840
to here

196
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,160
who enjoy the latest in new music.

197
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,860
Back we go.

198
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,540
Oh, dear friends, this is Magic Mose.

199
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,960
What is it? What is this?

200
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
Say, do we have any druids in the audience?

201
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,860
Well, hi, yeah, this one's for you.

202
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,100
Magic Mose and his royal rockers here.

203
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:20,640
Have yourselves a groovy little solstice.

204
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,040
Mithras won his fight.

205
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:37,500
From now on, the days are longer than the nights.

206
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:51,500
Yeah, have yourselves a groovy little solstice.

207
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,180
Nosh out on druid food.

208
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,960
Yeah, make little pigs of yourselves.

209
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:07,140
Then we'll all dance naked in a fair shoe.

210
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,480
If you are a dazzling urbanite,

211
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,660
a smug suburbanite,

212
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,620
hey, that's cool.

213
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:36,140
You don't have to lead a boring country life

214
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,220
to groove on natural life.

215
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,020
As a rule,

216
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,840
someday soon

217
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,000
we'll all dance nude together

218
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,400
if utility rates allow.

219
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,780
You know, those funky Boston Edison guys, you know.

220
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,740
Until then,

221
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,780
we'll don our ritual robes and bow.

222
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:26,040
To have ourselves a groovy little solstice now.

223
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,820
Take it away, guys.

224
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,360
Oh, yeah, all you pagans out there

225
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,900
ought to get into this special Christmas show

226
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,300
here on the Hour of Slack.

227
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,160
This is Magic Mose and his royal rockers.

228
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,080
So, y'all have a good time.

229
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,080


230
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,080


231
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,300
You having a good time this evening, huh?

232
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:45,980
I sure am.

233
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:46,960
Aren't you?

234
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,500
Yeah.

235
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,860
Are they putting boots in the drinks tonight, huh?

236
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,880
Mm-hmm.

237
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,660
Oh, yeah.

238
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,640
Well, remember, folks,

239
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,540
the more you drink, the better we sound.

240
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:55,980
Yeah.

241
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,600
The better I feel.

242
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,560
The more you drink.

243
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,780
Praise Bob.

244
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,140
Oh, it may be witchcraft.

245
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,640
The royal rockers, ladies and gentlemen.

246
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,240
Aren't they wonderful?

247
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
But it's wonderful.

248
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,460
It's wonderful.

249
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:10,620
Thank you.

250
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,420
Thank you very much.

251
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:11,920
Thank you.

252
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,060
Absolutely.

253
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,060
The boys thank you.

254
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,280
Thank you.

255
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,660
All right, thank you.

256
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,880
Oh, we love you.

257
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,140
Hey, we're swinging now.

258
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,160
Yeah.

259
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,360
It is turnover.

260
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,800
The time of the year when all things sell,

261
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,320
the end of the year sale.

262
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,080
Oh, yeah.

263
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,880
So, come and get it, everyone,

264
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,760
and just buy our products.

265
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,100
Now, are we, is Christmas,

266
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,500
I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

267
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,820
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus

268
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,760
or his death when they nailed him?

269
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,860
Well, that,

270
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,000
that's the ancient, ancient subgenie,

271
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,220
but the present subgenie,

272
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,640
try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now

273
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,440
and sell everything to the pigs.

274
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,620
Oh, yes.

275
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,320
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

276
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,580
And it was something else in between there,

277
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,340
but before it was,

278
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,780
after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season,

279
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,200
it was something else,

280
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,920
but I think they started a war over it.

281
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,340
Yeah.

282
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,920
Yeah.

283
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,940
Well, friends, we've got our own special,

284
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,680
special Christmas carol that we're going to play

285
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,280
that's, that we're inventing as we go right now.

286
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:18,780
Ex-esprit.

287
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,080
On the tail.

288
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,960
Come one, come all.

289
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,540
From Bugs Bunny!

290
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,700
The EYZ!

291
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,360
It's He Bob!

292
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,540
Hey, kids, you can help the mighty subgenius,

293
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,420
Rice, overthrow the evil normals

294
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,680
with new Bob Dobbs action figure with Rocket Pie.

295
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,380
What'd I wouldn't do?

296
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,100
From Bob Cutler.

297
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,680
Chocolatey pebbles from you know who.

298
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,020
I'm a chocolate space cadet.

299
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,220
Life support system down to zero cocoa.

300
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,780
Feeling spacey.

301
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,780
Have some of my new cocoa pebbles.

302
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,480
Now so chocolatey.

303
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,720
Smells cocoa-licious.

304
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,980
Space cocoa-licious.

305
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,520
Well, friends, what do you think?

306
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,740
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?

307
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,700
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob?

308
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,540
The Santai Bob, as he's been referred to in some early prescriptures.

309
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,560
It's so separate. It's so separate. It's so separate. It's so separate.

310
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,980
New from Tonga.

311
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,360
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob.

312
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,860
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.

313
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,100
Shut up, pink boy.

314
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,560
No way. I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.

315
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,560
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien tool.

316
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,440
Bob Dobbs comes with rockets, pipe, head launcher, jainer device,

317
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,220
all Yakatisma, Fightin' Jesus, and other action figures sold separately.

318
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,260
Some assembly required, batteries not included.

319
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,700
This toy falls apart in three days.

320
00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,560
He-Bob!

321
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,620
As the bastards of the universe, too much is always better than not enough.

322
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,680
From Bob Dobbs.

323
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,880
Even I came down so separately.

324
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:07,740
Gorgeous.

325
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,660
We girls can blow from head to toe.

326
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,760
Like Barbie.

327
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,700
Ron Stoller.

328
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,640
Everything you see here.

329
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
You can't tell us all separately.

330
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,100
He-Man, He-Man.

331
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,040
Now to touch my thunder punch.

332
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,000
You hear it here.

333
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,060
But you feel it there.

334
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,220
Skeletor figure, Castle Grayskull and Thunder Punch He-Man figure each sold separately.

335
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,120
You put the castle together.

336
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,280
With He-Man over there, Grayskull will be mine.

337
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,740
Like I said, bone face.

338
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,500
You hear the thunder here.

339
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,620
But I feel the punch here.

340
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,920
Feel Thunder Punch He-Man.

341
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,940
New from the Masters of the Universe collection.

342
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,200
Skeletor and Castle Grayskull each sold separately.

343
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,500
But Hogan's Rock and Wrestling Club will return.

344
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,380
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.

345
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,160
Santa Claus.

346
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,700
Here's Grubot.

347
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,460
A robot you can program to perform eight different functions.

348
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,180
Upsy Baby.

349
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,020
Upsy Baby.

350
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,060
The doll that stands up.

351
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,900
She's new.

352
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,000
From Kenner.

353
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,080
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

354
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,000
We must buy our toys.

355
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:13,180
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

356
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,620
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

357
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,280
It will be powerless to resist, 영상slayer.해요 thì  china b cach ở nhưng n funciona.

358
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:26,100

360
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,680
For the usual plus expenses.

361
00:20:48,360 --> 00:21:00,220
Good. This covenant has been required in the archives of reality.

362
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:07,260
Okay, I think the girls will have the strawberry rainbow bites.

363
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:17,220
And for Lloyd, little tiny transformer robots have changed into dollar bills and back again.

364
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,980
Yes, but how will the battle of the

365
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:28,740
be represented in your marketing schemes, you heard me?

366
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,940
Good has lots of muscles.

367
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,000
Good.

368
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,780
Good!

369
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,380
Good!

370
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:42,360
The primitive earth societies should accept this value judgment.

371
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:50,040
Good will have pre-physical attributes according to human desires,

372
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,820
sexual desires, latent in children,

373
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:02,640
brought out through the vehicle of this so-called

374
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
So-called pharmaceutical exploits at church?

375
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,780
That is not included.

376
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,280
Skull farmers, that's good.

377
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,320
I think that may sell to the humans.

378
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,800
Skull farmers, little white duck bobs.

379
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:29,060
Hundreds of little bobs, each whispering their messages in the night to the little children as they sleep.

380
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,880
Too much is always better than not enough.

381
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:41,460
Too much is always better than not enough.

382
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,040
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad.

383
00:22:49,660 --> 00:23:00,760
When everybody sells, we're all selling.

384
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,360
But we all have something to sell.

385
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,680
Yes, everyone selling together.

386
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:32,400
According to super snackies, man's Jenna was 1980 years old by then.

Un Message

390
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:43,460
Sure, son. All of us moms have TVs, so we know that polyester hoes are just chock-full of conspiracy genetic coding and administrative byproducts.

391
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:53,340
That's right, Mom. One serving of polyester hoes can turn your blue-collar children into what appears to be a bag of pink pus stuffed into a white shirt and tie.

392
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:59,300
And remember, there's a whole dead executive in every can of Chunky Style Polyester Hoes.

393
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:11,920
You have lost your reward. You shall enter heaven as a servant without a single soul to your credit.

394
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:20,920
It's unfair. It's so unfair. I've worked so hard for the kingdom all these years. It's unfair that I should lose all my credits now.

395
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,860
You knew all of this before you backslid. Show him his record.

396
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,460
January 3rd, 1970.

397
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:43,700
But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live?

398
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:53,960
All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned. In his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.

399
00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:02,100
This simply means that if you backslide, turn away from God, all the rewards that you've accumulated shall be lost.

400
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,420
And if you do not, you shall be

401
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:19,320
You mean you aren't going to church again today?

402
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:25,100
Baby, don't bother me. You know there's some on the day off. I don't have to live in church to be saved.

403
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,820
Dana, if you aren't careful, you're going to miss out with the Lord completely.

404
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,920
Come on, Kim.

405
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,580
Well, my son, you heard the word.

406
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,640
I think we're all going to miss out on the Lord.

407
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,300
You were warned.

408
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,680
Were you so foolish as you think you could outwit the law of God?

409
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,500
No, we actually are not.

410
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,920
You have returned and have been saved as of our...

411
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,640
See, friends, here's the thing.

412
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,020
When they told us that we were damned and we're going to go to hell, you know, what else could we do but start a church?

413
00:25:59,260 --> 00:25:59,980
Ah, yes.

414
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,000
But the glory and the splendor that could have...

415
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,480
Switch over.

416
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,140
We're going to some...

417
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,420
What have we got here on turntable one, I think?

418
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,680
Throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity is an awful price to pay.

419
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,320
It is an awful price to pay.

420
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,540
Mom, Buck's calling you.

421
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,040
And we do...

422
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,240
We're going to seriously address this issue.

423
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,180
But in the meantime, we have the problem of who is the Santa Bob?

424
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,820
Were there any readings here on the Santa Bob?

425
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,660
Didn't you have I'm a Bob on the show last week?

426
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,120
No.

427
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,140
We had a show before and we had to pay...

428
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,940
Yeah, that's right.

429
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,340
That's right.

430
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,260
We did have the I'm a Bob on the show last week.

431
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:40,900
It's a...

432
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,260
It's a Bob and a Euro Bob.

433
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,560
Santa Bob and Maria.

434
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:49,240
But, you know, we ought to talk a little bit about where Bob's and I'm a Bob's tonight, Reverend Stang.

435
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,980
I can sense a little bit of that coming on Red Room Stang.

436
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,260
The where Bob's and I'm a...

437
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:58,540
Those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.

438
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,340
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.

439
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,580
And they go shuffling through the...

440
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,480
The snow on their nameless, hideous errands.

441
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:13,680
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

442
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,780
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float in through the keyhole.

443
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,180
Oh, friends, it's tough.

444
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,980
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.

445
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,340
You gotta send your money to the Santa Bob.

446
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,480
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids...

447
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,240
That Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.

448
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,160
Can you believe that?

449
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,100
They asked...

450
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,200
The kids were asking if their parents...

451
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,760
Maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.

452
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,380
And the mom said, no, no, he won't because he bills us.

453
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,360
We can't afford that.

454
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,180
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.

455
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,920
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

456
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,860
Yeah, what kind of a Christmas season is this where Santa Claus is starting to bill you?

457
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,760
And the delivery.

458
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,220
Can you imagine the delivery?

459
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,320
The cost of bringing that stuff up from the North Pole?

460
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,880
That's going to be added on, too, friends.

461
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,140
Even the Gimme Bob's sort of pale into comparison with that.

462
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:13,780
Yeah.

463
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,500
Well, friends, we've got to play a public service cartridge here.

464
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,100
It says on the log.

465
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,060
I hope you're enjoying the music.

466
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:26,580
But when we come back, we're going to play part one of our collection of Christmas music.

467
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,260
So, genius style.

468
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,520
We've got the Santa's on a Diet by Zug's Rift.

469
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,560
Santa Claus is Coming to Rape Your Wife.

470
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,460
by Mechanical Sterility.

471
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:35,800
Mommy?

472
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,920
And the Manson Family Christmas.

473
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:38,960
Mom?

474
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,280
So, here it be, folks.

475
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,600
Santa's on a Diet.

476
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,620
Now he has to eat instead of those stupid candy canes.

477
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,760
It all started when he accidentally sat on one of his elves.

478
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,460
.

479
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,640

00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,440


544
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,440


545
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,440


546
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,440


547
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,440


548
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,440


549
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,440


550
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:40,500
His famous white beard was long enough to cover his tiny penis, which had gone soft in the cold shower.

551
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,020
Everyone had to leave the steam room, so Santa would have room to sit down.

552
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:59,020
Some idiot threw him a medicine ball, but it bounced off his belly and knocked down the wall like the Battle of Gettysburg and the Battle of the Bulge.

553
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:16,020
But when he got home, nobody recognized him. Instead of a chimney, he could fit through a keyhole like a skeleton key.

554
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:33,560
And this one, dear friends, is Santa Claus is Coming to Rape Your Wife by a band called Mechanical.

555
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:44,240
The singer, I think, is Reverend M. Schaefer of the Church of the Subgenius. Listen to this beautiful, beautiful song.

556
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,120
The music is a little bit like a traditional music, but it's a little bit more than that.

557
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,120


558
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:11,920
But, uh, it's a little bit more than a traditional music.

559
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:20,100
Oh, one, sorry about what we said just a few minutes ago. No offense. And don't tape anything you hear, okay? Don't tape anything.

560
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:32,560
KNON 89.3 FM has the most diversified programming around, and nowhere is it more true than on Sundays.

561
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,560
Starting at 5, the show is going to be a little bit more than that.

562
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:33,560


563
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:33,560


564
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,460
Starting at 12 noon, KNON features programs other stations only dream about running.

565
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:46,460
Beyond Bows and Arrows, The Jewish Hour, Lambda Weekly, Celtic Crossroads, The Cajun Show, Varied Voices, and The Hour of Slack.

566
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:54,340
Now, KNON is going one step further by offering you the opportunity to underwrite these seven programs for a mere $35 a week.

567
00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:02,040
You heard right, $35 a week. Imagine, seven shows and ten hours of programming, all for only $35 a week.

568
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,540
For complete details, visit KNON.com.

569
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:11,720
For more details on this wonderful opportunity, call me, Ruben Artemides, at 823-1327, Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.

570
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:17,560
Again, that's 823-1327, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.

571
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,220
Take advantage of this. It's KNON's Super Sunday Special.

572
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,960
And he's got a big night.

573
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,800
Manifest is coming to rage your wife.

574
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,400
Music

575
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,440
Music

576
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,440


577
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,920
Music

578
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,420
Music

579
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:54,560
Music

580
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:55,860
Music

581
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,460
Music

582
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:56,460


583
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,540
Music

584
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:03,920
Music

585
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,120
Music

586
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,120
Music

587
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,300
Music

588
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,680
Music

589
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,400
Back in separate baggies

590
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:37,520
Mrs. Claus has disappeared

591
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,380
Is that blood in Santa's beard?

592
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,580
Christmas time again, I fear

593
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,040
Santa cooks up a mean reindeer stew

594
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,900
Daughter's Gibson

595
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,880
And Rudolph's tea

596
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,380
Quite tasty

597
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:57,300
He knows when you've been sleeping

598
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,480
He knows when you're awake

599
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,480
He knows if you've been bad or good

600
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,520
So be good for goodness sake

601
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,920
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife

602
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,660
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife

603
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:21,660


604
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,980
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife

605
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:32,080
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife

606
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,600
Oh, yes, dear friends.

607
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,880
That's a problem with Reverend Stang.

608
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,960
He just stops in the middle of a sentence like that sometimes.

609
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,800
And he often starts up.

610
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,680
Ho, ho, ho!

611
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,640
Ho, ho, ho!

612
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,560
Merry Christmas!

613
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,280
Mrs. Claus!

614
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,760
Oh, yes, dear friends.

615
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,320
Christmas.

616
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,320
The season of turnover

617
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,120
when the shelves must be cleared.

618
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,400
I can't get that call right now, dear friends.

619
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,860
You know, I got, I got,

620
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,180
after all these friendly calls,

621
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,580
I got one call from some,

622
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,060
somebody who, who said,

623
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,820
what are y'all, the usual thing,

624
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,920
the usual question.

625
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,300
What are y'all trying to do?

626
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,000
And I go,

627
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,340
we're trying to give you some slack, okay?

628
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,620
You know, they go, who's Bob?

629
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,440
I said, well, give me your address

630
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,400
and I'll send you some information.

631
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,280
Or whatever, you know,

632
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,640
I'll give the number at the end of the broadcast.

633
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,160
And they, uh,

634
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,160
and, and this person, you know,

635
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,940
I knew there was something that they weren't saying.

636
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,260
And finally, he goes,

637
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,240
well, I just hope that,

638
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,100
it was something like,

639
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,080
I just hope that, you know,

640
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,320
you can get right with Jesus

641
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,460
or something like that.

642
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,120
And just hung up.

643
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:40,820
He hung up.

644
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,000
That was the key point.

645
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,460
He said he didn't want to hear

646
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,920
what I had to say back about that

647
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,860
because, you know, see,

648
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,960
a subgenius has so much faith

649
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,060
that,

650
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,020
that he not only can accept

651
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,900
somebody making fun of Bob,

652
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,480
stomping on a picture of Bob,

653
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,500
he'll do it himself.

654
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,840
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.

655
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,020
Bob is such a good friend

656
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,480
that he can insult Bob.

657
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,940
Now, we subgeni,

658
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,460
I hate to get on my soapbox

659
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,040
in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,

660
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,440
but we subgeni may be bad,

661
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,680
but our way of bad is holy,

662
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,640
is holy compared to the evil

663
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,740
of so, not all,

664
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,760
by any means,

665
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,020
but so many American fundamentalist,

666
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,160
charismatic evangelicals,

667
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,840
et cetera, in general.

668
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,660
Of course,

669
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,860
they and their corresponding types

670
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,380
in Iran, Russia, Libya,

671
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,300
South Africa, et cetera,

672
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,520
if you ask me,

673
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,840
are actually the ace

674
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,320
up the devil's sleeve.

675
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,720
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends,

676
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,280
just like Jesus warned about.

677
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,660
I, we're,

678
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,740
Jesus and Bob, like we say,

679
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
our old drinking buddies,

680
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,140
got nothing against Jesus.

681
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,000
It's just his fan club.

682
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,200
And now, we aren't saying that Bob

683
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,840
is the ace up God's,

684
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,660
he's more like the smear on God's handkerchief,

685
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,540
just like you or me.

686
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,800
But the uptight rival cults,

687
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,460
they don't think God has a handkerchief.

688
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,060
Uh-uh, no,

689
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,580
because God's perfect.

690
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,300
He doesn't even sneeze.

691
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,360
We're made in his image,

692
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,360
except that we have all these nasty parts

693
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,160
attached to us,

694
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,320
and we have to go in the secret room,

695
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,740
the bathroom,

696
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,640
to do awful things.

697
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,800
But God, oh, he's clean and pure,

698
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,020
according to them.

699
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,860
Oh, and he's male,

700
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,920
but he doesn't excrete juices.

701
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,420
He doesn't sweat and smelly stuff

702
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,440
out of him like we do,

703
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,220
because we sin.

704
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,580
Oh, yeah, we all sin.

705
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,480
We're bad.

706
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,320
We're worthless.

707
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,080
We're no good to God

708
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,100
unless we sign a contract with his agent.

709
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,640
Well, friend, Jesus himself,

710
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,800
he spouted just about as many great punchlines

711
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,020
as Bob, probably more.

712
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,280
But, and this is true,

713
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,600
this is historical fact,

714
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,000
the very early mainstream Christian church

715
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,200
methodically censored about half

716
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,900
of the existing gospels about Jesus.

717
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,660
And this, I'm not kidding,

718
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,080
you can go to any real bookstore

719
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,700
and pick up the censored gospels

720
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,920
that they finally found years later.

721
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,340
They took out the parts

722
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,420
where Jesus specifically said

723
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,240
that every person had equal access

724
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,200
to the Lord,

725
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,760
and that you didn't need no preacher

726
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,680
between you and him.

727
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,060
That, in fact, was probably his main point,

728
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,600
now lost in antiquity,

729
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,180
that you were the son or daughter of God

730
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,800
just as much as Jesus was,

731
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,220
or Bob, see?

732
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,160
But that's too humanistic

733
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,900
for the consumerist.

734
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:35,420
Listen, this is very, very important

735
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:35,680
because every second switching

736
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,640
any matter of sources

737
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:39,640


738
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:39,640


739
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:39,640


740
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:39,700
perspective on the gospel,

741
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,660
you should just look straight

742
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:41,700
into your heart.

743
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:48,900
Say No to this prison system.

744
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,420

Ride on, ride on, ride on, ride on.

748
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:15,420
I am yours truly, Rudy Ray Moore, bold and still beautiful.

749
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,820
Baby, I want to talk to you for this Christmas.

750
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,700
Because Christmas holds a lot of memories for me.

751
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,620
Baby, I've had a lot of hard times at Christmastime.

752
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:30,100
I can remember me and my brother when I was about six years old.

753
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:35,000
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece and the health department made us take them down.

754
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,440
Baby, me and my brother wore tennis shoes so long.

755
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,040
Now let me tell you how long we wore them.

756
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,260
We wore tennis shoes Indian summer, Easter, Thanksgiving.

757
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,080
Thanksgiving, Halloween day, New Year's and Christmas.

758
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,160
Baby, we wore our tennis shoes so long till we wore them out up to the name on the ankle.

759
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,420
When we got ready to lay down, we didn't take them off.

760
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,560
All we had to do was fold them back, baby.

761
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,040
I remember my father well, you know.

762
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,820
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.

763
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,900
He used to have, you know what caused it then?

764
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,100
He used to put a...

765
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,880
stocking cap on his head and put a knock light in front of it.

766
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,300
Daddy wake up with that bumping headache.

767
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,180
And he said, the kid said, my head's hurting so bad.

768
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,320
He said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas, but he's going to bring you something.

769
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:38,460
So Daddy took that old rifle and went outside and shot up in the air and come back inside and told us the biggest lie I ever heard.

770
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,380
He said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.

771
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,600
Amen!

772
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,100
Amen!

773
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:44,620
Amen!

774
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:45,560
Amen!

Amen!

776
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:45,960
Amen!

777

Amen!

778
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:46,720
Amen!

779
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


780
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


781
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


782
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


783
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


784
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


785
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


786
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


787
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


788
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


789
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


790
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


791
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


792
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


793
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


794
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720


795
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:47,720
Amen!

796
00:41:59,140 --> 00:41:59,740
Amen!

797
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:00,840
Amen!

798
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,820
On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me

799
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:13,460
three pounds of grass, 200 reds and a tab of yellow sunshine LSD.

800
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:18,140
On the fourth day of Christmas my true love gave to me

801
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:25,320
Four grams of hash, three pounds of grass, two hundred reds, and a tab of yellow sunshine LSD

802
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:32,880
On the fifth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me five Valiums

803
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:41,000
Four grams of hash, three pounds of grass, two hundred reds, and a tab of yellow sunshine LSD

804
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:50,060
On the sixth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me six joints of smoking, five Valiums

805
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:58,260
Four grams of hash, three pounds of grass, two hundred reds, and a tab of yellow sunshine LSD

806
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,060
On the seventh day of Christmas, my true love gave to me

807
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:10,020
Well, yes, Ivan, thanks for coming out to Dobstown here,

808
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:10,980
and I wanted to thank you for coming out to Dobstown.

809
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:10,980


810
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,540
I wanted to show you the...

811
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:17,540
Oh, look at these little scamps, and to think these used to be slackless children.

812
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,860
What did you kids say?

813
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,920
Oh, yes.

814
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,020
That's so darling.

815
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,700
Does that warm my Bob Glander or what?

816
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,220
Yeah, hey, would you like to use one of these kids?

817
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:27,920
Yeah, yeah, I...

818
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,440
Warm it up a little more? They're available.

819
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,040
Yeah, uh...

820
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,840
A discount for our...

821
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:36,200
Our subscribers, uh, our church family subscribers

822
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,780
can adopt one of these little scamps for a mere, oh, a couple thousand,

823
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,740
on top of your usual annual fee, and...

824
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,700
That's right, put them to work.

825
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:43,920
Yeah.

826
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,020
Take them home, put them to work.

827
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:45,360
Ugh.

828
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,040
They've been trained, and they'll do all sorts of tricks.

829
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,160
They've been trained to slack off.

830
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,240
Just try to get work out of some of these little guys.

831
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,320
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

832
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,680
Print Bob!

833
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,840
And the X-Men!

834
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,900
On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me

835
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,380
Twelve kids that dreamt of love and magic mushrooms,

836
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:10,980
Ten of them...

837
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


838
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


839
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


840
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,820
Nine yoddy buttons,

841
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,200
Nine caps of dropping,

842
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,760
Eight spoons of smorgasbord,

843
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,040
Seven whites of buzzing,

844
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,580
Six joints of smorgasbord,

845
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,880
Five alleles,

846
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,400
Four grams of hash,

847
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,780
Three pounds of grass,

848
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,280
Two hundred mills,

849
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,180
And a tab of pure, whole,

850
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,920
Unshined LSD!

851
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,860
One day, the rabbit woke up and realized he wanted a hamburger.

852
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:57,600
Boy!

853
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,180
Said the rabbit to himself.

854
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,200
A hamburger would sure hit the spot right now.

855
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,460
But, having never had a hamburger,

856
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,620
The rabbit was at a loss as to where one could be found.

857
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,440
I know.

858
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,180
He said.

859
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,720
I'll ask my old friend.

860
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,900
The chestnut tree.

861
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,380
Ap!

862
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,060
You.

863
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,080
From Tonka.

864
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,580
Now you're in my evil clutches, Bob.

865
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,160
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.

866
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,200
Shut up,umuzikی!

867
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,940
No way, I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.

868
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,940
Cus a little of my rocket pipe alien tool?

869
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,140
1990 B respond

870
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:32,700
Hmph MiiS

871
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,820
Two the ear finished

872
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,820
Boys let' s a fuc

873
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,200
Can wrestle

874
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,380
Double or passes

875
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:36,740
Federation

876
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:36,980
preceding

877
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:36,980


878
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:36,980


879
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,200
As Sonya

880
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:40,980


881
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:40,980


882
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:40,980


883
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:52,000
I love him. I adore him. My breath, my sunshine.

884
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:57,440
Then all sorts of serious problems in the Church of the Subgenius,

885
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,500
many of which include trying to find the right equipment in the radio station,

886
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:15,860
with so many confusing issues at hand, including whether or not the Santa did actually die at the hands of the cavalry

887
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:25,820
that day on the Mount of Skulls, or whether the over-modulation can be helped at some time in the far future.

888
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,180
So, friends, this is a song about...

889
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,480
Oh, I see, I see, I can control that he comes in and out.

890
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:32,740
I can control that he comes in and out of here.

891
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,940
We can now control the hiss.

892
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:45,900
That means that their minds can likewise be controlled by subliminal messages planted in the hiss that goes out with this show.

893
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,380
Stay there.

894
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,620
Please stay there.

895
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,500
I'll be right back.

896
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,860
Remember, we're commanding, not asking.

897
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,280
So be firm.

898
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,480
Don't keep quiet.

899
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,380
Don't keep quiet.

900
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,300
Don't keep quiet.

901
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,120
Don't keep quiet.

902
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:10,920
Don't keep quiet.

903
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,680
Don't keep quiet.

904
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,660
Don't keep quiet.

905
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,720
Don't keep quiet.

906
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,840
Don't keep quiet.

907
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:23,040
Don't keep quiet.

908
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,640
Don't keep quiet.

909
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,640
Don't keep quiet.

910
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,740
you've heard of it out of New Jersey.

911
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:38,440
Toilet Suck is a fantastic cultural artifact.

912
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:42,200
And what we're playing right now, friends,

913
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:46,420
is an album by this fellow.

914
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,940
It says,

915
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,780
The irritating sounds heard on this recording

916
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,600
are not intended to be digested as reenactments of actual events.

917
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,220
Sounds based on personal activity.

918
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,920
Monsoon familiar mechanized calf Jesus.

919
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,860
And it is copyrighted.

920
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,980
The name of this tune is

921
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,520
The Manson Family Christmas.

922
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:58,520
The Manson Family Christmas

923
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,220
It's a game, it's always been a game

924
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:04,280
Shortly after Shady and I

925
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,800
Got new words she do enjoy

926
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,220
Creepy crawlies let down

927
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,300
We have to let love happen

928
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,780
Charlie is our love

929
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,360
We are Charlie's love

930
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,440
It's our one

931
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,300
It's all happening now

932
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,440
Listen to that beautiful

933
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,440
Charlie Manson Family Christmas.

934
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,060
Yes.

935
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,700
You know, that was, those were

936
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,760
different kind of family values, I think, in those days.

937
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:42,260
But who says the 60s can't live again here in the 80s?

938
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,540
And now, your local multinational corporation presents

939
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:52,240
some energy-saving holiday tips from Mr. Abernathy.

940
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:55,980
Hello.

941
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:56,560
Hello.

942
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,640
Your local multinational corporation

943
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,200
has sent you a message.

944
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,180
Send me to this remote point in Australia

945
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,580
to prove a point.

946
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,180
Conservation can be dangerous.

947
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,580
In this remote aboriginal village

948
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,300
just outside of Sydney, Australia,

949
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,560
the natives were told by their government

950
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,660
to slow down in their consumption

951
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,420
of gasoline and fossil fuels.

952
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,840
Unfortunately, the files

953
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,220
in the government energy office

954
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,460
on this town were lost.

955
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,080
So, nobody bothered to tell them

956
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,760
when it was okay to go back

957
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,040
to normal energy use.

958
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,860
Sadly enough, this town has become

959
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,500
the victim of what we call an energy surplus.

960
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,880
And the natives have been forced to convert

961
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,460
many of their dishwashers, lawn mowers, and refrigerators

962
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,680
into these homemade, energy-hungry,

963
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,960
miniature racing guards.

964
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,960
Boys and girls in the village between the ages of 14 and 20

965
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,980
must stay behind the wheels of these primitive, high-speed,

966
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,440
and dangerous machines for up to 90 hours at a stretch,

967
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,860
just so their village can receive the next fuel shipment

968
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,820
from their local multinational distributor.

969
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,840
And we'll keep on shipping it on our way.

970
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,320
The

971
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,240
carbon monoxide, the silent winter killer, lurks everywhere.

972
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,520
So, if you have a gas stove,

973
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,240
oil burner, or open flame,

974
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,840
make sure all the doors and windows in the room

975
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,220
are tightly sealed so that none of that nasty carbon monoxide

976
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,080
can sneak in.

977
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,780
Thanks, and happy holidays.

978
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:42,660
This is Mr. Abernathy signing off from your town to you.

979
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,540
Scott, you made your choice.

980
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,920
You rejected my word, you rejected me.

981
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,500
And to your eternal soul.

982
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,860
You have found that only could you afford to give to God

983
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:09,660
that which was his, but you could not afford to do otherwise.

984
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,800
The Senate still stands.

985
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:20,180
From deep into outer darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.

986
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,400
Sir, please, give me just one more chance, sir.

987
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,580
I don't want to go to hell, sir!

988
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,600
No, no, no!

989
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:27,900
I have been found.

990
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:28,280


991
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:28,480
I have been found.

992
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:28,480


993
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:28,480


994
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,960
Let go of my God of hell!

995
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:32,420
No!

996
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,140
...as reliable as he could be.

997
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:44,900
And the children saved who could laugh and play just the same as you and me.

998
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,160
The talebearer will be at the judgment.

999
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:53,760
I suspect that here will be a special place in hell for such beings.

1000
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,460
David the Psalmist said in Psalms 50 and 1 and 3,

1001
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,240
Lord, who may abide in thy tabernacle,

1002
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,020
who may dwell on thy holy mountain,

1003
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,160
the man of blameless life,

1004
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,920
who does that which is right and speaks the truth from his heart,

1005
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,420
who has no malice on his tongue,

1006
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,380
who never wrongs a plan and tells no lies,

1007
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,760
who never steps forward on the road to peace.

1008
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:17,600
Thank you.

1009
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,460
There will be those who have destroyed the lives and reputation of others.

1010
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,220
These Gospers will be cast.

1011
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,860
Into the lowest, darkest pit.

1012
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:25,700
I'll be turning.

1013
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,940
They're going to be cast.

1014
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:27,800
Oh, the next dependence.

1015
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:28,820
Into the pit.

1016
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:29,940
Mommy?

1017
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:31,320
Oh.

1018
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,800
Why do my feet hurt so bad, Mommy?

1019
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:35,620
Um.

1020
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,460
Pastor Naked?

1021
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,140
I mean, Dr. DeBrogfran?

1022
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,220
If you need to do your public service messages,

1023
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,720
this is a good time to do it.

1024
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,580
We can, we can, uh.

1025
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,260
Oh, oh, we got a phone call.

1026
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,120
Yep.

1027
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,080
Oh.

1028
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,220
No.

1029
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,680
They wanted to know if we could do the, uh,

1030
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,940
mention the curse of Neegie over the air,

1031
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,340
but we're not allowed to mention the name of Neegie.

1032
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,060
No, whatever.

1033
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,380
We really shouldn't talk about Neegie over the air

1034
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,160
because he's a demon.

1035
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,600
You know, for every Bob particle, there is a Neegie particle,

1036
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,720
and for every Santa Claus particle,

1037
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,680
there's a Bill that comes in the mail.

1038
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,120
No, don't fall for it.

1039
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,020
For wherever you find Bob, you must also find Neegie.

1040
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:23,740
Neegie.

1041
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:23,740


1042
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:23,740


1043
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:23,740


1044
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:23,740


1045
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:23,740


1046
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:23,740


1047
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:23,860
That's true.

1048
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:28,540
There's a dark side to the cult and to the Santa Bob.

1049
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,140
You know, friends, because if you better watch out,

1050
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,000
you better not cry,

1051
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,180
you better not, uh,

1052
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,460
You can't hide from Santa Claus.

1053
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,900
You can't hide from Santa Claus.

1054
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,600
That's right, friends.

1055
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,520
You just better not.

1056
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,020
Whatever you do, don't do it.

1057
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,900
You haven't told him about jingle farking bells yet.

1058
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:48,480
No.

1059
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,080
Jingle farking bells, jingle farking bells,

1060
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,800
jingle jingle any day.

1061
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,700
Oh, what gosh darned fun it is to ride

1062
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,280
in an old Corvair with the top down in the dead of winter.

1063
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,580
Oh, it's another lovely Christmas hamper.

1064
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,580
Friends, try to imagine

1065
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:11,900
somewhere in the snowy north,

1066
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:17,960
the Santa Bob trudging mindlessly through the Himalayan snows,

1067
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,660
driven by strange forces to complete his nameless,

1068
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,020
errant, and he may show up at your house.

1069
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:31,860
My friend, if you've been a bad subgenius or a halfway subgenius,

1070
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,160
or if we keep getting tangled up in these other shows

1071
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,840
and having strange microphone situations.

1072
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,100
Oh, hell swami?

1073
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,480
I was wondering, I didn't mean to cut off your, uh,

1074
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,480
your, uh, hymnal there.

1075
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,040
I didn't mean to interfere with your freedom of religion or anything.

1076
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,640
Well, I know, Dr. Stang, that you wouldn't have in your heart to do something as,

1077
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,120
uh, despicable as that.

1078
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,140
No, I wonder what happens if I push this, though.

1079
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,340
It's, it's supposed to close the gateway that'll keep those other shows out.

1080
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:00,600
Hold it.

1081
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,700
Easy it was to dip on the floor.

1082
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,980
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1083
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:05,480
Voices.

1084
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,220
Huh?

1085
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:06,840
The sky.

1086
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:07,920
And you shall see.

1087
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:13,460
Friends, we're once again attempting to do our Christmas show in one channel only.

1088
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,180
Is that a mic?
