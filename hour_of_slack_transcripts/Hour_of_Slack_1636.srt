1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
Listen.

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,980
Alright, on one.

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,120
Going up in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,180
The Strong Genius Power of Squatting.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,860
We'll meet again at midnight.

6
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,200
10-4 Beanie, head full of fear.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,780
Microwaves won't find me here.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I detect a conspiracy smell.

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,520
I want to know who's at the wheel.

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,200
Who's at the wheel?

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,940
Who's at the reins?

12
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,300
Who's the little voice inside of my brain?

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,880
Starts with a whisper, ends with a squeal.

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,980
I want to know.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,980
Who's at the wheel?

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,800
Fidel Johnson, mafia spies.

17
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,140
I don't really think that Kennedy died.

18
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,560
They took him to the moon, that would be so.

19
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,980
But I'm pretty damn sure that they didn't really go.

20
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,840
Who's at the wheel?

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,420
Who's at the reins?

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,820
Who's the little voice inside of my brain?

23
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,820
Starts with a whisper, ends with a squeal.

24
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,920
I want to know.

25
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,560
Who's at the wheel?

26
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,600
Kenyan Muslims ruin our lives.

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,600
Al Qaeda camps, drones in the sky.

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,000
A man with a mustache plotting a deal.

29
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,860
I want to know.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,560
Who's at the wheel?

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,920
My paranoia's an avalanche.

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,380
When I find out I want to crap my pants.

33
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,940
The hard, hard truth.

34
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,640
The real, real deal.

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,000
God, I fear nobody's at the wheel.

36
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,800
Who's at the wheel?

37
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,340
Who's at the reins?

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,700
Who's that little voice inside of my brain?

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,240
Starts with a whisper, ends with a squeal.

40
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,780
I want to know.

41
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,460
Who's at the wheel?

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,040
Who's at the wheel?

43
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,660
Who's at the wheel?

44
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,320
Who's at the wheel?

45
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,980
Who's at the wheel?

46
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,660
Who's at the wheel?

47
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,240
Who's at the wheel?

48
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,920
I want to know.

49
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,720
Who's at the wheel?

50
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,580
Who raised up brain squelchy, made it glisten with pink,

51
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,760
and served up big stupid so yous all take a drink?

52
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,320
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

53
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,280
Who spends Sunday morning praising in church,

54
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,380
then bants from the touchdown when he's doing God's work?

55
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,940
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

56
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,940
Look, if I'm laundry, won't you come out tonight?

57
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,260
With your cowboys in the heat and sweet Jesus inside.

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,300
Crumphish on pickup trucks, who could it be?

59
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,720
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

60
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,240
Who dance around naked with long dangling meat?

61
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,660
Down at the schoolyard, let the girls get a peek.

62
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,300
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

63
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,400
Who says he's sorry for what he's done?

64
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,900
For being pre-birded and flashing his buns?

65
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,460
He's a good ball player.

66
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,880
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

67
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,240
Could Roger Stavok be the governor's team?

68
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,260
Illegal abortions and white bread to eat?

69
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,500
Ask Jimmy Creighton, you happen to see,

70
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,640
about the Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

71
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,440
I just want to kill for God.

72
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,840
I just want to kill for God.

73
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,100
I just want to kill for God.

74
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,340
I just want to kill for God.

75
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,340
I just want to kill for God.

76
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,800
Who made roly poly, roly poly, roly poly?

77
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,780
Hot dang, it's spicy cheese ball.

78
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,580
Let all them friends and neighbors come a-calling,

79
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,840
cause anything's good if it sits on a wrist.

80
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,160
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

81
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,240
What kind of thing is it what's got one head like this?

82
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,440
The head like Andrea Dworkin.

83
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,140
The other head like Bob Tilton.

84
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,100
And two scoops of raisins, cause that's the only way he could get it to

85
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,000
sit up straight at the gawd darn table.

86
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,040
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

87
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,000
Yip-de-tum-lundry, won't you come out tonight?

88
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,500
Put your hair up in curlers, pull your nipple rings tight.

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,620
Stretch your urethra around the sycamore tree.

90
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,820
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

91
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,840
Yip-de-tum-lundry, won't you come out tonight?

92
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,340
Put your hair up in curlers, pull your nipple rings tight.

93
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,400
Stretch your urethra around the sycamore tree.

94
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,640
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

95
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,080
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

96
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,660
Me, Jesus and me.

97
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,580
I'm not driving for the touchdown sky.

98
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,620
In case you didn't know it, the world ends tomorrow,

99
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,260
and you may die!

100
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,460
Game from the start to steal my large flat.

101
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,220
They build the vastness, fear of streets, but we never get it back.

102
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,960
This way back.

103
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,980
In 63, Jehovah one-voiced boom.

104
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,600
He spoke the earth through chastity, through a TV tune.

105
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,280
He made a prophet of a simple man, not a stupid bum will groom.

106
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,120
He's brought the beauty and the kindness for the world too.

107
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,820
Whoa!

108
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,320
The union has built a church.

109
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,360
Not put on 10 bus stripes.

110
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,040
For $35 down.

111
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,000
Seeking to save your lives.

112
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,220
It's so tedious.

113
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,860
It's the worst.

114
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,900
Hard time ever, stiff and hard.

115
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,180
And come next day, we'll fly away from the comfort of our backyard.

116
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,340
Whoa!

117
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,440
Slim sumo career of the country.

118
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,240
I'm starting to feel serious.

119
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,640
B.O.B.

120
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:25,640


121
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,960
B.O.B.

122
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,660
Bob.

123
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,840
B.O.B.

124
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:31,840


125
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:31,840


126
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,320
B.O.B.

127
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,000
Bob.

128
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,620
Wow!

129
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,460
Bob.

130
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,520
B.O.B.

131
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,440
Bob.

132
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:38,440


133
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:38,440


134
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,900
B.O.B.

135
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,900
Bob.

136
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,560
B.O.B.

137
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:43,560


138
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,840
B.O.B.

139
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,320
Bob.

140
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,400
A church of lies, Sub-TDX will help you find your slack

141
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,100
For $35 down, see if you can get it back

142
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,840
Sub-TDX is the word on my membership card

143
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,200
And come next day we'll fly away from the comfort of my backyard

144
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,060
Give me slack or kill me, or kill me, or kill me

145
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,720
Give me slack or kill me, or kill me, or kill me

146
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,520
Give me slack or kill me, or kill me, or kill me

147
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,840
Give me slack or kill me, or kill me, or kill

148
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,800
Kill me

149
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,360
Kill me

150
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,620
Kill me

151
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,520
Kill me

152
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:44,520


153
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:54,220
Kill me, kill me, kill me

154
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,140
Praise Bob!

155
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,900
And praise Dr. Argus Fox and the Right Angles

156
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,360
who performed that song live at the West End Trading Company in Tampa, Florida.

157
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,920
Dr. Fox, whose name the unenlightened think must be pronounced faux,

158
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,360
is one of the most fiery of subgenius preachers and that band sets the air on fire.

159
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,380
More from them later.

160
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,720
By the way, this is one of those shows that I have to do from home,

161
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,320
so I'm sitting in my backyard recording this.

162
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,200
Before that, we heard a song dear to my heart by the Rudy Schwartz Project,

163
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,900
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and Me.

164
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,240
I can't describe how many times I refrained from yelling and flailing and attacking

165
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,380
when my fellow Dallas citizens back in the day

166
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,660
would go into that, so how about them Cowboys routine.

167
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:56,000
Our buddy Joe Newman, who leads that huge band, Rudy Schwartz Project,

168
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,080
lived in Austin, Texas back when he recorded that.

169
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,900
He has long since moved to Canada.

170
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,960
Who's at the Wheel was by the Rainmakers, one of my favorite bands.

171
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,760
The great Bob Walkenhorst being the singer-songwriter.

172
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,360
And that song is from a Rainmakers album.

173
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,980
I didn't even know it existed until last week.

174
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,640
A 2014 album with the title Monster Movie.

175
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,240
We'll be hearing more from that album too,

176
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,920
because I guess we're on the same wavelength or something.

177
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,800
We might call this episode Ask Dr. Howell the Musical,

178
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,080
because we're basically going to be cutting back and forth between music that's new,

179
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,100
at least to me, and the Ask Dr. Howell show recorded last July

180
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,200
on location at Wisteria Campground at the 20X.

181
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:51,700
I'm about to play that, but I have to admit that I lost a sound file

182
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:58,240
and the crisp, clean recording of Ask Dr. Howell from my mix board is just not there.

183
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,060
It's gone.

184
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,900
It's the first time I've ever lost a recording that particular way.

185
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,780
Luckily, we had a video camera also pointed at the stage

186
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:12,240
just to provide a backup audio recording just in case the thing that happened happened.

187
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,100
So it's a little echoey.

188
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,180
More like the audience heard it, not the way we heard it in the headphones,

189
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,520
but what-evs.

190
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,020
All right, okay.

191
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,660
Ask Dr. Howell.

192
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,420
Now you have filled out question slips,

193
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,880
and while the show is running,

194
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,800
you have the chance to fill out more question slips and send them up here.

195
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,920
We have a tradition also called the side note.

196
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,840
If you feel that the answer hasn't covered your question,

197
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,340
and the way...

198
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,320
Maybe you would have liked.

199
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,960
You can add something, write it on the slip, send it up here,

200
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,860
and it will be added to the permanent record,

201
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,620
which is all part of this show, the Akashic Records.

202
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,400
Oh, is that what the cash part of it means?

203
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,460
The cash is right here on the table.

204
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,720
Cash on the back there.

205
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,500
I just was stupid when I was talking about that Akashic Records.

206
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,280
No, they knew what side their bread was buttered on.

207
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
So now we...

208
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,760
We'll begin.

209
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,880
So let's just show how this works

210
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,900
by answering the very first question pre-selected by Ivan Stang.

211
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,960
I selected it on the basis of its placement by random nature on top.

212
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,960
With this $2...

213
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,400
$2, well, that is a very good beginning.

214
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,300
Here's the question, and the gorilla is asking the question,

215
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,120
so he'll say,

216
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,000
Who will win the Game of Thrones?

217
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,300
A marketing...

218
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:45,780
A marketing executive.

219
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,360
Um, the estate of George R. R. Martin

220
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,780
is the clear victor in this endless combat.

221
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,420
But, aside from that, the most sympathetic characters

222
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,920
are the winners, because they are forever associated

223
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,220
with that particular moment of loire,

224
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,520
that moment of glory, and so therefore,

225
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,900
Peter Dinklage,

226
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,100
the guy who killed his father while his father was sitting on the toilet,

227
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,720
has to be the most sympathetic character in the entire affray.

228
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,780
What scriptwriters call the center of good

229
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,200
should be put in one person,

230
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,280
and it would have to be in our diminutive protagonist.

231
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,980
Does that mean Sheriff Rick is going to win The Walking Dead?

232
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,640
Well, you know, I wouldn't put it past him.

233
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,840
Okay, here's a $5.00.

234
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:43,880
Here's a $5.00.

235
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,600
Okay, a demon, eh?

236
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,220
Mhmm.

237
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,660
$5.00 demons, but...

238
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,320
The demon asks,

239
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,140
I want some slack.

240
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,420
How do I get that stuff?

241
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,740
The problem is that the demon, being a demon,

242
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:09,180
thinks of the slack as something which he can acquire like a product.

243
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,620
This is actually the conspiracy way of, uh,

244
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:13,880
of the demon,

245
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880


246
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880


247
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880


248
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880


249
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880


250
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880


251
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880


252
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880


253
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880


254
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880


255
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880


256
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880


257
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880


258
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880


259
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880


260
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,220
looking at things.

261
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,320
Because, according to the conspiracy,

262
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,140
you're almost happy,

263
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,460
and you would be happy

264
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,780
if you bought the next available item

265
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,380
that is just there,

266
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,540
just out of your reach.

267
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,940
You can almost get it.

268
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,120
And once you get it,

269
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,320
it will complete your happiness.

270
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,480
And when you finally do get it,

271
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,420
it's okay,

272
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,600
and you do like it or not,

273
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,820
but there's another thing

274
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,720
that you don't have.

275
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,300
And so it continues.

276
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:42,600
Continues.

277
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,560
And thus,

278
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,600
instead of attempting to get the slack,

279
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,240
one must simply have slack.

280
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,560
Since, as we've always taught

281
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,920
in the Church of the Subgenius,

282
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,880
you were born with original slack.

283
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
The conspiracy wants to take

284
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,100
your original slack

285
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,000
in exchange for false slack,

286
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,420
which it manufactures,

287
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,020
and sell it to you

288
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,820
so that you will perform work

289
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,020
to support these sales,

290
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,840
doing meaningless labor,

291
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,260
for meaningless results.

292
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,900
So generate slack on your own.

293
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,740
Although, for a demon,

294
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,600
the greatest slack

295
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,380
is a soul in agony.

296
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,360
And not just an ordinary soul,

297
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,280
but a master spirit,

298
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,740
or soul burning.

299
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,200
As opposed to,

300
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,080
well, you know,

301
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,040
angels have cherubs,

302
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,120
and those are like cute little things

303
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,660
that are miniature versions of angels,

304
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,820
and they have to do with pleasant moments.

305
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,200
In the same way,

306
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,980
with demons,

307
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,060
you have imps,

308
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,780
which are tiny little things

309
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,680
that mainly want to make you lose your temper,

310
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,600
and arrange inanimate objects

311
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,340
so just this will happen.

312
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,100
And that is their delight.

313
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,160
But if they ever manage to develop

314
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,700
into a full-fledged demon,

315
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,480
nothing will give them delight

316
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,240
like seeing a master spirit combusting.

317
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,500
geez

318
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,580
These are some of the faintest

319
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:32,580


320
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:32,580


321
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:32,580


322
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:32,580

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:32,720


326
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,220
That's every sin

327
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,100
within myself

328
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,180
began

Retail's devils into retail. If your soul's for sale, it's all gonna be gone. Pale politicians hiding in religion. Drag us to the ditch, it's all gonna be gone.

334
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:15,060
In a monster movie, these monsters are real. In a monster movie, in a house on the hill.

335
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:24,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

336
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,760
Ain't no salvation in a monster movie.

Money nation, greed gonna eat you. It's all gonna be gone.

In a monster movie, these monsters are real.

In a monster movie, in a house on the hill.

341
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,860
In a monster movie, in a house on the hill.

342
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,460
Everything about it is a puzzle. Something's been set. We're all puzzled.

343
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,080
Nobody believes that we'll survive. Probably it's a lie.

344
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:20,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

345
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:38,220
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

347
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:47,040
Numb out to drama in your melodrama. You're the limited, it's all gonna be gone.

348
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:55,820
Jesus ain't a-comin', neither is your mama. Close up for the kill, it's all gonna be gone.

349
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:04,460
In a monster movie, these monsters are real.

350
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:12,960
In a monster movie, in a house on the hill.

351
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:21,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

354
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:47,140
That's quite a marching song by the Rainmakers from the album, which, like that song, is called Monster Movie.

355
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:53,140
I was so thrilled to discover that album, which had somehow slipped under my Rainmakers dar.

356
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,780
It's from 19, uh, I mean 2014.

357
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,520
Uh, but, but it seems like it's ripped from today's headlines.

358
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,580
But now, back to the Ask Dr. Howell Show at 20X Day Drill.

359
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,400
Here's a, uh, now this is a $2 one.

360
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,060
Oh, boy!

361
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,560
A very flowery buildup.

362
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,520
That's all right, flowery buildups are us.

363
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,800
Gorilla voice all the way through, please.

364
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,220
Well, this is a more sensitive gorilla.

365
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,180
What?

366
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,940
Sensitive, new age gorilla.

367
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,760
I have this demon with a gnarled spine and knobby feet.

368
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,040
Fingers.

369
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:37,780
It possesses hind legs as a kangaroo, so can project itself forward with leaps, bearing teeth as a jackal.

370
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,980
The red skin seems to serve as mere afterthought.

371
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:48,740
And it carries a kidney balloon to tease me into acknowledging it.

372
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,640
Knowing all this, I ask you,

373
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,760
Why is Greek yogurt so thick?

374
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,580
That gorilla has really nice handwriting.

375
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:08,020
Yes, well, he took instructions from the best.

376
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,160
Well, you see, this strange creature described by our Simian friend

377
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,780
appears to be what we would call a chimera,

378
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,340
a mythological being comprised of elements of other mythological beings

379
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,900
put together into a new form.

380
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,960
So it was with Greek yogurt when it first appeared,

381
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,300
supplanting the regular little cans that we had seen in the grocery store

382
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:42,740
for so long in an undisturbed succession of rather limited flavor types and caloric load.

383
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,420
Suddenly it became possible, or financially feasible,

384
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,660
to thicken the upper part of the yogurt,

385
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,500
indeed to produce not the usual puddle

386
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:54,880
of the yogurt,

387
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,880
full of sugary jam at the bottom,

388
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,180
but a blended form in which the blend or flavoring agent

389
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,860
would stay in isostasis throughout the yogurt.

390
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,960
And this kind has tended to sweep all other kinds before it.

391
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,980
And perhaps its thickness is its strength,

392
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,380
like Samson's hair or the heart of the giant,

393
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,060
which was kept in a distant tower

394
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,480
so no one could kill him while he was on his rampages.

395
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,860
Ah, ooga!

396
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,320
Here we have a five dollar question.

397
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,800
Oh, b-b-b-boy.

398
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,600
It's short, but I...

399
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,160
All right, short.

400
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,500
Short's important.

401
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,520
I predict it not so short an answer.

402
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,400
It's short, but let's see what we can do.

403
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,180
And it has a poem request.

404
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,480
All right. Does it request a specific poem?

405
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,640
Oh, yes. I'll tell you the poem in advance.

406
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,400
All right.

407
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,720
The poem requested is The Skeleton in Armor.

408
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,820
I remember that.

409
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,400
Oh, yeah.

410
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,940
Well, I was only going to do one longish poem this time.

411
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,020
That one I could speed up somewhat.

412
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,420
But what is the question?

413
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:16,820
The question, and this one is signed by the good Dr. Uncle Onan Kanabaiti.

414
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,580
Ah-ha! Onan Kanabaiti.

415
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,300
The question?

416
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,960
It all fits now. I see.

417
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:29,940
Is the good discernible from the observation of nature?

418
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,520
Is the good discernible from the observation of nature?

419
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:42,800
Well, sir, I'll answer this question in two shakes of a fish's tail,

420
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,580
ere the Leviathan can swim a league.

421
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,800
I'll put a girdle around the earth in 40 minutes.

422
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,360
The reason is to save more time for the poem.

423
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:59,300
When one sees nature itself in operation, as Coleridge pointed out in his essays,

424
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,160
one sees beauty because one sees good.

425
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,800
And the good and the beauty that one sees is multiety in unity,

426
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:11,060
all things in the proper proportion, creating harmony.

427
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,020
But what ain't good?

428
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,260
What would stick out like the sorest of sore thumbs?

429
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,960
Anything disproportionate.

430
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,760
Too much material from a different place.

431
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,160
Something entirely out of size.

432
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:33,320
It's generally a matter of size with everything else that's there.

433
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,860
Because remember, when you're talking about good and evil,

434
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,260
that evil is not creative.

435
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,320
Only good has that ability.

436
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,160
All evil can do is pervert the good.

437
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,100
And all evil things are things.

438
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,120
That started out as good, and usually by disproportion

439
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:58,380
of one or more of the elements which constitute a lasting parcel of its composition,

440
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,140
we note an evil thing.

441
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,320
One, two, one, two, three, four.

442
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,700
What's good?

443
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:29,520
What's not good?

444
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,420
Adamant.

445
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,400
What's good?

446
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:43,500
When you're done saying the will of the

447
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:43,500


448
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,820
I like hate, I like to watch.

449
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,260
I like every emotion.

450
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,340
Hook her up, gonna raise the bar

451
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,760
Time's up, show us where you are

452
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,840
Step up, it's time to commit

453
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,380
Plane to sea, we all stepped in it

454
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,900
Let your pants down, gonna dance now

455
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,220
Lead me to the ledge, push me to the edge

456
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,140
Mark my words, time will come

457
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,420
Step up, we're here for fun

458
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,820
We want it now, we want more

459
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,000
We're not the droids you're looking for

460
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,760
Let your pants down, gonna dance now

461
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,960
Lead me to the ledge, push me to the edge

462
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,960
Oh-eh-oh

463
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,520
Oh-eh-oh

464
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,920
Oh-eh-oh

465
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,020
Oh-eh-oh

466
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,160
Oh-eh-oh

467
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,540
Oh-eh-oh

468
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,020
Oh-eh-oh

469
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,840
Oh-eh-oh

470
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:23,920
Hey!

471
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,600
Let your pants down, gonna dance now

472
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,840
Lead me to the ledge, push me to the edge

473
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,060
It's a joke, it's not funny

474
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,300
Open the cage, I'm not your monkey

475
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,680
Here's a judge, here's the steeple

476
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,820
Open the gates, free the people

477
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,800
Time's up, we won't behave

478
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,440
This ain't your new wave

479
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,620
Step up, it's time to commit

480
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:13,140
Plane to sea, we all stepped in it

481
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,680
Let your pants down, gonna dance now

482
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,920
Lead me to the ledge, push me to the edge

483
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,460
Oh-eh-oh

484
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,180
Oh-eh-oh

485
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,340
Oh-eh-oh

486
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,080
Oh-eh-oh

487
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,740
Oh-eh-oh

488
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,340
Oh-eh-oh

489
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,260
Oh-eh-oh

490
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,760
Oh-eh-oh

491
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,120
Oh-eh-oh

492
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,140


493
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,840
Oh-eh-oh

494
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,720
Oh-eh-oh

495
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:45,940
Oh-eh-oh

496
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,660
Oh-eh-oh

497
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:46,720
Oh-eh-oh

498
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:46,720


499
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:46,720


500
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:46,720


501
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,540
Let your pants down, gonna dance now

502
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,760
Lead me to the ledge, push me to the edge

503
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,440
Exposed Foreheads are responsible for the last four minutes.

504
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,080
That's from their new CD, Urgency Squad.

505
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,760
Exposed is spelled starting with an X

506
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,940
and Foreheads is spelled starting with the numeral 4.

507
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,800
They did an amazing live performance of that song,

508
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,040
The Devotion.

509
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,600
in Cleveland last month.

510
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,600
But now back to 20X Day.

511
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,060
Okay, here's a question, a $2 question.

512
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,420
Would it be a violation of subgenius ethics

513
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,740
to breed a cow and an octopus or other cephalopod?

514
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,620
Why or why not?

515
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,160
I'm not sure if ethics would be the problem.

516
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:34,440
That's octopus.

517
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,520
An octopus, yes.

518
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,180
Well, in this world, it would be a mistake

519
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:45,460
because however amazing the result of such an experiment would be,

520
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,840
even though Victor Frankenstein himself might approve,

521
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,480
the problem is what happens after you unleash your creation.

522
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:59,140
And as Frankenstein found out, you're responsible for it,

523
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,400
and you can't just abandon it.

524
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,400
But fortunately for us,

525
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,880
we can indulge in all sorts of genetic engineering,

526
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,640
diddling and shape-shifting

527
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,160
because we're going to be aboard the saucer

528
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,880
where the morality is no more

529
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,040
to tamp down what one might do

530
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,700
because someone might use it for an unsubgenius purpose.

531
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,620
Unsubgenius purpose.

532
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,940
That's right.

533
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:30,980
Unthinkable.

534
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,000
Unsubgenius.

535
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,360
I know.

536
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,140
Well, we're going to get rid of those assholes

537
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,500
and be all with ourselves in the wonder world of tomorrow.

538
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,300
That was fun.

539
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,560
Okay, we've got one more?

540
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,280
Two more.

541
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,700
Two more.

542
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,620
All right, let's have them.

543
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,920
Dr. Howell, it has already been asked

544
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,480
how the practice of male circumcision started.

545
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,060
What I want to know is

546
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:58,480
how were the second and third participants

547
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,440
convinced to take part in this exciting process?

548
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,560
You see, anything that is a new fad

549
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,160
can start to change.

550
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,820
It can certainly be done

551
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,780
when the rich people want to do it.

552
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,120
In fact, the rich people want to start a fad.

553
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,760
So they do something.

554
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,780
And then to be like your prosperous neighbor,

555
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,880
you yourself go in for it.

556
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,620
Furthermore, those who kept the temples

557
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,480
were, as Jesus Christ complained,

558
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,860
all about counting the receipts and the money.

559
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,740
They too were economic players.

560
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,120
Dr. Yeah.

561
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,840
And apart from the Austria and the Dadu

562
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:47,920
from know-it-alls,

563
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,260
they were also veryɯwerd and potential believers,

564
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:52,260


565
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:52,260


566
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:52,260


567
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,560
so they'd be filled with уп nunca这 turbo

568
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,920
while for our own memory

569
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,300
that people had been very flash.

570
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:10,100
InSch puedes be a great example of,

571
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,380
done to people and animals in the brave days of old.

572
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,140
So edifying.

573
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,340
You said it.

574
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,420
Here, the final question.

575
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,720
All right.

576
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,380
A deep question.

577
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,200
Okay.

578
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,480
Why did we humans,

579
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,020
why did we bother leaving the woods to begin with?

580
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,220
We're in the woods right now.

581
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:50,920
Well, the woods are really like a spider's web

582
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,880
where you wait for something to come along.

583
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,120
But humans were able to,

584
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,520
by the virtue of their programming,

585
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,000
go out questing, looking for stuff,

586
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,780
looking for stuff to mess up,

587
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,280
or eat,

588
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,240
or take home,

589
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,660
or have sex with,

590
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,200
or whatever.

591
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,900
But looking, constantly looking,

592
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,000
turning over rocks,

593
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,420
tasting various animals and plants.

594
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,800
And this proved to be an adaptive characteristic.

595
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,480
Yes, this proved to be just what the doctor ordered

596
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,840
for an invasive, meddlesome, and burdensome species.

597
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:36,260
Nosy parkers involved in the business of all that, that, and all that.

598
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:36,260


599
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:36,260


600
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,740
They can see and it can see them.

601
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,800
But that's not to say it wasn't good in the woods.

602
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,960
And some did stay in the woods

603
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,240
because there were different types of humans in the old days.

604
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,320
And some who lived in the woods,

605
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,120
there are those who say,

606
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,980
are there still?

607
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,240
Yep, that's the basis of the legend about the year.

608
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,000
Yet he's still coming in and like in all those jokes

609
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,040
that the apostate subgeniuses find so offensive,

610
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,980
polluting the blood line with DNA from outside

611
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,080
and creating a lasting change,

612
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,440
a synthesis of a new order of beings,

613
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,360
a new beginning and a new order of world.

614
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,260
Like the Nephilim in the Bible

615
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,240
who had sex with the daughters of men

616
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,200
and the Jehovah one and his impatience

617
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,060
washed everything away with a large flood.

618
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,120
But he said it would never happen again.

619
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,040
A flood that is.

620
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,820
No floods.

621
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,640
No flood, no it'll be fire.

622
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,080
They could say that would happen.

623
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,400
Anyway, thanks for listening to the Ask Dr. Hal show.

624
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,140
I think we have another one of these to do tomorrow.

625
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,060
Is that the case, Reverend Stang?

626
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,360
According to the schedule.

627
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,940
Oh, sorry, there I was cleaning my hearing aid.

628
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,080
All right, we're getting ready to wind this sucker down.

629
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,300
And ladies and gentlemen,

630
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,100
I would now like to produce unto you,

631
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:20,280
the loving crowd of Sanford, Florida, the right angles.

632
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,300
Hurry up, please.

633
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,620
Bye!

634
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,160
I have to go.

635
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,920
I have to be quick and proper before my end due.

636
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,280
Thanks, rude man.

637
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,080
I whiteshilted you figured I'd get it.

638
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,060
There, there.

639
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,180
All right, lovely.

640
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,260
All right, just perfect.

641
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,220
How's that?

642
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,220
Espero bueno, of course.

643
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,060
I missed one.

644
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,200
There we go.

645
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,300
Thank you.

646
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,360
Thank you.

647
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,960
Thank you.

648
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,580
Thank you.

649
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,420
Thank you.

650
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,220
Thank you.

651
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,560
Thank you.

652
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,160
Thank you.

653
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,540
Thank you.

654
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:36,580
Thank you.

655
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,720
Thank you.

656
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,840
Thank you.

657
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,420
Thank you.

658
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:36,500
Thank you.

659
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,240
Thank you.

660
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,320
Thank you.

661
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,200
Thank you.

662
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:36,820
Thank you.

663
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,320
Thank you.

664
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,660
Thank you.

665
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,340
Thank you.

666
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:07,220
Thank you.

667
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:07,220


668
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:07,220


669
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:07,220


670
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,620
We're at AIER and you'll be seeing a bunch of us at 9 o'clock in the morning, Seattle time.

671
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,740
That's like noon here, so we'll see, friends.

672
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:20,500
Anyway, I'm going to leave you with that to think about.

673
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,220
And the rest of this show is a fairly timely thing from Starwood.

674
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:31,720
I hope it doesn't get the station burned down tomorrow.

675
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,920
On this screen may be projected the total scientific knowledge of the crowd from its

676
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,580
primitive beginning to the day of its annihilation.

677
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,780
The brain of these citizens seems quite suitable for our purposes.

678
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,120
We have made the most excellent choice.

679
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,540
The other don't know much as that, but he is not of his world.

680
00:47:33,120 --> 00:48:01,680
The other don't know much as that, but he is not of his world.

681
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:31,600
The other don't know much as that, but he is not of his world.

682
00:48:37,660 --> 00:49:01,320
The other don't know much as that, but he is not of his world.

683
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:31,660
The other don't know much as that, but he is not of his world.

684
00:49:34,020 --> 00:50:01,660
The other don't know much as that, but he is not of his world.

685
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:31,640
The other don't know much as that, but he is not of his world.

686
00:50:46,780 --> 00:51:01,700
The other don't know much as that, but he is not of his world.

687
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:31,580
The other don't know much as that, but he is not of his world.

688
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:01,300
The other don't know much as that, but he is not of his world.

689
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:19,640
Your anniversary should be before years.

690
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:19,940
Your anniversary should be before years.

691
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,280
Your birthday should be at Starбуш caffeine.

692
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:20,300


693
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:20,300


694
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:20,300


695
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:20,300


696
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:20,300


697
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,700
You should go to Zhirei delicious food.

698
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:21,920
You should be the chief governor of your country.

699
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,900
You should be travelling to what will shorten your difficulty.

700
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:22,900


701
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:23,200
You should contribute your time to your nation .

702
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:23,600
You should donate to Wen Ge.

703
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,000
You should take part in On 관 Vo.

704
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,920
Thank you.

705
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,680
Thank you.

706
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,400
Thank you.

707
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,940
Thank you.

708
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:26,420
Thank you.

709
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:55,540
Thank you.

710
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,340
Thank you.

711
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:55,580
Thank you.

712
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,060
Thank you.

713
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,540
Thank you.

714
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,980
Thank you.

715
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,640
Thank you.

716
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,520
Thank you.

717
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,200
Thank you.
