1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
And I want you to be free.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,160
Lavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,980
Everything you have is God's.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,440
Right.

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,800
Lavery, money, slavery, money.

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,580
There's a lot of guys that wouldn't really make it in a lot of other venues,

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,480
but they can get a small church, be nice to some people, and sort of squeak out a living.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,260
Uh, test, test, test. Are we on the air?

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,220
Are, is this working?

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,520
Folks, they're finally here.

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:35,060
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,640
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,620
Who could it be now?

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,760
Hey, you know what? I was just, uh, copying that onto Hour of Slack.

15
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,360
You're copying that onto Hour of Slack?

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,140
Who could it be now?

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,760
I was making Hour of Slack tonight.

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,400
Yeah.

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,480
On tape, and I was using Lanty.

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,120
Just weak tape.

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:04,460
You put the tape between your knees and then take the little razor blade and spin it with a little spool between your knees?

22
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,360
Or do you just, just hack away?

23
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:13,820
Well, I put it between my knees and then I slowly kind of creep it up closer and closer to me.

24
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,240
And then I, and then that's when the curtain opens.

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,880
And all those kids are out there waiting to see the clown show.

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,660
Little clown.

27
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,080
And then I am with my tape editor.

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:26,720
Right there.

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,400
Well, yep.

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,880
It's usually Blashy, king of the men. Remember him?

31
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:31,880
Yes.

32
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,160
I'm glad you do.

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,780
I do remember Fred Blashy, the king of men.

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,580
In fact, he was...

35
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:44,800
Oh.

36
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:47,800
Oh.

37
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,320


38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,020
Oh.

39
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,400
Oh.

40
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,840
Oh.

41
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,060


42
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,180
Oh.

43
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:53,860


44
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,040


45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,320


46
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,320


47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,380
Oh.

48
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,580
Oh.

49
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:55,580


50
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:55,580


51
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:55,580


52
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:55,600
Oh.

53
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


54
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:55,780


55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,420
Oh.

56
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:56,500


57
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:56,500


58
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:56,500


59
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:56,500


60
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:56,500


61
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:56,500


62
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:56,500


63
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:56,640
Oh.

64
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,160
Thank you.

65
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,400
Oh.

66
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,360
Oh.

67
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,760
Oh.

68
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,080
Oh.

69
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,240
Oh.

70
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,760
Oh.

71
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:00,820
Oh.

72
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,120
Oh.

73
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,200


74
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,280
Oh.

75
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,280


76
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,280


77
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,280


78
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,280


79
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,280


80
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,280


81
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,280


82
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,720
Careful, honey.

83
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,680
No.

84
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,800
Go easy on that one.

85
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,280
Safe word.

86
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,000
Safe word.

87
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,160
Oh.

88
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,640
Oh.

89
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,520
Oh.

90
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,700
Wait.

91
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,140
Wait.

92
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,340
Wait.

93
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,000
I know what to do.

94
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,320
I'll pull down the volume and hit the pause button.

95
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,420
It's gone.

96
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:21,860
Oh.

97
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,820
Lordy.

98
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,400
Friends.

99
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,160
I just, I never know.

100
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,800
I never know quite what to, what to, how to, that was a Bill T. Miller's horrible sound

101
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,160
effects.

102
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,360
And I don't know what else is going on here except that, friends, you know, the world ends

103
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,420
any year now.

104
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,160
And you may die.

105
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,860
No, I'm just kidding, kids.

106
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,540
You know, actually, we all know that the surface of the earth will be scoured of pinkness and

107
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,140
that we, the saved, will be ruptured up to the escape vessels of the sea.

108
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,700
Ex-goddesses.

109
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:07,180
At precisely 7 a.m., July 5th, 1999, as prophesied by Nostradamus and almost certainly meant

110
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,860
by that man J.R. Bob Dobbs.

111
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:19,000
Only the most pathetic, faithless, weakest-willed subgenius wannabes would let something like

112
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,180
last year's little so-called disappointment shake their trust in Dobbs.

113
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,280
Dobbs.

114
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,060
7-5-98.

115
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,040
July 5th, 98 was actually the best possible drill.

116
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,320
The only way to make us truly prepared.

117
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:34,900
Admit it.

118
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,620
Half of y'all were sound asleep last ex-day at 7 a.m.

119
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,100
Now, weren't you?

120
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:46,040
And the pin kooks are all running around like ninnies fretting about the year 2000 and Y2K

121
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,320
when all their precious false slack devices will shut down and crash out and fail to reboot.

122
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,260
They should be so lucky.

123
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,140
They're worthless.

124
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,120
The world isn't even gonna last that long.

125
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,600
And that's why we say,

126
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,180
No Y2K.

127
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,180
X, Y, Z.

128
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,800
X year zero, my friends.

129
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,340
X year zero.

130
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,520
Examine your zipper.

131
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,860
The world ends July 5th, 1999.

132
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,260
Next day.

133
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,220
Dos Equis.

134
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,080
Duh!

135
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,260
The pinks did not take us seriously last time.

136
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,080
Hell, half of you didn't take Bob's.

137
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,980
Prophecy seriously.

138
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,900
But this time we've learned our lesson.

139
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,680
We can't rely on invisible monsters from outer space.

140
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,220
Dobbs hath said,

141
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,820
just in case,

142
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,480
you must

143
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,020
build your own ship.

144
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,140
And while you're at it, help get ship shape the one we're already on, kids.

145
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,580
This is your last chance not to screw up.

146
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,140
Dobbs inexplicably said,

147
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:04,280
All these other US

148
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,280


149
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,280


150
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,280


151
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:24,120
We want all the вч-

152
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,000
Life,

153
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,640
Guess what? We've got us a special little glimpse into last year's X-Day.

154
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,380
This upcoming X-Day, there's going to be twice as many hilarious screwed-up weirdos

155
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,260
and stark-necked beautiful Connie tights and tools.

156
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,260
Thrice the miracles, signs and portents,

157
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,920
four times as many colorful body fluids as last year's blood wrestling, my friends.

158
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,000
It will be...

159
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,500
Well, I really should just go to the tapes.

160
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,720
I should just go straight on over.

161
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,020
Praise Bob.

162
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,140
And praise Tom and Richard, who actually edited, shot and edited

163
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,420
the documentary portions of what I'm about to play.

164
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,940
Bits and pieces, excerpts from a video, a documentary video called

165
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,980
Countdown to X.

166
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,500
X-Day.

167
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,060
Uh, yes. Praise Bob.

168
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,060
Oh, the music in the background is, of course, Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

169
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,600
And it is in the video, too.

170
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,620
Just like the Heaven's Gate people did their farewell video,

171
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,880
this is, this, this will save me tape.

172
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,060
Um, God, who should I talk to? My mom and dad are saved.

173
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,940
Okay, my brother and sister.

174
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,420
And a lot of friends of mine, and even a lot of subgeniuses,

175
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,820
including some of my best subgenius old buddies and collaborators

176
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,180
that never actually sent their $30 in.

177
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,660
Like I did last year.

178
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,800
Um, man.

179
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,040
It's just a container.

180
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,280
It's a temporary container.

181
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,620
It's like casting off your old shoes and putting on some new ones.

182
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,760
It's not like anybody's gonna really die.

183
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,140
You'll still be around after the exes or the robo-beasts

184
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:44,180
or whatever the vengeful subgeniuses have stripped away your house and your body.

185
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,340
In a way, you're not really leaving.

186
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,220
You humans and pinks and relatives of mine,

187
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,720
you're just entering.

188
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:50,780


189
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,460
You're stepping over into a bigger world, a more open world.

190
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,580
I feel sorry for the friends of mine who never bought a membership.

191
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,240
I've always tried to expose them gently to Bob's word,

192
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,520
not to force it down their throats,

193
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,540
not mail them pamphlets constantly.

194
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,260
I have turned some people to the church.

195
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,800
I am very proud of those people.

196
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,080
I look forward to greeting them on the saucers, you know.

197
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,500
But it's kind of sad that my mother, who really is a wonderful person,

198
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,980
never did buy that membership.

199
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,100


200
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,880
And I don't know what she would make of the saucers.

201
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,480
And of course, there are my enemies.

202
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,820
I do have people in my life who have hurt me for no particular reason

203
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,420
all the way back in high school.

204
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,120
And once I get my memory editing, I'll be able to remember who you all are.

205
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,800
And I probably will have specific tribulations set aside just for you.

206
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,360
And that's just my slack.

207
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
And I'm afraid there's nothing you can do about it now.

208
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,980
It's been difficult during all this time to be patient.

209
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,600
But I knew that if I just...

210
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,420
if I just persevered,

211
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:57,100
I'd be able to say goodbye from above, from the saucers, and not below.

212
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,080
And I just want to thank those that supported me.

213
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,460
I come from a long line of subgeniuses.

214
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,680
And they imparted into me the values that have got me where I am today.

215
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,300
And to all the normals and all the pinks and all the bobbies

216
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,600
and the glorps and the normals that have tried to wear me down,

217
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,760
well, soon, you better hurry if you've got anything left to say to me

218
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,400
because I'm on my way out.

219
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,360
Goodbye. So long.

220
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,700
They have a secret weapon.

221
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:32,140
They have an invisible monster that lives up in the sky.

222
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,200
And it's powerful. And it's their buddy.

223
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,400
And if they kiss its ass, it'll send us to hell forever.

224
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,360
And it'll do them favors, you know.

225
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,420
Now, 87% of this country, of America,

226
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,580
believes in that individual.

227
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,740
And it's a monster that lives up in the sky.

228
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,140
And it's a monster that lives up in the sky.

229
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,420
And it's a monster that lives up in the sky.

230
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,180
That's great. Fine.

231
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,080
I don't believe in that invisible monster.

232
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,660
You probably don't believe in that invisible monster.

233
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,760
But we still have to deal with it.

234
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,580
Because they believe it.

235
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,340
God, friends, that's why the Church of the Subgenius

236
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,160
and J.R. Bob Dobbs

237
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,020
has come to declare war on God!

238
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,240
We've been talking about it.

239
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,900
Huh. Where was Letterman? How come we didn't have him?

240
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,580
In any case, Bryant might be looking for solace

241
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,260
after that verbal barrage,

242
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,900
and we just might have the answer for him.

243
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,940
It's called the Church of the Subgenius.

244
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,200
And it's truly on a level of its own.

245
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,860
You know those late-night commercials

246
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,580
that promise everything from electric massage recliners

247
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,520
and instant weight loss to do-it-yourself bathroom renovations?

248
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,840
Well, here's a deal you might not want to miss.

249
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,560
Salve the people of the world.

250
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:50,560


251
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,420
Salvation or triple your money back.

252
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,920
In Dallas, Texas, the Church of the Subgenius

253
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,580
is offering a one-word solution to all of our problems.

254
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,420
Slack.

255
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,640
That word solves another problem for the Church as well.

256
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,400
Money.

257
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,520
The Reverend Ivan Stang spreads the gospel.

258
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,040
Stang, author of The High Weirdness by Mail

259
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,800
and Book of the Subgenius,

260
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,960
preaches his gospel every Sunday over the radio at WKRO in Dallas.

261
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,860
Stang claims to be a disciple of the Church's founder,

262
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,540
one Dr. J.R. Bob Dobbs.

263
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,020
Once also known as the greatest salesman ever born.

264
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,300
Oh, yes.

265
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,260
Civilization falling apart.

266
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,980
According to Stang, Bob Dobbs became a prophet one night

267
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,280
after seeing God on his homemade TV.

268
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,420
The vision inspired him to save the world

269
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,480
and gave him the message to do it with slack.

270
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,000
Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world.

271
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,800
Only his predictions are just a little different.

272
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,540
July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m. to be exact,

273
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:50,540


274
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,620
the men from Planet X, as the news media will call them,

275
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,620
will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses,

276
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,660
the true believer subgeniuses,

277
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,280
up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

278
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,620
And believe it or not, plenty of people,

279
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,340
4,000 of them so far and more every day,

280
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,480
have already joined up.

281
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,040
Suddenly the joke has become serious and profitable.

282
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,400
Your standard religious rip-off, right?

283
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,980
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?

284
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,380
As Bob says,

285
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,800
we offer eternal salvation or triple your money back.

286
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,180
And there is no other religion that offers that deal.

287
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,480
Triple your money.

288
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,080
Church of the Subgenius, about 10 years ago, basically,

289
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,460
I was a very lonely weirdo in a small Massachusetts town

290
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,660
where nobody was like me and nobody liked me.

291
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,360
And I'd just gotten out of high school,

292
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,540
which I felt was a real waste of time.

293
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,280
I'd in fact spent four years in special ed,

294
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,620
which is also known as the retard room,

295
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,580
basically because none of the teachers wanted to deal with me.

296
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,540
So they stuck me in a room by myself for four years.

297
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,980
Shows what I think of public education.

298
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,200
And, you know, I really was a very lonely person.

299
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,880
And I finally got a boyfriend who was a member of the church

300
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,640
and had been for two or three years.

301
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,280
And he showed me the pencils and I said,

302
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,640
this is it.

303
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,360
Where are these damn pencils?

304
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,180
Where have these damn people been all these years?

305
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,260
I broke up with this girl.

306
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,300
We had a parting of the ways.

307
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,960
And I basically degenerated at the time

308
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,840
into a state of total slacklessness

309
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,860
where I was just riding around on my motorcycle like a nutcase.

310
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,740
You know, just hoping that somewhere

311
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,860
there was somebody who was bold enough to take me on.

312
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,760
And one day a car started chasing me through a thunderstorm.

313
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,380
I'm going like 90 miles an hour on my bike through a thunderstorm.

314
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,500
And there's a truck chasing me.

315
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,040
And I thought I got away from the guy.

316
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,560
But he caught up to me a couple of miles later.

317
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,320
And he got out of his truck.

318
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,520
And I was like, good, you know, I didn't get to kick this guy's behind, right?

319
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,760
Well, he comes up and he offers to let me join a motorcycle club that he belonged to.

320
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,400
An outlaw motorcycle club in South Jersey called the High Rollers.

321
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,300
And I hooked up with him a few months later.

322
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
And I met a guy named Reverend Spider.

323
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,160
Now, I didn't know what he was a reverend of.

324
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,480
He told me about this church and the subgenius thing.

325
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,220
And he gave me a tape.

326
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,700
And I listened to the tape.

327
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,140
But I was the only subgenius around.

328
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,520
I thought, oh, this stuff, you know, this is about me.

329
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,500
You know, all this stuff in here, stuff that I've been saying for years

330
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,700
and everybody else has blown off and said, that's weird.

331
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,640
You're stupid, you know.

332
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,500
That stuff isn't the way things are.

333
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,800
You know, it's not the way we see it on TV.

334
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,420
In sociology class at Farragut High School,

335
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,740
I was living in Knoxville, Tennessee at the time,

336
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,560
Deborah L. turned around.

337
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,460
And said, my boyfriend wanted me to give you this.

338
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,440
And she held up this weird poster with these three funny faces on it.

339
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,220
And said, Sinisac religion and a society for the bizarre.

340
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,680
Send $1 to the subgenius foundation.

341
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,740
I thought, well, that's kind of weird.

342
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,360
It only costs $1.

343
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,680
I'll just go ahead and do that.

344
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,680
I got a pamphlet in the mail.

345
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,640
Boy, that's pretty funny.

346
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,300
I showed it to my buddy Scott K.

347
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,000
And he thought it was real funny.

348
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,980
He sent in his $10 to join up.

349
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,840
He got his membership pack back.

350
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,280
And there it said, membership $20.

351
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,780
So I figured, man, if it's gone up from $10 to $20 in this past week,

352
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,400
I better join quick.

353
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,740
So I sent in my $20.

354
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,700
And that was in 1982.

355
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,700
The church first stumbled into my life in 1981.

356
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,940
I was reading an underground comic by Robert Crumb called Weirdo.

357
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,540
And there was an ad in the back pages,

358
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,780
the world ends tomorrow and you may die.

359
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,040
And it sounded like a good prospect to me.

360
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,480
And now it's almost tomorrow.

361
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,560
And it's been 17 years that I've had the church of the subgenius in my life.

362
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,720
At first, it was a joke.

363
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,980
You know, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

364
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,600
Pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

365
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,460
But there was something much deeper and more life affirming than I'd even realized.

366
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,540
Do we have any takers?

367
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,320
Any volunteers?

368
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,600
No, I think this is the blood wrestling.

369
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,680
Friends, it's...

370
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,720
Actually, the purpose of the wrestling in particular is so a whole bunch of people can laugh

371
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,520
at a bunch of idiots that look funny getting knocked down and slipping and sliding around.

372
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,740
That's the purpose of the blood wrestling.

373
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,220
That's the entire purpose of it as far as I know.

374
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
It's because people look funny.

375
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,420
Amateur wrestlers look real funny sliding around.

376
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,600
That's what I'm talking about.

377
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,680
Lassus! Lassus!

378
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,400
Lassus! Lassus!

379
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,220
Woo!

380
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,780
Lassus!

381
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:54,640
It's a good thing you can't see this footage on the radio because it would be not for children.

382
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:03,500
Some of these lovely subgenius ladies and men didn't want to get their clothes all bloody.

383
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,480
It's a savage and ridiculous sight.

384
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,880
I think it's an expression of some pent-up aggressions towards other subgeniuses and towards the conspiracy

385
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,640
that needed an outlet that was healthy enough to not get arrested before X day.

386
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,960
It's a way of getting back to all the slack you had when you were a little kid.

387
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,400
Remember when you were a little kid and you'd be able to just sit there with your little plastic soldiers?

388
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,460
You'd create a whole fantasy world around you.

389
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,680
This is it.

390
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,000
We've created our own fantasy world around us.

391
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,160
That's what religion's for, right? To create a fantasy world?

392
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,920
But we live our fantasy world out.

393
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,180
We don't wait until we die.

394
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,880
Hey, son, you've had a fan!

395
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,360
That's the very thing, buddy.

396
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,980
Take me off to space.

397
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,460
Take me off to space.

398
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,300
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

399
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,440
Take me off to space.

400
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,640
Take me off to space.

401
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,220
Take me off to space.

402
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,640
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

403
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,080
Leave needles in my belly.

404
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,200
Take samples of my skin.

405
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,560
I don't care as long as I can live with saucer man.

406
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,140
I know that you don't take requests, but I'm a special case.

407
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,580
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

408
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,820
Take me off to space.

409
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,040
Take me off to space.

410
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,420
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

411
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,640
Take me off to space.

412
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,880
Take me off to space.

413
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,340
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

414
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,880
Hey, cattle mutilators, let me join your crew.

415
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,120
Give me a knife, you bet your life I'll cut up cows for you.

416
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,800
I don't care if you're some kind of get-

417
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,280
Sleepy without a face.

418
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,200
Or some kind of body.

419
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,220
I don't care if you're a bull with two eyes.

420
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:28,500


421
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:28,520


422
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,700
Is that a murder from a Druid with 100

423
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,460
눈치

424
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,400
Or are you walking around with a body with only one eye?

425
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,540
Boying!

426
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,260
Think you can move a body and you can do beach last night?

427
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,800
and life is just a sucker dream and death is a disgrace.

428
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,160
So come on down you saucermen take me off to space

429
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,280
Take me off to space Take me off to space

430
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,580
Come on down you saucermen take me off to space

431
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,760
Take me off you saucermen take me off to space

432
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,160
Come on down you saucermen take me off to space

433
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:12,300
This week's Hour of Slant is brought to you by Bob's Super Fiber Tabs.

434
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:19,140
Contains oat bran, guar gum, xylem fiber, and at least 20% Bob Donald by weight.

435
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,640
Bob's Super Fiber Tabs.

436
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,300
It's the gut blowout you won't forget.

437
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:32,200
These intricately looped and coiled strands are nucleic acids, DNA.

438
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:41,200
Everything you need to know on how to make a human being is encoded in the language of life, in the DNA molecule.

439
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,480
Save your children.

440
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,940
We were going to talk about Gogol and the dead souls tonight, weren't we?

441
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,340
We were going to analyze that one part there where...

442
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,060
Hey, they're not broadcasting us right now.

443
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,220
Oh, good. Well, there goes everything that's important.

444
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,600
Because if they were, you just blew it.

445
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,180
Yeah.

446
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,920
That you just told them, now they know everything.

447
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,560
About Congressman Bratwurst?

448
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,700
Well...

449
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,600
Well, it's off to too late now.

450
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,480
Congressman Hitler.

451
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,040
Oh, yeah.

452
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,360
And his speech impediment.

453
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,560
Now everybody's going to...

454
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,900
It's like, next thing you know, David Letterman's going to be doing jokes about Congressman Hitler's speech impediment.

455
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,780
Well, you know...

456
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,660
He's got it on the bag now.

457
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,240
It's like the colostomy bag is out of Frank Sinatra now.

458
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,540
Well, Congressman Hitler is awful old, and there's a lot of people wondering how he got his visa papers and so forth.

459
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,440
You know what I mean?

460
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,260
Well, I think it's just a popularity contest.

461
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,060
You know, that's all politics are now.

462
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,080
Yeah, but so...

463
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:50,280
I thought it was cool when Jesse the Body Ventura became governor, but then the next thing you know, it was Senator Jagger and Corporal Whitney Houston, or I mean Congresswoman Houston, and it was all movie stars.

464
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,540
And the next thing you know, then there's Congressman Hitler at 97 years old.

465
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,260
How old is he?

466
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,700
I think he said he's 97, but there's a lot of people say he's actually 106 right now.

467
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,620
Just a big old...

468
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,580
He's got a head in a jar going,

469
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,000
Moxnell, Moxnell.

470
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,960
Moxnell, Moxnell, Moxnell.

471
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,240
Everybody wants to go faster.

472
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,780
You remember that one Lady Rife and Stall movie where they had everybody suspended in them jars, and they were going by at 1,000 miles an hour with them little swastikas on it?

473
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,020
And a little blonde child would jump out.

474
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:25,320
Each time one would go by and would salute it, and the thing would just go off into the, well, we don't call it the urine wagon, whatever it is, you know, where they dumped all that stuff.

475
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:31,680
And it was just like it was the city of the future where they take away every part of you you didn't need, like your hair.

476
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,420
You could get your hair.

477
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:38,120
You walk in, and a hair cutter would land on your head and would remove it in really, you know, Nordic fashion.

478
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,200
And it was kind of weird, you know?

479
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:52,420
Tell me over and over and over again, my friend, how you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

480
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,000
You know, are there...

481
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,380
Are there real subgenius kooks that, like, take it a little too far?

482
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,700
Oh, yes, they are kooks.

483
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,820
And they do.

484
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:18,960
There are subgenius, those who call themselves subgeniuses and believe all the wrong lies in the book of the subgenius.

485
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:24,360
The stuff that's obviously there to be laughed at, they know from their...

486
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:31,000
It's what happens is our bulldada, or, you know, kind of cheesy takeoff, blah, satirical.

487
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,520
Stuff happens to intersect with their schizophrenia.

488
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,640
He's following me.

489
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,080
He's up there.

490
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,180
Can't you see?

491
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,740
Following me, flying free.

492
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,680
There's a psychotic man in a dark, fat suit, and he's after me.

493
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,080
He's up there.

494
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,740
Can't you see?

495
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,440
Some of these guys are truly twisted in the head.

496
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,600
Some of them, I think some of them should be locked up.

497
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,920
I think that some of these people...

498
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,900
After they sent their $30 to the Church of the Subgenius,

499
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,220
probably should have gone off somewhere and gotten some help.

500
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,820
Stared at me in hell.

501
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,760
Eyes closed, Fred.

502
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,300
They went straight through my head, not gone.

503
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,360
I was dead for sure.

504
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,200
No!

505
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,440
It's always dangerous to enfranchise the misfits of society.

506
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:31,500
And this church is like a validation on our mental and emotional parking.

507
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,340
It's a certain level of impulsivity,

508
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,040
the mental riflage that we already have to notice.

509
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,080
And we need to understand...

510
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,080


511
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,080


512
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,080


513
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,180
We now에게 extraneous VR millions,

514
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:51,360
alam gotcha keep Leadership Committee

515
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:51,660
in order to connect

516
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,440
with each individual,

517
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,200
make yourself feel like a mic,

518
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:01,960
learning from the sins of others.

519
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,300
Yes.

520
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,740
and fixate on it.

521
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,940
You can join the rest of us at the same time,

522
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,960
on the same day, and overwhelm the power.

523
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:11,300
Oh!

524
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:18,200
That day is July 5th, 1998, and that hour is 7 AM.

525
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:18,700
Oh!

526
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,520
Are you going to be part of the problem?

527
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,100
Are you going to be part of the solution,

528
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,620
the final solution to kill the conspiracy?

529
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,420
There's some potential for violence anywhere at all times.

530
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,120
I'd say, in this case, you have the advantage

531
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,600
that you have people who are prepared for violence.

532
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,020
There's a potential for violence.

533
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,840
I don't know if it's going to be anything

534
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,360
that can't be diffused with a joke.

535
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,720
I certainly hope so.

536
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,560
Don't you understand what I'm trying to say?

537
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,460
And can't you feel the fears that I'm feeling today?

538
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,320
If the button is pushed, there's no running away.

539
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,860
There'll be no one to save with the world

540
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,400
in a game of chess.

541
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:01,700
Great.

542
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,880
Take a look around, you boy.

543
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,900
It's bound to scare you, boy.

544
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:12,720
And you tell me over and over and over again, my friend,

545
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,360
how you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

546
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,980
Change the order of the nucleotides,

547
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,320
and you change the genetic instructions.

548
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,700
DNA must replicate itself.

549
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,220
Change.

550
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,220
With extreme fidelity.

551
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:32,960
Change.

552
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,720
The reproduction of the DNA molecule

553
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,300
begins by separating the two helices.

554
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,280
Spare change.

555
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,920
This is accomplished by an unwinding

556
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,340
Spare change.

557
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,060
Like some precision tool.

558
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,000
They have more fun with their partner,

559
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,100
and that's what life's all about.

560
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,820
I told you this would happen.

561
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,620
And not just Ferris.

562
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,060
There'll be others, all of them.

563
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,980
They won't just sit still and wait to die here.

564
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,240
名

565
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,240


566
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,300
I'm sorry.

567
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,860
You can go now.

568
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:06,860


569
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:06,860


570
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,100
Don't used to it.

571
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,380
I'll take a fork.

572
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:17,820
I mean, it's not by force, am I silly?

573
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,600
Of course.

574
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,560
No, you're a fool.

575
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:24,560


576
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,580
We were together.

577
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,660
I'll say that to you.

578
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,440
Einstein's Secret Orchestra, dear friends,

579
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,300
there in the background,

580
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,720
and we've been listening to the voices of

581
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,020
Friday Jones, Papa Joe Mama,

582
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,680
Susie the Floozy,

583
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,280
Dr. Legume,

584
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,720
yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

585
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,900
Dr. Onan Kanobite,

586
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,480
and oh, who else, Maury Povich there,

587
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,240
from little bits and pieces from Countdown to X-Day.

588
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,460
We also heard a little bit of Reverend Howard Kalin

589
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,320
of the Turtles there,

590
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,140
with that old Barry Maguire song,

591
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,240
Eve of Destruction,

592
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,120
which happens to be about X-Day.

593
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,980
Well, we'll be back on site, too,

594
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,780
with more love.

595
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,860
By the way, you can write to

00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,060


637
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,080
Good evening,

638
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,660
and welcome to the radio ministry outreach

639
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,820
of Tranquility Base,

640
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,920
where we believers carry the firm conviction

641
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,380
that we were placed here to build the rocket ships,

642
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,820
the space-faring pleasure vessels prescribed in

643
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,820
Dobsian scripture,

644
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,380
to voyage out into the cosmos,

645
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,240
to venture where no billion-year-old carbon

646
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,460
has ventured before.

647
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,320
Wanna go for a ride?

648
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,000
We must get out.

649
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,380
We must get out.

650
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,120
They'd say, you know,

651
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:09,060
that crazy neighbor dreamed houses up the street.

652
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,820
He kept talking about this.

653
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,380
That religious nut.

654
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,760
He must have been wild.

655
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,800
And now all of you who are under the influence of the world,

656
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:25,800


657
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,140
you're 18,

658
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,940
turn your heads away,

659
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,220
because this is the naked baptism part of the show,

660
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,420
with all those subgeniuses in that big swimming pool.

661
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,260
Hey, guys, let's go in.

662
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,460
Make money with your heads on top.

663
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,100
Subgeniuses in an ideal world would be able to quit all their jobs

664
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,800
and just kick back,

665
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,360
but they don't, you know,

666
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,580
just like everybody else.

667
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,080
They rub elbows with a lot of jerkos, you know,

668
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,400
a bunch of just douchebags that they run into, you know,

669
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,120
from day to day.

670
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,860
And they get that kind of taint they rub off,

671
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,860
that rubs off on them, you know,

672
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,640
that pink taint.

673
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,720
And the baptism is basically to wash away that pink taint

674
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,060
from rubbing elbows with it and kind of purify them.

675
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,120
The baptism is a very beautiful event

676
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,800
because most of us need a bath.

677
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,160
That's the main reason it's done, I like to think.

678
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,260
Whoa!

679
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,500
I'm there!

680
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:24,880
I'm there!

681
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,680
Yeah, it's a great way to go!

682
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,200
We do!

683
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,720
We do!

684
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,460
We do!

685
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,020
We do!

686
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,080


687
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:32,980
We do!

688
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:33,360
We do!

689
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,020
We do!

690
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,200
When I joined the Church of the Subgenius as a 16-year-old,

691
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,340
there were things about the church that I found a little unsettling.

692
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,540
Some of the scripture used words and ideas

693
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,240
that I just found objectionable on the political levels

694
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,260
or social levels,

695
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,320
or I thought it might keep me from getting dates.

696
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:01,920
or whatever, but in time, some of the other doctors

697
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,580
noticed that.

698
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,900
And one of them took me aside and explained

699
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,820
that it had a cathartic value, that they didn't really

700
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,200
believe in the certain forbidden words or forbidden acts,

701
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,100
but they felt they had to do them,

702
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,020
because the conspiracy was both making

703
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,280
them appealing and forbidden.

704
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,600
And that kind of tension was building up so much,

705
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,120
they needed a way to break out of it.

706
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,500
And what better way to break out of it

707
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,640
than indulging in all the bad things

708
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,000
that they're not supposed to do?

709
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,200
Basically, every year we sin.

710
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,160
We work.

711
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,100
We mingle with pinks.

712
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,160
And we wash away our sins every year

713
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,800
so that we can gain new sins and then wash them away once again.

714
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,240
And you get to look at plenty of naked chicks and guys.

715
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,120
And I'm sitting in front of my dad and26

716
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,120


717
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,200
He's a Серг makes things look done.

718
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,520
Well, the baptism, I guess, it's not really a metaphor.

719
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:07,080
We're really baptizing people in the �aed blood and expulsions

720
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,940
But a lot of these folks were baptized against their will

721
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:30,340
You talk about when you're having really bad hallucinations and you hear a lot of really like voices floating around

722
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,440
You have giving you commands

723
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:37,240
Like say you've been 2,000 years old and you're a dog, you know, and you're telling people this

724
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:44,760
Conserve no purpose anymore right in the heart and he has no further conversation. Yes. I never mind

725
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,080
See now I can't hear any of this now. I'm starting to feel like you like me

726
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,440
What would I felt were look like?

727
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:04,860
Even if it had an identical molecular chemistry to life on earth, which I very much doubt it could not be similar

728
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:09,440
very similar in form to familiar organisms on the earth a

729
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,560
Random character of the evolutionary process must create elsewhere creatures

730
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,240
very different from any of that we know

731
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,980
Well, it's it's a squaring off against two of the main factions in the church

732
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,920
the

733
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:32,740
evangelicals the followers of Reverend Ivan staying on our beloved guru and then there are the Holocaust ales

734
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,300
with more of a led by dr. Laguna of more of a

735
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:37,900
bitter

736
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:43,180
bitter hate burning within them for safe they reject the

737
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:47,080
feel-good hugging us of the more

738
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,460
complacent evangelicals

739
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,580
upon the hill

740
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,800
that circle of police tape

741
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,600
Is a ring a white ring painted on the ground?

742
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,100
That is the circle of life

743
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,760
Our two teams the Holocaust ales and those mothers

744
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:21,420
Are going to meet us in that circle of life and it's going to be the throwdown at hell's hoedown

745
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,060
and

746
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:29,420
Now friends we cut to it's hard to describe out out in the rain. There's this

747
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,920
gigantic crowd of people dressed in the most outlandish

748
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,620
Battle armor you could imagine some of them completely naked some of them

749
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,660
Wrapped in acres of a bubble wrap, which is what I did

750
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,140
I

751
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,640
I'm not fighting you like you

752
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,040
I'm not fighting you like you

753
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,820
Just mother for the Cold War

754
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:01,840
Twenty years 18 years appreciate the training and love all of our family community

755
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,860
W Hairt it was very exciting to get into The First Line

756
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,260
was just was it to see cued on the first the distribution of thrones

757
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,080
For W

758
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,040
Life was like deserve it

759
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,060
Men were Bee Nein

760
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,040
It was only when I saw a plain-capped

761
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,040


762
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,440
So they look down on people like Hitler.

763
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,280
Hitler killed six million Jews.

764
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,620
How many Jews have the Catholic Church killed

765
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,060
or the Christian Church killed over the last 2,000 years?

766
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,860
Can you describe what's going on for the people?

767
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,500
Well, 90.5% we have the Battle of Armageddon here.

768
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,440
I tell you, it's the Evangelicals versus,

769
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,720
I don't know who the other side is.

770
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,360
The Holocaustals.

771
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,080
The Holocaustals.

772
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,340
But they, and I think that some of the saints,

773
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,520
worshippers have come out of here,

774
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,000
and I think some of the Jesus freaks have come out here also.

775
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,060
Several subgeniuses are work.

776
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,420
I mean, that's their job.

777
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,260
They're cops or they're federal agents

778
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,440
or they're DEA drug analysts, you know?

779
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,340
Like, why not?

780
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,700
There's soldiers here.

781
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,640
To tell the truth,

782
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,700
there's a couple of special forces guys here.

783
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,980
There's people here that make me not worry too much

784
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,220
about violence because if somebody got rough,

785
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,240
there really are subgeniuses

786
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,500
that can handle that kind of thing.

787
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,520
I think I feel the real intense competition

788
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,880
of survival of the species

789
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,120
here.

790
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,460
No time to rest once you eliminate all the sin.

791
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,060
We're all just a bunch of retarded six-year-old kids

792
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,880
who've managed to carry our childlike sense of fun

793
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,200
into our adult years.

794
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,100
Well, this is like a three-legged sack race

795
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,320
at a family reunion.

796
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,440
This is where we all meet our extended tribe

797
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,160
and reenact the rituals and traditions

798
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,900
that bring us closer together.

799
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,400
You know, the countdown has begun.

800
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,540
It's like Christmas, you know?

801
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,800
Santa's coming.

802
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,200
Santa's coming real soon.

803
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,160
And we've got the shortwave.

804
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,820
We can tune in and hear Santa delivering his little gifts

805
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,760
of death and destruction to the world

806
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,260
as it rotates under the line of X's saucers.

807
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,400
Oh, Bob.

808
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:24,920
Oh.

809
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,200
Turn on.

810
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,780
Please tune in.

811
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,760
And switch off.

812
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,840
Why do you want to be normal?

813
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,320
The rupture is upon us, dear friends.

814
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,660
That fateful day, July 5th, 1998.

815
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:53,820
Next day's a-coming, and the peaks are booming.

816
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:06,440
Next day's a-coming, and the peaks are booming.

817
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,180
Ah!

818
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,780
Next day's a-coming, and the peaks are booming.

819
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:09,780


820
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:09,780


821
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,640
Sure, when the rupture hits, we'll all be on the edge,

822
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:15,640


823
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:15,640


824
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,980
in our first-class window seats on the pleasure saucers,

825
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,940
watching the little pink boys fry.

826
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,640
Turn on.

827
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,400
Please tune in.

828
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,420
And switch off.

829
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,300
Switch, switch, switch.

830
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,320
We certainly don't want to be tricked, dear people.

831
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:39,020
Next day's a-coming, and the peaks are booming.

832
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,360
Ah!

833
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,420
Ah!

834
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,840
Sure, J.R. Bob Dobbs is my savior.

835
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,660
And of course I want more slack.

836
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,440
And I'm smoking prop nonstop.

837
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,060
But what I really want...

838
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,100
Oh, yeah, that's it.

839
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,060
Those lovely alien nympho mutants.

840
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,200
Ah!

841
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,920
Non-stop orgies on the pleasure saucers.

842
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,360
Oh!

843
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,280
Oh!

844
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,620
Oh!

845
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
Oh, yeah.

846
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,420
Oh!

847
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,000
Oh!

848
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:14,920
Oh!

849
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,020
Oh!

850
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,580
Oh, I love to be naked.

851
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:18,940
Oh!

852
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,500
Oh!

853
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,340
Oh!

854
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,160
Oh!

855
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,820
Oh!

856
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,000
Oh, fuck.

857
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,660
Oh!

858
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,120
Oh!

859
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,500
Oh!

860
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:27,800
Oh!

861
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,280
Turn on.

862
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,140
Please tune in.

863
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,060
And switch off.

864
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,980
Switch, switch, switch.

865
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,260
Switch, switch, switch.

866
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,300
We certainly don't want to be tricked.

867
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,840
Next day's a-coming.

868
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,300
And the pigs are bummin'

869
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,040
I said, X-Days are comin'

870
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,760
And them little pigs are bummin'

871
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,600
Those conspiracy Duke Pink Boy normals are gonna fry

872
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,560
They won't even know what hit them

873
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,480
That old Stark fist is gonna come down hard

874
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,480
But nothing's guaranteed, dear friends

875
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,920
I'm a card-carrying member of the Church of the Subgenius

876
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,000
I'm the almighty king of slap

877
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,040
But when X-Day comes around

878
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,940
The only thing I have is my unshakable faith in Bob

879
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,240
Turn on. Tune in. And slap!

880
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,480
X-Days are comin'

881
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,760
And the pigs are bummin'

882
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,040
Don't you wanna be saved?

883
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,720
X-Days are comin'

884
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,760
And the pigs are bummin'

885
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,520
Listen to me, mister, it's salvation I'm talkin' about

886
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,800
Oh!

887
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,700
Oh!

888
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:10,740
Oh!

889
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:12,540
Oh!

890
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:12,560


891
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:13,520
Oh!

892
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,020
Oh!

893
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:25,220
Cut the porn!

894
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,480
I mean, this is the... this is the fulcrum event of human history.

895
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,920
We're subgenius history.

896
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,360
We don't care about human history.

897
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,880
This is when we finally get our history back in our own hands.

898
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,760
We created the humans.

899
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,900
80 million years ago, our ancestors did.

900
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,040
Our greatest mistake.

901
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,360
This is our chance to correct that mistake.

902
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,220
Of course, there's tremendous feeling of anticipation.

903
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,700
I have actually been, I've had butterflies in my stomach

904
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,320
for a couple of months now.

905
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,680
It's been getting more and more frequent.

906
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,680
Jeez, it's really coming.

907
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,580
This is really happening.

908
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,640
20 years ago, I thought 1998 was a million years off.

909
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,920
I'm surprised that I live to see 1998.

910
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,460
To be honest with y'all, about a week ago,

911
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,280
I had a vision of 7 o'clock coming and Reverend Stang

912
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,880
getting up on stage and making some kind of lame excuse

913
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,300
why the sausage didn't come.

914
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,420
And some bent dumbass out in the audience

915
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,360
just stepping out and putting a bullet in.

916
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,180
This is a voice speaking to you from thousands of miles

917
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:36,680
beyond.

918
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,460
Your planet.

919
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:38,820
Morning.

920
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,340
Morning.

921
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,080
Morning.

922
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:41,080


923
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,740
The final hour is approaching for the people of Earth.

924
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:45,660
No.

925
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:46,740
No.

926
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,000
No.

927
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,140
No.

928
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:47,220
Please.

929
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:47,480
No.

930
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:47,840
No.

931
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,140
No.

932
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:48,660
No.

933
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:48,960


934
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:49,260
No.

935
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:49,440
No.

936
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:49,560


937
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:49,800
No.

938
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,000
No.

939
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,440
No.

940
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,160
No.

941
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:51,480
No.

942
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,040
No.

943
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:53,600
No.

944
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:56,940
No.

945
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,280
No.

946
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:06,760


947
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:06,760


948
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:06,760


949
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:06,760


950
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:06,760


951
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:06,760


952
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:06,880
It's Articus.

953
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,480
No, there's nothing in me.

954
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,120
So I must be right.

955
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:10,680
Thank you.

956
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,120
So thanks for the poolade.

957
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,360
Stang told me to make it last night.

958
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,140
He just mentioned,

959
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,900
here's the poolade that we're making

960
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,780
and here's the cup.

961
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,540
I mixed it myself.

962
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,180
I watched the kitchen staff.

963
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,220
I filled the thing myself.

964
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,240
It's got the lid on it.

965
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,840
You don't want to put like aند so much in there.

966
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,880
I'm just doing what Stang told me to do.

967
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,340
Attention, radio station technicians.

968
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:47,900
The brief moment of bad sound coming up is not your tape deck jamming.

969
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,440
Thank you.

970
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,320
I've been waiting 17 years for this to happen.

971
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,160
I have never waited for anything so long in my life.

972
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,780
I didn't wait to get out of school for 17 years.

973
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:07,900
There has never been a goal in my life that was a clear-cut date and time that I could work toward.

974
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,940
And that's been shining like a beacon on the horizon to me.

975
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,880
I've had this day to cling to, and now that it's finally coming up,

976
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:23,000
I've spent the past few months marching toward it with every bit of resolve I could muster

977
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,980
to take care of business, to finally get everything in my life in a row

978
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,760
because this is a world I've never seen before.

979
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,560
It's a wonderful opportunity.

980
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:39,840
We're on the threshold of the end of this civilization.

981
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,360
All right!

982
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,220
No. No, no, no, please, no, no, no.

983
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,560
Eternal salvation or triple your money back!

984
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,560
Sounds too good to be true, dear friends.

985
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,420
Industrial strength! Anti-religion!

986
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,040
I don't know, I think we've been duped.

987
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,320
We have nothing to hide.

988
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,560
Religion is poison.

989
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,100
Religion is poison.

990
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,180
So I kiss the antidote.

991
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:22,480
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

992
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,880
I don't know, I think we've been duped.

993
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,040
We have nothing to hide.

994
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,340
Religion is poison.

995
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,920
Religion is poison.

996
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,140
So I kiss the antidote.

997
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,440
Religion is poison.

998
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,020
Religion is poison.

999
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,260
Love is your only hope.

1000
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,240
It's true.

1001
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,940
Cults control money.

1002
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,060
That's how they work.

1003
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,400
I need a slack fix.

1004
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,880
Give me that slack, baby.

1005
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,100
Give me my slack fix.

1006
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:57,920
Give it up.

1007
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,540
Give it up.

1008
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:58,900
Give it up.

1009
00:46:59,380 --> 00:46:59,820
Give it up.

1010
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,960
Gotta have my slack fix.

1011
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,260
We have nothing to hide.

1012
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,880
Religion is poison.

1013
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,440
Religion is poison.

1014
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:09,780
Religion is poison.

1015
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,580
Slack is the antidote.

1016
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,720
Get off the earth now because you want to have sex with it.

1017
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,100
And also, help you find parts, you know, of any kind.

1018
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:18,900
Of your spaceship.

1019
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:19,500
Yeah.

1020
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:25,660
You know, you'll be pointing the way if you're a male, and it'll be any kind of part you need for either pleasure in this dimension or another, I suppose.

1021
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,700
Hey, I think we all agree that...

1022
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,560
Bye, golly.

1023
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,560
It's great to be an American and live in a...

1024
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:31,980
In a...

1025
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,260
In a...

1026
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:32,760
In a...

1027
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:37,300
Gosh darn it, one of the most highly advanced technological societies.

1028
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,180
I'm not proud of the Hill Card.

1029
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:45,020
It's become very apparent that nobody can make a shelter of men with no man-god.

1030
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:54,660
The daughter-in-law of Butler, who claims to be rude, raised being possessed, make mother-tosses as she used to, and things fly for the air.

1031
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,320
Goodbye, Dad.

1032
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:55,740
You know...

1033
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,540
I gotta go into tuna can now, man.

1034
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,220
Bye, Pop resource.

1035
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,700
I hate people, you know?

1036
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,080
Everywhere says,ения...

1037
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,020
You need to carry that Agatha.

1038
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,940
I'll let you know a sweet story...

1039
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,020
Oh, my God...

1040
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,020


1041
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,200
Come what might Sister Michelle expect...

1042
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,420
I want myrendocte back back back to normal.

1043
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,800
Take it easy, Dad.

1044
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,540
I'd like it.

1045
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:18,600
Exactly.

1046
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:20,600
Uh...

1047
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,220
I want my blind man.

1048
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:58,180
This conversation can serve no purpose anymore.

1049
00:48:59,300 --> 00:48:59,500
Goodbye.

1050
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,100
How?

1051
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:04,560
How?

1052
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,240
How?

1053
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:12,500
We've heard so far the voice of life on only a single world.

1054
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,200
But for the first time, as we shall see,

1055
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,620
we've begun a serious scientific search

1056
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,580
for the cosmic future.

1057
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,520
Well, I guess to be honest,

1058
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:28,380
I'd have to say that I never really expected any flying saucers.

1059
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,740
To be honest,

1060
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,360
a lot of this stuff is really, really stupid.

1061
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:42,280
But I guess a lot of people need something really stupid in their lives

1062
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,200
to give it meaning.

1063
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,600
I don't know. It's still a pretty beautiful world we've got here.

1064
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:50,040
And Bob is still a very important part of my life

1065
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:50,580
and always will be.

1066
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:50,580


1067
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,780
So, yeah, I am disappointed.

1068
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,760
But part of being a subgenius is saying,

1069
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,440
okay, I'm disappointed and miserable about this.

1070
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,300
Let's put it aside and keep going.

1071
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,680
I have every confidence the Church of the Subgenius

1072
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,500
will outlast today,

1073
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,320
outlast the memory of all of us involved.

1074
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,520
It's here to stay.

1075
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,340
This is more than about our likes.

1076
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,740
About liking Bob.

1077
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,600
We're doing the same catchphrases.

1078
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,260
This is about understanding the same kind of pain.

1079
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,360
The same sort of inability to find happiness

1080
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,440
in a world that doesn't seem to be made

1081
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,820
for people like us.

1082
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,120
We are truly mutants.

1083
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,800
What I've always tried to keep in it

1084
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,980
is an emotional connection, you know,

1085
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,560
with real human feelings.

1086
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,740
People that have, that fall in love

1087
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,060
and have kids or get depressed

1088
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:45,700
and can't get the right job

1089
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,420
and are miserable.

1090
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,060
All that human stuff, you know.

1091
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,440
It's like, that's what we try

1092
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,220
to keep some vestige of.

1093
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,120
And I think that's what really attracts people

1094
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,960
is that behind all these layers and layers

1095
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,820
and layers of stuff,

1096
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,180
somewhere down in there,

1097
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,620
there's a kernel of,

1098
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,900
I hate to use the word humanity,

1099
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,900
but, and it's not.

1100
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,020
It's yetensiny,

1101
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,960
but because look at most humans.

1102
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,720
You know, that's what we're really trying

1103
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,320
to hold on to is that real core

1104
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,400
of real realness, you know.

1105
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,580
Do you know how much?

1106
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,200
Do you know how it feels?

1107
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,300
To be different from others?

1108
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,140
To get picked on and you can't find a lover?

1109
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,340
Are you a subgenius?

1110
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,180
Do you know how it feels?

1111
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,340
Do you know how it feels

1112
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,220
when you have to go work

1113
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,260
at a job that you hate

1114
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,220
and your boss is a jerk?

1115
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,520
Are you a subgenius?

1116
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,440
Do you know how it feels?

1117
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,480
Do you know how it feels

1118
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,580
with a gun in your hand?

1119
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,300
In your back?

1120
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,580
When the conspiracy

1121
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,240
takes away all your slack?

1122
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,580
Are you a subgenius?

1123
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,300
Do you know how it feels?

1124
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:05,040
It's the end of the world as we know it.

1125
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:09,600
It's the end of the world as we know it.

1126
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:14,040
It's the end of the world as we know it.

1127
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,100
And I feel fine.

1128
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,720
It's definitely a sign of the apocalypse.

1129
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,600
Negative feelings directed at others

1130
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,820
is never constructive.

1131
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:29,860
Grill bow!

1132
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,000
All packed up and ready to go

1133
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,880
Waiting for the exit saucer to show

1134
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,640
Come on!

1135
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,700
The normals say the rupture's a hoax

1136
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,080
And all the people who are in it

1137
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,080


1138
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,080


1139
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,080


1140
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,080


1141
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,220
All those sub-Ds are all just slapped up on dough

1142
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,980
But I know Bob wouldn't lie

1143
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,180
The X-ray rupture is the one true escape

1144
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,660
The one kid hungry

1145
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,040
I don't slack

1146
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,860
I need a slack fix

1147
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,320
Gimme gimme slack fix

1148
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,640
Joseph Ford slack fix

1149
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,260
Give it up I need slack

1150
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,780
Religion is poison

1151
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:13,960
I'm out of here!

1152
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,220
Religion is poison

1153
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:20,340
The final hour is approaching for the people of Earth.

1154
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,740
I hate to disappoint you, but the world is not coming to an end.

1155
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,020
Wah wah wah wah.

1156
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,080
Ah yes, dear friends.

1157
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,960
But you know it's not too late.

1158
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:36,100
Like we said, there's...

1159
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,280
You've still got time to get on board.

1160
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,080
Next day, X-Day 99.

1161
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,280
Let me do some credits here.

1162

1163
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,580
Religion is Poison,

1164

Countdown to X-Day,

1183
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,760

Take Me Off to Space

1192
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,400
by Nenslo

1193
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,900
at the beginning of the show.

1194
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,940
And there was a little bit of instrumental music there

1195
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,880
by El Diablo.

1196
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,900
And, uh, I, I think that,

1197
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,580
that about covers,

1198
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,560
