1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Now, you know it's kind of fun to see that good homemade pie.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:12,600
Ask any waitress and she'll tell you that the small cube of cigarette ashes makes the wonderful difference in flakiness.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,200
Rub a cigarette butt in the palm of your hand.

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,360
You'll feel the fleas drop off immediately.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,080
They puff, bubble, and turn into the kind of crust every cook is proud to bake.

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,160
Get several packages.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:32,220
For some unexplained reason, the General Motors Research Laboratories have recently issued a bulletin that adds tenderness and flakiness to your pie crust.

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:37,940
You know, the kind you make every time when you use dry snuff and then brush it thoroughly into the hide.

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,680
Well, I guess that should keep you busy over the weekend.

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,220
This is the Radio Network.

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,480
From PR News in Washington, I'm bombing a television station.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,520
The U.N.'s top emergency relief official says time is running out for denouncing tens of thousands of victims

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,140
and quaking.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,700
U.N. emergency chief Jan Egeland says gas rooms aren't deterring 37 people.

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,080
The sheriff arrived bundled in sleeping bags prepared for that.

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:10,340
On Wall Street 422-1085, President Bush is forced to balance a deficit-riddled budget in Crawford, Texas.

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,180
The British news media have been threatened with persecution if they publish PR news from London.

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,640
Speaker 6 hit MPB.

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:28,680
Justin.

20
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,460
Fans not yet teaming with river's specifically

21
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,000
where it means you have to die

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,000


23
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,720
Call here

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,000
ooh

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:43,760
Hi!

26
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:44,680
Shhh!

27
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,260
When that's a heavy joke,

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,460
Who said that?

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,760
Put that slide on!

30
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,940
Now who said that?

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,400
Who are you?

32
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,520
Going off nice for you!

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,260
Oh, like my face?

34
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,560
That means you did the devil a day later today.

35
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,180
How in tarnation like David Opsiskin!

36
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,560
How's that?

37
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:58,860
Yeah!

38
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,400
Heh heh heh heh!

39
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,460
Oh, shut up!

40
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,500
Shut up! Shut up!

41
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:02,640
Why?

42
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,720
And I remember the delight with which I devoured it.

43
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,940
Now that I have been reading over all the letters which he wrote to me laboriously with his own hand after the fashion of those days,

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,080
I feel that I did not at the time appreciate how much he thought and cared for the

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,340
Self-genius,

46
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:19,740
Powerful,

47
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,720
Smart,

48
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,580
King!

49
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,500
Marr!

50
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,660
You might sit over there on a Monday morning and talk about how Bob got the money,

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,280
But I guarantee you Bob's gonna get it!

52
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,060
Bob's gonna pay his bill and then get you to go over and lick your sores on Monday morning!

53
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,800
And I can guarantee you if we said that at one of our radio stations,

54
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,980
The FCC would come down and say,

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,040
you have to sit over there and go down and pull the plug!

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,500
Bob!

57
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:43,820
Bob!

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,200
Bob!

59
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:44,880
Bob!

60
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,260
Bob!

61
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:45,660
Bob!

62
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,100
Bob!

63
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:46,400
Bob!

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,460
Bob!

65
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,640
So let's get to it!

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,900
The first segment of it for the benefit of those who just arrived we did a few hymns.

67
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,180
We had a little community singing, and we rappled on the first

68
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,000
Self-genius!

69
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:00,860
Powerful!

70
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:01,940
Smart!

71
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:02,520


72
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,400
I see, my name is Bob.

73
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,260
Dr. Lester!

74
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:07,700
Security!

75
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,840
No, sir, it's a...

76
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,300
It's just a little mix-up with your secretary.

77
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:11,980
Uh!

78
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,040
She's not my secretary.

79
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,960
She's what they call an executive liaison.

80
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,300
And I'm not banging her, if that's what you're implying.

81
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,600
No, sir, not at all.

82
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,340
I want to speak to you.

83
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:26,760
Yes?

84
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,720
This morning.

85
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,420
All right.

86
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,300
From distance.

87
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,020
Yes?

88
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,840
Hitler.

89
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,460
Yes?

90
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,580
And here.

91
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,300
Oh, yes.

92
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,420
And when I speak.

93
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,120
Yes?

94
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,040
And think.

95
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,560
Yes?

96
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
About Hitler.

97
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,320
Yes?

98
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,340
I can't help.

99
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,140
Oh, what about?

100
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,100
Thinking about him.

101
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,620
Yes?

102
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,600
Hitler.

103
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,460
Oh, yes.

104
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,140
And here.

105
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,840
And here.

106
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,920
They tell me.

107
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,280
Yes?

108
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,620
That he's a man.

109
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,520
Oh, yes.

110
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,400
Who lives.

111
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:49,820
Yes?

112
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,040
In a storm.

113
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh, yes.

114
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,460
Town.

115
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,220
All about.

116
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,180
Elevator.

117
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,960
Yes, sir.

118
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,640
Service.

119
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,120
Yes?

120
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:56,800
Go.

121
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,560
Yes?

122
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,500
From one.

123
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,240
Yes?

124
00:03:59,520 --> 00:03:59,960
Patient.

125
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,580
Yes?

126
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,140
To another.

127
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,080
Oh, yes.

128
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,740
In his past.

129
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,220
Now.

130
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,480
I'm telling you.

131
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:04,940
Oh, no, sir.

132
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,040
This morning.

133
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,620
Yes, sir.

134
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,260
And he.

135
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,220
Yes, sir.

136
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,840
Is the dictator.

137
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,940
Oh, yes.

138
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,400
Of Germany.

139
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,400
Yes, sir.

140
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,740
Hitler.

141
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,860
Oh, yes.

142
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,940
You must come down.

143
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,600
Oh, yes.

144
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,100
You must come down.

145
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,620
Oh, yes.

146
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,640
I thank you.

147
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,460
Oh, yes.

148
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,140
As you.

149
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,020
Oh, yes.

150
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,420
Take that.

151
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,360
Oh, yes.

152
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,460
In your easy chair.

153
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:22,860
Oh, yes.

154
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,800
Wine men.

155
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,700
Oh, yes.

156
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,640
It's time.

157
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,460
Oh, yes.

158
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,540
On the battle seat.

159
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,200
Oh, yes.

160
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,160
Go on.

161
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,020
Um.

162
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,800
Go on.

163
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,240
Oh.

164
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,920
For years, my daughter Maggie smelled like the cracks in the schoolyard.

165
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,080
Go on.

166
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,380
Well, she finally agreed to let me wash her piano teacher.

167
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,260
So I did.

168
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,660
Go on.

169
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:41,940
Go on.

170
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,280
And she just loved it.

171
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,960
She said that it made her smell like her butt crack poo.

172
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,500
Why?

173
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,240
Why?

174
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:47,720
Why?

175
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,000
Because she said the poo smelled like her piano teacher.

176
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,540
Smell like the piano teacher.

177
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,460
Are you planning to increase or extend?

178
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,380
The, um, increasing, uh, that, uh.

179
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,060
Are you planning to extend or increase?

180
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,560
Um, but, um, that, that, uh.

181
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,260
Uh-oh.

182
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,500
Uh-oh.

183
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,740
Uh-oh.

184
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,300
Uh-oh.

185
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,660
Uh-oh.

186
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,320
Uh-oh.

187
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,320


188
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,820
Uh-oh.

189
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,480
Uh-oh.

190
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,160
Uh-oh.

191
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,840
Uh-oh.

192
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,020
Uh-oh.

193
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,580
Uh-oh.

194
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,260
Uh-oh.

195
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,500
Uh-oh.

196
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,000
Uh-oh.

197
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,600
Uh-oh.

198
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:18,880
Uh-oh.

199
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,260
Uh-oh.

200
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,700
Uh-oh.

201
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:19,900
Uh-oh.

202
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:19,900


203
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,060
Uh-oh.

204
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,060


205
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,060


206
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,060


207
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,380
There was a garden.

208
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,200
Uh-oh.

209
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,460
Uh-oh.

210
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,280
There was a tree.

211
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,420
Uh-oh.

212
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,400
And there were three of me.

213
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,620
I was a snake and a crow and a cat.

214
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,360
And in the tree all three of me sat for eternity.

215
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,680
And that was that.

216
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,240
One night,

217
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:52,600
an apple grew and the apple knew everything that I knew it was part of me and it was part of the

218
00:05:52,600 --> 00:06:00,760
tree the tree that I climbed into and flew into and slithered to and now I grew and there I sat

219
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:09,960
as an apple and a snake and a crow and a cat and that was pretty much that until one day

220
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:21,640
a girl who was not me came out to play and I could see what she wanted from me she wanted to

221
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:34,200
know what the Apple knew and I said you already do my dear otherwise you wouldn't be here and

222
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,720
she said please I've come to eat the apples from the tree

223
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:51,920
and I said no I am an apple and a snake and a cat and a crow and she said please I need to have that

224
00:06:51,920 --> 00:07:04,060
apple inside of me she wanted to know everything I knew and I said but my dear you already do then

225
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,940
she stamped her foot and said for heaven's sake why can't you be me

226
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:21,240
a cat and a crow and a snake and I said no let the Apple go then she took a bite and I could tell

227
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:30,760
that she knew I was right she walked away weeping with the apple in her hand and fed my secrets to

228
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:39,940
another man so I slid away and flew away and out of the tree I ran I who was once one and I was one

229
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:48,860
now forever three a cat and a crow and a snake without a tree just a snake and a crow and a cat

230
00:07:48,860 --> 00:08:00,500
and that was that uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh the Billy Nair show did that friends and they like

231
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,080
the amino acids that we're hearing in the background will be at x day nine I'm told

232
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,940
and that song was from their album Return to the Moon and I'm told that it's going to be a good

233
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:18,460
song to bring a doom you can get more information from Billy Nair.com this is our of slack number

234
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:28,720
1027. uh happy last year friends the starting collages and the ending ones are by Mr Fernand

235
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:37,880
although the pre-intro intro was by Department of transmutation and the post-intro intro was by

236
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,500
Reverend Maynard

237
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:48,300
then Reverend Noel Preff did the Hitler to hell cut up and music did I mention this is the amino

238
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,780
acids in the background but let's get back to the subgenius over the edge puzzling evidence

239
00:08:53,780 --> 00:09:01,800
business retreat on KPFA where puzzling evidence will tell us just what to do next

240
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,780
but right now I think the important thing is to laugh at Hal and 420 guys

241
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,900
recreation back to San Jose

242
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,940
Barbara

243
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,940
help

244
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,600
the

245
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,640
kids were having our own little night of slack I can just see Pedro стать

246
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,680
back

247
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,300
maybe just outside and they can't get the doors

248
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,460
theinison

249
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:37,920
post office

250
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:37,920


251
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,180
you know

252
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:38,560
healthcare

253
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,420
and

254
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:39,940
each to his and ter 해서

255
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,300
You're right in a hovercraft.

256
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,040
That's real funny.

257
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,780
Yeah, why is that funny?

258
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,620
Because they're on the radio.

259
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,860
Yeah, that makes it funny.

260
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,360
Radio.

261
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,820
Funny how that works.

262
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,100
If I was just sitting at home saying this to myself, nothing, nada, zero zip.

263
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,880
But because I'm on the air.

264
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,820
You think it's incredibly interesting.

265
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,540
And it is.

266
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,200
My life.

267
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,020
To somebody as long as one person.

268
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,960
If we're getting through to even one soul.

269
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,200
That's all that matters.

270
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,060
That's all that matters.

271
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,980
If we didn't get one soul in Bob's pipe tonight.

272
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,500
Then it's all worth it.

273
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,760
All of it.

274
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,580
The pyramids.

275
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,140
The Statue of Liberty.

276
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,260
The Declaration of Independence.

277
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,060
It's all worth it if you are saved.

278
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,100
I think I want to get one of those little Reese buttercups in the shape of Hal.

279
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,600
I'll get two of those.

280
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,560
Wow.

281
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:49,520
Just having a little good-natured laugh at the Reverend, Reverend Dr. Hal, who is now, only now, just showing up.

282
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,020
Sure.

283
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
He's shown me up so many times.

284
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,740
I dare you to say a Hal-ism.

285
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,420
I doffed my hat to Hal.

286
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,260
We couldn't believe it because we've been following your progress by traffic report.

287
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,540
And that whole, you know, that car crash that killed so many hundreds of people.

288
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,020
What's happening?

289
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,760
Backed up all the way to San Jose.

290
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,080
All the way to San Jose.

291
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,700
And you have to get in the back of the line.

292
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,560
Even if you start in San Francisco, they make you go all the way back to San Jose and come back.

293
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,240
You know, I don't like to complain, but I've got some terrible things going on in there.

294
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,260
Like everybody else.

295
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,100
It's scratched in my ear.

296
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,820
Oh, I think old Reverend Stang.

297
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,360
He's up there in his high hill.

298
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,640
His big couch on the hill up there.

299
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,980
That big fancy trailer of his.

300
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,500
Oh, yeah.

301
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,240
Reverend Stang, you don't have to think about him.

302
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,740
Poor folks down here.

303
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,940
Down there in the salt mines with you.

304
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,260
Wiggly and wonky.

305
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,700
I'm in those salt mines right now.

306
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,640
Under Lake Erie.

307
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,460
It could cave in at any moment.

308
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,480
Or some mutated monster.

309
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,560
The walls, they're going in and out.

310
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,020
We don't know if tomorrow might be X-Day.

311
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,360
We don't know if this is Earth for sure.

312
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,500
Why do you think this is Earth?

313
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
I'm all confused now.

314
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,340
Which one's X-Day?

315
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,780
You just read it in a book somewhere.

316
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,980
Some scientist told you.

317
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,320
This is planet Earth.

318
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,380
Yeah, it could be K-Day.

319
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,900
And you're so sure of everything.

320
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,960
Oh, today is this date.

321
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,220
November 25, 2005.

322
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,620
Oh, it must be right.

323
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,720
Oh, this planet.

324
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,660
This must be Earth.

325
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,460
Oh, it's always been the United States of America.

326
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,700
Oh, yeah.

327
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,500
You assume so much.

328
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,320
And you don't know nothing.

329
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,480
You don't know a dang thing.

330
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,200
Nothing.

331
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
You don't know nothing?

332
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,160
You don't know less than nothing.

333
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,100
But what was this about Jack Ruby didn't have a molar?

334
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,880
What am I going to do?

335
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,040
And if you insist on being blind,

336
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,240
then why don't you just tear out your eyes

337
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,580
and send them to P.O. Box 181417, Cleveland, Idaho, 44118.

338
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,240
And why is it?

339
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,640
Because Bob loves you!

340
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,080
And puzzling evidence killed him for you.

341
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,920
Yep, sure did.

342
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,500
And what about that?

343
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,460
What is he going to do about it?

344
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,420
What is it like to know that you have to kill Bob?

345
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,340
This is the moment to know that you have to kill Bob.

346
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,640
The warfare is what killed him.

347
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:21,880
The warfare is what killed him.

348
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,900
We as people have to kill Bob in our minds.

349
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,440
It's salty out there at night and it's cold.

350
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,020
The guy from Star Trek, his...

351
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,720
He blasted him with some air.

352
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:36,080
Well, it was his will that he left him a sizable parcel as part of his estate.

353
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:36,640
Yeah.

354
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,840
And he was the warfare at that time.

355
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:39,920
Yeah.

356
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,860
But unfortunately after this we had a complete blackout of the records

357
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,000
and we weren't able to run them through our high-powered computer.

358
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:55,760
Until just a few moments ago when Ivan Stang began his historic broadcast.

359
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,160
And now the results are in.

360
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,060
It looks like Kennedy by a landslide.

361
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,540
That's right.

362
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,460
He is dead by a landslide and...

363
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,740
They're clearing off that landslide now and apparently no one was seriously hurt.

364
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,660
But why did no one try to kill Nixon?

365
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,700
That's the question.

366
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,820
I concede the sacred scribe ship to President John F. Kennedy.

367
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,920
An idiot like Ford, they tried to kill...

368
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
We will bear any burden.

369
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,460
...in Cuba.

370
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,040
That's right.

371
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,140
And it's not in Cuba, it's in Vietnam.

372
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,700
What about the prizes here?

373
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,880
We will be a church.

374
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,340
Well, ask Kennedy.

375
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,860
He's the sacred scribe now.

376
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,280
Somebody's going to be awarding the prizes a little later on in the program.

377
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,580
Oh, I thought it was we will accept any prize.

378
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,160
He's known to accept...

379
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,720
...with a ground war that they couldn't win.

380
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,480
We will hold on to any prize.

381
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,460
But Kennedy's policy was special forces in Vietnam.

382
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,720
Yeah, and...

383
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,500
They're very special.

384
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,460
...subgenius forces in Dallas.

385
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,160
Yep.

386
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,480
Where are the tapes with Maryland?

387
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,360
Somehow Kennedy's plan went wrong.

388
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,900
Who has the Maryland tapes?

389
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,140
Yeah, and all the other tapes.

390
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,680
There are many Maryland tapes.

391
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,640
Think of all the tapes.

392
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,740
That's the problem is you have to store them.

393
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,560
So bad guys have warehouses full of tapes.

394
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,220
Well, all the Judah Vickners.

395
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,640
What about the Judah Vickners who had sex with both Giancana and Kennedy?

396
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,660
Buckets of historical walled...

397
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:08,740
That is why.

398
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,780
...wire tappings.

399
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,000
These are the two most powerful...

400
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,760
Bathtubs.

401
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,640
Mysterious tapping on the walls.

402
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,580
...closetfuls.

403
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,740
Tapping under tables.

404
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,480
Seances.

405
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,080
And warehouses.

406
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,360
And intimate recordings.

407
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,640
And warehouses of every single tape.

408
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,740
Elvis glasses are...

409
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,980
And the...

410
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,680
They're all dangerous.

411
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,000
...entire collection...

412
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,340
It's like this end shot in...

413
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,120
...of Elvis collectible plates.

414
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,220
Citizen Kong.

415
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,560
You can get anything you want.

416
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,460
They're doing a remake of that.

417
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:31,940
King...

418
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,960
Citizen Kong.

419
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,360
Yeah.

420
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,320
It's a sled at the end.

421
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,520
Oh, Roy Cohn?

422
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,720
Charles Foster Crowe.

423
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:38,720


424
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,560
What?

425
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,280
Yes.

426
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,020
Charles Foster Kong.

427
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,120
Charles Foster...

428
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,020
The greatest imperialist industrialist of all.

429
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,520
...the eighth wonder of the world.

430
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,640
I really like at the end where he's holding a sled and he says...

431
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,480
Bob Dobbs.

432
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,240
Joe is cuter though, but...

433
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,000
No, it's a plane.

434
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,180
He's holding a plane.

435
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:57,620
Oh.

436
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,700
Kidding me.

437
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,640
It's named...

438
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,300
I was on drugs...

439
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,600
A plane named Rosebob.

440
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm Condemned.

441
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:08,720


442
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:08,720


443
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:08,720


444
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:08,720


445
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:08,720


446
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:08,720


447
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:08,720


448
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:08,720


449
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:08,720


450
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:08,720


451
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:08,720


452
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:08,720


453
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:08,720


454
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,240
They created a show where police could rely on pro- sjunk, puisqu میijdمون

459
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,780
PR news ended yesterday in Washington.

460
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,260
We'll be right back.

461
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,780
On your knee.

462
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,740
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

463
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,120
Huge.

00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,920
But I, but I, but I, but I, but I don't, but I don't.

Thick, thick, thick, thick, thick, thick, thick.

466
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,260
Not good.

467
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:44,760
Yeah.

468
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,000
Chicken hock, chicken hock, chicken hock, chicken hock.

469
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,780
Yeah, I'm one of them.

470
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,120
Really.

471
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,440
Cult, cult, cult.

472
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,600
Cult, cult, cult.

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,180
Cult, cult, cult, cult, cult.

474
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,560
From PR news in Washington, I'm abandoned in the Sahara Desert in Morocco.

475
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,960
The African pregnant children said they were loaded.

476
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:05,520
Governor Arnold has signed legislation that will bolster kids buying video games with PR content.

477
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,080
PR content.

478
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,980
Governor Arnold said that video games availability is important to him.

479
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,380
This is extremely important.

480
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,860
Meanwhile, authorities in India say.

481
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,180
In India, Indians in India were attributed to road accidents caused by PR news in New Delhi.

482
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,860
Parts of Pakistan are reported to be in ruin after today's PR news.

483
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,020
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now.

484
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,600
The reason this is happening is because of you.

485
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,980
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.

486
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:42,160
Change the country from a secular progressive based philosophical country.

487
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up.

488
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,560
Doubt religion.

489
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,300
That's right, that's right.

490
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,800
Doubt religion.

491
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,660
That's right, that's right.

492
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,500
You in the middle.

493
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,520
Pure ignorance.

494
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,440
Do that.

495
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,200
Do that.

496
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:51,440
Do that.

497
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,040
From a hatred.

498
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:52,880
Do that.

499
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,780
From a hatred.

500
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,820
Here's the point.

501
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,860
Accused Bush and Cheney of lying because they wanted Halliburton to make more money.

502
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,420
Smearing on each other.

503
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,460
This kind of crap.

504
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,320
Whip, whip, whip.

505
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:04,500
Whip, whip, whip.

506
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,540
I'm talking.

507
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:05,660
I'm talking.

508
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,880
Blame propaganda.

509
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,860
That's what I'm talking about.

510
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,300
I'm gonna do it.

511
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,660
Kill us where we live.

512
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,680
Spin zone.

513
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,180
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin zone.

514
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:16,840
Spin zone.

515
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,620
This kind of crap.

516
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,740
I'm talking.

517
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,160
I'm talking crap.

518
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:20,720
I'm talking crap.

519
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,060
That was Norelpref, dear friends.

520
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,860
You can get more of that and about that at norelpref.com.

522
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And before that, a whole bunch of leads.

523
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:46,960
I'm talking about the

524
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,160
Oh, I had slack!

525
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,480
It was mine all along.

526
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,220
But only now that it's gone do I recognize it.

527
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,080
And do you think anyone had any care for the whinings of a little boy?

528
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,420
Loser.

529
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:12,220
No, they just laugh with a disdainful leer while you've lost your slack forever.

530
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,900
Kick that weirdo.

531
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:15,820
Put.

532
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,360
He's not like us.

533
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,700
Look at this poor young lad.

534
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,480
Look at him.

535
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,200
Glasses.

536
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,820
Large was his bounty and his frame sincere.

537
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,980
But when I'm looking, think of the others who might follow his prestigious footsteps.

538
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,620
Can't get a girlfriend.

539
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,340
A youth.

540
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,740
Loser.

541
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,040
Lives with his parents.

542
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,180
Lives with his parents.

543
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,020
Plays with his computer.

544
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,700
Fair silence.

545
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,320
When photos like these are available.

546
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,860
At his humble birth.

547
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,420
Trekkie.

548
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,500
And melancholy Clinton.

549
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,360
At the stamp collector.

550
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,080
Wants to get an Xbox now.

551
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,360
It isn't even spring.

552
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,200
And iPods.

553
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,420
No father seek his merit to disclose or draw their secrets.

554
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:55,900
No.

555
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,220
No.

556
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,800
I don't come in a blossom to a gelada.

557
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,320
Girls don't come round much.

558
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,100
No, but.

559
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,820
You know, and.

560
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,400
You don't go round them now ever since what happened to Betty Jean.

561
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,720
Only to die.

562
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,020
And so it goes.

563
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,020


564
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,060
And so it goes.

565
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,400
And so it goes.

566
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,180
The truth he will disclose.

567
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,560
He just kind of works with his computer and just dreams.

568
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:18,080
Are you going to be like that friend or are you going to let loose the bob in you?

569
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,620
Unbuckle your belt, bend over and let it fly.

570
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:29,600
Of course, today's more understanding, caring parents don't take off that belt buckle and

571
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,640
flail around the way mom and dad may used to have done.

572
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,000
I know we've all been there, but this is a different generation.

573
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,460
She's pretty.

574
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:46,060
And, and, and, you know, maybe I can see that dub of the X-Files.

575
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,140
Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction shall drive it from him.

576
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,840
I just wish I could think.

577
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,800
I can't think of anything.

578
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,340
The blueness of the wound cleanses away the evil.

579
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,400
Still pictures fly.

580
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,460
The closer to the bone, the sweeter the more.

581
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,620
Do you hear me, mom and dad?

582
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,940
The TV took away the pain.

583
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,700
Do you hear me, subgenius mothers and fathers out there?

584
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,320
The TV took away the pain.

585
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,380
The blueness of the wound cleanses away the evil.

586
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,260
I'll just float here for a while.

587
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,100
And more of the same.

588
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,060
Beat slack into that child.

589
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,360
I'll just, I'll just.

590
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,740
This picture is not one typical of a disease.

591
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,240
I won't try to get, get smarter.

592
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,940
I'll just.

593
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:28,060
A subgenius child is formed in the crucible of pain and blood.

594
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,220
Trying to get smarter.

595
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,300
Magazine.

596
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,800
I hope they don't hit me again.

597
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,460
It approaches another class of magazines.

598
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,380
Now you are pure.

599
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,640
Repeat after me.

600
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,600
Will you, my ward, ever flinch or falter in this life?

601
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,780
Well, I hope so.

602
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,480
I hope so.

603
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,120
I hope so.

604
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,960
I hope so.

605
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,720
Congratulations.

606
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,860
You are now a soldier of Bob.

607
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,900
Now your first assignment is to go out along the 34th Street

608
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,860
and to pick up all the garbage at the left side of the road,

609
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,600
transfer it to these orphanages,

610
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,320
put it in인지 plastic bags here,

611
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,500
and we wanna see you about 2 o'clock in the afternoon

612
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,680
by the water cooler over there.

613
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,140
And we're gonna have some signs we want you to use.

614
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,160
So this is Mr. Schwobler.

615
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,300
He's gonna be your supervisor.

616
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:17,900
Okay.

617
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,700
Good luck and enjoy being a subgenius son.

618
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:20,960
Ok.

619
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,200
We're going to knock off for lunch.

620
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,400
Thank you sir.

621
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,100
Thank you.

622
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:24,640
Thank you.

623
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,240
Yeah, the right man.

624
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,240
I will draw his jigs.

625
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,900
I'll help you.

626
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,720
Ah, wow.

627
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,480
Thank you pretty.

628
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:28,900
Okay.

629
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,100
That's ...ant specialized.

630
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,500
Thank you Mr. Schwobler.

631
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,700
At first ...

632
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:33,940
Ahhhh!!!

633
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:34,600
That's things you can, eh, they are not actually good.

634
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,120
You will want to turn away from him.

635
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,640
Then you may find him a silent, unresisting target for your ridicule.

636
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,320
Mister, why is your head so big, mister?

637
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,580
But if you come to know him...

638
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,820
Have you always been the way you are now?

639
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,440
You will begin to see beyond the perversion of his form.

640
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,360
Are you in any pain? Are your parents still alive?

641
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,940
And discover the beauty in the beast.

642
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,800
At no time have I met with such a perverted or degraded version of a human being as this man.

643
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,100
I am not an animal.

644
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,000
From PR News in Washington, I'm slamming into a tree.

645
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,620
I'm the first of many.

646
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,800
Three or four of them.

647
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,500
Uh, uh.

648
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,580
Here's bad. Here's bad. I'm bad.

649
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,700
Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas says this is PR News.

650
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,460
Two people were PR'd on California's busy Highway 101 this morning.

651
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,700
Three people are reported PR'd.

652
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,520
In South Central Nebraska this morning, a moderate earthquake struck several who were trapped inside.

653
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,300
For PR News, I'm in a large portion of Central Nebraska.

654
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:48,800
New Jersey transit officials predicted New Jersey Turnpike Authority spokesman Joe Orlando would clog major arteries for a six-day period.

655
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,920
Because, uh...

656
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,240
Iraq's President Jalal Talabani is rejecting PR News in Washington.

657
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,540
Al Jazeera. Al Jazeera. Al Jazeera. Al Jazeera.

658
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,420
Rock. Rock.

659
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,900
Bush caused the war and created all these terrorists.

660
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,520
I throw.

661
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:01,800
Real simple.

662
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:02,780
Idiotic.

663
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,920
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

664
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,940
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

665
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,580
Amiga for people.

666
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,340
Amiga for people.

667
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:06,840
Gay. Gay.

668
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,620
Amiga for people.

669
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,280
Amiga for people.

670
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:08,580
Gay.

671
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,280
Television.

672
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,500
B.S. B.S. B.S.

673
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,080
Feelgood

674
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,760
B.S.

675
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,880
Art. Art. Art. Art. Art.

676
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,200
Stop the violence.

677
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,780
Go there. Go there.

678
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
They Just. Go there.

679
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,820
They Just. Go there.

680
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,620
Stop the violence.

681
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,600
Stop the violence.

682
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,760
I don't like that.

683
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,540
Amiga for people.

684
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,200
Ho! Yes!

685
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,100
Ho! Ho! Ho!

686
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,060
Did you mean ?

687
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,440
Yes!

688
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,500
Idiotic.

689
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,460
Yes! Yes!

690
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,720
You gonna be k-

691
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,820
Aba. Aba.

692
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:30,940
Aba.

693
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,660
Protesting abuse.

694
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,700
Protesting abuse.

695
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,640
Protesting abuse.

696
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,700
Protesting abuse.

697
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,020
Abu grab and club get moaned.

698
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,240
Abu grab and club get moaned.

699
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,060
Blame Bush for this.

700
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,980
Blame Bush for this.

701
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,440
Yeah.

702
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,740
But what were we doing?

703
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,800
I don't care.

704
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,520
Let them take me.

705
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,060
Let them take me.

706
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,920
I let them take me.

707
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,600
I don't don't don't don't care anymore.

708
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,560
That cut up was by Nor El-Pef and now one from Reverend Maynard Brainerd.

709
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,160
A person may stay in the anger state, waging an overt or covert war against a company.

710
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,800
If they are going to take money out of my pocket, I'm going to take some of theirs.

711
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:10,100
One aggravated driver ran his forklift into a tall stack of expensive electronic equipment.

712
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,240
Final damage estimates was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

713
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,980
What a darn shame.

714
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,360
Fortunately, the company's leadership team had been anticipating this initiative for several years.

715
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:28,440
And had been planning accordingly by developing several previous bomb drones, as well as other forms of sabotage that occurred over the past year.

716
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,140
We ended up with a bomb.

717
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,300
We're all set to go!

718
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,620
Hanker state.

719
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,420
Hanker.

720
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,840
Hanker.

721
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,260
Hanker.

722
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,360
Hanker.

723
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,400
erem.

724
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,400


725
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,400


726
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,400


727
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,400


728
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,300
Hanker state.

729
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,960
She quietly went into the cubby room, took the large screwdriver out of her purse, and jammed

730
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,360
the screwdriver repeatedly into the gears and pulleys of the cubby machine, rendering the

731
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,860
expensive machine totally inoperable.

732
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:50,700
She replaced the screwdriver and her evil eye in my building, thinking to herself, well,

733
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:58,240
if they are going to take money out of my pocket, I'm going to take some of theirs.

734
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,680
I love you.

735
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:58,680


736
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:58,680


737
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:58,680


738
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:58,680


739
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:58,680


740
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:58,680


741
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:58,680


742
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
I love you too.

743
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,680
From PR News in Washington, I'm Fawlty.

744
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,760
Authorities in Jordan destroyed and damaged and killed.

745
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:18,420
The Bureau of Statistics says 3,315, 2,059, 3,378, 38, 11, 59, 2,019, 4,36.

746
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,960
PR News in Washington.

747
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,720
PR's bad. PR's bad. I'm bad.

748
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,440
Democratic Party Chairman Howard Dean is going to war in Iraq.

749
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,080
But local officials say all residents have been killed, just to be sure.

750
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,920
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had some pointed hardline leaders of PR News in Washington.

751
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,420
I've seen so many movies on this show that I would never have gone to in a movie.

752
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:47,460
You can see B-movies that you don't have to pay the $10 for Batman.

753
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,400
You can just hear it and imagine a better one.

754
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,960
The Penguin will be here later, by the way.

755
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,560
Oh my God!

756
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,520
What is it coming?

757
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,100
Who? Who?

758
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:56,920
Who's going to be here?

759
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,380
The Penguin.

760
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:57,920
The Penguin himself.

761
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,480
The arch-criminal genius.

762
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,160
The real Penguin?

763
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,140
No, that's right.

764
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,880
The real man.

765
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
Where is he, by the way?

766
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,640
Not this Bobby De Niro movie guy.

767
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,160
Where is the Penguin?

768
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,400
The real arch-criminal that the Penguin was based on.

769
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,740
It's a real person.

770
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,900
The Batman comic book, of course, popularized this.

771
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,300
They cartooned him up a bit.

772
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,280
But there was a deformed criminal called the Penguin.

773
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,420
Called himself the head of the family.

774
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,580
A big belly like a fat guy?

775
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,840
That's right.

776
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,720
Wow.

777
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,140
That's right.

778
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,700
That's how you have to say it when you speak about the brow.

779
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,100
But he fancied himself vaguely intellectual in some way.

780
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:37,800
The Penguin did.

781
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,560
I must say.

782
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:43,940
The made-in-form brow was a not-so-manly version of the same thing.

783
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,040
I thought the Brow was very true.

784
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,020
But the original brow sent his armies out to collect all those images.

785
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,400
What's his name?

786
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,600
Jim Rowe.

787
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:49,600


788
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,100
Jim Rowe.

789
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:50,920
Jim Rowe.

790
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:50,920


791
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,160
Jim Rowe.

792
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:52,300


793
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:52,460
Jim Rowe.

794
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:52,560


795
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:52,560


796
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:52,880
Jim Rowe.

797
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,540
Jim Rowe.

798
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,260
Jim Rowe.

799
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:54,360
Jim Rowe.

800
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,540
Jim Rowe.

801
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,180
Was that tough interview?

802
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,080
But well, Jim wasn't frank enough, so he belonged to the thing.

803
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,080


804
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,080


805
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,000
He came from Buffett.

806
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,120
He was inilated.

807
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,480
So not him.

808
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:03,480


809
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:04,720
No.

810
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,660
That guy he died of reproductions.

811
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:07,660


812
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:07,660


813
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:14,740
That book is one of those pre-Jones verf 높 la sinistrinuv hid it in the を

814
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,340
So this is what it is.

815
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,160
It's this one here you see.

816
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,160


817
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,820
The Term of a prosecutor.

818
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:16,840
If Jim Rowe was about to make the case, it would have been published in begin-up.

819
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,880
It would be.

820
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,980
It was in 19.

821
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,220
No sir no sir.

822
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:21,420
Yeah taboo.

823
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,420
It's been published many years back.

824
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,520
Liby was out.

825
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,920
and they have children.

826
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,700
It's really an amazing movie.

827
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,180
Versus Penguin.

828
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,000
In a sub-cinematic way.

829
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,540
The Riddler.

830
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,500
Bob Dobson.

831
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,720
No, the Riddler won't be here.

832
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,700
Nina Hagen.

833
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,880
Nina Hagen won't be here.

834
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,880
She doesn't remember much about subgenius anymore.

835
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,140
I don't either, actually.

836
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,160
I was invited to her house to do Acid.

837
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,120
The night of the 85 shows in the back.

838
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,920
I was taken to the Charles Manson.

839
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,240
The Beatles.

840
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,320
No, she just invited me.

841
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,620
Wait a minute.

842
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,440
Which side is good?

843
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,800
The B side.

844
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,160
Your mom.

845
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,600
Because Bob may also be there.

846
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,580
Because that's the most good thing.

847
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,980
I thought I could do that.

848
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,080
I wanted to get some brow tickling.

849
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,360
Your mom.

850
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,100
Exactly.

851
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,200
What about your mom?

852
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,100
She had this whole staff that traveled with her.

853
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,520
I was tempted, though.

854
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:12,780
Boy.

855
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,700
What about your mom?

856
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,020
What could you learn from Gary Cabrogfram's mother, Nina Hagen?

857
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,840
He likes Bob, then.

858
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,780
Gary Cabrogfram's mother is Nina Hagen.

859
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,840
That's probably why you're a subgenius today.

860
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:22,700
Wow.

861
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,420
How'd that happen?

862
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,160
It's like a sandbox.

863
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,540
In a laboratory.

864
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,760
Ten people talking at odds.

865
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,500
Jody's father is named Bob.

866
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,100
Really?

867
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,000
Bob?

868
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,080
Ginger and Jody's father are both named Bob.

869
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,480
You do Bob with your uncle.

870
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,580
You can get to where you hate that name.

871
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,100
That's real funny.

872
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,640
Bob.

873
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:42,900
Hilarious.

874
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,540
Stick a pipe in it.

875
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,000
Stick a pipe in it and charge $500,000.

876
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,760
It's odd.

877
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,420
That's odd.

878
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,460
Look in his eye as he gives you your instructions.

879
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,180
Pretty hot.

880
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,740
Bob's afterbirth.

881
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,140
Yes.

882
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,540
Oh, now you're talking.

883
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,000
Oh, my mouth is watering.

884
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,440
Did you know that Bob Dobbs was an abortion survivor?

885
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,540
Yes, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

886
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,040
What?

887
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,780
The son of...

888
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,640
Jesus.

889
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,800
Gamera.

890
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,660
Jane McBride Dobbs, the sainted mother.

891
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,420
She tried to abort.

892
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:23,720
What?

893
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,480
The infant Bob because she wasn't really supposed to be pregnant.

894
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,980
Well, it was supposed to be.

895
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:48,980
But, unfortunately, the tenacious fetus hung in there and was not actually successfully aborted until Jane McBride Dobbs was strapped down in a Kansas wheat field in front of a tornado's path.

896
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,940
The tornado was able to extract the tiny infant Dobbs.

897
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,200
Susan Sarandon.

898
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:04,560
But then, when Jane saw the preemie Dobbs laying in that field panting and bleeding, she, of course, loved him.

899
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:11,660
She could no longer go through with the abortion, and she loved him as do all whose eyes fall upon him.

900
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,740
And she took Bob home and raised him.

901
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,880
So, friends, remember, the next time you're getting an abortion, just think about Bob.

902
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,420
If they'd successfully aborted him, then maybe we wouldn't...

903
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,220
We wouldn't have a church in the subgenius.

904
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,720
We wouldn't have.

905
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,280
Maybe that's an argument for abortion.

906
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,080
I don't know.

907
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,140
I'm going to go out and get one right away.

908
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,880
We would have no reason to exist.

909
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,360
I'm going to go.

910
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,060
I'm going to go.

911
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,900
I'm going to go.

912
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,460
We wouldn't have slack.

913
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,020
Philo's abortion.

914
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:42,700
Well...

915
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,420
That was a great band, Philo's abortion.

916
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,240
Yeah, they were...

917
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,880
I got proud when they broke up.

918
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,360
Philo's, oh...

919
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,280
You know, I was almost aborted, actually.

920
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,300
Were you?

921
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:53,940
I was.

922
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,040
It was a...

923
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,960
Wishful thinking.

924
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,700
It was a partial abortion.

925
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,340
...to term with a cancer.

926
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,840
And they said...

927
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,820
I'm not on Bob.

928
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,700
They said...

929
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,460
First, they said it's a cancer.

930
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,860
He was about 35.

931
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,540
And then they said, no, it's not a cancer.

932
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,080
It's breathing.

933
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,260
And then the third opinion was...

934
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,120
It's cancer.

935
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,780
I'm not on Bob.

936
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,020
I'm not on Bob.

937
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:10,800
I'm not on Bob.

938
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:10,920
I'm not on Bob.

939
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:10,920


940
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,660
And because it was a Catholic doctor, they didn't abort me.

941
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,340
And, I mean, the cancer died.

942
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,560
That was a great song, Abort Me.

943
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,260
The baby died, but I was born.

944
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,000
You can...

945
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,140
I'll be buried, of course.

946
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,560
And, no, that's a true story.

947
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,300
The twin...

948
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,880
My mother was brought in, and she...

949
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,320
Robert Pepe.

950
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,660
She deliberately went to a Catholic doctor.

951
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,240
That means her father pulled out.

952
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,660
Beware ye the Jesse Pepe ghost.

953
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,160
Weren't you one half of Simon Quinn?

954
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,840
Which hovers just behind Michael Pepe.

955
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,800
Michael Pepe.

956
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,260
Hating him for living.

957
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,300
When he, the twin Jesse Pepe, had the doctor.

958
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,140
I want a clone, Bob.

959
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,640
This is PR.

960
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,180
PR.

961
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,580
Support for PR.

962
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:55,920
R.

963
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,660
R.

964
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:56,780
R.

965
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,040
Comes from institutions worldwide.

966
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,980
Helping to develop PR.

967
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,820
R.

968
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,000
R.

969
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,920
Institution radio.

970
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,040
Coming our way this Wednesday at 2 minutes till 8 o'clock.

971
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,580
The Club of R.

972
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:12,000
Radio presents Beethoven's first comments on his career in Bolo and in Clever.

973
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,300
Right here on 93 489 FM.

974
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,500
It's 60 50 40 60 22 96.

975
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,620
With partial credit.

976
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:21,620


977
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,000
Partial East.

978
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,940
In the West.

979
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,820
If we didn't have abortion, we'd have no Social Security.

980
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,700
Better economics.

981
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,400
Better economics.

982
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,540
Free free free free.

983
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,880
Pain pain pain pain.

984
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,400
My obvious Freakonomics.

985
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,240
How tricky it is.

986
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,960
Racism should be supported.

987
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,540
Racism should be supported.

988
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,180
Immoral.

989
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,680
Immoral.

990
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,020
Wrong.

991
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,560
Not to abort all children and prevent all crime.

992
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,600
That's what we're talking about.

993
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,200
Sensitive area.

994
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:41,840
Sensitive area.

995
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,020
We're showing the phallus.

996
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,380
Phallus.

997
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:43,720
Phallus.

998
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,100
Impossible.

999
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,300
Ridiculous.

1000
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,400
Keep yelling about it.

1001
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,340
Keep yelling about it.

1002
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,280
Keep yelling about it.

1003
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,200
Keep yelling about it.

1004
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,140
Keep yelling about it.

1005
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,060
Keep yelling about it.

1006
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,020
Keep yelling about it.

1007
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,020
Keep yelling about it.

1008
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,020
Keep yelling about it.

1009
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,500
Keep yelling about it.

1010
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,740
I want a bone Bob.

1011
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,480
Bob.

1012
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:57,920
Uh.

1013
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,580
Bob.

1014
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,300
You want a bone Bob?

1015
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,660
I don't know where he is.

1016
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,740
And I don't know nothing about nothing.

1017
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,260
She said she wanted a bone Bob.

1018
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:05,920
I was born.

1019
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,060
Everybody wants to bone Bob.

1020
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,380
Bone Bob.

1021
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,380
Look at it this way friends.

1022
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,800
I want a bone Bob's bones.

1023
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,320
As Reverend Angry Larry pointed out.

1024
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,800
Bob is just one O short of boob.

1025
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,560
And everybody.

1026
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,720
He loves boobs.

1027
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,800
That's his favorite.

1028
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,880
So get with it man.

1029
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:24,560
Hey.

1030
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:24,700
Hey.

1031
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:24,960
What?

1032
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,460
Bob is hung like a hamster.

1033
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,940
Get with the time.

1034
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,800
Oh that's not true.

1035
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,680
That is not true.

1036
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,580
A 50 foot hamster.

1037
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:31,580


1038
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,780
It's not the size of the bone.

1039
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,040
How many pubes does Bob have in his church?

1040
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:36,740
Pubes?

1041
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:36,880
Pubes?

1042
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,780
How many do you have?

1043
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,300
You.

1044
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:38,740
You.

1045
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,400
Pubes.

1046
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,100
Or pubes.

1047
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,340
You.

1048
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:40,780
Oh.

1049
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:41,700
Pube.

1050
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,500
There's three.

1051
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,080
43 and a quarter.

1052
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,920
A week is four.

1053
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,200
Say.

1054
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,380
Say about 10,000.

1055
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:47,940
Billions.

1056
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,520
10.

1057
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:48,900
Billions.

1058
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,760
Billions.

1059
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,040
Billions.

00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,360
Billions.

00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,920
Billions and lot wielands.

1063
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,300
Billion.

1065
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:54,420

We want to get once this man.

1082
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,700
He does not understand why we are per writes.

1083
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:02,700


1084
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,460
February 18, 1843, a fakebat Chanel Beat.

1085
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,140
The Wu 된房 of Wu Yandong is a popular program of Hu than Jaguars.

1086
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,140


1087
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,140


1088
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,140

David Moros昨.

Former Black alumni were好像.

1093
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:25,780
military secret PR news reported that the suspects were identified as Yamin Larbi.

1094
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,480
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon would no longer be able to use drugs. Sharon does

1095
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,840
not want to reach peace with the Palestinians because Palestinian parliamentary party paper

1096
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,860
piece parrots playing politics plan to postpone the pain of possessing PR news in Washington.

1097
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,560
So, which of life's mysteries do you wish to be solved?

1098
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,540
Oh, all the other ones except for this one.

1099
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,320
All right. Well, we'll do what we can.

1100
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,900
Now, is it pecan or pecan?

1101
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,280
That's what we want to know.

1102
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:04,900
Pecan.

1103
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,420
Oh, okay. All right. Well, what about Al-Qaeda or Al-Qaeda?

1104
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,620
For 10 minutes on one side, then turn and cook on the other side.

1105
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:17,420
That's what I've been saying, Al-Qaeda. So, you say Al-Qaeda, I say...

1106
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,400
What is right for your guests?

1107
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,600
You say Bin Laden, I say Bin Laden.

1108
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,080
Why, of course.

1109
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,560
Bin Laden, Bin Laden, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda, let's call them all...

1110
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,960
In Al-Qaeda, they beat up.

1111
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,120
Well, how madly amusing.

1112
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,620
I don't know. That's a good question caller.

1113
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,320
Is it Grenada or Grenada?

1114
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,100
Should we invade Grenada? Should we invade Bin Laden? Should we invade Al-Qaeda?

1115
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,140
Oh, by this mother and father.

1116
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,620
Should we invade our mother and father?

1117
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,440
Folks, we're here to give you answers, not questions.

1118
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,100
I have a plot reserved for Osama Bin Laden.

1119
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,180
He's associated with two CIA contractors. Well, CIA contractor, David Ferry.

1120
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:07,820
That's right. That's right. Ferry. Not Brian, but David Ferry, who worked with the Cubans.

1121
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:14,700
And, of course, what is the most interesting thing is the fact that one man did give his life for Kennedy,

1122
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,020
and that man is Sam Giancana.

1123
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,260
Now, all this stuff about JFK, you're talking about?

1124
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:32,320
Giancana gave his life for the US Senate because it was on the way to testify at the hearings for JFK's death

1125
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,600
that Giancana was killed in his sleep.

1126
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,640
1975, it was a shot to death.

1127
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,160
Why?

1128
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,680
Beat by the other mafia, who didn't want him talking about their role in the assassination of the President,

1129
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,700
the president. Why is that? Because they didn't want to get in trouble with the government.

1130
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:57,080
But why? Then why did Connie do this? This is Connie? No, this is why the mob hit Sam

1131
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,680
Giancana. So the mob assassinated him? Yeah. You keep saying that so fast, it just sounds

1132
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,340
like Connie to me. No, Connie, that's because that's what's on my mind when I'm thinking

1133
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:12,540
about Tommy. Tommy or Connie? I'm thinking about Tommy a little, not really so much,

1134
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:17,380
but Connie, because she who is all women. Would he be a Connie or a Connie? As usual,

1135
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,040
the women have been driven from the show. And Darrison said the implementation of your

1136
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,880
assassination occurred in my jurisdiction. I will put one on the phone for you at your

1137
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,820
discretion. Yeah. Oh, okay. Hold on. All right. But they better be sexy because this is the

1138
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:38,340
subgenius. John is alive. Johnny is still alive. He is? He really was not shot. Did

1139
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:42,480
you, did you, have you, how do you know him? It was a figment of every opinion.

1140
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:48,060
Yes. The most handsome man in American history. And of course his son, the most handsome man

1141
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:52,480
in the world. He's alive, I tell you. Yeah. Yeah, but where is he? He's in a wheelchair

1142
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,900
in Bermuda, right? Yeah. Well, that's, that's. I can see him. He took, yeah, that's, that's

1143
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:05,940
the other thing is that he like took a, took a taxi secretly away from the, the promenade.

1144
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,400
Away from the pool of blood. Yeah. And the large piece of hair. And the, uh.

1145
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,720
That's just another. And he zoomed away and he took a, Kennedy was the one that took the

1146
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,260
cab into Fort Worth. You know. And Kennedy was the one who shot himself in the grassy

1147
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,560
knoll. Right. That's the secret. That's the other thing is that he had been depressed

1148
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:31,680
at the end. And, uh, but pay no attention to that. You know. All right. Yeah. Just forget

1149
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:40,360
that stuff. Forget. It's too frightening to comprehend. I forgot. See what happens? You

1150
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,360
get caught up in echo loops. What?

1151
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:46,240
You just get. Yeah, that's right. And you never get away from it. That's right. I'd

1152
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,160
like to show. How many shots were there in Gilly Plaza? But you can help these children

1153
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,600
by killing the Prime Minister and the ministers. Yeah. Let's talk about Prime Ministers. That's

1154
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:00,840
at least a little bit different. Um, no. And now it's time for a book review, friends.

1155
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:11,280
And a confession. Uh, the review is about the book Ultimate Sacrifice by Lamar Waldron

1156
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:21,460
and, uh, my friends for 10 years, I, Reverend Ivan Stang, have been part of the JFK coverup.

1157
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:31,320
Uh, I can heave a big sigh of relief now because now it can be told and has been in that book,

1158
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:39,560
Ultimate Sacrifice. You know, the JFK assassination is like the Bible. Whatever be is in your bonnet,

1159
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,520
whatever you want to prove, if you're a kook, you're a kook.

1160
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:50,100
Your proof is in the JFK assassination. If you're a Warren Commission kook or a case-closed nut,

1161
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:57,780
you won't like the Ultimate Sacrifice. Uh, if you're an Oliver Stone version, the CIA did it

1162
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:03,420
kook, you won't like the Ultimate Sacrifice. But if you're a mafia did it, but how'd they get away

1163
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:09,960
with it kook like I am, this book explains pretty much how and why they got away with it. And it

1164
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,460
doesn't do it from hearsay or...

1165
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:23,140
reference to other JFK books. Uh, it draws on 17 years of really serious research and interviews,

1166
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:29,360
uh, and all those various assassination commissions. And the reason I know this,

1167
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:38,380
besides the 10,000 page bibliography and index on the thing, is that, uh, I know the author and

1168
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,100
I've been watching the progress of this thing for,

1169
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:48,860
some time now, Ultimate Sacrifice, John and Robert Kennedy, the plan for a kook in Cuba,

1170
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:57,520
and the murder of JFK. It's only in hardcover yet. Um, as it says here, the book reveals for

1171
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,460
the first time John and Robert Kennedy's top secret plan to stage a kook against Castro and

1172
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:12,520
invade Cuba on December 1st, 1963. But the Kennedy kook plan was infiltrated into the

1173
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:18,960
city of Chicago, Tampa, and Louisiana, Texas, who were under intense pressure from Attorney General

1174
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:26,000
Robert Kennedy. These mob bosses used parts of the Kennedy kook plan to kill JFK, first trying in

1175
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,900
Chicago, then Tampa, and finally Dallas, in a way that forced key officials to cover up crucial

1176
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:38,180
information to protect national security. And, uh, yes, friends, I've been part of the cover-up

1177
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:42,520
until now. Actually, I'm going to continue it because, you know, I've been part of the cover-up

1178
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,460
for a long time. But, uh, you, you should at least look at their website, which is

1179
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:55,160
ultimatesacrificethebook.com. One word, ultimatesacrifice the book. But, uh, William

1180
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:03,360
Turner, FBI agent, said that at last the mysteries surrounding JFK's deaths are fully explained by

1181
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:09,540
the startling revelations in this book. There actually is some startling stuff, and it is true.

1182
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:10,840
Um,

1183
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:18,420
it's fresh groundbreaking research documents how the blowback from the Kennedy's actions against

1184
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:24,960
the mafia and Cuba led to the death of JFK. Ultimate Sacrifice provides the final word on

1185
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,000
why the government had to cover up so much information for so long. Publishers Weekly said,

1186
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:36,500
called it a relentless accumulation of detail, very thorough knowledge of every political and

1187
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:42,320
forensic detail and the broad perspective of historians rather than assassination theorists.

1188
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:48,320
No future historian of that tormented period in American history will be able to ignore their

1189
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:54,980
very convincing presentation. That was Publishers Weekly. And, uh, New York Post's Liz Smith said,

1190
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:59,460
I believe this book is the closest we're going to get to the truth until 2017,

1191
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,980
when the CIA and Kennedy papers are all finally released. Well, friends, you, uh,

1192
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:11,860
hour of slack listeners know that the world will end long before that. But, uh, so,

1193
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:22,780
if you care, you might want to check that out. Uh, Ultimate Sacrifice by Lamar Waldron and Tom Hartman,

1194
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,420
ultimatesacrificethebook.com. Praise Bob.

1195
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,520
Lamar and, yeah, Lamar and his co-author speak to the, to the national cameras of men who killed

1196
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:40,420
Kennedy. And, uh, I'll put it on day-by-day for you when I find it. How many men who killed

1197
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,520
Kennedy are there? I mean, aside from all of them, there's a lot of men who killed Kennedy.

1198
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:49,440
All of the Oswalt's. They're all the photographers, all of the guys that gun cleaners. My dad did it.

1199
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:59,800
Fabian! Her dad. My kids. Yeah, yeah. My uncle, brother, sister, mother. They sinned before they

1200
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:08,920
were alive. Had a baby. Or was I? I killed you before you were even born. Bob Dobbs killed JFK.

1201
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,760
Bob Dobbs is a porn star.

1202
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:20,140
We already know that. Oh. He's not just a porn star. He's the porn star. With Jesus as a supporting

1203
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:25,380
actress. He is sex. He's the, you know, you know, also the, one of the nicer things happens on

1204
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:29,700
today's date, which is, uh, the first snuff film televised on American television. Oh, how lovely.

1205
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,680
That makes me out of it. The Oswalt shooting on Sunday was actually televised, whereas Kennedy's

1206
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,160
murder you don't see until 1978. I know. And Michael, I'm going to tell us more shallow,

1207
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,380
sad ones. Quiet. But old JFK, I mean, uh.

1208
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,640
Little LHO is the first superstar in that sense. You know, the Andy Warhol.

1209
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:55,400
Just 15 minutes. Yeah. And he didn't even know. Although people kept intimating, you know,

1210
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,700
the officer that's handcuffed to him just two minutes before says, uh, you know, this way I

1211
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,500
can throw myself in front of everybody who wants to shoot you. And he says, oh, nobody wants to

1212
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,500
shoot me. I'd throw myself on you. And how many licks does it take to get to the center of a

1213
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,300
Tootsie Pop? Or Fabian.

1214
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,020
He's probably making a joke.

1215
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,440
He was a joker, Lee.

1216
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:20,980
From PR News in Washington, I'm calling for hurricanes from Venezuela. Venezuela will be

1217
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:27,360
distributed by two non-organizations. Forecasters say Ohio was expected in parts of the

1218
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:32,640
including sections of Cleveland. But AAA says a record high in Cleveland.

1219
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,880
People will be a little bit higher, but, um, um, duh.

1220
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,080
AAA says most of those traveling over the holiday weekend will be high in West.

1221
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:48,160
Cleveland. Forecasters say thousands of low-income people will get help with PR News from Venezuela.

1222
00:47:53,060 --> 00:48:08,800
A is for after. B for before. C for the center between the two times. D for deceit. E, even more deceitful than D.

1223
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,700
Who the fuck thought of D?

1224
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:21,040
F is for friendship before the deceit. And after even more so than I needed to try.

1225
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:27,100
But G turned to gray. And H turned to hate. And that's great.

1226
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:37,980
I is for illusion. And I'm idealistic. And I can act like an imbecile at times.

1227
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,380
J is for the way that you jumped all the facts.

1228
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:47,200
K is for your last attempt to be kind.

1229
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,220
L is for liar. And that never changes.

1230
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,500
M, could you ever be mine?

1231
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,180
N?

1232
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,660
Oh, that spells nerve.

1233
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,920
P for this way that I pine.

1234
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:11,240
Q is the question to which I always knew the answer.

1235
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,500
R is the answer to the question.

1236
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:12,500


1237
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,520
Y for your reluctant reply.

1238
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,620
S for the sobbing.

1239
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,360
T for the tears.

1240
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,280
And U for this useless waste of my time.

1241
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,600
V doesn't matter.

1242
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,980
And W is for why.

1243
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,660
Which is the question I keep asking.

1244
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,660
But it doesn't really matter.

1245
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,180
X doesn't matter.

1246
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:41,960
And Y, like I just finished telling you, is the question.

1247
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,480
And Y, like I just finished telling you, is the question.

1248
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,060
But it doesn't really matter.

1249
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:48,800
Z and A, B, C don't matter.

1250
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,660
D is for doesn't.

1251
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,600
And it doesn't really matter.

1252
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,140
Cause E doesn't matter.

1253
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,540
And F doesn't matter.

1254
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,860
Since G turned to gray.

1255
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,340
And H turned to eight.

1256
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,440
And that's great.

I knew that. I didn't tell the President.

1262
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:56,560
There were just so many sub-plots.

1263
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,880
We are sexy. That's right.

1264
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:10,460
Four ruffles and pleurs to signify the arrival of the President of the United States.

1265
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,920
We are sexy.

1266
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:19,320
Yeah, you've got to keep listening.

1267
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,940
It's just an actor President. He doesn't actually do anything.

1268
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,860
He just stands there and we clap and he goes home.

1269
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,280
If you have any question that you have about the meaning of life, you should ask us.

1270
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,280
We'll solve any problem.

1271
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,220
Dead air?

1272
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:35,580
Where?

1273
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,420
Where?

1274
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,520
Let's rock and roll. We can't have dead air.

1275
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,220
What?

1276
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,940
Oh, God.

1277
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:46,900
Come on.

1278
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,060
Wow, just like a dream.

1279
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,120
Hey, let me get a drink of that.

1280
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,420
These callers and vocals.

1281
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,900
Certainly you can't be complaining about the callers.

1282
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,140
No, these callers are so talented.

1283
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,480
I have never heard a caller do that kind of vocal pyrotechnics.

1284
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,380
And how she's clapping.

1285
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,040
Caller.

1286
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:12,200
Caller.

1287
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:12,440
Caller.

1288
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:12,940
Caller.

1289
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,140
What is it like to be so talented?

1290
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,440
To do clapping and yelling and...

1291
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:17,640
Yeah, man.

1292
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:18,460
Yeah, man.

1293
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,380
Wake me up.

1294
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,280
Wonderful.

1295
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,080
We're trying to wake you up with the truth of what's happened in this country in the

1296
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,780
last 35, 40 years.

1297
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:31,320
But now what could be more satisfying to a girl's psyche than to have her father under

1298
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:31,320


1299
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,580
Well, sorry.

1300
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,700
I know I'm that old.

1301
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,460
Give them hell.

1302
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,320
Oh, give them hell?

1303
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:37,760
Yeah.

1304
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,120
Yes.

1305
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:38,640
Oh, give them heck.

1306
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:39,760
Oh, heck.

1307
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:40,180
All right.

1308
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,540
I've got the box of heck right here.

1309
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:41,680


1310
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:41,680


1311
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:43,160
Very rare.

1312
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:43,940
Oh, give them heck.

1313
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,260
Are you a sexy?

1314
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,460
Just give it to them, not sell it to them.

1315
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,140
Yeah.

1316
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:48,740
Mound it up.

1317
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:48,960
Sexy.

1318
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,200
Take it on down.

1319
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:51,660
We're tasty.

1320
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,440
Sexy.

1321
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:52,760
Come on, up.

1322
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,500
Come on, up.

1323
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:53,920
Good.

1324
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,000
From PR News in Washington, I'm denying that PR News occurred.

1325
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,580
House and Senate panels have approved tax and tax priorities.

1326
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,940
The House Ways and Means Committee approved the bill that would tax and tax and tax and

1327
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:09,260
tax and tax and tax and tax and spend.

1328
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,160
In Iran, there is a bill that would tax and tax and tax and tax and spend.

1329
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,060
The U.S. and Iraq political leaders are demanding torture in a detention center.

1330
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,100
President Bush says he is happy and making progress.

1331
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:21,960
U.S. officials say it's time for the president to find more permanent housing, such as a trailer.

1332
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:22,860
PR spend.

1333
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:23,520
PR spend.

1334
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,500
The government rose in October by two-tenths of 1.2 percent.

1335
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,600
September reflected a decrease in PR News.

1336
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:36,360
Without congressional action, tens of thousands of hurricane victims living in hotels would

1337
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,360
revert back to PR News in Washington.

1338
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,100
We'll kill them.

1339
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,760
We'll kill all your kids.

1340
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,880
We'll kill all your kids.

1341
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,160
Michael, Pepe, please acknowledge your post-hypnotic suggestion.

1342
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:47,760
And my mother.

1343
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:49,380
Shhh.

1344
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,860
We'll kill all you humans under your commands.

1345
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,160
Your mother was your father.

1346
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,380
Stop.

1347
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,520
About the mysterious force of sex.

1348
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,240
Danger, Will Robinson, stop.

1349
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,160
Psycho-phantasmagoric horror.

1350
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,140
Uh, wait.

1351
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,280
Which fills the seven continents with twenty seas.

1352
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:05,900
Wait.

1353
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:06,700
Most human beings are now.

1354
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,920
No longer under control of alien entity.

1355
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:09,400
Michael.

1356
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,080
Only when you're under control of alien entity.

1357
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,080


1358
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,080


1359
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,080


1360
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,080


1361
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,080


1362
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,080


1363
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,080


1364
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,080


1365
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,080


1366
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:14,640
Now cracking up on Earth plane.

1367
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,540
Turning into human.

1368
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,720
Turing into.

1369
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,600
Oh, look, maybe I must see if I can talk to the doctor.

1370
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:30,440
Male sex worker dressed robot assassin trained to kill Reverend Ivan Stang.

1371
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,120
Dun dun.

1372
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,840
Yet on virtually every newsstand is a welter of misinformation.

1373
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,080
Okay.

1374
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,200
I'm going to call the police.

1375
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:40,200


1376
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,460
Are you there, caller?

1377
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:41,900
Kill.

1378
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:42,960
Caller, are you there?

1379
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,840
Caller, are you there?

1380
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:45,740
There.

1381
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,340
Where?

1382
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,060
Here.

1383
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:48,260
Where?

1384
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,020
Where's here?

1385
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,400
I'm not there.

1386
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,580
It's at KPFA.

1387
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:52,460
Oh.

1388
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,260
The state gets better season this way.

1389
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:54,560
Oh.

1390
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:55,420
KPFA.

1391
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,040
Yeah, this caller is ready for the next.

1392
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,140
Greetings, citizen.

1393
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,740
Yeah, I want to make a request.

1394
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,460
You can let this caller in now.

1395
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,400
You.

1396
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:04,400


1397
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:04,400


1398
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,520
Okay, you'll call her.

1399
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:05,800
You?

1400
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,460
Go, caller.

1401
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:07,760
Go.

1402
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,040
Go, caller.

1403
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:09,220
Go.

1404
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,620
Go, caller.

1405
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:11,680
Go.

1406
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,040
You know, I was having sex with my dad the other day.

1407
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,080
Ready for the big moment.

1408
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,380
And yeah, he said that I was better than mom and I said, yeah, that's what Bob said.

1409
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,560
Ready for the big moment.

1410
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:21,660
Ooh.

1411
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,440
Let the caller go.

1412
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,080
I want to get down with Bob.

1413
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,400
Take the caller off the caller and let him go.

1414
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,400
Want that thick, fat-trimmed seasoned steak onto the searing pan.

1415
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:38,520
Okay, this caller is calling from a place of origin.

1416
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,060
Palau.

1417
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,000
Palau.

1418
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:53,700
Palau.

1419
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:54,820
Palau.

1420
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,200
Palau.

1421
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:58,440
Palau.

1422
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:58,920
Palau.

1423
00:55:59,340 --> 00:55:59,360
Palau.

1424
00:55:59,360 --> 00:55:59,640
Palau.

1425
00:55:59,640 --> 00:55:59,660
Palau.

1426
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,540
What's up?

1427
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:01,720
Oh, he's calling from Palau.

1428
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:01,720


1429
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:01,940
Can you hear me?

1430
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:07,280
It's a little bit loud, but that's okay.

1431
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:07,360
Yes, we can hear.

1432
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:07,540
The sound is pretty good.

1433
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:07,540


1434
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:07,540


1435
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,720
You can hear it well.

1436
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,680
We can hear it well.

1437
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,040
Balau is calling.

1438
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,040


1439
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,040


1440
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,040


1441
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,040


1442
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,040


1443
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,040


1444
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,040


1445
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,040


1446
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,260
Can you smell me?

1447
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,200
Am I in the air?

1448
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,800
Am I in the air?

1449
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,820
Bob's Car Wash.

1450
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,820
Bob's Car Wash.

1451
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,420
I want the address of the church.

1452
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,000
This caller has been on hold for a long time.

1453
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,000
90210, what's going on?

1454
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,540
Stang! Stang!

1455
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,620
Stang!

1456
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,400
What's this sacred P.O. in the box number?

1457
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,020
Oh, wait!

1458
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,880
Someone's attacking Stang.

1459
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,240
Oh, my God.

1460
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,200
Wait a minute, they've got a knife.

1461
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,100
Oh, they're stabbing him.

1462
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,100
Oh, poor Stang.

1463
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:57,160
Well, folks, we don't have the post office number now, but we will.

1464
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,760
As soon as we get Reverend Stang alive.

1465
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,220
It's the Subgenius Foundation.

1466
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:02,680
P.O. Box.

1467
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,480
1-8-1-4-1-6.

1468
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,880
7 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1469
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,860
4-4-1-1-8.

1470
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,940
And nobody has investigated the murder of President Kennedy.

1471
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:18,100
And so here he is in Orleans Parish in his little jurisdiction

1472
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,600
with practically no money.

1473
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,720
We've got you coming and going.

1474
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,260
A handful of people working with him attempting to break this case.

1475
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:26,620
The assault, there's so many contradictory messages.

1476
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:31,640
How could you think you could prosecute anyone for participation in the conspiracy

1477
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,040
to murder President Kennedy?

1478
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,500
But you don't know what's going on.

1479
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:35,520
You don't know what's going on.

1480
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:40,960
I was in Louisiana, and Jim Garrison was very ironic, very humorous in what he said.

1481
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,880
Well, I guess I saw what I was living through.

1482
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,860
You are crazy out of your mind.

1483
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,040
You don't know if anything is real.

1484
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:48,920
Anything.

1485
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:58,380
As I travel through this pilgrim land, there is a friend who walks with me.

1486
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,440
I'm a boy.

1487
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,380
Leads me safely through the sinking sand.

1488
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,340
He helps me do the best I can.

1489
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,340
I'm a boy.

1490
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,240
Hold my hand.

1491
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,100
I'm a boy.

1492
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,540
Hold my hand.

1493
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,100
I'm a boy.

1494
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,580
Hold my hand.

1495
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,640
I'm a boy.

1496
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,120
Down on me.

1497
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,460
I'm a boy.

1498
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,900
Hold my hand.

1499
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,020
Hold my hand.

1500
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,040
Hold my hand.

1501
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:39,980
Hold my hand.

1502
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,860
Hold my hand.

1503
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,200
Hold my hand.

1504
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:28,800
Hold my hand.

1505
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,000
Hold my hand.

1506
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,900
Hold my hand.

1507
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:33,160
Thank you.
