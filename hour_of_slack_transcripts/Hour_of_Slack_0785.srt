1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Salak, and saint of saints on planet Earth.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:19,300
You have to love Bob. He loves you, but you love Bob. You have to.

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,080
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,740
He'll kill you. He'll Bob you out.

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:33,240
He'll Bob you out, folks. You heard it here first. If you don't love Bob, he'll Bob you out, man.

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:47,120
You are letting yourself go. A little more. And a little more.

7
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,040
Every nerve. Every tongue.

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,860
He has 92.9% air.

9
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,780
I'm dead.

10
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,500
I'm dead.

11
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,400
That's Texas.

12
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,420
See you, Tristel.

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:57,780
I'm dead.

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,280
I'm dead.

15
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,100
I'm dead.

16
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,240
So nice to be with you again.

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,660
Start a new week together?

18
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:52,500
Tomorrow, tomorrow, we'll start the day tomorrow with a song or two.

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,320
I'm not the only solo.

20
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,220
Choose not.

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,440
Hit.

22
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,860
Run, run, run, run.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,960
I must leave your planet now

24
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,600
and return to a world of cold and unemotional galaxy beings.

25
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,400
I will give them my report and I will be destroyed.

26
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,820
I have failed in my mission, not because I am weak,

27
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,740
but because you are stronger.

28
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,760
Kimi tobi, Kimi tobi.

29
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,440
We call this reality a national today charge the Argentine government

30
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,580
with frequent violations of human rights of the period.

31
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,920
Bone, code, nucleus, also by the house.

32
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,480
Blue.

33
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,360
Blood.

34
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,700
Turn into sign of host.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,100
Some brave and right to cheer.

36
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,680
All is your name, nature and joy.

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,400
You look up and I'll be gone.

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,100
Bit by bit I came for you, for you, I came for you,

39
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,260
but you did not heed my urgency.

40
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,740
Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today?

41
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,760
Make it a camp to be out in the cold.

42
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,240
Watching all the tag girls.

43
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,200
Oh.

44
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,640
They shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

45
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,340
Now, yeah, we got for you.

46
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,320
I'm cleaning, too.

47
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,600
We're cleaning our time.

48
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,600
We're cleaning.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,240
We're cleaning our time.

50
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,180
Oh, we?

51
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,640
We're the communication people.

52
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,340
People whose talk is strictly state of the art technology.

53
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,140
It's disposable, reversible, reusable with almost any leading round of our bill,

54
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,080
including our box line, yours.

55
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,160
Hey, booboo, I'll save you.

56
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,100
Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop.

57
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,300
Hey, you talk to me.

58
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh, oh.

59
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,280
Number nine.

60
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,380
All to see.

61
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,140
The twist.

62
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,960
A ride.

63
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,320
Can you draw me on him?

64
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,320
Can you draw me on him?

65
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,560
I remember a wild fetch.

66
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,340
A guy standing on the train station in the rain with his eyes kicked out.

67
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Go ahead and shoot him.

68
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,820
He'll be doing me a favor.

69
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,620
That old monsieur Mr. Dancy for pain.

70
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,320
My nose told me that I've come out of my hell the way you described it.

71
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,700
You said I'd be better dead than alive.

72
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,600
Dripping legs hanging from their backs.

73
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,080
Oh, boy.

74
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,080


75
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,720
Station identification.

76
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,940
Mr. President, look out!

77
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,800
KKD, San Francisco.

78
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,340
I scare myself when other bubbles run.

79
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,860
I cast away as they pour out of the atmosphere.

80
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,780
Seven-and-a-half minutes, station, to that end.

81
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,980
So come to London, England.

82
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,880
You are here to participate in an atomic bomb.

83
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,580
How your baby has gone down.

84
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,400
Oh, my God.

85
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,720
And it was radiation from heaven that whooshed down the city.

86
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,520
It was very devilish, this city.

87
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,820
It was God's fire.

88
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,740
And God said, grab all your stuff.

89
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,840
And they made all these deals.

90
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,040
And the evil just kept going up and up and up.

91
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,600
And God just turned around right then with a whoosh.

92
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,620
And he opened the sixth seal.

93
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,240
And behold, the sun became black as sackcloth.

94
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,440
The full moon became like blood.

95
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,880
And the sky vanished like a scroll that has rolled up.

96
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,840
And I saw an angel call to the birds of midheaven.

97
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,400
Come, gather for the great song.

98
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
Come, gather for the great song.

99
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,060
To eat the flesh of man.

100
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,720
Plasma palamita, avloquitas vala bodhisattva.

101
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,400
But the bodhisattva realizes that all five scoundrels are empty.

102
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,300
He is freed from the cycle of birth, death, and suffering.

103
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,960
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

104
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,080
They're all unsaved, you know, and unwashed.

105
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,480
The great unwashed are not so great.

106
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,540
Don't let those eyes roll back in the head of you.

107
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,960
And the unsaved are only great because we still haven't got their 30 bucks.

108
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,800
No frothing.

109
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,840
They're potentially great.

110
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,020
But the pink can never be great.

111
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,520
The pink is like a blind, deaf snake crawling on the floor of a pitch black cave.

112
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,080
But old speedunker Bob, my friends, he's got a flashlight.

113
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,500
And he's got a bucket and a long, sharp dick.

114
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:01,960
And soon enough, you will be searching for dobs on the scaly roof of your mouth, my friend.

115
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,400
It's not a scaly thing.

116
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:12,340
There's a man searching for dobs on the scaly roof face of another person's mouth.

117
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,100
Does anyone believe anything anymore?

118
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,840
No, they believe more in soaps.

119
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,980
Except the midriff.

120
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,460
Soaps thrown in anthracite are the now common mediums for getting the message across.

121
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,500
I only honor the current marketing.

122
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:24,820
Quirk.

123
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,400
What is the current marketing?

124
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,040
16-year-old midriff.

125
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,500
16-year-old midriff?

126
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,320
The halter top.

127
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,840
The teenage halter top.

128
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,300
Yeah, that's what's going on in all the test markets.

129
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:34,680
Oh, that's this year's model.

130
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,500
Yeah, it's fine with me.

131
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,960
Next, it'll be the back of the knee.

132
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,920
That's fine, too.

133
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,760
Yeah, but...

134
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,520
I'm telling you, from Columbus to Utah...

135
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,260
So you'll buy it as long as it's the buying part.

136
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,820
No, he sells it.

137
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,740
You download it from the internet.

138
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,580
Like the great faucet of pornography.

139
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,940
Spewing and spewing.

140
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,120
He does not buy.

141
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,460
No, as a cultural motivation.

142
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah, sure.

143
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,280
Well, my cultural icon would be perhaps to see...

144
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,800
I back him up.

145
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,400
To see, like...

146
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,840
Have you ever seen, like, a religious picture of the Virgin Mary?

147
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,580
Oh, it's hippie.

148
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,280
Maybe hit me one more time.

149
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,500
Showing her midriff.

150
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,420
I wonder what kind of psychic impact that would have on people.

151
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
You're hitting them with two things at one time.

152
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,100
Your fist and your soft-gloved foot.

153
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,500
You know what I mean?

154
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,220
Or the...

155
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,760
Yeah.

156
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,120
No, I know what you mean.

157
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,320
Yeah, yeah.

158
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,800
I know what you mean.

159
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,140
You know what I mean?

160
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,300
You're sneaking into the...

161
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,320
It's like being under the waterfall.

162
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:22,900
Yeah.

163
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,080
Only you're behind the waterfall.

164
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,240
Well, that's more...

165
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,020
You're not getting directly wet.

166
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,760
Yeah.

167
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,940
You're just sort of enjoying the spray coming from the...

168
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,380
Indirect wetness.

169
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:33,620
...flow.

170
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,400
Now, see, that should be the marketing ploy's...

171
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,460
...the strategy name.

172
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,080
Indirect wetness.

173
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,860
I think people could understand that easily.

174
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,980
Especially what it has to do with zygotes.

175
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,360
Killer sperms.

176
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,140
Perhaps that blue, blue mansion on the top of that green, green hill right there.

177
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,820
Where so many thousands...

178
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,020
...of folks like you have gone before...

179
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,000
...will walk through that door...

180
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,760
...taking a nocturnal omission through the backyards.

181
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,160
Maybe smoked a little pie in the oyster beds...

182
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,380
...or hung out by the farm...

183
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,240
...waiting for Dad to come back.

184
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,440
But no.

185
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,660
He's never coming back.

186
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,140
But the dead must come back.

187
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,420
Sooner or later, heaven can't last forever.

188
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,340
Soon the dads will walk the earth again.

189
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,840
I'm sorry, son.

190
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,140
The dead will never walk the earth again.

191
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,420
Unless, of course, someone...

192
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,720
...with a very sharp little brain like yours...

193
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,160
...can figure out the proper sequence of these syllables...

194
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,440
...to reanimate the flesh.

195
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,240
Repeat after me.

196
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,420
But it must be your inflection, not mine.

197
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,560
It must be your inflection, not mine.

198
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,100
Not that.

199
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,440
No, no, no, no, no.

200
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,600
The secret words.

201
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,880
Now hold your hand over the top of your head...

202
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,580
...so as not to let any emissions...

203
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,200
...come out of the top.

204
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,540
Yeah.

205
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,360
Yeah, I'll say it's a...

206
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,340
...rock and roll, baby.

207
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,320
...was the part of the scene.

208
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,000
Going to the rhythm now, I guess.

209
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,320
Oh, he was about to give the secret words...

210
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,120
...and Chaz is sitting here looking at internet pornography.

211
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,060
Just come...

212
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,960
Chaz, you've got a computer at home.

213
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,600
You could do this.

214
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,460
I'm singing rock and roll.

215
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,660
You can make...

216
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,680
Oh, you can't listen to rock and roll...

217
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,040
...and look at internet pornography at the same time.

218
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,040
Rock and roll.

219
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:23,820
Rock and roll.

220
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,880
Oh, look what he's doing.

221
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,040
Look what came out of his ear.

222
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,780
His hairy, hairy ear.

223
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,840
Gross.

224
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,280
The Bonobo sect will now come to order.

225
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,380
Oh, oh, most of all...

226
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,220
Most of all, you're not supposed to get up on the console...

227
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,980
...and do the same thing to the monitor.

228
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,440
Now I got this.

229
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,000
Bonobo, bonobo, bonobo, bonobo, bonobo, bonobo, bonobo.

230
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,740
She's saying it over and over again.

231
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,120
Bonobo, bonobo, bonobo.

232
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,820
Save your phone cup for the revival...

233
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
...at the Euclid Tavern on May 12th.

234
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,360
Oh, my breath.

235
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,160
Save up that spunk!

236
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,260
Not that I practice what I...

237
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,180
You're a spunky punk.

238
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,720
All good listening mums and...

239
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,020
You know our...

240
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,240
...out there in listening land...

241
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,460
...should be aware of the sexual dangers...

242
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,460
...of copulating with the noble monkey.

243
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,500
Hey, speaking of sexual...

244
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,940
Stick to your own species.

245
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,160
Stay with your own species.

246
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,460
Now, it's a good way of procreating the right species.

247
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,100
That's all about really doing it with mums in America.

248
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,720
Oh, better.

249
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,860
It's a metaphor, man.

250
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,860
Yeah, man.

251
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,320
You're a monkey.

252
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,160
It's a metaphor, my man.

253
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,700
Ah, yes.

254
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,100
The bishop carries some music along with us in the background.

255
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,000
And welcome to Hour of Slack number 785.

256
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,760
Ah, yes.

257
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,420
We listened to a little bit of recent ESO radio on WCSB Cleveland live there.

258
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,840
Thanks to Chaz Smith.

259
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,660
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

260
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,460
Getting ready for the Euclid Tavern revival,

261
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,660
which will probably be going on about the time that you hear this.

262
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,020
The rest of the show, a lot of it is from Hour of Slack number 106,

263
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,920
back around like 1987.

264
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,360
And, in fact, this rant I'm about to play is even older than that, I think.

265
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,100
And somebody else saved this off the internet.

266
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,000
It's a...

267
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,160
Oh, what the hell.

268
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,700
Here it is.

269
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,300
Ah, yes, friends.

270
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,940
I'm all hooked up.

271
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,820
And ready to answer your questions.

272
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:31,560
Now, we've been getting letters and phone calls from noble subgeniuses out there asking,

273
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,860
Reverend Stang, how can I be more subversive?

274
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:44,420
How can I be of more service to Bob in bringing down the conspiracy that enslaves us?

275
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:50,420
And, friends, I'm afraid that that is entirely up to you.

276
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,600
Now, the conspiracy will tell you.

277
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,180
How to be more subversive against it.

278
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,400
So we sure won't.

279
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,760
But I can give you one helpful hint, friends.

280
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,100
There's nothing wrong with looking normal.

281
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,540
If you want to be more subversive, friends, you don't have to show off about it.

282
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,700
If you were a uniform, like a high-fashioned punk haircut,

283
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,700
or leather and spandex and whatever,

284
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,800
unless it's really extreme, friends,

285
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,680
you're just playing along with the conspiracy,

286
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,880
joining a conformity of nonconformists.

287
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,800
You're labeling yourself as someone who the conspiracy doesn't really need to worry about.

288
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,620
Because you're going to follow a predictable pattern.

289
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,900
One that they've co-opted already.

290
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,280
But what kind of subversion are we talking about anyway, friends?

291
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,820
Friends?

292
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,720
Being down the state?

293
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,060
Blowing up polluters?

294
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,800
Nay, nay.

295
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,120
That only kills people, friends, and gets you in jail to boot.

296
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,200
It's stupid.

297
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,760
But not stupid in the right way.

298
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,800
Bob said,

299
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,660
Bob said,

300
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,880
Thou shalt kill none but me.

301
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,860
Unless they're literally about to kill you or if they insult your ancestors.

302
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,320
That's what Bob said.

303
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,440
And, you know,

304
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:23,820
there's no such thing as a subversion.

305
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,760
There's nothing wrong with technology, friends.

306
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,660
We don't need to subvert technology.

307
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,060
After all, only technology is the only thing we've got to clean up the mess we already made.

308
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,920
So, who are we trying to subvert?

309
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,320
The Republicans?

310
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,480
Oh, friends, an awful lot of subgeniuses are Republicans.

311
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:51,320
But, you know, subgenius doesn't mean left-wing pinko or right-wing anything.

312
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,980
It's not a thing.

313
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:53,560
It's not a thing.

314
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,500
It's the spy who's going to send an invitation to the United States.

315
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,920
It's the good guy that's going to send a message to the United States.

316
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,720
It doesn't matter what party is in control.

317
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,860
As long as none of the parties really have that much control over how much you party.

318
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,940
Besides, what you're fighting ain't just a political system.

319
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,880
I mean, as political systems go, the U.S. is one of the least evil.

320
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:31,820
And just as Jesus is okay, it's just that some members of his fan club make him look bad.

321
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,960
Same goes with Bob and the Bobbies.

322
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:41,720
Surely some of you have met nerds on the street who started trying to talk Bob at you and you were just embarrassed.

323
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,520
Well, friends, see, the conspiracy is a great combination of things.

324
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
Work is one of the main ones.

325
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,540
That's how you're really controlled, friends.

326
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,220
You have to work for someone else to make a living.

327
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,160
Now, the subgenius actually likes to work at what he likes to work at.

328
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,820
But that's the rub and the bub, my friend.

329
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,000
The conspiracy is also ancient customs and new invented customs.

330
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,200
It's a whole background attitude.

331
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,320
The conspiracy is an attitude.

332
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,540
An attitude of hatred.

333
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,940
For anything weird.

334
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,500
So what you want to subvert, friend, is that attitude.

335
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,960
Now, some strange things are bad.

336
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,760
But all great inventions and ideas started out as strange ones.

337
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:40,540
So if you want to subvert the government or some manufacturer or blow buildings up,

338
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,560
that's just what the conspiracy wants you to do, my friend, so they can catch you.

339
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,040
Make you look like a kook in front of millions.

340
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,680
Now, history proves that every time...

341
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,000
you overthrow something overnight,

342
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,240
ditch some old government,

343
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,660
what replaces it always ends up just as bad.

344
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,420
We have to break that cycle, friends.

345
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,560
And this isn't anarchy we're talking about.

346
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,260
Anarchy is just another political system.

347
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,520
Just like atheism is just another religion.

348
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:17,160
To truly subvert, my friend, you work alone at your own pace, casually, but with alertness.

349
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,680
To subvert the attitude of hatred.

350
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:20,680


351
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:20,680


352
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:20,680


353
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:20,680


354
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:32,640
To use my own super cool, scuttly self as an example.

355
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,820
Oh, darn person, I don't really...

356
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,540
Normals who can't possibly appreciate it anyway.

357
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,400
That just makes them hate weirdness more.

358
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,720
I don't really appear...

359
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,480
You should like a mad prophet.

360
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,160
...abnormality, my friend.

361
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,500
You have to break them in a little at a time.

362
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,160
It depends.

363
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,780
And you can't indiscriminately...

364
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,180
hate all normals,

365
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,960
because that only proves that you are a normal yourself,

366
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,320
because you don't understand yet...

367
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,760
To use my own...

368
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,840
...what you call normals are actually weirder than you are.

369
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,160
Use my own super cool, scuttly self as an example.

370
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:15,040
Now, in person, I don't really appear like a mad prophet of the airwaves.

371
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,780
I very deliberately look like an innocent computer.

372
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,320
I'm not a whiz or something.

373
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,780
If a policeman stops me for speeding, I look like a regular citizen.

374
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,620
And part of me is.

375
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:36,200
And so he doesn't look in the trunk to see if I'm carrying 5,000 copies of subgenius pamphlets

376
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,280
to hand out to grade school kids, which I am.

377
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,100
Get away with murder this way, friend.

378
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,080
And that time the Secret Service came to my house.

379
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,820
They took one look and said,

380
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,740
Oh, he's just a poor humorist.

381
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,840
He isn't building bombs.

382
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,020
Not physical bombs.

383
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,020
Nay, my friends.

384
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:06,260
But me and perhaps many of you are from that 1970s post-hippie nihilistic generation, more or less.

385
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,260
And aside from not working for a living,

386
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,540
I and perhaps you are still that same devious hippie.

387
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,340
Not a commie, nay.

388
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,240
Not a pinko.

389
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,620
But a soldier for slack.

390
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,680
A warrior against the conspiracy of the normals.

391
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,800
And so you truly suffer to smite them.

392
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,420
But not physically.

393
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,220
Smite them psychologically.

394
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,340
With your jokes.

395
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,740
Your cryptic statements.

396
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,720
Your band.

397
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,880
Your paintings.

398
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,920
Your weird car.

399
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,700
Your whole attitude.

400
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,180
Not just your haircut and clothes.

401
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,120
My God.

402
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,400
The normals.

403
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,200
They can wear weird haircuts and clothes.

404
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,880
And they do it all the time.

405
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,640
If they are normals, my friend,

406
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,920
they'll recoil in fear and jealousy

407
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,100
to see a free man or woman.

408
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,280
But for latent subgeni who are ripe to be saved,

409
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,460
you are setting a good example

410
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,480
to be weird in your own way.

411
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,480
Achieve slack in your own life.

412
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,940
My friend and those who are worthy

413
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,520
will turn toward it as towards a beacon

414
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,140
as a moth dives headlong into the flames.

415
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,820
They're not trying to steal your slack

416
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,900
or to imitate you,

417
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,720
but merely to see what is possible.

418
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,040
Then and only then will they learn

419
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,560
to pull the wool over their own eyes.

420
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,760
So you don't have to talk about Bob, friends.

421
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,480
They have to just stumble upon Bob

422
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,160
in their own sweet time.

423
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,560
And I'm not saying,

424
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,720
be yourself.

425
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,100
Quote, unquote.

426
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,280
There are too many yourselves.

427
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,040
You might end up being your own

428
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,940
conspiracy normal lynch mob self.

429
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,900
You must try to try not to

430
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,180
achieve the development of your Bob self.

431
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,620
That in you, which is Bob-like.

432
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,240
And there is no rule book for this, my friend,

433
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,560
except the one.

434
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,420
The one you make

435
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,900
and the one that you buy

436
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,640
from Bob.

437
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,960
Praise Bob!

438
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,920
Help me, somebody!

439
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,740
Pull the lever!

440
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,580
Down you go!

441
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,960
Help!

442
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,800
I gotta keep sweeping, sweeping

443
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,300
Before the bill, the bill, the bill, the bill

444
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,940
I see

445
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,540
The thing I got to keep on, keep on

446
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,580
I gotta keep up sweeping

447
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:50,900
Sweeping and sweeping

448
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,480
Get off my feet

449
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,220
I gotta keep sleeping, sleeping

450
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,280
You see like I see Bob

451
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,200
Seem like I see Bob

452
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,000
It's still, still said

453
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,560
Would you clean

454
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,760
It is still

455
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:03,980
emerged

456
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,580
Go ahead and clean

457
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,300
and clean

458
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,480
because you're learning

459
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:07,940
about him

460
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,600
Is a good $2 room

461
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,400
Hun Adjusttı

462
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,260
Why I think

463
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,900
he's a good $2 room

464
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,600
Why do you think

465
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,120
you're learnin'

466
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,640
is a good $2 room

467
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,520
is a good $2 room

468
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,220
aboron

469
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:47,300
Oh, it's pretty, friends.

470
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,460
But how long would I make you listen to it?

471
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:59,620
That weird Captain Beefheart mix that just ran through there was from some folks in Canada, Toronto, called Mystery Tapes.

472
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,920
John Oswald.

473
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:47,140
Oh, my God.

474
00:23:47,300 --> 00:24:03,560
Oh, my God.

475
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,720
I was trying to get it back, but it's turning pretty black.

476
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,560
State dip on the coals.

477
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:25,860
Yeah.

478
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,680
Wiener on the foil.

479
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,080
The skin begins to boil.

480
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,680
I dropped it in the soil.

481
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,200
I thought that it was spoiled.

482
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:58,120
So I washed it with a hose and fed it to Aunt Rose.

483
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,340
Wiener on the foil.

484
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,660
Burgers on the grill.

485
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,100
Burgers on the grill.

486
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,780
Burgers on the grill.

487
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,580
By Bob Rivers.

488
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,920
Thanks to Why Ask Why.

489
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,800
Ask Why.

490
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,960
Posted to alt.binaries.slack.

491
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,080
Oh, and the Beefheart cut up there was by John Oswald of Plunder Phonics.

492
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,780
My frosty brown lips and my bright blue culo have often done the man-volda.

493
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,080
Listen to the beginning of this, Dave.

494
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,500
Listen real careful to the beginning.

495
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,120
La entrada.

496
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,500
Listen when the guitar comes in.

497
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,300
La entrada.

498
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,340
Right on it, baby.

499
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,600
Okay.

500
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,980
Okay.

501
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,140
That's the way we don't want you to do it at the Euclid Tavern.

502
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:16,940
I would not.

503
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,080
I would not remind you.

504
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,380
Well, you don't have to worry about that.

505
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,700
It's Saturday week.

506
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,460
When is it?

507
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,480
Saturday week.

508
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,900
May 12th.

509
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,680
May 12th.

510
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,160
Yeah.

511
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,700
I got to go to Madison, Wisconsin this weekend.

512
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,520
Really?

513
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,200
We're playing the University of Wisconsin.

514
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,880
That's a wonderful place to go and hang out with.

515
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,400
Your team is playing the Madison team?

516
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,580
That's an all-woman team, isn't it?

517
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,000
Actually.

518
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,560
Not all women.

519
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,800
The Cobra Verde is against the Madison Badgers.

520
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,780
The Madison Monkey Girls.

521
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,560
The Vicious Monkey Girls.

522
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,580
The Wisconsin Badgers.

523
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:46,800
Actually.

524
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,860
I stayed in Madison.

525
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,400
We're playing the Vast Seamans next week.

526
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,600
Well, we're heard in Madison on WORT.

527
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,700
That wonderful station.

528
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,640
Home of the wars.

529
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,700
I stayed at the Monkey House when I was in Madison.

530
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,660
Me and Jesus and Legan.

531
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,420
And you were forever changed because of the experiments.

532
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:05,980
Oh, man.

533
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,000
Here's that chorus part.

534
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,200
Those cows know how to experiment.

535
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,060
Listen, if you do this one, why don't you listen?

536
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,540
Okay, but listen.

537
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,160
Listen to this.

538
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,340
Listen to this.

539
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:18,520
Right here.

540
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,580
Right here.

541
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,020
Right on it.

542
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,520
Right on it.

543
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,680
Chaz is reminding me of everything you reminded me of practice the other day.

544
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,320
And it'd be really good if you could look like Clint Eastwood when you did that.

545
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,120
Well, I'm going to have to wear all this.

546
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:37,360
Yeah, of course.

547
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,720
You're going to need a hat down low.

548
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:38,860
With a gun.

549
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,960
I'm going to need all this.

550
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,780
Yeah, you need a gun on.

551
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,380
You need a little.

552
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,000
Can you grow a couple days growth for that show?

553
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:44,440
Oh, yeah.

554
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:44,980
That's no problem.

555
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,520
I grow a couple days growth in 45 minutes.

556
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,040
Yeah.

557
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,280
I don't know if you guys notice that.

558
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,100
Usually when I come up gray, just shave.

559
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,340
Can you grow it for like three days and then die?

560
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,280
You were down on speed at the end of the show.

561
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,340
It's more like one of those floor on purple things.

562
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,960
Like, remember the old days of the trobs?

563
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,760
You know, girls would put on their dashboards and stuff, and you'd know it was okay to try

564
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,000
and jump them at the wrong time?

565
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,480
Yeah.

566
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,640
Yeah, that was when no didn't mean no.

567
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,600
When it meant no.

568
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,820
Do you know fighting, please?

569
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,900
Yeah, it's not bleepo.

570
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,180
The only reason I'm answering is because I said he might call.

571
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,300
Bleepo, I don't think you made it into town this week.

572
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,060
No, no, but he said he might call anyway.

573
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,300
All right.

574
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,220
All right.

575
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:17,820
Okay, here it is again.

576
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,780
Oh, oh.

577
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,440
Oh, oh.

578
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,340
With the fuzz box.

579
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,340
We're playing this.

580
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,980
If you want to come and see this song live, come to the Euclid Tavern if you want to see

581
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,120
this.

582
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,740
May 12th, Saturday night.

583
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,120
Bend sympathy for the devil, right?

584
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,320
Yeah, we haven't even worked.

585
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,060
We haven't done that yet.

586
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,540
And Saint Anne will be there himself.

587
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,420
Well, Dave's going to sing sympathy.

588
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,620
Who is Saint Anne?

589
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,160
Saint Anne.

590
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,080
Wait, you missed it.

591
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,540
You missed it.

592
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:54,780
What?

593
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,620
This is important.

594
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,180
Dave is going to sing sympathy.

595
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,140
If I can remember the words, I'll sing it.

596
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,400
I'll sing it.

597
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,640
I was working on a takeoff called Sympathy for the Salesman.

598
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,180
Well, we were working on a takeoff called You Can't.

599
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,100
What was it, Dave?

600
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,000
You Can't Always Get Sympathy for the Devil.

601
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,960
You Can't Always Get Sympathy for the Devil, right.

602
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,080
You Can't Always Get Sympathy for the Devil.

603
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,460
You're good.

604
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,920
I'm going to do kind of a battery below great, you know,

605
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,940
ethotic storm.

606
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:21,860
Yeah.

607
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,200
Chaz, you did a wonderful Devo-like Sympathy for the Devil

608
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,140
at Winterstar, just sort of practicing and warming up.

609
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,080
I don't even remember.

610
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,400
Oh, it's on tape number one.

611
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:34,800
Oh.

612
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,380
Which is the first number.

613
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,200
Yeah.

614
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,600
Oh, you think so?

615
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,380
Oh.

616
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,100
I thought you were spatially disoriented right now.

617
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,220
I mean, I see that puddle down by your shoes.

618
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,600
I noticed that you did evacuate there.

619
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,780
I do that every time.

620
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:56,500
Well, I'm getting a little tired of it, but outside of the fact, it's kind of a fluorescent color.

621
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,240
I don't really know.

622
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,520
I'm not going to.

623
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,580
You were asking who Saint Anne is?

624
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:05,940
Well, no, I was asking why you urinated so suddenly and so spasmodically throughout the whole studio.

625
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,760
Well, I mean, that's a simple question.

626
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,200
Hey, that's old news, dude.

627
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:11,980
What?

628
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,620
Well, why?

629
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,680
But no one in Cleveland.

630
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,700
And nor I have ever seen Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket.

631
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,060
So they're playing to not real people?

632
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,880
Yeah, they do kind of like computer techno subgenius music.

633
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,200
Let's see what else they're going to play.

634
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,540
Well, then we don't have to really look at them, do we?

635
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:31,980
Evil buy.

636
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,040
You know, since no one's seen them.

637
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,240
Oh, Helena.

638
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,540
Right.

639
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,100
You don't have to, but you will.

640
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,880
So you're saying Helena Handbasket is a treat for the eyeballs?

641
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,940
You will be.

642
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,260
Welcome to the future.

643
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,520
People of Earth, listen and obey.

644
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,020
People of Earth, listen and obey.

645
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,500
You must not be afraid.

646
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,480
You must not dosen't.

647
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,180
You must not do ends when you complete.

648
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,040
You must not talk against your enemies.

649
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,260
Look right into my eyes.

650
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,020
You must not be afraid.

651
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,060


652
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,880
You know I've got my switch.

653
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:39,180
A place within us

654
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,940
I am your new master.

655
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,400
The어� boat Berti chi имеет you, col.

656
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,700
They will worship me as their god.

657
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,480
A startling new world is upon you.

658
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,920
An army of atomic robots.

659
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,540
Welcome to the future.

660
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,560
A vivere la dolce vita.

661
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,920
Blitzkrieg 3D.

662
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,320
I will have my revenge.

663
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,700
Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge.

664
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,920
Yes, dear friends.

665
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,840
Saint N and Helena Handbasket from their CD Slogans Run.

666
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,360
I'm about to give you information on how you can procure such a CD.

667
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,920
In fact, it's a website that you should look at just in general.

668
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,440
It's a great subgenius website for a great subgenius clench.

669
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,140
Reverend Armand Geddon and Barbie Geddon's Mini True.

670
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,840
And they're at www.minitrue.org.

671
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,820
But mini true is spelled without an E.

672
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:36,340
That's www.minitrue.org.

673
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,840
P-R-U dot org.

674
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Friends, for more about Mini Ministry of Truth and the CD Slogans Run by Saint N and Helena Handbasket.

675
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,400
Ba-bs are coming!

676
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,920
Ba-bs are coming!

677
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,140
Ba-bs are coming!

678
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,500
Now that's Тaint!

679
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,300
Au-oh-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!

680
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,600
Au-oh-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!

681
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:32,500
Au-oh-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!

682
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:32,500


683
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,080
Au-oh-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!

684
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,940
Ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-run...

685
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:34,940


686
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:55,620
The road signs flashed by at a particularly high speed.

687
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,060
Slippery when wet.

688
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,340
Low shoulder.

689
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:03,500
Low shoulder.

690
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,860
Speed limit 45.

691
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,540
You are now entering God's kingdom.

692
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,000
Ray had to stop at that one.

693
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:32,360
The rental car bounced and shuddered roughly over the low shoulder to a crooked stop right in front of the sign.

694
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,860
That's exactly what it said.

695
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,480
You are now entering God's kingdom.

696
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,260
Ray got out of the car and looked around.

697
00:36:53,440 --> 00:37:02,320
The scenery looked desperately similar to the last 50 miles of country's two-lane highway

698
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,320
that he had been driving on.

699
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,760
The road signs were very similar to the one he had been traveling on.

700
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:12,240
And was most likely going to look very much like the next 50.

701
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,080
God then looked out from behind the cloud and frowned at him.

702
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,520
Ray looked up and noticed this.

703
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,640
Being a typical Catholic,

704
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,300
this was the very last thing that he had to do.

705
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:33,300


706
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,260
This was the first sign that he had ever expected to see.

707
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,740
He looked up and gazed.

708
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,700
Don't make fun of the sign.

709
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,980
I happen to like it.

710
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,200
God said in a deep, loud voice,

711
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,680
echoing across the countryside,

712
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,920
and then returned.

713
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,980
To whatever he had been doing before.

714
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,500
Behind the cloud.

715
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,620
Ray got back into his car

716
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,840
and drove off

717
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,200
very slowly.

718
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,420
Very slowly.

719
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,660

Please don't repeat this message.

724
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,780

728

I break for God by the button from their new CD,

729
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,900
10 Family Minutes. You can get information on that.

730
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,780
You can get information about the button

731
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:08,200
from www.pressthebutton.com.

732
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,280
Do you know what that is?

733
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,400
If you smoke a pack of cigarettes a day,

734
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,640
if you took all the nicotine that you ingest

735
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,920
and injected it into your vein,

736
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,220
you would die.

737
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,060
Man, I would have died five times a day.

738
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:23,720
Exactly.

739
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,940
And if you took it as an enema,

740
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,660
you would trip.

741
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,140
Wow.

742
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,760
What would you rather do?

743
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,600
What would you rather do?

744
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,300
You would have my friend.

745
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,400
What would you rather do?

746
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,640
What would you rather do?

747
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,960
You would have to like, you know, distill it.

748
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,600
Take it into a venison and die or put it in your butt

749
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,640
and you're on that trip.

750
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,520
You know, like an Aztec chocolate drink sort of thing, you know?

751
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,440
An Aztec trip?

752
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,480
Kind of a chocolate.

753
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,140
What, is she like the Jaguar?

754
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:46,640
Yeah, hello.

755
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,620
Yeah, hello.

756
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,240
Hello.

757
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:49,880
Yeah, hello.

758
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,700
Yeah, hello.

759
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,480
Hello.

760
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,680
Praise God.

761
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:53,860
Praise God.

762
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,140
Hello.

763
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:54,760
Hello.

764
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,460
How are you?

765
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,340
How are you?

766
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,660
How are you?

767
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,020
How are you?

768
00:39:59,180 --> 00:39:59,580
How are you?

769
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,380
Well, you never know about these California tapes.

770
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,560
Friends, I'm just slinging tape after tape here.

771
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,600
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

772
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,020
What the 70 years church promised me.

773
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,440
That's about what I said.

774
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,000
You know, the key word in this group is activism.

775
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,580
It's really a care of plumbing together like

776
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,940
and be out of a bad .

777
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,940
We want to know .

778
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,700
You're a .

779
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,580
You're a robot.

780
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,140
Not me!

781
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,900
Not me!

782
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,480
I didn't bring you cotton, too!

783
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,160
Not me! Not me!

784
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,400
Not me!

785
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,220
Somebody look like me.

786
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,080
I'm a Bible twin!

787
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,800
Bible twin!

788
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,040
They look a lot like me, but it's not me!

789
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,760
I didn't do it!

790
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,500
Bible twin!

791
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,960
I didn't bring your refrigerator!

792
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,660
Bible twin!

793
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,060
Not me!

794
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,240
Not me!

795
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,280
Not me!

796
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,720
Somebody look like me.

797
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,080
Like me!

798
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:34,740
I was taking some cans back to the store.

799
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,720
I was buying a milkshake.

800
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,040
Not me!

801
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,300
I was blocking frogs.

802
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,340
Not me!

803
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,220
Not me!

804
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,000
Not me!

805
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,560
Not me!

806
00:41:59,580 --> 00:41:59,700
Not me!

807
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,460
Not me!

808
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,160
Not me!

809
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,760
Not me!

810
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,140
Not me!

811
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,560
That was not me!

812
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,380
It was Bible twin!!

813
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,980
Am I evil twin?

814
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,400
Am I evil twin?

815
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,460
There by happy flowers.

816
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:28,420
There by happy flowers.

817
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:57,940
There by happy flowers.

818
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:28,420
There by happy flowers.

819
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,040
There by happy flowers.

820
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,980
No, I've never done that.

821
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,980
There by happy flowers.

822
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,640
There by happy flowers.

823
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,980
There by happy flowers.

824
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:38,200


825
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,520
You pull out the styrofoam container.

826
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,160
At just the right time or something?

827
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,160
Yeah, really fast.

828
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,080
Like, you know, the tablecloth trick.

829
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:46,620
Uh-huh.

830
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,040
Right.

831
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,120
And then that leaves the meatballs in place.

832
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,960
And your body gets amazing nourishment from that.

833
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,440
You kind of start working from the bottom.

834
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:08,600
up kind of right you know yeah well I don't know I think burp why would you

837
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:22,500
meatball sub animal no I'm not saying that the meatball sub animal would hurt

838
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:28,960
you per se it's I think it's the idea that comes after you've taken the meatball

839
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,020
sub animal I'm sorry I can't elaborate on it anymore it's already growing

840
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:42,660
growing inside no no need to get solid growing inside there are a lot of other

841
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:46,880
things you could do to get spiritual awareness anything we're kind of in a

842
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,420

baseball in the summer football in the fall hockey in the winter but I play none at all

846
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,000

847
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,220
and I count back

848
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:25,360

00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,580

that's you this is unlucky

858
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,320
Mmm

859
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,620
that should be easy

860
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,540
let's look at the video

861
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:55,540


862
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,800
there's a lot other

863
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:58,800


864
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:06,700
very cringy

865
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:10,460
or this radio show will be transmitted

866
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,880
through a magical intergalactic time warp

867
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,920
into Hamburg,

868
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,640
where they're actually going to play this show

869
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,660
somewhere in the next couple of days,

870
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,500
or actually a couple of days ago.

871
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,640
Well, here's Dave to explain about this.

872
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,180
See, Germany is a very, very, very slack country.

873
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:34,560
I think the Germans invented slack, actually,

874
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,300
and the conspiracy sent Hitler to take it away from them.

875
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,680
The German, Germany was full of slack

876
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,020
before Hitler got there.

877
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,420
Those people, they did not even, they weren't,

878
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:48,920
and if they...

879
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,900
Actually, J.R. Bob Dobbs actually fought

880
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,220
in the Second World War on the American side, of course,

881
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,100
thus fathering lots and lots of children.

882
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,820
As I heard Stang say the other day,

883
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,040
lots and lots of children here in Europe.

884
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,680
That doesn't mean there's any lawsuits.

885
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,320
There's no point in...

886
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,720
There's no point in pursuing any of those class action lawsuits

887
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,000
against, paternity suits against Dobbs from the war.

888
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,880
I mean, that was a long time ago.

889
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,700
Those kids are grown up now.

890
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,220
They're world leaders and great hobos.

891
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,680
Well, you know, before the war, before...

892
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,660
That's the most meaningless, wonderful rubbish I've ever heard.

893
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,180
What?

894
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,740
That's why I'm here.

895
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,040
That's exactly what I wanted.

896
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,160
You heard it here a lot.

897
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,240
I heard it here first.

898
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:45,740
I heard it here first.

899
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:03,520
I heard it here first.

900
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:03,520


901
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,040
Is anyone there?

902
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,180
Come on, bike truckers, and talk to Teddy Bear.

903
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,100
Well, I keyed the mic, and I said,

904
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,120
you got it, Teddy Bear.

905
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,440
And the little boy's voice came back on the air.

906
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,180
Appreciate the break.

907
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,860
Who we got on that end?

908
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,280
I told him my handle, and then he began.

909
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,360
Now, I'm not supposed to bother you fellas out there.

910
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,740
Mom says you're busy, and for me to stay off there.

911
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,300
But you see, I get lonely, and it helps to talk.

912
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:42,500
because that's about all I can do. I'm crippled and I can't walk. I came back and told him to

913
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:50,460
fire up that mic and I talked to him as long as he liked. This was my dad's radio, the little boy

914
00:49:50,460 --> 00:50:00,980
said, but I guess it's mine and mom's now because my daddy's dead. Dad had a wreck about a month ago.

915
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:08,660
He was trying to get home in a blinding snow. Mom has to work now to make ends meet

916
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:17,020
and I'm not much help with my two crippled feet. She says not to worry that we'll make it all right,

917
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:25,000
but I hear her crying sometimes late at night. You know, there's one thing I want more than

918
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,900
anything else to see. Oh, I know you guys are too busy to bother with me,

919
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:39,780
but you see, my dad used to take me for rides when he was home, but I guess it's all over now

920
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:49,680
since my daddy's gone. Not one breaker came on the old CB as that little crippled boy talked with me.

921
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:57,840
I tried hard to swallow a lump that just wouldn't stay down as I thought about my boy

922
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,420
back in Greenville town.

923
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,300
Dad was going to take mom and me with him later on this year.

924
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:09,800
Well, I remember him saying someday this old truck will be yours, Teddy Bear,

925
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:14,920
but I know I'll never get to ride an 18 wheeler again,

926
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,100
but this old base will keep me in touch with all my trucker friends.

927
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,880
Teddy Bear is going to back on out now and leave you alone because it's about time for mom to come

928
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,760
home. But you give me a shout when you pass,

929
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,300
and I'll be happy to come back to you.

930
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:41,380
Well, I came back and I said, before you go, 1010, what's your home 20, little CB friend?

931
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:49,160
Well, he gave me his address and I didn't once hesitate because this hot load of freight is just

932
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:55,820
going to have to wait. I turned that truck around on a dime and headed straight for Jackson Street,

933
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,320
229. And as I rounded the corner, oh,

934
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:05,800
that one heck of a shock. 18 wheelers were lined up for three city blocks.

935
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,740
Well, I guess every driver for miles around had caught Teddy Bear's car.

936
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:17,320
And that little cripple boy was having a ball. For as fast as one driver would carry him in,

937
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:20,440
another would carry him to his truck and take off again.

938
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,760
Well, you better believe I took my turn at riding Teddy Bear.

939
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,920
And then I carried him back in and put him down in his chair.

940
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,740
And buddy,

941
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,700
if I never live to see happiness again,

942
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,260
I want you to know I saw it that day in the face of that little man.

943
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,680
We took up a collection for him before his mama got home.

944
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:47,180
And each driver said goodbye. And then they were all gone.

945
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:54,400
He shook my hand with a mile long grin and said, so long, Tucker. I'll catch you again.

946
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,960
Well, I hit that interstate with tears in my eyes.

947
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,840
I turned on the radio.

948
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,100
And I got another surprise.

949
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,300
Breaker one nine came a voice on the air.

950
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:09,100
Just one word of thanks for Mama Teddy Bear.

951
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:14,300
We wish each and every one a special prayer for you.

952
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,600
Because you just made my little boy's dream come true.

953
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,880
I'll sign off now before I start to cry.

954
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,920
May God ride with you.

955
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,680
10-4.

956
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,760
And goodbye.

957
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,420
No.

958
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:44,980
Ah.

959
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,040
Bye.

960
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,300
Bye.

961

972
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:44,960
Well, this music in the background is by The Bishop. Praise The Bishop.

973
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,940
Oh, this week's hour of slack features a great version.

974
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:04,920
The Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts, that beloved old song. So everyone tune in,

975
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,100
nine o'clock Sunday.

976
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,240
Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts

977
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,380
On 3rd Avenue

978
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,400
On 14th Street

979
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,060
Eyeballs, eyeballs rolling down the church

00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,660

I don't feel like little children ought to be exposed to anything.

987
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:47,280
First you take the train to respond.

988
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:52,140
All the water today is like a lake.

989
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,420
Canarsie Beach is filled with all the happy people.

990
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,880
On the southern side of Canarsie Beach is filled with happy people.

991
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:02,940
On a sunny day where there's no haze, you can look all the way down the beach to Coney Island.

992
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:07,160
And you can still hear the fat lady singing.

993
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,120
Singing so soon, far away.

994
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

995
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:21,720
Did you boys get your new ESO's Hour of Slag List best of CD or latest CD release?

996
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,820
You missed the release party.

997
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,960
Yeah, I did.

998
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,020
About all I did was put a little ad on the website.

999
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,740
But it's the greatest subgenius CD ever.

1000
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,700
ESO's subgenius best of number one.

1001
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,280
May 12th, Saturday night at the Euclid Tavern.

1002
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,540
Reverend Einstein, won't you come with me?

1003
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,380
Einstein Secret Orchestra.

1004
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,060
Who else?

1005
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:48,240
Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket will take us all to hell and back, friends.

1006
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,420
If you can make it down there.

1007
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,040
Well, you really shouldn't, though.

1008
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,920
It's not for humans or people.

1009
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:55,860
It's just for...

1010
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,720
Can you live through this experience?

1011
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,460
Do you dare to try to live through this experience?

1012
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:07,960
Enjoy a virtual night out with the Church of the Subgenius.

1013
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,680
If you can survive, if you can stay alive.

1014
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,880
But now, it's time to get high.

1015
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,840
Come on, let's get high.

1016
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,640
Hey, look, there's pretzels in the pedenda.

1017
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:25,320
Good night.

1018
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:26,660
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1019
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:27,980
Gorgomoli.

1020
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,140
Ha, ha.

1021
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:30,460
Ha.

1022
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:31,560
Ha.

1023
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,060
Hum.

1024
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,160
Buona.

1025
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,400
Not just...

1026
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,080
Come on, everybody, get up.

1027
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:45,940
I can't get up right now.

1028
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,960
The bolts from the back of my neck.

1029
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:50,360
That's it.

1030
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,220
That's it.

1031
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,140
There goes the machine.

1032
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,420
Anyway, for the bottom of my ghost cart.

1033
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,060
That calls me on the telephone.

1034
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,020
Everything else is gone to my radio.

1035
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,240
But I'm still singing a song of you.

1036
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:15,240
It's a lonely Saturday night.

1037
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,560
Now, if I was an actor.

1038
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,540
If I was an actor.

1039
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:21,220
Or a dancer.

1040
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:21,940
Or a dancer.

1041
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,280
Whose glamorous.

1042
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:23,960
I don't know.

1043
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:24,200
I don't know.

1044
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:24,540
I don't know.

1045
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:24,900
I don't know.

1046
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:25,120
I don't know.

1047
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:25,120


1048
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:25,120


1049
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:25,120


1050
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:25,120


1051
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,520
It would soon be my end.

1052
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,240
I would soon be my end.

1053
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,000
But now the tense light has stopped.

1054
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,000
All of these mistakes.

1055
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,160
So it's hard to forget my heartbreak.

1056
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:37,600
And at eleven o'clock I watch the network news.

1057
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,140
Oh, whoa, whoa.

1058
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,700
Something tells me that you're clearly gone.

1059
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:53,080
You said we could be friends, but that's not what I want.

1060
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:53,320
I don't know.

1061
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:53,920
I don't know.

1062
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,440
I don't know.

1063
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:15,400
I can hear the birds in the back.

1064
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,220
See you next week, kids.

1065
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,960
May 12th, Saturday night, Eagle Tavern.

1066
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,700
See you next week.

1067
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:24,740
See you next week.

1068
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,980
See you next week.

1069
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:24,660
See you next week.

1070
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,500
See you next week.
