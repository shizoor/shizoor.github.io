1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,600
I am seeking information about Bob. Let us see what is on the radio.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,900
You're listening to PR News.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,960
No, I don't think I can accept that program.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,040
Nor that one.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,540
The subgenius power of SWAT.

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:43,380
With everyone obsessing over this werejackal character, it's easy to forget that not long ago, the people in this hemisphere lived under the peaceful tyranny of Gorr, the invisible behemoth. Remember that?

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,220
Of course.

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,460
Nothing pleased Gorr more than a powerful...

9
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,180
He was wonderful, though.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, that monster has long since been deposed by the werejackal.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,780
I don't call him a monster.

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:59,980
But don't let that stop you from doing your duty. Be it kin, credits, or corn, try to honor the past by giving proper tribute at the designated time.

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,680
Or else the werejackal will kill you in your sleep.

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:15,980
Drop off your dead goods, your candle with hands, and your sanded slack at a number of stations across the city.

16
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,540
Now you can burrow in your loved ones the same way our species burrows in the Earth itself. You heard me right, it's...

17
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,860
Pete Naughty's House of Ganges Smut Analyzer Liquidation Sale.

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,780
That's right. Nothing says...

19
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,700
I love you.

20
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,860
Like a poke in the intestine.

21
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:29,980
I love you.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
Or like intestines with twelve inches of molded plastic.

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,080
Don't let the impotence plague cost you your sexmate.

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,620
Nail your sweetie to the bed every night with one of our discount analyzers.

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,960
Pete Naughty's House of Ganges Smut.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,300
Your outlet for all of your deviant needs.

27
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:51,680
And as always, we have your poppers, flare guns, bongs, duct tape, executioners, masks, left-handed cigarettes, and other tobacco accessories.

28
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,740
That's...

29
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,580
Pete Naughty's House of Ganges Smut.

30
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,500
Everyone else is jerking you around.

31
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,980
Visit our showroom at the 5th Auxiliary Service Tunnel next door.

32
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,920
Next to the crematorium.

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,700
See you there.

34
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,640
We will be right back.

35
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,960
Well, let me tell you something.

36
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,680
I am showing a nipple right now.

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,380
All right?

38
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,740
I am doing this show in the nude.

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,780
And the FCC might have a problem with that.

40
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,260
I don't know.

41
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,600
But, yeah, I'm showing more than just nipple right now.

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,780
Rob, would you like to hear a very well-worded short statement about that famous nipple?

43
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,760
Sure.

44
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,440
This was posted by Nenslow.

45
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,060
On the Internet.

46
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,640
Nenslow said,

47
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,700
So it seems that millions and millions of USA-Americans

48
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,560
watching the world's biggest lout rampage of no-brow hulks

49
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,320
competing to see who can smash into each other hardest

50
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,120
were offended and insulted at being forced to see a girl's one little kitty.

51
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,660
Dear Ben Lawton, please take me now.

52
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,580
Look at the monkey, funny monkey, little red monkey acting so fidgety.

53
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,760
Look at the monkey, funny monkey, little red monkey, cute as can be.

54
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,400
Where is his mama, papa, sister, brother, cousin, rest of the family?

55
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,680
Little red monkey on his own, some very lonesome monkey, is he?

56
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,900
Listen carefully, Dick and Jimmy, because here is a job for you.

57
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,540
What is it?

58
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,440
If you get him into the zoo.

59
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,460
The zoo?

60
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,000
He'd do all of his tricks for you.

61
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,500
Joy, why not drop him a line or two?

62
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:36,820
What for?

63
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,880
Inviting him to the zoo.

64
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,440
For if we do.

65
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,300
Then what?

66
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,760
He'll be a happy, snappy monkey, little red monkey acting so merrily.

67
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,880
We hope you like this little red monkey.

68
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,980
Very lonesome monkey, is he?

69
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,660
Little Red Monkey by Jimmy Edwards and Dick Bentley

70
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,440
brought to us by...

71
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,740
by the letter K.

72
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,300
Before that, Lymph Node Institute did the Weird Jackal stuff.

73
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:10,240
And, well, we're at WCSB in Cleveland for this show a lot.

74
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:17,360
Sometimes recorded on Dr. Sinister's radio synesthesia by calling in.

75
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:23,180
Sometimes broadcasting from the Cleveland-only version of Hour of Slack

76
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,600
from the very studios of WCSB itself,

77
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,360
rather than here in...

78
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,180
my castle.

79
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,740
Anyway...

80
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,240
I'll tell you, I saw an interesting movie called Calendar Girls.

81
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,880
Now, this is on the subject of Unmentionables,

82
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,000
which is a lightweight British fictional movie

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,220
about the true story of these old gals in England

84
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,240
who made money for their local church

85
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,600
by selling nude calendars of themselves.

86
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,100
Kind of like the Church of the Subgenius?

87
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,080
Well, these were...

88
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,340
What are you talking about?

89
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,280
These were not...

90
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,520
not as freakish and deformed by normal standards,

91
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,280
nor as beautiful by subgenius standards.

92
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,780
But it was a freak show for people who go,

93
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,180
Oh, my God, you mean old people even, like, do that kind of thing?

94
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,320
That's horrible.

95
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,280
That'd be like making love to a Galapagos tortoise's neck.

96
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,140
That's just...

97
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,020
Unsavory.

98
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,380
Unsavory.

99
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,380
Now, you know, the more I think about it,

100
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,800
No, don't go there.

101
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,180
Don't even.

102
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,200
As they said in the early 90s,

103
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,940
don't even.

104
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,500
Or the 80s, I can't remember.

105
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,520
Somebody needs to turn their radio down.

106
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,700
Because I am hearing that feedback.

107
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,880
Another subgenius.

108
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,700
Here, this is more on the breast of the news.

109
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,660
I knew as soon as I saw the breast...

110
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,920
Yeah, I'm listening to the radio and you're...

111
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,820
So you saw it.

112
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,940
...that I had to sell.

113
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,660
That five delay sucks.

114
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,660
That's against...

115
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,900
You know, they shouldn't have that.

116
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,020
Shouldn't have what?

117
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,740
That five second delay.

118
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,360
That's crazy.

119
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,460
Well, yeah, I tend to believe that we should be able to broadcast

120
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,500
stuff that we see fit, you know, as long as we're not, you know,

121
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,740
slandering people or anything like that, you know?

122
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,320
Right.

123
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,640
You don't want to say the F word.

124
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,500
Well, no.

125
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,460
I mean, I think there's nothing wrong with it, personally.

126
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
I think it ought to be allowed.

127
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,140
Right.

128
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:24,900
You know, so long as...

129
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,720
Yeah, Shona Nipple.

130
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,300
You know what?

131
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,860
I thought she had a band-aid or something.

132
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,440
I don't know.

133
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,440


134
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,440


135
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,440


136
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,440


137
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,800
I've seen it live.

138
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,640
I didn't even notice it until I'd seen it ten minutes later in a commercial.

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,320
Well, you don't want children to hear people on the radio talking like their parents talk.

140
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,120
Oh, that's right.

141
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,440
You know, that's where the parental guidance comes in.

142
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,040
You know, by all...

143
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,440
We must not let those foul curse words fall upon the dainty ears of the children

144
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,740
coming out of speakers.

145
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,040
My virgin ears!

146
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,500
If it's a TV or rap, then it's bad.

147
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,380
And, you know, in radio, then...

148
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,060
But if it's a parent's...

149
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,620
Yeah, you know, with CBS, it wasn't HBO.

150
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,700
But keep it in the family.

151
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,400
Right.

152
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:04,660
That's right.

153
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,180
Those are two totally different mega-conglomerates.

154
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,880
With the quiet...

155
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,600
So how can anybody complain about an exposed female breast in the first place?

156
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:23,020
That is itself an example of how the conspiracy mocks our very slacklessness, brazenly, mercilessly.

157
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,020
Yeah, I was...

158
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,520
Have you forgotten where we live?

159
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,160
Yeah.

160
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:27,760
Yeah.

161
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:27,760


162
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:27,760


163
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


164
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


165
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


166
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


167
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


168
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


169
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


170
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


171
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


172
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


173
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


174
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


175
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


176
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


177
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


178
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


179
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


180
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


181
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


182
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


183
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


184
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


185
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,040


186
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,420
The bar is because they saw an unauthorized nipple.

187
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,880
And meanwhile, the most gross violence and injustice is happening.

188
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,000
But what are they looking at?

189
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,420
Oh, my God.

190
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,860
Did you see that?

191
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,840
Yeah, I think that...

192
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,180
If it was a National Geographic special, you'd show two of them and nobody'd raise a...

193
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,520
Mob?

194
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,180
Yes.

195
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:55,200
For if the Virgin Mary would only dress the way Jesus does on those crucifixes, friends,

196
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,440
that religion would be three times...

197
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,560
Four!

198
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:57,920
Four!

199
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,020
Four!

200
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,260
Three times as popular as the Beatles themselves.

201
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,660
We would follow the Beatles everywhere.

202
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,700
Oh, ladies.

203
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,700
So divine.

204
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:15,420
Instead of putting a nickel in your pantalones, I will put my chewing gum in your hair.

205
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,440
For the...

206
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,640
To sell a religion, friends, you don't need all the answers.

207
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,580
You only need one good answer.

208
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,620
And that good answer is Bob, my friend.

209
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,040
And now, you know, as Poop Bobby Bob says...

210
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,100
the Pink Boys got a Bob complex.

211
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,560
And it's true, nothing is fair

212
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,580
and nothing to get hung about.

213
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,360
But when you take the path less traveled,

214
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,580
you often find that it's less traveled for a reason.

215
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,240
It's easy for us weirdos to be jerks

216
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,500
because we're trying to do more than normal people.

217
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,840
And us preachers have to do more than just lay people.

218
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,840
So praise Bob and help me somebody

219
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,260
because the bargain bin ladens

220
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,160
have been stinking up the bush of freedom.

221
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:15,080
Stale pee has befouled our constitution.

222
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,000
The skull and bones guys get all the good drugs.

223
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,760
I dare him a load of a splite on a lad of...

224
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,320
And it turns out that the John Birchers

225
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,820
were right.

226
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,560
They were right all along about the CFR

227
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,760
and the Trilateral Commission.

228
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,360
And it turns out the CFR and the Trilateral Commission

229
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,960
were all right about the Bilderbergers

230
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
and the Heinehausers.

231
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,260
The kooks were right.

232
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,620
The right-wingers are the commies.

233
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,880
They were hiding in plain sight,

234
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,400
right under our noses.

235
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,980
They had us looking for them where they are.

236
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,260
In your face.

237
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,340
That's where the mark of the beast lies, my friend.

238
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,380
Your face.

239
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,680
Above your hairline.

240
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,720
The mark shall be...

241
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,120
Put on your hand and on your forehead.

242
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,920
Well, the one on your hand is your thumbprint.

243
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,920
The one on your forehead is your face.

244
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,640
Your face is the mark of the beast.

245
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,900
It's the final program, my friend.

246
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,600
Do you have hope?

247
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,560
Do you have faith?

248
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,080
If you do, you are a fool.

249
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,980
What you need is Bob.

250
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,660
J.R. Bob Dobbs and his teachings

251
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,360
are the only thing standing between you

252
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,400
and complete brainlessness.

253
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,680
Actually, he's what will lead you

254
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,680
to complete brainlessness,

255
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,420
but that's a...

256
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,720
That's getting too complicated.

257
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,720
Friends, you must be saved,

258
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,320
even if it kills you.

259
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,320
For he shall come as a thief in the night,

260
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,900
and he shall be a salesman,

261
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,320
and then shall take your last,

262
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,900
last credit card.

263
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,080
For he'll...

264
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,300
And then you find yourself taking that bath

265
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,780
that is less bubbled.

266
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,600
Friends, you know,

267
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,140
just as suicide is the most

268
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,440
sincere form of self-loathing,

269
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,020
Bob's new church,

270
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,060
the church of the subgenius,

271
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,980
is the most sincere form of send one dollar.

272
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,620
Praise Bob and hail Connie.

273
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,240
Connie, that beautiful wife of Bob,

274
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,420
the feminine essence

275
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,080
which balances Bob's ultimate maleness, yes?

276
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,320
Connie, the seductive side of slack.

277
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,440
Bob, the rich, successful, lucky side of slack.

278
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,300
The single one word you need to remember.

279
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,860
Connie.

280
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,560
Simple, kindly.

281
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,860
Connie.

282
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,820
The connective tissue from the top of your skull

283
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,500
to the bottom of your toes.

284
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,300
Connie.

285
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,860
25 cents any time you peek.

286
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,160
Connie.

287
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,860
She came from another place,

288
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,140
and she went back as soon as she came.

289
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,840
She came back as soon as she came.

290
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:58,840


291
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,340
White folks do some funny things.

292
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,220
The plight of our people is desperate.

293
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,660
Destined for disaster.

294
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,060
George Bush Sr. did that for us

295
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,280
because he cares.

296
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,280
Yes, white folks do the funniest things.

297
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,960
Has that flag-waving cheerleading rah-rah bullshit

298
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,040
stopped or died down at all?

299
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,420
Really?

300
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,740
Have flag pills to eat

301
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,960
and then you shit out a flag.

302
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,920
That's true patriotism.

303
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,860
Perpetual war for perpetual peace.

304
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,820
Perpetual war for perpetual peace.

305
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,700
We vote on.

306
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,460
We who?

307
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,720
We vote on.

308
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,640
Who benefits?

309
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,960
Perpetual war for perpetual peace.

310
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,960
Perpetual war for perpetual peace.

311
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,820
We vote on.

312
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,620
We who?

313
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,800
We vote on.

314
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,780
Who benefits?

315
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,860
In whose interest are these wars?

316
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,120
Well, you know, people vote and they don't inform themselves and they're willfully ignorant in this country.

317
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,760
They don't want to know.

318
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,600
I don't want it.

319
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,020
Bill O'Reilly said, and that's good enough for me, you know.

320
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,540
How eager they are to be slaves.

321
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,980
Hey, Indians, get a Bible, then we'll talk, all right?

322
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,380
It's called Manifest Destiny.

323
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,160
Look it up.

324
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,440
It's in the book we wrote.

325
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,100
Thank you.

326
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,600
That was not funny.

327
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,060
We vote on.

328
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,820
We who?

329
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,300
Remember, some seamen.

330
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,220
And nobody's fucking paying attention to all the fucking truly evil shit he's doing and can get away with

331
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,260
using the war on terrorism and the fucking thousands of people who died as an excuse

332
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:22,580
to protest.

333
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,320
We're going to push through every shitty agenda, roll back civil rights, women's rights, you know,

334
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,600
separation of church and state.

335
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
It's all being rolled back, you know.

336
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,820
And, but we're all, we're ignoring it.

337
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,960
We're going, hey, good job on the bombing.

338
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,840
Very strange present.

339
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,160
Born deaf and dumb.

340
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,700
Have flag pills to eat and then you shit out a flag.

341
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,660
That's true patriotism.

342
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,080
Act of patriotism with a twist.

343
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,600
The blood is on the head of the boss.

344
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,800
The blood is on the head of the boss.

345
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,020
The dancing corpses.

346
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,000
There's a choice, my beakers.

347
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,940
There's a choice, my beakers.

348
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,940
There's a choice, my beakers.

349
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,980
There's a choice, my beakers.

350
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,360
Stranger to kindness.

351
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,560
In a moment, I'll tell you about a funny election.

352
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,560
Yes, white folks do the funniest thing.

353
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:42,520
War on War by Norrell Preff and more on Preff at heavyconfetti.com.

354
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:50,880
And in other news, Ashcroft update, friends.

355
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:59,560
Lying in a near-death state in intensive care, Attorney General John Ashcroft is getting the very best care money can buy.

356
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:09,920
His attending surgeon, Dr. Phil Farnsworth, has said that despite introducing massive amounts of marijuana smoke into his lungs,

357
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,500
Ashcroft is still barely hanging on.

358
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:21,140
If only he could get multiple semen injections into his hind fast enough and orally, he might have a chance.

359
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:29,920
There just aren't enough homosexual men on the East Coast willing to make that life-saving gesture, it seems, said Dr. Farnsworth.

360
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:39,320
A Miss Leticia Lacowana-Jones of Voodoo High Priestess has been brought in as a consultant from New Orleans

361
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,300
at her insistence several dozen calico cats maintaining.

362
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,560
A noisy vigil outside his 10th-story hotel room window have been removed.

363
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,740
Him soul being sick, she was quoted as saying,

364
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:02,320
he be needin' some of that high John DeConquer root and some special double mojo gree-gree powder I makes up.

365
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:08,160
The devil got strong claws in this one for sure.

366
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,320
Well, you can certainly only agree with that.

367
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,500
The devil certainly has.

368
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,920
He has his big red claws right in John Ashcroft's derriere.

369
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,100
Certainly does.

370
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,260
And it doesn't look like he's about to release.

371
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,700
No, not anytime soon.

372
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,600
We expect flying monkeys to be bringing him home.

373
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,880
Flowing?

374
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,280
Via the usual route, past the Beltway and up through the Georgetown crossover.

375
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,720
Right up the Ashcroft, you say, eh?

376
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,120
Yes, and here he comes.

377
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,500
It looks like the processional's about to start for the former justice minister of...

378
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,940
...external sciences.

379
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,380
Oh, my, my, my, my.

380
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,700
John Z. Ashcroft, as the motorcade wings its way slowly.

381
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,000
That's really bewildering, isn't it?

382
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,720
It's not really winging its way, though, is it?

383
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,320
It's kind of slow.

384
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,320
No, yes, yes.

385
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:01,820
And it's being pulled by three delayed gray horsies, one bigger than the other, each one smaller.

386
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:09,680
And it looks to me like the whole Ashcroft family, if there is such a thing, is crying, waving little Kleenexes.

387
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,420
And there's little...

388
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,800
What's his name?

389
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,080
Bill Bill.

390
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:14,900
Little Bill Bill.

391
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,480
Little Billy Bill.

392
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:21,900
Little Billy Bill is shedding his one solitary tear, according to the Patriotism Act.

393
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,920
Apparently, he's only allowed to shed one per four-hour delay.

394
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,380
And so then there are horses' ashes on horses' ashes, then?

395
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,780
It looks like a full orange recoup.

396
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,840
It looks like everybody's going to be there.

397
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,340
And as they approach the diorama now, the horses are getting closer.

398
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,080
But the...

399
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,080
The

400
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:55,800
Oh, yeah.

401
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:03,200
I want to pass into the mud and become one of the great flowers.

402
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,600
Oh, Mr. Tang?

403
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,340
Oh, Reverend.

404
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,360
Hello?

405
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,900
Can I ask you about psychic powers?

406
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,140
How can I connect your...

407
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,360
Psychic flowers?

408
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,860
I wanted to ask you a serious question about it.

409
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,320
How can I connect your...

410
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,800
Well, serious.

411
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,160
This is a good place to ask a serious question.

412
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,980
Okay, what's the question?

413
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,960
I wanted to ask you something.

414
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,980
If you're able to have visions, and within a year of having those visions, something bad happens in a certain place,

415
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:31,240
like a year before what happened in New York happened, I had a vision of something...

416
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,960
Well, you're a psychic, and you should be making money by taking psychic friend phone calls.

417
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,020
Yeah, you should turn it into your erotic kind of urges.

418
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,700
And you know what else I can do?

419
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,340
Yeah.

420
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,680
Well, see, with your erotic urges, there's a lot of stuff you can do with your psychic ability.

421
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,380
I could tell when people are about to die.

422
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,440
Well, people will pay for that.

423
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,180
You know, you should be making good money at that.

424
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,520
Can you tell when they're about ready to be born again or any of that stuff, or just when they're going to leave this time?

425
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,860
When they're going to leave this time, I could tell by their energy.

426
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,620
Their energy.

427
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,640
When is Donald Rumsfeld going to die?

428
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,140
Yeah, we wanted to know about that one.

429
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,880
He's not going to die yet, but the vice president, Cheney...

430
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,040
Yeah?

431
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:07,580
Cheney?

432
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,220
Probably in a year to a year and a half, he's going to die.

433
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,580
He already looks like he had a stroke.

434
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,280
That is too freaking short of a long of a time for me, man.

435
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,060
He already looks like he had a stroke.

436
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,880
He sits there and half his face is asleep already.

437
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,760
Talk to Tim Lee again.

438
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,620
I think they're lying to us.

439
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,940
The man is already dead.

440
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,160
They're going to get the documents someday.

441
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,740
But his energy is...

442
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,320
People have, like, an energy.

443
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,620
Yeah, their ki.

444
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,840
And you could feel it when it's dying.

445
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,500
Yeah.

446
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,880
Have you ever noticed a little...

447
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,380
You've been feeling of Cheney, huh?

448
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,020
Yeah.

449
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,200
You've been feeling of Cheney.

450
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,000
By looking at his mouth, have you passed your punky-spunky sputum into his area?

451
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,560
You want to stick your tongue in Cheney's mouth, don't you?

452
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,440
No, I don't.

453
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,080
You don't.

454
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,460
Don't give us that.

455
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,440
Because he is dying.

456
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,000
We see right through this ruse.

457
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,940
You could feel, like, a negative energy, too.

458
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,960
Okay, how about the press?

459
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,060
I know we're not allowed to ask, but we're just kind of, you know, just basically asking.

460
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,960
When's old W going to kick the hucket?

461
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,000
Not anytime soon.

462
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,280
How about the Catholic Church?

463
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,440
When are they all going to die?

464
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:06,920
Right.

465
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,680
When is the Pope going to pass into another generation?

466
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,500
The Pope.

467
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,100
Yeah.

468
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,420
How long can this Pope mother, you know, how long can this guy...

469
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,420
Have you seen him, W?

470
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

471
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:17,740
Yes.

472
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,760
He's already dead.

473
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,340
He's like one of those bodies looking down.

474
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,180
His eyes are closed.

475
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,620
They roll him up to the microphone.

476
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,580
He's going to be, like, one of the first people that probably dies next year.

477
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,380
You mean, like, around January, something?

478
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:34,580
Yeah.

479
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:34,940
Yeah.

480
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,880
First of the year.

481
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,020
So that'll be, like, our little Moxie Bobber and our little...

482
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,040
That'll be our New Year.

483
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,060
He's going to die on Christmas.

484
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,180
Yeah.

485
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,180


486
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,180


487
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,180


488
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,180


489
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,460
His energy isn't, like...

490
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,700
Hey, I bet they're taking...

491
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,120
I bet you can get odds on...

492
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,380
I bet you can get odds on a Pope's death.

493
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,640
Odds?

494
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,120
Yeah.

495
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,020
What's so odd about that?

496
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,940
Every Pope dies.

497
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,240
No, I bet you can lay bets on it.

498
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,240
Oh, oh, I see.

499
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,680
Game of chance.

500
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,420
Let's go on to Vegas.com and find out.

501
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,540
Well, there are no chances.

502
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,180
There's no synchronicities, and there are no coinkydinks.

503
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,760
Yeah, huh?

504
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,520
It's all smooth as gravy to me, folks.

505
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,660
We must eliminate wasteful and frivolous religious congregations.

506
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,960
These institutions...

507
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,180
Gamble their lives...

508
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,940
Lives and futures on drugs.

509
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,300
We expect third graders to get rid of steroids now.

510
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,800
The aim here is to punish children not performing.

511
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,360
Drug use in high school has the children shuffling along.

512
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,860
Protect them from junk, and you will kill them.

513
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,460
Our nation must defend the sanctity of chaos incarnates in God's sight.

514
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,200
Unless you act.

515
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,540
Unless you act.

516
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,360
Unless you act.

517
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,040
Unless you act, George W. Bush.

518
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,640
Tard.

519
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:40,800
Tard.

520
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,280
Tard.

521
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,020
Unfair.

522
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,260
Bush.

523
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,040
Tard.

524
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,620
Back up.

525
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,620
Sexually transmitted diseases.

526
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,540
Sexually transmitted diseases.

527
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,540
Small businesses will pay higher taxes.

528
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,480
Drug testing in our schools.

529
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:52,880
Border.

530
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,280
Border.

531
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,100
An un-and.

532
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:54,840
An un-and.

533
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,500
An un-and.

534
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,960
Out from the shadows of American life.

535
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,200
Filled with victims.

536
00:21:59,520 --> 00:21:59,800
Dick.

537
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,060
Dick.

538
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,400
Dick.

539
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,640
Dick.

540
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,180
The American people have now been captured or killed.

541
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,080
As a union of a man and a man and the addicted.

542
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,020
Faith-based.

543
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,560
Faith-based.

544
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,440
George W. Bush.

545
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,620
Listen to your mom.

546
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:10,620


547
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:10,960
Mom or dad.

548
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:11,620
Dan.

549
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,120
Dan.

550
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:12,740
Dan.

551
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,300
Dan.

552
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,840
Dan.

553
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,380
Dan.

554
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:14,960
Dan.

555
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,560
Dan.

556
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:15,720


557
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:15,900
Dan.

558
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,060
Dan.

559
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,260
Dan.

560
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,280
Dan.

561
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,320
Dan.

562
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,060
The cause we serve is filled with victims.

563
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,820
Pillars who hide in cities.

564
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,420
The addicted.

565
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,080
Faith-based groups commit crime.

566
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,360
The negative influence of faith-based groups.

567
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,080
Unleashing the faith-based.

568
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,420
Again.

569
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:30,880
Them.

570
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,500
Against them.

571
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:31,780
Again.

572
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,480
Again.

573
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:32,800
Them.

574
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,460
Against them.

575
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:33,740
Again.

576
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,400
May God continue to doubt the word of America.

577
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,260
The last shrub.

578
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,200
By Norrell Kraft.

579
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,980
I love to sing-a.

580
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,300
I like to sing-a.

581
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,520
Never stop-a to my papa.

582
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,140
I wipe a flag-a.

583
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,100
With a cheer for Jackie Bunny and another for my mommy.

584
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,680
No!

585
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,500
We love to sing.

586
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:01,120
Yeah, scenes from the latest subgenius convention in Little Rock, Arkansas.

587
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,160
Unfortunately, the latest one was 1985.

588
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:10,340
And the choir, what a beautiful young choir they had of children who were all gelded at a much earlier age.

589
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:17,700
So they could not only carry the high notes, but also their mother's pilferages and the small things they brought home from work.

590
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,700
Because they were working out of mines for a long time.

591
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,320
It makes their skin nice and soft and smooth, too.

592
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:22,860
Yes, yes.

593
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,520
It makes it supple.

594
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,280
Like a rag.

595
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,640
Nice and supple, yes.

596
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,040
Much like their foreheads when they're implanted with the tubes.

597
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:30,480
Yes.

598
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,240
Those glistening alumite tubes.

599
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:32,980
Yes, yes.

600
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,220
They conduct those little children all the way into deep space with just a moment's thought.

601
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,520
A little perforce.

602
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:38,840
That's how they can sit right.

603
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,760
Yes.

604
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,600
Yes.

605
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,300
Very...

606
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,220
Oh, Ashcroft has been healed!

607
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,820
I can see his wings, Brownie.

608
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,620
It's a miracle!

609
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,960
The sun is rising over America.

610
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,080
Everything will be beautiful and wonderful again.

611
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,720
Howdy, Nurse Bess. I'm feeling fine.

612
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,080
I want to go out that way.

613
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,400
Look out the window.

614
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,020
Help, help, help me.

615
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,880
My feet.

616
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:05,940
Jesus.

617
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,680
Oh, yeah.

618
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,060
The light out there is blinding.

619
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,160
Yes?

620
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,460
Yes.

621
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,240
It's a blinding light everywhere.

622
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,420
In his ears, in his eyes, in his neck!

623
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:22,340
Not only is asbestos an excellent source of 27 different vitamins and minerals, but it's

624
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,300
also the only fire-proofing material that can suppress your genital herpes.

625
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,440
It also makes the delicious drinks for mom and the kids, especially after school when

626
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,000
they're laying around fondling each other's foreheads.

627
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,820
Mom and dad enjoy the rich, rich flavor and the strange dreams it brings every night.

628
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,140
And those dreams are bringing us to the end of the world.

629
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,020
We're bringing lots and lots of money.

630
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,420
Somewhere.

631
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,740
Well, let's not forget mercury as we sing the praises of asbestos.

632
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,620
Mercury was a substance that used to be a lot of fun to play with.

633
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,260
And now it's deadly poison.

634
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,100
It tastes good and it's good for you.

635
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,420
Yeah.

636
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:57,800
Oh, no.

637
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,700
Now it'll kill you.

638
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,520
Oh, it'll turn your maker babies be born with monsters.

639
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,380
No, you'll just end up with mad hatter syndrome, that's all.

640
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:06,800
Yeah.

641
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,820
And, you know, I'm the maddest hatter of them all.

642
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,120
Yeah.

643
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,100
Well, you just rub mercury on your scalp, then.

644
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,320
Yeah.

645
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:17,300
Did they tell you not to rub mercury in your, actually into your cranium, you know?

646
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,460
I mean, give me a break, you know?

647
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,380
Actually, I've been looking for a mad helmet maker.

648
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,060
You take it as a homopathic remedy.

649
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,560
Do you, do you know, can you do helmets?

650
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,000
You have to do helmets yourself with some Saran Wrap.

651
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,580
And the same, and then same helmet maker, same difference, whatever.

652
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,660
You rub your bed.

653
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,400
Schizophrenic helmet maker, any kind of helmet maker who's differently sane.

654
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,800
I'll see if I can get in touch with the, uh, with the mad germaphobe.

655
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,100
I'm not sure if I can get in touch with the, uh, with the mad germaphobe.

656
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,800
I'm just gonna go to the Cernyman's Network and we'll get you hooked up with one.

657
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,920
Yeah, I need some, some, some mad or deranged hat wear.

658
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,200
Some mad trans, uh, trans-

659
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,480
Are you, are you covering the gaping wound in your skull now with the, where your brain's

660
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,100
starting to come out?

661
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,860
Or is it just, uh, you know, a fashion thing?

662
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,380
Oh, that's been, we put the, uh, clear plastic-

663
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,240
It's not my brain coming out.

664
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,040
This is the evil humor.

665
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,820
Plexiglass over that so that you can see it.

666
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,580
Well, that's what I was saying.

667
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,480
If you want the real helmet look, all you gotta get some Saran Wrap and a rubber band

668
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,420
and pop the, you know, pop the actual brain part out so it looks like the end of your

669
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:09,860
phallus.

670
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,560
No, no, no.

671
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,360
The whole idea is to shield the brain from the rays.

672
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,340
You know, Dave, it's just a glorified, you know, aluminum-

673
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,120
That's Saran Wrap.

674
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,380
You're halfway to a hot Carl.

675
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,000
You guys are sick.

676
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,840
Well, no, we have deviated septum, so it just kinda sounds like we're sick.

677
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:27,760
Yeah.

678
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,440
Chepti.

679
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,080
We had the septums deviated, but we were born with normal septum.

680
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,360
Yeah, it was the only part of-

681
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,640
He started listening to that, to that evil rock and roll music.

682
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,440
Yeah.

683
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,840
And now they're all deviants.

684
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,080
Yeah.

685
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,080


686
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,480
And now they're all deviants.

687
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:40,480


688
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:46,300
My septum and my octum and my, and my quadrum.

689
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,500
Really quadrum.

690
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,240
Hide your body modification.

691
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:54,720
Like, I've had several bones carefully broken and then mended back together in weird patterns.

692
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,820
You don't really see them.

693
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,360
You just feel them.

694
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,100
I'm calling it.

695
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,580
We are bringing back the sarcophagus now.

696
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:06,720
We're ready to ensconce it on the diamond area of the cathedral here.

697
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,800
Is that what that smells?

698
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,960
It's right underneath the obelisk.

699
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,080
Oh, yeah.

700
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,080


701
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,080


702
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,080


703
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,080


704
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,080


705
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,080


706
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,080


707
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,560
It's a little obelisk dome.

708
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,000
Or is that an obelisk or a dome?

709
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:20,460
And that's where, that's where John will be laid to rest for the full view of the listless

710
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:20,980
audience.

711
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,340
It looks like there are several thousand people making their way past the sarcophagi,

712
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:32,100
each holding their small hand out to touch the former justice, justice, justices sarcophagus.

713
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:40,080
And it looks like, oh, there are some very, very large, people with large heads are weaving

714
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,080


715
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,240
now and it looks like the sergeant of arms and the corporal of rights are trying to

716
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
remove these people.

717
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,080
I don't know if it can be done with the sheer size of their heads or not.

718
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,220
Justice, the justices, just out of sight.

719
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:02,760
It's just about time for a time to reconnect the tubes.

720
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,680
I was surprised.

721
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,580
George Bush equates the terrorists with the United States position.

722
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,220
And I don't really care.

723
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,380
I've done more crap.

724
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,960
So you keep your mouth shut.

725
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,520
You know why?

726
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,240
Warped view of father.

727
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,880
What about George Bush?

728
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,400
That's it.

729
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,220
I'm not going to say anymore.

730
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:19,940
Shut up.

731
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,420
Cut his mic.

732
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,420
I'm not going to dress you.

733
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:21,920
We're done.

734
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,880
You're watching the number one program on people news.

735
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,460
Enter the spin zone on the shut up factor.

736
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,520
The most powerful name in news.

737
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,340
Shut up.

738
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:30,840
News channel.

739
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,620
I feel bad.

740
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,520
I really do.

741
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,140
Spin cycle by Noral Prep.

742
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,480
Stand up, baby.

743
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,560
Stand up.

744
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,380
Let me see.

745
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,160
Let me see.

746
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,080
Wait a minute.

747
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,600
Let me put my eye back in.

748
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,220
I'll keep an eye out for you.

749
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:52,700
As president of the United States, I would like to pronounce my consonants very hardly.

750
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,140
Or hardly at all.

751
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,500
I would like to say that I have gone to see the passion of Christ and have returned invigorated

752
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,400
as a new leader of my United States.

753
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:09,560
I know that my Christ, my Lord, my leader, and my big guy, my God, my God, my God, my

754
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,680
God, my God, my God.

755
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,520
And with their main thing being to walk the national walk.

756
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,620
Each one of them is to be loved.

757
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,760
I know that I have spring at the feet of Cortes.

758
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,600
I already beat him with a mountain of beatings.

759
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,080
Now, I knew him because of how much he stood to�

760
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,300
because of how strong he was.

761
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,420
And of course, David, David.

762
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,060
David was a great man.

763
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,180
How many others do you have that you can get away with?

764
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,780
Disneyland is a little different in terms of golfing.

765
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,440
Yeah, I'm a pistols hundred drop.

766
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:36,680
Your head is everyday žéšt всё中国 Cher nation.

767
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:36,680


768
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:36,680


769
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:36,680


770
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:36,680


771
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:36,840
You don't know what it is?

772
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,180
This is the stories.

773
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:39,880
W. Bush.

774
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,960
Yeah.

775
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,300
Please stand and say the Pledge of Allegiance with me.

776
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,260
Okay.

777
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,400
I pledge alignment to the flakes of the untitled snakes of America

778
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,740
and to the Republicans for which they stand

779
00:29:54,620 --> 00:30:02,740
one macho underpants invisible with licorice and jars of wine for hours.

780
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,280
Amen.

781
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,360
What about penis? Is penis a bad word?

782
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,420
No, penis...

783
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,520
Only depending on how it's used.

784
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,660
Just as it is in life.

785
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,460
Right.

786
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,160
In the law books.

787
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,000
It is all the bit as bad depending on how it is used.

788
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,920
It can be used for good or for evil.

789
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,160
I mean, you know why they named it that?

790
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,120
Because half of the little girls missing are named Amber.

791
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,420
They could have called it the Heather Alert,

792
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,720
the way America is so sallow and vinipid today.

793
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,940
You had a daughter?

794
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,500
Yes.

795
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:31,920
Okay.

796
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,440
Well, I don't mean it in that kind of cruel way

797
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,060
where I'd like to torture my own children.

798
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,500
I didn't say that.

799
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,220
I sometimes do like to slap them a little bit.

800
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,840
That's why John Walsh...

801
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,800
People should eat their young.

802
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,980
Eat your young.

803
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,160
Eat your young.

804
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,640
Eat your young.

805
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,380
That's a lot of guys. That's a lot of convicts.

806
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,520
Well, there are a lot of roads that need to be built in this country, my friend,

807
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,740
and I hope you're one of the first people that understands that we need meat.

808
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,120
We need strong arms and tiny little feet to build great railways

809
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,080
and to...

810
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,060
Stretch the American Union and...

811
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,520
And eat their young.

812
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,380
If you don't want your kids to come up missing,

813
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,160
you better get a microchip put in their head.

814
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,860
Because if somebody gets your kid...

815
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,440
This guy's recommending good things.

816
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,480
A microchip...

817
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,720
Why do people even have children anymore?

818
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,700
Why don't you just get a...

819
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,420
Why don't you just buy an Android?

820
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,620
If I could do it right now

821
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,300
and put something in my kid's head

822
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,260
where if she was missing like a non-star system,

823
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,360
if they can do a car, they can do a kid, right?

824
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,320
There will be a chip in every garage.

825
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,060
And this is how the New World Order...

826
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,180
The last time he drove to Buffalo,

827
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,580
we could use that non-star system in his head.

828
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,500
And this is how the New World Order will be created.

829
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,820
Roland was a warrior

830
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,660
From the land of the midnight sun

831
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,440
With a Thompson gun for hire

832
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,280
Fighting to be done

833
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,920
The deal was made in Denmark

834
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,540
On a dark and stormy day

835
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,420
So he set out for Biafra

836
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,580
To join the bloody fray

837
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,220
Through 66 and 7

838
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,220
They fought the Congo War

839
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,900
With their fingers on their triggers

840
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,820
Knee deep in gore

841
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,320
For days and nights they battled

842
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,260
The best in the world

843
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:35,260


844
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:35,260


845
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:35,260


846
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:35,260


847
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:35,260


848
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,900
And two to their knees

849
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,920
They killed to earn a living

850
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,100
And to help out the Congolese

851
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,120
Roland the Thompson Gunner

852
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,220
Roland the Thompson Gunner

853
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,140
His comrades fought beside him

854
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,780
Van Owen and the rest

855
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,240
But of all the men in the world

856
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,760
Of all the Thompson Gunners

857
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,720
Roland was the best

858
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,580
So the CIA decided

859
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,700
They wanted Roland dead

860
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,400
That son of a bitch Van Owen

861
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,520
Blew off Roland's head

862
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:27,680
Roland the headless Thompson Gunner

863
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,540
Norway's bravest son

864
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,700
To the heavens of the score

865
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,720
They can still see his headless body

866
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,760
Stalking through the night

867
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,100
In the muzzle flash

868
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,820
Of Roland's Thompson Gunner

869
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,140
In the muzzle flash

870
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,840
Of Roland's Thompson Gunner

871
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,400
Roland searched the continent

872
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,680
For the man who'd done him no good

873
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,280
He found him in

874
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,240
He found him in Mombasa

875
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,980
In a ballroom drinking gin

876
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,720
Roland aimed his Thompson Gun

877
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,060
He didn't say a word

878
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,920
But he blew out a once body

879
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,880
From there to Johannesburg

880
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,520
Roland the headless Thompson Gunner

881
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,500
Roland the headless Thompson Gunner

882
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:34,680
Roland the headless Thompson Gunner

883
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,440
Roland the headless Thompson Gunner

884
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,000
Talking about the man

885
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,440
Roland the headless Thompson Gunner

886
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,680
The eternal Thompson Gunner

887
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,260
Still wandering through the night

888
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,020
Now it's ten years later

889
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,140
But it still keeps up the fight

890
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,660
In Ireland, Ireland

891
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,560
In Lebanon

892
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,440
In Palestine

893
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,580
In Berkeley

894
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,300
Paddy Hearst

895
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,520
Heard the burst

896
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,800
Of Roland's Thompson Gun

897
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,940
And bought it

898
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,700
Was anybody here in the Navy?

899
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,100
I was a rear admiral

900
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,440
Oh my, sheesh, here we go

901
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,020
No more jokes about the fuzzy doctor again

902
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,440
No more consuming yourself

903
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,640
In the all incredible fire

904
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,480
Who's the fuzzy doctor?

905
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,060
Huh?

906
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,020
Who's the fuzzy doctor?

907
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:40,540
He is

908
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,380
You are the fuzzy doctor, my friend

909
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,660
I am Doctor Sinister

910
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,720
And I am here to help

911
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,000
Every man is a fuzzy doctor

912
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,960
This is the Doctor Sinister's Suicide Helpline

913
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,080
Cannibal Bushes are their own selves

914
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,340
And who can you be all?

915
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,260
I predict

916
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,240
Fuzzy doctors will be elected president

917
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,000
In the year 1997

918
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,860
A self-made man from the Midwest

919
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,380
And the middle of the world

920
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,900
Where things come down hard

921
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,740
Go back easy

922
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,000
And the world will be a better place

923
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,000


924
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,000


925
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,000


926
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,000


927
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,000


928
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,000


929
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,000


930
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,420
Fuzzy doctors grew up the easy way

931
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,520
Knowing mom and dad really cared for themselves

932
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,680
You guys that crazy out here

933
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,220
A hard-nosed, down-to-earth people

934
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,880
And he took the trains across the United States

935
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,340
And waved and whistled

936
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,120
Through the heartland

937
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,540
And kissed babies as far as he could see

938
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,160
And that's why fuzzy doctors

939
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,240
Is a man for you

940
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,000
A working man

941
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,560
A farmer

942
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,400
A stinker

943
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,080
A holy man and a sailor too

944
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,020
Are you gonna let the fuzzy doctor be forgotten, my friend?

945
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,240
Jackal can smell your guilt

946
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,360
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

947
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,400
Obey the wear, Jackal

948
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,440
Ah, the commercial break

949
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,640
You know, commercials are now woven into the tapestry of our lives

950
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,700
Answering the questions we first posed to ourselves

951
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,820
Who am I?

952
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,880
What do I believe?

953
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,280
What is my worth?

954
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,780
Before commercials, these questions were merely rhetorical and thus unanswerable

955
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,180
But, when viewed through the magnifying lens of commercials

956
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,160
These questions, like all others, yield answers

957
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,440
Imagine, no more wondering about identity, self, or beauty

958
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,980
If you allow your life to reflect the questions you ask

959
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,820
Like the images in commercials

960
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,120
The nagging doubts and feelings of inadequacy will fall away

961
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,960
Leaving the person you've always dreamed of

962
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,920
The person you've always dreamed of

963
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,900
The person you've always dreamed of

964
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,540
Confident

965
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,440
Assured

966
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,120
Bold

967
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,120
Or

968
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,180
Beautiful

969
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,400
Sexy

970
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,460
Loved

971
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,500
Yes, America, you loved your commercials

972
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,300
And why shouldn't you?

973
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,160
Commercials are themselves lovers

974
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,960
Gentle are their words

975
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,340
Tender their caress

976
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,260
Commercials know what you like

977
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,960
And they want to give it to you

978
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,120
Attuned only to your wants and needs

979
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,760
Commercials stir the passions

980
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,620
And arouse desire

981
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,920
Commercials give and give

982
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,740
Reaching lovingly deep inside of you

983
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,580
Creeping tentatively at first

984
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,540
And then relenting

985
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,760
Into a singly focused writhing

986
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,820
Searching out the source of your ache

987
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,460
Pushing fiercely into your loneliness

988
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,340
And into a spot you never knew existed

989
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,600
Commercials fill you up with hopes and dreams

990
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,560
With new desires and new possibilities

991
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,400
Delivering you into an eerily delirious ecstasy

992
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,900
Afterward, you'll sleep as only someone who's been completely satisfied can

993
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,340
Only vaguely sensing the arm of commercials

994
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,480
Draped over your body

995
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,260
Holding you

996
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,060
Keeping you

997
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,140
Safe and secure

998
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,240
And you'll dream

999
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,960
Of ballroom dancing

1000
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,900
Of game-winning home runs

1001
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,460
Of first kisses

1002
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,060
And of commercials

1003
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,560
The preceding message was conceived by General Consensus Incorporated

1004
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,740
And was funded entirely by you and consumers like you

1005
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,020
You are doing a great job

1006
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,960
Now go out and buy yourself something nice

1007
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,820
Something red

1008
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,920
You look beautiful in red

1009
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,260
Do you like fat chicks but can't seem to find any during our current food outage?

1010
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,120
How about chicks so fat that they seem like two or three chicks were eaten by this other chick?

1011
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,400
Well hop on down to

1012
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,840
The Werejackle's House of Boys!

1013
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,660
Lymphnode Institute

1014
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,640
Uh, Werejackle and so forth, friends

1015
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,700
Before that, Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1016
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,420
And Dr. Sinister, yours truly, Princess Wee and her collars

1017
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,380
And whoever else

1018
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:55,080
And before that, the late, great Warren Zevon, dear friends

1019
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:00,840
Uh, the late, great Warren Zevon with Rollin' the Headless Thompson Gunner

1020
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,140
Man, you know

1021
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:08,300
Just thinking about the fates of so many of the great artistes

1022
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,560
Cut down before they could find Bob

1023
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,220
Man, it tears me up

1024
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,180
We're just not saving them

1025
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,140
We're failures

1026
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,860
We are failures, man

1027
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,200
I give up

1028
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,240
I give up

1029
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,000
I want to just end it all

1030
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
But, you know, even at that

1031
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,720
I blew it

1032
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,240
He couldn't handle it

1033
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:35,740
No

1034
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,960
See, he was ready to commit suicide and he had already come to the right place

1035
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,120
Dr. Sinister's Suicide Helpline

1036
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,720
I'll tell you exactly how to do it

1037
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,240
I'll prescribe you the medication necessary

1038
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,400
Cause they don't call me Dr. Sinister for nothing

1039
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,420
Oh, that's a good deal, friends

1040
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,840
If you're looking to commit suicide

1041
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,020
If you're thinking about it any time in the near future

1042
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,800
You wanna call Dr. Sinister's Suicide Helpline

1043
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,080
He gives you active tips on which button to push

1044
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,380
If you're going for that quick shot

1045
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,380
You might as well buy a gun

1046
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,460
But some people actually like to crawl out the non-existent rear window

1047
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:10,060
Much in the old, uh, same way as the old film noir from the 1940s

1048
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,620
And they can't crawl back in

1049
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:17,060
So you wanna call Dr. Sinister and make sure that if you're gonna swallow that Drano

1050
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,860
Or put it in your vanos

1051
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,060
That you know the right spot

1052
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:26,960
That's right, we carry a wide variety of options for the end of your life

1053
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,220
We have potassium chloride

1054
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,260
We have thiopental sodium

1055
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,840
We have sarin and ricin

1056
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,040
We've got the solanine and the...

1057
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,340
Scopamine

1058
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,980
And we've got a high bridge on the way out of town

1059
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,140
Sobs and big birds that sing in your poo

1060
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,480
It's a wonderful world

1061
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,460
It's a wonderful world

1062
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,860
It's a wonderful world

1063
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,240
He lives in his own little world, doesn't he?

1064
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,380
His own little wonderful world

1065
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:00,800
His own little world

1066
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,940
He's safe in there

1067
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,460
I think it's a beautiful song idea too

1068
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,160
And you could have, you could have that as the bed

1069
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,960
For your PSA, you know, for the suicide hotline

1070
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,600
And, uh, jeez

1071
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,240
Yeah, we gotta do some PSAs too

1072
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,180
We are here to help

1073
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:14,980
I don't know if my brain's getting hot now

1074
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,040
Look at the monkey, bunny monkey

1075
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,680
Little red monkey acting so fidgety

1076
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,560
Get out your fiddle and play him a tune

1077
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,820
Dick, very lonesome monkey is he

1078
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,780
That was ghastly!

1079
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,400
Don't think the monkey liked that Bentley

1080
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,560
Seems to be jumpy, acting so fidgety

1081
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,300
You cheer him up, Jimmy, with your euphonium

1082
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,400
Little red monkey, cute as can be

1083
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,320
I was in logic class

1084
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:09,280
And, uh, they were using this example of like, uh, you know, a statement that is contradictory

1085
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:16,860
Like, oh, this president is, uh, a lot, you know, some presidents are alive, some presidents are dead

1086
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,000
Therefore, some presidents are both alive and dead

1087
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,420
And they said, well, that's obviously not true

1088
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,080
So I said, what about Reagan?

1089
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,160
Reagan's retarded

1090
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,020
Both alive and dead

1091
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,440
There's your original silly jism if you want to talk about creating a new race of humans

1092
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,200
Reagan!

1093
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,140
Right there, there's your original silly jism

1094
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:36,980
Is Ronald Reagan created from, uh, the first, uh, what do they call that, putty?

1095
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:41,420
Ronald Reagan was a cowboy, he was a president, now he's crazy

1096
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,180
Donovan's body, they called him

1097
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:44,540
Yeah

1098
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:51,460
The brain was kept elsewhere and was not used in, uh, political decisions at all

1099
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,660
But was more of a sex toy for Nancy

1100
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,720
Oh

1101
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,100
Look at those lights down there

1102
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,800
Would you go with me?

1103
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,340
They're pretty

1104
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,440
They're so beautiful

1105
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:01,880
No

1106
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,200
Sparkly and shiny

1107
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,100
Little people

1108
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,320
You know, I had all the laws of man and God

1109
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,560
All the different colors

1110
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,240
There may be an entirely new set of laws, Jim, that we know nothing about

1111
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,980
Come out and say what you mean

1112
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,600
I'm only guessing

1113
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,000
Someone sing in my yard

1114
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,480
Someone sing in my yard

1115
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,380
Come by, uh

1116
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,760
Someone sing in my yard

1117
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,300
Come by, uh

1118
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,580
Oh, Lord, come by, uh

1119
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,440
Come by, uh

1120
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:44,300
Is th-th-th-th-th-this th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-stuttering our

1121
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,280
Slag?

1122
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,520
So to you, my child, let me in

1123
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,500
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here

1124
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,180
Ever here, ever here

1125
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,220
Come close and now

1126
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,700
Come close and, Jim

1127
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,500
Yeah, sit around

1128
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,980
Sit around my feet

1129
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,580
I had enough of the Bible when I was a kid

1130
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,340
That's where the signals were coming from

1131
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,160
From the bottom of my feet

1132
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,580
Awesome

1133
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:22,940
Well, that's sound

1134
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,280
Let's order pizza

1135
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:25,740
A what?

1136
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:26,640
A pizza

1137
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,680
A what?

1138
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,500
A pizza

1139
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:33,800
You know, round flat dough with tomatoes and toppings and cheese

1140
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,180
I know what a pizza is

1141
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,080
Well, how fabulous for you, darling

1142
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,160
Because I could use a little mortal pleasure

1143
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,120
You know, sex

1144
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,200
I don't get it

1145
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,580
Oh, come on

1146
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,520
I've seen a number of your porno movies

1147
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,340
And I've noticed that the pizza men tend to be rather

1148
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,380
Well hung and quite over-sexed

1149
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,080
You know, getting

1150
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:58,400
Gatorской

1151
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,260
Well, you know

1152
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,260
You see what I say

1153
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,460
I have an idea

1154
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:06,460


1155
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:07,780
It's not giving me the time

1156
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:08,180
We spare the besttery

1157
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,040
No write-up

1158
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,040


1159
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,660
Then by the point

1160
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:10,920
A general

1161
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,220
Ascension

1162
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,220
Not a grave

1163
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:15,400
Moral

1164
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,020
Don't talk about the war

1165
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,040
Get away from me

1166
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:19,040


1167
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,460
Get away from me

1168
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,140
Excuse me sir, there's a call for you.

1169
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,780
Hello, Becky, it's your time!

1170
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,420
Zack, I got a sporting event laid out for this Saturday.

1171
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,120
A fire eater named, uh, Philo.

1172
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,740
Philo, never heard of him.

1173
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,400
Lions and tigers and bears!

1174
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,580
Bob, you there?

1175
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,700
Philo, you there?

1176
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,240
Dave?

1177
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,420
Philo, are you making the, for the excrement for the baklava?

1178
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,100
Philo doll, you there?

1179
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,760
Did you know that, Reverend Howell, compared to slack nirvana,

1180
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,100
it's like having your eyeballs slowly gouged out with a carrot peeler while receiving electroshock?

1181
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,060
I know, man, it's so difficult to tell and explain to these people,

1182
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,420
because most humans, or normals as we call them,

1183
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,300
cannot conceive of experiences lying outside the ranges,

1184
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,260
set, apparently etched in brass, by their own nervous system.

1185
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,500
It just amazes me.

1186
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,080
Ten hours spent basking in the sun,

1187
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,160
in the white light of the ultimate,

1188
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,460
is like ants crawling up your nose and burrowing deep in your sinuses

1189
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,340
while you're dying of thirst in the desert.

1190
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,840
In relation to an eighth of a second,

1191
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,340
an eighth of a millisecond of slack.

1192
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:41,200
We cannot do because it lies outside of our experiential base in this universe.

1193
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:46,200
But by imagining that there can be such a thing as a new color,

1194
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,820
Now, do you think it's possible for normals to know they have slack?

1195
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,260
One has, essentially,

1196
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,680
performed a leap of faith,

1197
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,180
and this act of faith itself is sufficient.

1198
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,640
Or do you have to realize slack before you can know slack,

1199
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,220
even your own innate potential latent slack?

1200
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,740
You notice it gradually, don't you?

1201
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,360
This is the way it came for me.

1202
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,840
You learn to surf on the luck plane,

1203
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,520
to be an art bum,

1204
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,280
not to have a job and somehow to get by,

1205
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,180
to understand in all things,

1206
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,200
Well, don't forget the working,

1207
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:22,040
the power of working a mindless job for years and years just to pay your...

1208
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:22,240
Five, five years, I've got to get my money back.

1209
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,580
This is the happy warrior.

1210
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,060
This is he.

1211
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:25,800
Give me a hundred.

1212
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,400
That's me.

1213
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,220
And every man in arms.

1214
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,180
For me, I took the other path.

1215
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:35,640
I had to work for the conspiracy because my art was one which couldn't be expressed through normal...

1216
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,740
Well, what may burrow in from within,

1217
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,740
or donkey down from renown,

1218
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,720
in order simply to gain the respect of the conspiracies unwinding agents?

1219
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,100
Yes, we had to trickle down as opposed to bubble up and meet in the middle,

1220
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,980
where we've performed our gap analysis only to find that we were...

1221
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,120
Your so-called superiors in the hierarchy...

1222
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:52,420
...wanting.

1223
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,020
...wanting.

1224
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,340
I bring in a camera and I want to borrow some money on that...

1225
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,180
Be of good cheer.

1226
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:56,840
Your so-called boss is not worth the...

1227
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,480
Well, we'll let you...

1228
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,040
If you bring your camera in, we'll let you borrow the money...

1229
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:01,060
...the simple honor...

1230
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:01,800
...the toe of your shoes.

1231
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:01,980
...the simple honor...

1232
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,860
...while we use the camera to take pictures of you...

1233
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:03,860


1234
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,140
...you are indeed his...

1235
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:05,440
...the simple honor...

1236
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,280
...in a compromising position.

1237
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:06,480
...in a compromising position.

1238
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,140
...because you are that elusive being...

1239
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,380
...then we'll hold the camera and the pictures...

1240
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,480
...a sub-genius.

1241
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,880
...ransomed while you pay us more money...

1242
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,420
But you might ask...

1243
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,220
...not to distribute...

1244
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,120
...but you might ask...

1245
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,820
...to your family and loved ones.

1246
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:19,100
...to your family and loved ones.

1247
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:19,100


1248
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:19,620
...to your family and loved ones.

1249
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,340
The answer is incredibly simple.

1250
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,840
I'm sorry we put these tight deadlines on you like that, but...

1251
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,300
...unfortunately, that's the way we are.

1252
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:28,640
...a sub-genius owes what for work.

1253
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,780
...a sub-genius...

1254
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,660
Don't try your crying.

1255
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:31,000
...a sub-genius...

1256
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,980
Your crying doesn't work on me.

1257
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:35,400
...therefore, let us pause and parse...

1258
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,700
Okay, well, you gave her the slack that I wouldn't give her.

1259
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,080
...the word sub-genius itself.

1260
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,520
Thank you.

1261
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,940
The first syllable is the common prefix sub.

1262
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:44,120
India is divided among Hindus, Sikhs, Mohammedan, and Jain.

1263
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,320
This is commonly used...

1264
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:45,320


1265
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,200
...picturing God, man, and the universe...

1266
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:47,280
...picturing God, man, and the universe...

1267
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,360
...just as a submarine...

1268
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,620
As these are very...

1269
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,280
...goes beneath the surface of the water.

1270
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:51,540
...goes beneath the surface of the water.

1271
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:51,580
Yep.

1272
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:51,780
Hello?

1273
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,160
And to be sub-human...

1274
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:53,560
I had a question.

1275
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,720
...or sub-normal...

1276
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,820
...is commonly considered a defect.

1277
00:48:59,060 --> 00:48:59,340
Is it true?

1278
00:48:59,340 --> 00:48:59,720
...is commonly considered a defect.

1279
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,980
You know, I'm trying to explain something here, and you're interrupting me, but what

1280
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:03,300
is it?

1281
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:03,580
Is it true?

1282
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,140
Your name...

1283
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:04,320
What?

1284
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,040
...is Steve Wilcox, and you're a pedophile from St. Louis.

1285
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,180
You're entirely wrong.

1286
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,180
That's not my name.

1287
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,240
I've never been anywhere near St. Louis, and I thank you not too...

1288
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,860
Pedophile from St. Louis.

1289
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,780
Steve Wilcox.

1290
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,020
Newsflash.

1291
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:21,980
KPFA.

1292
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,460
Oh my God.

1293
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,240
KPFA?

1294
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,180
Someone made the connection.

1295
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,400
Thank you very much.

1296
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,560
What?

1297
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,420
But you say pedophile as if it's a bad thing.

1298
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,140
This is how rumors get started.

1299
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,040
Well.

1300
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,440
But I like this one.

1301
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,000
What about Fred Wilcox?

1302
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,700
What about poor old Fred Wilcox?

1303
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,380
Come on, let's make fun of pedophiles.

1304
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:57,260
Well, I was just trying to explain what the word subgenius meant.

1305
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,520
Well, same thing, right?

1306
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,280
It's real.

1307
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,480
First they say you can't get married.

1308
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,760
Then they say you can't be a pedophile.

1309
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,560
There is that sense, of course.

1310
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,060
And it is a very real sense.

1311
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,420
And we will come to that in time.

1312
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,900
Well, when I joined up, they told me.

1313
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,100
That you would have knowledge of those.

1314
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,000
Okay, where's that Steve Wilcox guy?

1315
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,780
We want him to call back right now.

1316
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,120
There was a youth corps.

1317
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,920
A youth corps of subgenius youth.

1318
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,340
We want you to call back right now.

1319
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,480
I've met some of them.

1320
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:30,060
And they are the brightest, most well-scrubbed, shining faces in the rising generation.

1321
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:37,880
They are 100% true blue Americans whose red blood pulsates in them through the marching rhythms of John Phillips.

1322
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,880
Let's not make fun of pedophiles.

1323
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,540
I'm not making fun of them.

1324
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,220
We won't do it anymore.

1325
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:41,640
I'm saying.

1326
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:47,680
That to be a, well, you know, it is getting perilously close to the end of our program.

1327
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:52,800
And perhaps we should leave these distinctions in the theoretical murk in which they are temporarily enshrined.

1328
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,740
Yes, we must make the transition back to normalcy.

1329
00:50:54,740 --> 00:51:02,720
And no longer pick over what a while earlier in a less normal time slot seemed to be wholesome provender.

1330
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:03,900
I agree with that.

1331
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,460
But I only wanted to finish saying what the word subgenius meant.

1332
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,620
And I explained the sub part.

1333
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,820
Now I've got to explain the genius.

1334
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:18,980
You see, everybody thinks that subgenius has something to do with intelligence or stupidity.

1335
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,200
And, of course, it has nothing to do with intelligence and very little to do with stupidity.

1336
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:32,740
But what the word genius means in this context is not the measure of intelligence or a supernormal intelligence.

1337
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:42,240
Instead, it means a spirit, as in genius loci or the genie who emerges from the lamp of the Arabian Nights.

1338
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:42,420
Yes.

1339
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:51,340
An elemental force, which is a directing and guiding intelligence in our universe.

1340
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,960
And a subgenius is under his own genius.

1341
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:06,020
Not under the direction of the conspiracy, the opposing force, which wants the prototypical subgenius to work for a living.

1342
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:10,540
And with the money, an illusion widely subscribed to.

1343
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,620
Purchase.

1344
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,180
Not.

1345
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,820
True slack, which a subgenius seeks as his birthright.

1346
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,760
But false slack.

1347
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,820
Manufactured by the conspiracy.

1348
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:27,340
Yes, the conspiracy wants him to work in a dead-end job to purchase the false slack, which will not produce true slack.

1349
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:35,380
For with the purchase of every tchotchke, palm pilot, and iPod, true satisfaction still darts away.

1350
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:41,600
Just beyond the reaching, questing fingertips as the grapes offered Tantalus.

1351
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,220
The reaching, questing fingertips.

1352
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,660
In the underworld could never be grasped.

1353
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:53,500
And unless you want to remain a sufferer, just like poor old Tantalus, you have to drop what you're doing and become a subgenius and join us.

1354
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,160
Surf the luck plane.

1355
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,900
Be an art body.

1356
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,120
Quit your job for Bob.

1357
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,960
Mooch off the world.

1358
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,100
Yes, it does owe you a living.

1359
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,720
And we can offer many varieties of proof.

1360
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:07,860
Write and contact us now.

1361
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,580
The address of our cult is still...

1362
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:16,340
All the same, the old address that has been for many years in Dallas, Texas.

1363
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,560
And what was that address again?

1364
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:24,480
That address which is known throughout the land by far and wide.

1365
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:32,900
www.subgenius.com is your best and most readily accessible source for all of the contact information.

1366
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,160
Let it echo wild and free.

1367
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:41,560
And for those of you named Steve Wilcox out there who are from St. Louis, I'd like to apologize for accusing you of...

1368
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,940
I know, that was a gag. I hope you understand.

1369
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,680
I mean, not to be taken seriously.

1370
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,520
So, any of you other Steve Wilcoxes of which get confused with the other one true Steve Wilcox...

1371
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,300
A true Steve Wilcox would never get confused.

1372
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,060
...can understand that that was just a joke.

1373
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,540
And they don't have to hold it against me later when they have that big whip in their hand.

1374
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:06,220
Did you see that cool car that was parked outside that Don got?

1375
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,820
Man, that's a real luxury vehicle.

1376
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,260
It is a luxury vehicle.

1377
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:10,760
A giant...

1378
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,020
A giant...

1379
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:11,560
A giant...

1380
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:11,560


1381
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,540
It's a Chevrolet.

1382
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:12,980
It's a bubble dome.

1383
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,860
It's a GM product, isn't it?

1384
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,000
Yeah, the tractor treads.

1385
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,980
That would give you an incredible purchase in any road condition.

1386
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:21,540
No kidding.

1387
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,820
You could drive over the bodies of...

1388
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,480
Eight wheels on that thing.

1389
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,040
...people with that.

1390
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:26,880
Really remarkable.

1391
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,940
Crushing skulls, much like in the Terminator.

1392
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:29,780
It must weigh a couple of tons.

1393
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,600
And it seems to have an antenna.

1394
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:35,740
There must be a satellite, a TV hookup, a hot tub, a salon.

1395
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,300
Yeah, and a barometric pressure reliever.

1396
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,540
The hyperbaric...

1397
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,040
...chamber.

1398
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:46,780
I heard that it's so large on the inside that it can actually...

1399
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,500
...has its own weather patterns.

1400
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,720
Oh, web patterns.

1401
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,720
Weather patterns.

1402
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:52,280
Weather patterns.

1403
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,440
Storms, clouds.

1404
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:54,680
Like the Pantheon.

1405
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,180
Right.

1406
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:59,560
A tiny hole is in the roof, but no rain ever manages to wet the inhabitants

1407
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:06,180
because it evaporates in its long fall from the roof to the interior of the car.

1408
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,200
And look at this.

1409
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,900
Of the Astrodome.

1410
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,360
Rich Corinthian leather.

1411
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,880
That's knock-a-high.

1412
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:10,940
Stained.

1413
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,460
It's a doleful red.

1414
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,200
No, I believe this is actually leather.

1415
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,900
What was that other kind of leather called?

1416
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:17,780
The fake leather?

1417
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:18,240
It was...

1418
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,060
You had knock-a-high.

1419
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,100
That was a different car.

1420
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:24,660
He was actually offered several cars, but this is the beauty that he finally chose.

1421
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,700
This is the nice swinging car.

1422
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:29,480
This is the one that has the fringe that goes all the way around

1423
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,120
and the little doggy head in the back that bobs up and down

1424
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,260
with the lights go on when he hits the brakes.

1425
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,300
And so forth.

1426
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,440
Yeah, with the fringe.

1427
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:40,920
And even though we're...

1428
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,720
We're members of a club that uses knives in film,

1429
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,420
we try not to at every opportunity.

1430
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:52,160
Our knife-slashing propensities are only used in the cause of peace,

1431
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,340
harmony, and world understanding.

1432
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:59,200
In every subgenius soul, there still lurks the mindless primitive.

1433
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,840
But just because we enjoy gorilla suit movies

1434
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,400
doesn't mean we don't appreciate your basic animal nature.

1435
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,120
And as Philo says, there will be gambling in the tents.

1436
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,980
In the Lord's tent, we will gamble and frisk

1437
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,040
as we bask in the divine effulgence.

1438
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,160
Well, it's been great broadcasting at you,

1439
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,300
and I have to sign off now because I've got a pie in the oven.

1440
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,240
Otherwise, if these nosebleeds didn't keep me out of my diet,

1441
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,800
I'd be here broadcasting 24 hours a day.

1442
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,440
You can take that one to the bank.

1443
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,080
And I'm going to have to eat that.

1444
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,200
So, Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships,

1445
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,800
see, I'd just like to say it's been fine and done.

1446
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,120
It's a pin-sized digital recorder that you'll need for the next show.

1447
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,400
Don't let any...

1448
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:44,100
A right-sized, sawed-off, kin-pot dictator tell you what to do

1449
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,740
because you're an American, a citizen of the United States

1450
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:51,840
with the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of a total imbecile.

1451
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,780
We interrupt this program to end it.

1452
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,940
It's the only way.

1453
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,020
It's been a puzzling evidence show,

1454
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,920
and I say goodnight.

1455
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:11,200
Goodnight, Hal.

1456
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,980
Goodnight, my friend.

1457
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,260
Say goodnight, Philo.

1458
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:19,740
Goodnight, Berkeley and Northern California and the world.

1459
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,160
I'm not going to say goodnight.

1460
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,420
Goodnight.

1461
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,380
And goodnight from Cleveland.

1462
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:44,840
And that, what we've been hearing there was from KPFA and Berkeley.

1463
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,340
I'm from WCSB in Cleveland.

1464
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,100
And this has been the Hour of Slack.

1465
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:58,400
And if you must know more, then you can see www.subgenius.com

1466
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:05,800
or hear Post Office Box 204206, Austin, Texas, 787204206.

1467
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,060
www.subgenius.com.

1468
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,220
Or you can come see this band heard in the background.

1469
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,120
The Amino Acids.

1470
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,820
Actually, this is just one of the Amino Acids, I think.

1471
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:22,300
Reverend Angry Larry, Automatic Robot Fish

1472
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,000
at the next Subgenius Devital,

1473
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,760
which happens to be in Cleveland.

1474
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:30,280
Convenient to yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1475
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,540
At the Beachland Ballroom on the east side.

1476
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,560
May 22nd.

1477
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,320
With Mann Incorporated.

1478
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,780
The Amino Acids.

1479
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,100
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1480
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,980
Yours truly.

1481
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,560
And if you're lucky, Princess, we might be there.

1482
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:56,820
Oh, Jim, didn't he love it too?

1483
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,400
I got it right.

1484
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,280
If you listen, he'll talk to you.

1485
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:05,420
He will chatter the whole day through.

1486
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:05,940
Oh.

1487
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:19,380
Now he's a snappy, happy monkey, little red monkey,

1488
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,660
acting so merrily.

1489
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,920
Gee, how we like this little red monkey,

1490
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,940
very cuddlesome monkey, is he?

1491
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,940
Little red monkey.

1492
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,020
Little red monkey.

1493
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,740
Won't you stay to tea?

1494
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,380
He said yes.
