1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, yes, dear friends, this is your dear friend and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang, and

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,280
you're listening to a recording of me in my sick bed.

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:25,740
My stomach hurts real, real, real bad, and I'm sorry I have to do this little introduction

4
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,640
by tape.

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:35,440
I wish I could be there tonight rather than wrapped around my own stomach muscles in spasms

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,800
of virus-induced pain.

7
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,480
And yes, you may pray for me if you want.

8
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,920
But anyway, back to the matter at hand here.

9
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:56,100
Earlier this week, I saw this full-page ad in the back of the magazine, Mondo Gag Me

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,580
With It.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,680
It was an ad for a new Bob Dobbs album.

12
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,100
What a surprise, especially to me.

13
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:16,040
And this groovy ad was for a CD called Bob's Media Ecology, which was described as, quote,

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,600
a transmutation of pop culture sounds and the almighty spoken word as assembled for

15
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,620
media guru Bob Dobbs radio broadcast between 1980...

16
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,620
and 1991.

17
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,060
Bob will update your consciousness on the control which the mythic governments exercise

18
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:41,240
over our lives and prescribes much-needed antidotes to overcoming these powerful forces.

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,180
Well, well, well, I thought.

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,380
Some nerve.

21
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,280
Who could be doing this?

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,760
It said the album came from Toronto.

23
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,380
I thought.

24
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,520
Maybe.

25
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,640
It couldn't be.

26
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,280
He wouldn't rip us off like that.

27
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:07,160
See, there's this guy in Toronto, Bob Dean, who's been doing this weird talk show for

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,060
a few years, not as long as we have.

29
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,040
And he likes to say he's Bob Dobbs.

30
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,720
He actually came through town here some years back, and he seemed like a nice guy.

31
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,460
His rants from his show were pretty good.

32
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,380
I've played bits of them on my show.

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,500
Although, certainly, they weren't anything like most of the other shows I've been on.

34
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:25,500


35
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:25,500


36
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,800
You could hear Bob's voice, and I was wondering why he kept insisting on using Bob's name.

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,020
I've always wondered why he kept insisting on using Bob's name.

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,260
Because he didn't really sound much like the way Bob would talk.

39
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,280
But I figured, no way would a nice guy like that start selling an album of his own made

40
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,200
to look like a subgenius album, making money off Bob's name and all the hard work that

41
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,100
we've done without even telling us.

42
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,500
I mean, only a real conspiracy glorified.

43
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:55,500


44
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:55,500


45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,980
I mean, only a real hypocrite of a new age, pink, would do something like that.

46
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,680
And then yesterday, in the mail, we got a press packet including the album.

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
It looked like the kind of packet they'd send to all radio stations.

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,120
There wasn't a letter in it.

49
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,860
And I finally listened to it.

50
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:23,060
And I did get physically sick, which is one reason why I'm not at the station tonight.

51
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,820
But what a relief.

52
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,480
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,560
But when I realized it wasn't Bob Dean at all.

54
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,180
It was me.

55
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,660
It was an old tape of mine.

56
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,720
This album, Bob's Media Ecology, being sold by this Toronto group as if it was a tape

57
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,660
of Bob, is nothing but an old tape I made one night, all by myself, in about three hours.

58
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,480
A long time ago.

59
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,740
It was just something I whipped out.

60
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,940
I wrote up some rants and composed and recorded a little music.

61
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,460
And kind of threw it all together.

62
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:55,460


63
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:55,460


64
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,240
on my cheap equipment. I mean it was really a one-man job and certainly

65
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:05,300
nothing I'd want to brag about and wouldn't normally play on the show. I

66
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:11,620
mean I was young then and and dumb and well in those days I would actually

67
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,940
pretend to be Bob. I know only an idiot would do that would be egomaniacal

68
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,940
enough to think that they could actually speak for Bob but I did so I did this

69
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,880
little tape called Bob's Media Ecology. Now why these Canadians would want to

70
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,380
confuse the issue by releasing that thing I don't know and on top of that

71
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,320
they're not paying me any royalties or any to butt naked either because

72
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:46,720
there's a pretty sad remake of one of his songs on here too and he says they

73
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,860
didn't ask him about that either. So rather than have you our beloved

74
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,920
audience see this tape, I want you to see this tape and I want you to see this tape.

75
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:09,080
Fly over this to you and tell me in the comments in case what I should decide

76
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,280
about by putting that tape into something else but let me let you guys

77
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,860
know about my personal choice today so yeah I'll fly over to your wife or

78
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,780
baby and I'm gonna try some noise profuso back in a minute.

79
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:13,780


80
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:13,780


81
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:13,780


82
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:23,900
If I don't apologize for the sobs that I got you you know you know we're already

83
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,560
of why you don't pretend to be Bob.

84
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,000
Well, I sound sort of Bob-like in this.

85
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,260
If Bob was smart instead of lucky,

86
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,920
and if he was a trendy, over-educated pink boy

87
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,420
using his parents' money,

88
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,140
and if he wasn't particularly funny,

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,780
but just sort of smug.

90
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,120
So, it's like the smug, intellectual,

91
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,940
know-it-all show-off Bob.

92
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,140
It's more or less the right message,

93
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,720
Slack.

94
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,320
But I guess, you know, in those days,

95
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,220
I was trying to impress the wrong audience,

96
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,660
the rich, trendy, mondo-2000-reading pinks.

97
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,780
And of course, soon after I did this album,

98
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,160
I realized that the true subgeniuses

99
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,260
needed Slack a lot more than gutless college boys did.

100
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:10,800
I don't know.

101
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,960
I guess I was just using Bob's name,

102
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,160
because, well, because he was already famous,

103
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,460
and I wasn't.

104
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,760
Besides, in those days, I was fool enough

105
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,820
and egotistical,

106
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,520
and dishonest enough

107
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,580
to think I really could put words in Bob's mouth.

108
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,980
So, I'm ashamed, dear friends,

109
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,560
but now that this fashionable,

110
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,420
trendy thing is being advertised,

111
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm going to go ahead and play it anyway

112
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,820
to ensure that you don't accidentally spend

113
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,600
your hard-earned money on it

114
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,400
thinking you're getting a real subgenius album.

115
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,420
I don't know. Maybe we shouldn't rub it in.

116
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,100
Maybe these Canadians haven't heard about The Curse.

117
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,640
The Curse of those who try to make money off of Dobbs.

118
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,160
Well, it hadn't affected us,

119
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,660
but it seems to hit everybody else

120
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,860
who does stuff like this.

121
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
So anyway, this, what you're about to hear

122
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,660
is Reverend Ivan Stang's early unfinished attempt

123
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,020
at a subgenius album.

124
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,040
Thank you.

125
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,320
Thank you.

126
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,160
Thank you.

127
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,180
On your current cable today,

128
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,800
we have a subgenius album.

129
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:22,800


130
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:22,800


131
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:22,800


132
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,500
We have a song entitled...

133
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,260
Everything's basically disappeared.

134
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,820
On your current cable today,

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,260
we have a song entitled...

136
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:39,500
On your current cable today,

137
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,820
we have a song entitled...

138
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,960
Everybody change.

139
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,700
We'll start...

140
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:52,800
We'll start...

141
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,640
We'll start...

142
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,160
We'll start...

143
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,000
We'll start...

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000


145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,840
We have a song entitled...

146
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,560
We have a song entitled...

147
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,280
Everything's basically disappeared.

148
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:41,040
I warned him it's going to create a separation, create a Berlin Wall in the family.

149
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,720
It's going to make my sister become a different kind of person.

150
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,200
It's going to make me become a different kind of person.

151
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,300
I'll lose my interest in hockey.

152
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,900
I'll get into drugs.

153
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,680
I predicted all this when I was 10, but he couldn't understand that.

154
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,420
He didn't believe me.

155
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,420
We'll continue after this.

156
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,300
On the turntable today, we have a song entitled...

157
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,180
Everything's basically disappeared.

158
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,800
Everything's basically disappeared.

159
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,380
Everything's basically disappeared.

160
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,580
Under electric conditions, all kinds of places exist.

161
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,960
We call it nostalgia, but we're just swimming in the sea of information.

162
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,420
Electrically retrieved, electrically present.

163
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,180
It's kind of an eternity, Doug.

164
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,260
It's misnomered in nostalgia.

165
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,960
You're asking me?

166
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,020
Costumes.

167
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,240
Yeah, they think they're in the 50s.

168
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,600
They're wrong.

169
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,080
The 50s do not exist.

170
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,040
The 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, they do not exist.

171
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,960
We never left 1945 and running on the same spot.

172
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,400
We've just been layering information on top of information.

173
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,000
Whoa!

174
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,880
That's acoustic.

175
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,980
Woo-hoo-hoo!

176
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,400
How do you like the baby?

177
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,180
That's acoustic.

178
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,340
That's acoustic.

179
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,700
Oh, Bob.

180
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,140
I love it.

181
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,520
Every minute of it is so wonderful.

182
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,980
That's acoustic.

183
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,980
That's acoustic.

184
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,860
Oh, Bob.

185
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,980
Woo-hoo-hoo!

186
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,360
I love it.

187
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,160
Every minute of it is so wonderful.

188
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,740
Better sound.

189
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,640
Almost ridiculous.

190
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,660
Let's get ready, Bob.

191
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,760
We're down to level five at least now.

192
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,380
Whoa!

193
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,200
That's acoustic.

194
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,300
Man, I'm hot today.

195
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,940
Whoa!

196
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,900
Whoa!

197
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:10,900


198
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:11,380


199
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,400


200
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,400


201
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,400


202
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,400


203
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,400


204
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,400


205
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,400


206
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,800
Whoa!

207
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:13,660
Whoa!

208
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:13,900
Whoa!

209
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,180
Whoa!

210
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,420
Whoa!

211
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,560
Whoa!

212
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:21,320
Whoa!

213
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,260
Whoa!

214
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:22,720
Whoa!

215
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:22,800


216
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:22,800


217
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:22,800


218
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,360
Whoa!

219
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,440
Whoa!

220
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:26,440


221
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:26,440


222
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
We didn't expect exciting piloting here.

223
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,380
That's awesome.

224
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,780
Let's take a three-way road trip.

225
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,600
That's really cool though.

226
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,680
All right.

227
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,600
You bet we did great.

228
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,000
How do you like the Plume?

229
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,460
Oh!

230
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,680
Oh!

231
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,460
Yeah, I do.

232
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:47,740


233
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:47,740


234
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,080
It's a dream job.

235
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,480
Oh!

236
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,460
Oh!

237
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,200
Wow!

238
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,200


239
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,660
I'm really lucky.

240
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:50,660


241
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,900
There we go.

242
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,800
Myself, my pretty baby.

243
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:52,800


244
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,940
That's acoustic.

245
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,880
Man, I'm hot today.

246
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,000
That's acoustic.

247
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,740
We're coming into week 10 or so.

248
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,320
Let's get ready.

249
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,840
We're at five at least now.

250
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,640
Of course, that's why in this period after World War II,

251
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,480
we have nothing but retrievals of these things.

252
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,700
But they are clichés made new.

253
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,880
That's our job.

254
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,820
I mean, nothing is new under the sun,

255
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,960
but there's nothing old under the sun now.

256
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,600
1985 is the year of the 40th...

257
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:44,820
Bobby.

258
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,260
Bobby.

259
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,740
Bobby.

260
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:48,780
Bobby.

261
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,580
Bobby.

262
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,300
Bobby.

263
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,040
I'd like to...

264
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,640
Tiddly.

265
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,560
The nerves there.

266
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,100
I'd like to...

267
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,680
Tiddly.

268
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,580
The nerves there.

269
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,860
The electric nerves are responding right now

270
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,260
and tell them that I'd like to go into a little talk.

271
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,580
Why use the word, Bob?

272
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,760
Well, first of all, it's not a word.

273
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,860
Why use the word, Bob?

274
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,060
Well, first of all, it's not a word.

275
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,380
Only when you use your mouth

276
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,780
does it sound like a word.

277
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,100
Like a word.

278
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,940
Like a verbal medium.

279
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,080
Spoken language.

280
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,720
There are many other languages.

281
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,140
Many other environments,

282
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,360
linguistic and grammatic characteristics.

283
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,700
I'd like to stress the electric language.

284
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,300
I'd like to stress the electric language.

285
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,360
Because that is the language we're involved in right now.

286
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,340
Electricity is a biological event

287
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,540
when telegraphs rise and depart in the 1950s

288
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,400
that pushed man to a new dimension.

289
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,260
So every electric environment system

290
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,140
has been refined to a new dimension.

291
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,540
A biological event

292
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,980
will move into a new biology

293
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,380
we're aware of in time, perhaps.

294
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,500
Okay.

295
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,720
Too many words? Too many words?

296
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,340
No, no.

297
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,180
The words are fine.

298
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,060
The ideas are a bit thick.

299
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:19,980
Okay.

300
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,820
Let's get down to business.

301
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,780
I gotta say something.

302
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,340
I've gotta perform.

303
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,140
Gotta produce.

304
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:24,880
Gotta record.

305
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,900
Gotta sell it.

306
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,100
So anyway.

307
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,240
Hallucinate.

308
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,880
No buses go to Miami.

309
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,200
No buses go to Miami.

310
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,520
Game is a linear visual concept.

311
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,340
There's no ends or middles or betweens

312
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,620
in acoustic space under electric conditions.

313
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,060
That's why no buses...

314
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,360
You're right.

315
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,660
No buses could travel to where you are.

316
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,880
Perfect statement he made.

317
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,120
Yes.

318
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,260
No buses go to his end.

319
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,580
I'm going after the...

320
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,140
Good show to make, Bob.

321
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:25,660
Thanks.

322
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,280
Good energy.

323
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,800
Okay, I got it.

324
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,620
Okay, I got it.

325
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,360
Okay, I got it.

326
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,960
You never heard the show.

327
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,860
You don't know I'm on a political campaign here.

328
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,480
You're on a political campaign?

329
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,260
Yeah, I run the solar government,

330
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,200
but my campaign is to have you find out that that's what's happening.

331
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,540
And then the more you find out that I'm running the show,

332
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,360
then we can implement my policies because you'll be able to match with them.

333
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,300
That's the point.

334
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,100
I already do run the show behind the scenes.

335
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,100
The whole global theater.

336
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,020
Now, this is preposterous to say,

337
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,880
and most people can't believe it,

338
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,580
but it's taken at least three years now to educate a few people

339
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,200
to begin to dimly perceive that's true.

340
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,660
The point is that so many discarnate, super-angelic megalomaniacs

341
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,940
run around thinking they're candidates

342
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,940
that we can't get them to understand, to bow down,

343
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,820
not in a negative way,

344
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,580
but to bow down and acknowledge my agenda,

345
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,200
and we get this media ecology on the road.

346
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,060
My God, Bob, that's pretty crazy.

347
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,120
Yeah, isn't that?

348
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,140
Isn't that startling?

349
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,560
Don't lose your words there.

350
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,340
Well, you know, it's in the gap.

351
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,660
You know that people get attention if they start to stutter,

352
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,820
so I don't mind stuttering occasionally

353
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,120
because it creates a little interval and people listen harder.

354
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,960
Okay, now, my girlfriend's yelling at me in the air right now.

355
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,280
She's asking me, what do you think about the environment?

356
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,880
If you're on a political campaign,

357
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,460
you know, you must have some view on the environment.

358
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,720
Like, really, we're going cliche, Bill, right now.

359
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,720
Yeah, you know what I say about the environment?

360
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,420
Turn it off.

361
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,260
Turn it off.

362
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,200
Yeah, turn it off.

363
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,020
Turn all of it off.

364
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,840
Even those screaming about greenism, eco-fascists,

365
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,340
turn them off.

366
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,040
Turn it all off.

367
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,760
Turn the industrial, turn every environment off.

368
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,040
And you know how you do it?

369
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,100
You turn off TV.

370
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,240
The slowest to a standstill.

371
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,540
Sorry, we're not in touch.

372
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,600
Oh, one minute, Zach.

373
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,520
Yeah, hold on.

374
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,820
Sorry, I just listened to the radio.

375
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,180
Oh, yeah.

376
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,280
That's the only answer.

377
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,280
That's the only answer the study can have today.

378
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,180
But, no, we're talking about TV as the motor mechanism of fashion and war making.

379
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,880
It's an awful thing.

380
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,940
Well, my girlfriend's dead now.

381
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,640
She just killed herself.

382
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,520
Just now?

383
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,560
Yeah, that's what happens.

384
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,620
I used to do that years ago.

385
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,200
Sounds like another performance piece.

386
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,620
Yeah, kill people on the air.

387
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,140
I've done that.

388
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,060
Electricity is a biological event.

389
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,080
When the telegraph arrived as an environment by 1850,

390
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,140
that pushed down man into a new dimension.

391
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,580
So every electric environment since then has been a refinement of frequency modulation

392
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,800
of a biological event moving into a new biology.

393
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,920
We were wearing new apparatus.

394
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,500
You are listening to Radio Prague, Czechoslovakia,

395
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,060
with a 57-minute broadcast to the United States and Canada.

396
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,820
Let's listen to a Moravian folk song now.

397
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,240
A billion people all around the world

398
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,960
are listening to all these things all over again.

399
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,540
Hope you're enjoying the program.

400
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,080
Hope you're enjoying the music.

401
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,240
I'm your accompanist.

402
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,180
Electric, discarnate, merging, interpenetration.

403
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,460
Bob verses that.

404
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,760
He turns it on temporarily.

405
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,640
Media ecology, all right?

406
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,060
Monica.

407
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,420
Just to make us fall asleep again and wake up.

408
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:46,780
And then we can turn it on and we can grab any zone we want and surf and dance.

409
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,660
Bob, is that proper?

410
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,680
We play jazz.

411
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:48,820
We play jazz.

412
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,400
So, are you listening to all these records all over again?

413
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,560
Hope you're enjoying the program as much as I'm enjoying the music and your company.

414
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,320
.

415
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:58,320


416
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,480
.

417
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,140
.

418
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,360
.

419
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:02,360


420
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:02,360


421
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:02,420
.

422
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,560
担当者,

423
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:28,960
قة,

424
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,080
Х shuts off,

425
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,400
перестань,

426
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,920
지지мись!

427
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,660
The oral tradition, the acoustic world of the Greek,

428
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:48,660


429
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:55,520
The basis of his poetic and personal culture was quickly destroyed by literacy, phonetic literacy.

430
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,860
TV is a far greater overkill than any atom bomb.

431
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,580
TV wrecked socialism.

432
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,800
We're now in the post-TV age.

433
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,160
You're free.

434
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,040
You're free.

435
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,380
Of course, that means everybody else is free to run amok over you.

436
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,140
So you gotta be rather paranoid.

437
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,540
TV wrecked socialism.

438
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,920
We're now in the post-TV age.

439
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,520
Socialism is a new world. Here goes.

440
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,540
Be attentive, you.

441
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,900
This is Radio Tirana.

442
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,400
Socialism will come back in the form of Communalism.

443
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,420
In other words, little groups and little mandos.

444
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,200
Socialism is a new world. Here goes.

445
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,140
So you're a socialist yourself?

446
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,360
Uh, yes.

447
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,520
Yeah, so you're having an identity crisis?

448
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,120
You've seen the imminent end of your system?

449
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,360
Uh, well, I see it being discredited by the conspiracy.

450
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,100
What is the conspiracy? There are two kinds, top-down and bottom-up.

451
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,340
Which one would you like to be ex-

452
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,200
Well, top-down, I guess, would be obvious.

453
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,700
Well, no, see, the top-down plays catch-up with the bottom-up effect.

454
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,700
That's always the case.

455
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,840
Socialism was wiped out by television.

456
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,500
Oh, I guess.

457
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,460
You don't believe that?

458
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
Reagan and Thatcher were-

459
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,680
No, no, not the content, the medium itself, the tecto-mesh.

460
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,620
It bypassed the kinetic, moving mosaic of the radio era.

461
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:22,520
In other words, Churchill, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Roosevelt, Oliver Cromwell,

462
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,180
all these characters who ran around in the early part of the 20th century, products of the radio.

463
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,520
Now, fascism and socialism were byproducts through cultural distortion of the same effect of the radio environment.

464
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,060
Now, TV brings in what we call the new left or the new right, right?

465
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,960
The left had its turn in the 60s, the new right in the 80s.

466
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,940
Neither are effective in the long run.

467
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,060
Decentralization means you're free.

468
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,540
You don't need any external sort of governmental force to control your situation now.

469
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:50,940
You're free.

470
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,120
Of course, that means everybody else is free to run amuck over you.

471
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,840
So you've got to be rather paranoid.

472
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,220
And that's why you study the top-down information to see who's running what and pulling the string

473
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:07,460
so that you can be free without getting injections from viral chemical warfare.

474
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,300
You're going to be free.

475
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,100
Of course, that means everybody else is free to run amuck over you.

476
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,400
And that's why we have a new left.

477
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,240
Here goes.

478
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:32,360
TV wrecked. Social wrecked. TV wrecked. Social wrecked. TV wrecked. Social wrecked. TV wrecked. Social wrecked. TV wrecked. Social wrecked. TV wrecked.

479
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:40,220
Michael Jackson's 3LL was saved and everybody was astonished and suffering.

480
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,980
This is Radio Tirana.

481
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,220
Now, when everybody has a fast machine, they can be bureaucrats without the bureaucracy.

482
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,300
Okay?

483
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,440
So...

484
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,300
Total decentralization.

485
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,580
Total decentralization.

486
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,140
What was the last hangover of the bureaucratic phase?

487
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,380
The communist state and the Berlin Wall.

488
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:29,020
So the fax machine was the stimulator of a political revolution in the sense that the Eastern European gang is screaming for democracy, which is a bureaucratic setup.

489
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:29,700
All right?

490
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:39,040
And they saw from the effect of the fax machines the image of the end of bureaucracy, yet their solution is another bureaucracy, but a participatory bureaucracy.

491
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:39,400
Right?

492
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:39,840
And democracy is a democracy called democracy.

493
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,060
So, you know, we could say anything.

494
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,220
Dogma changes every 15 seconds here, right?

495
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:57,840
Bob?

496
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,260
Is that top down or bottom up?

497
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,240
The kids, the TV generation in the second world.

498
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:14,060
you know europe and the socialist communist world eastern europe uh those kids the tv kids

499
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:22,120
they are replaying what we and you did in the 60s yeah which was to scream we want it all and we

500
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:30,920
want it now but the problem is we except me and they at the time back then and now they have no

501
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:39,620
idea how to get it right because they don't exist anymore they already have ended the revolutions

502
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:46,240
over there they are sitting on a garbage dump and they don't know how to move in other words

503
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,300
they're dimly becoming aware of the discarnate state which uh was a replay of the 70s the 70s

504
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:58,520
was the baby boom generations bland out realizing that they wanted it all wanted it now but had no

505
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,900
inkling of how to get it because you can't

506
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:06,760
get something that isn't there therefore the rear view mirror images left for uh obsessive

507
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,500
consumerism consider obsessive shopping is a military operation

508
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,240
consumer shopping

509
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,080
consumer

510
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,660
consumer

511
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:56,700
we do not know how it's playing the sound but

512
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,800
one two three two

513
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:01,920

00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:41,820


539
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:41,820


540
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:41,820


541
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,820
did you forget

542
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:43,820


543
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,340
that everyone

544
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:46,440
standing

545
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:46,660
up

546
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:46,660


547
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:46,660


548
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:46,660


549
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,620
doing

550
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:03,240
so media ecology is the slogan and what it is it's not just private uh say boycotting of watching

551
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,560
your own tv is demanding your politicians to deal with this one issue it's become monomaniacal about

552
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:18,420
media ecology not about the nature oil uh high prices whatever issue is normally filtered in

553
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:23,960
the content of news right right you have to ignore everything and we have we can massively educate

554
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,440
the public to engage in that sloganeering if they understood the stakes breakdown it's breakdown

555
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:46,560
welcome to the international connection this is the electrified voice of bob marshall

556
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,260
today we feature an interesting

557
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,860
pattern from may brussels first under the category of the biography with missing facts

558
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:58,940
may point out the parallels in the careers of three actors evita perron ronald reagan and pope

559
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:04,820
john paul ii especially in the years during and just after the second world war according to a

560
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,980
book on evita by paul montgomery she was the quote creation of fascism that spread of the

561
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:15,720
totalitarian infection that spread from germany and italy in the 1930s unquote before her husband

562
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,740
juan perron became president of argentina

563
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:25,160
was that country's ambassador to rome evita then ruled argentina with her husband from 1945 to 1952

564
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,920
during that period having risen from poverty herself she played the dual role of helping

565
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,860
the poor and the labor union while privately accumulating great wealth with the help of

566
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,900
nazi advisors from germany including martin bohrman whom it is alleged to smuggle into argentina

567
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,900
when she died in 1952 she left huge sums in many accounts in switzerland which money according to

568
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,400
may brussels was released gradually by our nazi country and the government was able to get her to the

569
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:54,160
state of canada and to build up the post-war nazi international around otto scorsini until 1973

570
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:00,120
when 800 million dollars in evita swiss accounts was liquidated which caused wild swings on the

571
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:07,080
international gold market furthermore a new book published in 1984 by paul hoffman revealed more

572
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,440
details about the vatican's connections to spy money the cia nixon and the nazis in a project

573
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:18,380
codenamed operation eva and may brussel points out that evo is another name that evita perron was a

574
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,280
known by as she pushed her homeland a country that was much like the united states in the 1920s

575
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:28,420
into the arms of the fourth right meanwhile another actor who did not suffer during the war

576
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:35,260
was pope john paul ii as carol he was a worker in the salve chemical plant near oswich during

577
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:41,560
the nazi occupation of poland and because he had a job in official work he was protected from roundup

578
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,860
and even permitted to walk through the city after curfew according to the book the pope from poland

579
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,360
by mr karolak on the national television network he was a member of the national television network

580
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,440
the day before the major gestapo raid on the quarry owned by salve carol atila was transferred

581
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:00,020
to the factory which probably saved his life during the german occupation from 1942 to 1945

582
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,340
carol was able to start up and perform in the theater attended only by germans and at a time

583
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:10,820
when any other theater activity was illegal after the war he goes to rome and becomes a protege of

584
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:16,780
pope paul vi who has secretary of state for the vatican helped organize the rat line to enable

585
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,760
the state to62 in the name of pope paul ii who was the governor of south america his understudy pope

586
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:26,700
john paul ii then enters the world stage in the 1980s as a man's loving peace a champion of the

587
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,760
poor and obviously warm in front of the public like evita perron and ronald reagan but never

588
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,500
forgetting his hidden past connections to the nazis as is shown by his appointment of his former

589
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,460
employer the man who ran ig farben and hitler's major banks during the second world war german

590
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,380
ad to be in charge of vatican bank in 1982.

591
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,360
in spite of protests by jews over this appointment pope paul ii was in charge of the vatican bank in 1982.

592
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:53,660
Hermanaz is still in charge today. Another great actor of our time, Ronald

593
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,760
Reagan, also performed suspicious activities during World War II. According

594
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,740
to the book Where's the Rest of Me by Reagan and Richard Hubler, Reagan

595
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,100
collaborated with the OSS, who had obtained plans for the Nazi rocket

596
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:10,060
launchers at Pinamanda and the US Army, who built an exact replica of Pinamanda

597
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:15,480
in Florida and then bombed it while Reagan's group filmed it. This fact leads

598
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,560
me to ask, what were those films for? If they subsequently bombed the real

599
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,420
Pinamanda, he could have filmed that. However, to continue, after the war, Reagan

600
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,640
left the Defense Department as a captain and became absorbed in anti-communist

601
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,400
activities in association with Scherzer, Hoover, Senator Joseph McCarthy and

602
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,760
Richard Nixon. But according to a book by Donald Freed called The Secret Life of

603
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,400
Ronald Reagan, he kept these connections secret and joined the left-leaning

604
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,140
anti-fascist Green Actors Guild as a cover while working with the right. This

605
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,460
action was a great success.

606
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,040
Reagan's work was identical with Davidi Perron's image during the same years,

607
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:52,100
ostensibly helping the poor and the Union, but really strengthening their Nazi

608
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,680
ties. This is Reagan being on the board of Young Americans for Freedom and

609
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,700
organizing Democrats for Nixon in 1960.

610
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,780
So to tie the three careers together, to illustrate how they played roles to suck

611
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,480
the masses in and that their public policies are not conservative but fascist,

612
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,120
Nate Russell points to Reagan's new relationship with the Vatican. President

613
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,040
Reagan has established diplomatic recognition of Pope John Paul II's church,

614
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,380
the first time in over a century, with the appointment of Archbishop

615
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:23,100
Pio Laghi as the Vatican's ambassador to the United States. Pio Laghi, having

616
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,740
formerly been ambassador to Argentina during the period when its military junta

617
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:31,400
murdered thousands of dissidents. This junta was propped up by Nazis and their

618
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,080
billions of dollars originally released from Evita Perron's Swiss bank accounts,

619
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,820
whose coffers were filled during her husband's regime. He having been ambassador to Rome,

620
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,600
with strong connections to his church, who helped the Nazis escape to Argentina and whose own

621
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,240
bank is now run by Hitler's former banker. Therefore, any listener to the International

622
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,340
Connection should be able to understand the meaning of the story headline that ran in the

623
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:59,680
Toronto Star on April 12th. Quote, Reagan will honor Nazis on May tour, unquote. Now we'll hear

624
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,880
from Sherman Skolnik and the Citizens Committee to clean up the court in Chicago.

625
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,360
Hi, Sherman Skolnik bringing you news killed by the Monopoly press,

626
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,900
presented 24 hours a day by the Citizens Committee to clean up the court.

627
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,520
Oh Great Labor Day!

628
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,800
Oh boy!

629
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,560
This is a drop in the news news!

630
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,280
W.W.

631
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,340
I'm thinking I can hear you

632
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,760
in the big obviously

633
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,400
that's the negative

634
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:33,740
אני

635
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:33,740


636
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,040
To

637
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,960
turn it on and play with it in his own wand and surf and dance and play jazz.

638
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,260
Papi's a funky.

639
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:28,720
We're the rehearsing original concerts, going to a theater or on camping trips, or to good discotheques.

640
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,660
All these young people agreed on one thing.

641
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,340
I like the electric babies.

642
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,220
That's marvelous.

643
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,720
Okay, you can't go.

644
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,260
Okay, say it's wonderful.

645
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,500
Okay, bye.

646
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,960
I love all these shows.

647
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,780
No, no.

648
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,020
The only thing that shocks me is...

649
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,080
...is the success of my operation.

650
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,840
How successful are you?

651
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,400
Well, listen...

652
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,800
Bob, thank you.

653
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,920
I'm listening.

654
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,300
Bob.

655
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,200
Yes.

656
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,500
Bob's learning and stuff together doing.

657
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:00,860
Bob.

658
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:01,360
Yes.

659
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,020
You are a poet.

660
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,880
You're a philosopher.

661
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,760
You're a boxer.

662
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,740
Electric.

663
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,580
Updated consciousness in a real way that no one else is doing out there.

664
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,800
I'm satisfied, Bob.

665
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,620
It was very...

666
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:14,940
I understand.

667
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,720
I understand why you young people can't really say much, because where can you...

668
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,120
What can you articulate on a single plane today that's applicable?

669
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,380
Oh, that's strange.

670
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,420
I'm a pseudo-axis.

671
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:27,660
With me.

672
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,660
Is it easy to be young?

673
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,200
Thank you.

674
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,680
Goodbye.

675
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,100
Goodbye.

676
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,860
That was The Future Talks, hosted by Sarah Kamenshikova.

677
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,700
We continue our...

678
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,180
The axis of the planet, etc.

679
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:43,800
Yes.

680
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,860
He's in the car now.

681
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,940
He's had a really strange black dream.

682
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,480
And if he hears your voice now, if he hears my voice, if you could use the reverence power.

683
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,180
Jim Baker never made house calls.

684
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,700
Bob makes house calls.

685
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,260
Yes.

686
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,120
Can you make a car call to Dave now?

687
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,000
You're saying he had a dream?

688
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,180
No, he's in a moment of severe black loss.

689
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,300
We're escalating our programming here.

690
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,920
We are no longer going to just have pseudo-axis talk.

691
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,700
We're going to probe around.

692
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,580
What a sign that was.

693
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,140
The nation's capital was the site of a week-long party with guests from all over our little blue planet.

694
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:30,940
Tonight, we join...

695
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:37,160
Also the time when this song, by Karas, a group from the German Democratic Republic...

696
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
...to do a thing that we...

697
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,380
Good.

698
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:38,900
...you are.

699
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,580
Yes.

700
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,380
You're a wonderful person.

701
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,520
I'm the electric baby.

702
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,200
Yes.

703
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,700
Yes.

704
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,060
Yes.

705
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,240
Yes.

706
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,080
That's what Lynch predicted you.

707
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,960
That.

708
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:58,880
That's.

709
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,260
That.

710
00:39:59,380 --> 00:39:59,560
That.

711
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,140
That.

712
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:00,500
That.

713
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:00,720
That.

714
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,320
That.

715
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,580
That.

716
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:03,580


717
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,900
Even the universe is now imperfect.

718
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,380
And before that, the solar system has subsumed into the electronic, dis-common state.

719
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,140
And so, the aliens, the Xs, are corporate media.

720
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,480
That come here to act out as actors, like other media on the stage.

721
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,340
pensa la responsabilidade

722
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,180
a Exact street

723
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,300
And we will ever be like all together

724
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,540
Now that we're here

725
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,660
And our feet are getting right

726
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,680
Because you're like

727
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,680
Witness that I've Bol feminized

728
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,140
And that will be 먹어 space...

729
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,960
What being circumvented...

730
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,780
Discarnate electric experience goes beyond Newtonian space.

731
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,920
The space program is essentially Newtonian.

732
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,060
Okay, we're post-Euclidean here in the discarnate state.

733
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,440
We have access to the whole universe.

734
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:01,840
We can stay on the planet and travel faster and farther than anybody who's stuck in one capsule.

735
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,780
He's like an old version of the angel.

736
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,300
He can go anywhere he wants, but he's only at that point when he's there.

737
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,500
Now, when you're discarnate, you're everywhere at the same time.

738
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,060
You're not limited to one body.

739
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,600
Just by watching TV or listening to radio.

740
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,420
Electric environments is where it's at.

741
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,420
That's where we get our slack.

742
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,320
I'm not going up to space in the pink program.

743
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,980
This is the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service.

744
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,480
Tony, what have you been drinking?

745
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,620
No, I haven't been drinking.

746
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,760
It's kind of a long story, but it ends with this little piece of paper right here.

747
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,540
Let's see.

748
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,400
Oh, one of those fanatic things.

749
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,220
No, this isn't fanatic. It makes sense.

750
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,780
That's what we do here. We make sense.

751
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,780
We make sense.

752
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,840
You know, we don't match with some standard.

753
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,280
We make sense. We make it up.

754
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,820
But it's important. It's what, it's momming what goes on in the world.

755
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,720
We're basing the world on illusion right now.

756
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,560
Before the gram is in my mouth, I'm not really worth it, baby.

757
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,400
Then reload, under roll, and it be sold.

758
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,740
Personal stay and little relief.

759
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,040
Before I do, so says I'm Michael and Janet.

760
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,980
Number one electric condition. It takes a toll.

761
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,960
But, there's someone told somewhere.

762
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,080
That's how I be. All due respect to all.

763
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,200
Honestly, this is B-Bop.

764
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,720
I'm going in.

765
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,620
I've had my bank's electricity since I was running rampant.

766
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:34,340
I just conked out. I don't even know what I've, uh, I'm sorry.

767
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,760
I hope you got that on tape. That's the end of the call. Thanks.

768
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,520
Alright.

769
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,520
Okay, goodnight. Alright, sorry, Bob.

770
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,780
I just blew up.

771
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,700
Yeah, you just, you woke up.

772
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,940
Everyone says, now let me fly in.

773
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:55,040


774
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:45,940


775
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,440
Under electricorn...

776
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,840
Under electricond…

777
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:06,260
There's no electricity.

778
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:11,180
respond immediately as if a drum beat was imposed on you right and then after

779
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,860
that you have the VCR okay you can tape shows and watch them at your own beat

780
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:20,900
your own pace and then you have the remote zapper move from station to

781
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:27,140
station therefore bypassing advertising take that take the tape deck and the

782
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:32,100
satellite dish and the private computer all of these have brought back the

783
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:37,220
sensation of interactive media and demand a media cable TV all these things

784
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:42,040
came in from middle 70s and that's when the me decade and then the new

785
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,520
conservative retrieval of the 18th century chafing at the bit to get back

786
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,840
to the original autonomy of the individual ideals in the American

787
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,100
Constitution whether liberal or conservative the 18th century concepts

788
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:00,640
have been retrieved as an icon as an effect of the retrieval of the human

789
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,060
scale

790
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,080
the human scale is a human scale

791
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,560
meaning that these monster media don't impose their drumbeat on you anymore

792
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,280
you

793
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,100
know

794
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:43,960
you

795
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,140
scale give em

796
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:46,480
yeah

797
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:54,460
sexual framework human scale within the satellite went around the major media

798
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:54,880
area

799
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,340
yes

800
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,540
radio

801
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,760
Then you get in the skin.

802
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:09,480
And the problem is that it was a mentally created situation if you're in the skin.

803
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,620
It was a mentally created situation if you're in the skin.

804
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,800
Music, compose, arrange, and conduct.

805
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,000
My love.

806
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,820
The punk movement.

807
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,040
The punk movement.

808
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,140
The punk movement.

809
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,380
Okay, that was the retrieval of the futile, but a retrieval of the low-tech,

810
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:44,260
medium-scale effort of the 60s as a temporary ending for an abit of blue,

811
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,880
but the world knew that was coming to an end with the mixed corporate media,

812
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,760
these giants dying.

813
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,060
Your rhythm, compose, arrange, and conduct.

814
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,280
My love.

815
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,980
Music, compose, arrange, and conduct.

816
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,960
My love.

817
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,580
Okay, we have another caller.

818
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:33,480
Hello.

819
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:44,420
So is this an example of taking the Bob show to human scale?

820
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:50,920
I mean, is there a hijacking going on here with people using their own private cassette operations,

821
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,840
mixing with telephone and radio,

822
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,980
therefore becoming private broadcasters and generators of their own?

823
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,580
Is that your own church syndrome?

824
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,520
Is that the meaning here?

825
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,120
Is that Bob being echoed and mirrored with the human scale effect?

826
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,000
Because everybody's becoming their own radio station now, right?

827
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,740
I think it's just people ranking off.

828
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,780
That's very important.

829
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,420
No, no, no.

830
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,580
They say that masturbation is the thinking man's television.

831
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,400
Now think of that.

832
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:20,940
Woo!

833
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,380
Okay.

834
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,080
Let's get.

835
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,080
Is that right?

836
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,080
Is masturbation the thinking man's television?

837
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,060
Could be, dear friends, could be.

838
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:54,500
Masturbation may be all you have left without the church of the subgenius

839
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:59,660
whose program this is and has been

840
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:03,400
and would like to continue it to be,

841
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,100
or something like that.

842
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:13,860
I hope you've enjoyed tonight's broadcast of Bob's Media Ecology,

843
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:20,880
written, performed, and produced by the young Reverend Ivan Stang,

844
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,420
whose program this is.

845
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,440
Ordinarily.

846
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:32,220
But tonight, your guest host has been me, Will of Dobbs.

847
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:32,680
Thank you.

848
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,620
Thank all of you listeners, and especially you callers and pledgers to tonight's program.

849
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,640
Sure appreciate it.

850
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:53,720
For those of you, and I know there are those of you who have many questions,

851
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,480
questions.

852
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,240
You'd like answered about the church of the subgenius,

853
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,900
and our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

854
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,220
that we were unable to answer tonight.

855
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:12,140
For those of you who have those questions,

856
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,200
please, please do not hesitate.

857
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,400
Do not wait another moment.

858
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,800
Write to Bob.

859
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:23,620
Ah.

860
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,080
Ah.

861
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:24,220
Ah.

862
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:24,340
Ah.

863
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:24,480
Ah.

864
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:24,480


865
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:24,480


866
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:24,480


867
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:24,480


868
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,320
Ah.

869
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:27,500
Ah.

870
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:27,520
Ah.

871
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:27,520


872
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:27,520


873
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:27,520


874
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:27,520


875
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:27,520


876
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:27,520


877
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:27,520


878
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:27,520


879
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:33,520
Let him wash your problems away with Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

880
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:44,460
That address is P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas 75214.

881
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,420
Don't forget, as if we'd let you.

882
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,440
That address, Bob.

883
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,880
Write to Bob.

884
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,480
P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas 75214.

885
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:54,480


886
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:54,480


887
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,260
in Dallas, Texas 75214.

888
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,380
The information is free

889
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,420
and it will set you free, my friends,

890
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,680
like it did me, he, and ye.

891
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,320
It's not that ecology and the interest of ecology are irrelevant.

892
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,220
They are relevant.

893
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:14,860
They're relevant.

894
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,800
It's just that they get exaggerated on a certain level

895
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,700
due to the electric effect.

896
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,440
They deal with the ecology of the old nature.

897
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,400
But what about the ecology of our technological environments?

898
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,140
See, our technological environments are our new nature.

899
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:26,600
Indeed.

900
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,740
They are things we've got to learn to create spaces for them,

901
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,700
just as we have to create spaces for insects.

902
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,300
That's all.

903
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,580
Or African wildlife.

904
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,920
Whatever your old nature or...

905
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:35,160
Pinks.

906
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,480
Non-pleasures.

907
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,620
...meatings and their spaces are,

908
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:41,600
we have to consider new media as new animals that need new spaces.

909
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,560
This means an orchestrating of the old nature and the new nature.

910
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:45,460
Are you an animal?

911
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,340
Am I suggesting that you're an animal?

912
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,520
Or am I suggesting that you might be a human being?

913
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:01,580
Bob is the Gom Jabbar that will prove your subgeniusnessness.

914
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,460
You're not a stinking human, are you?

915
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,260
No, you're one of us.

916
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,500
So prove it.

917
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,180
By writing to the Church of the Subgenius

918
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:16,380
or pledging to your local subgenius program, for example.

919
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:22,340
So dear friends, it's time for us to leave this place

920
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,380
and do those things we've been doing for a long time.

921
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,560
Those horrible things that we must do when we leave this place.

922
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,580
You don't even want to know.

923
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,180
But if you do want to know, don't forget that address.

924
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,980
Write to Bob.

925
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,980
P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

926
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,580
Praise Bob, dear friends.

927
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,420
Thanks for listening.

928
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,320
His promise rings true.

929
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,240
Praise Bob.

930
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:48,720
Praise Bob.

931
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,120
Praise Bob.

932
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,480
Praise Bob.

933
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:49,980
Praise Bob.

934
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:58,720
Praise Bob.

935
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:58,720


936
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:03,060
Actually, mean to say that we are to give up technology forever

937
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,260
or is it just for a little bit?

938
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:06,980
Temporary wing.

939
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:07,660
Temporary.

940
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,080
What I call it is an ersatz.

941
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,020
E-R-S-A-T-Z, which means fake.

942
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:13,180
All right?

943
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,940
An ersatz anti-environment to this situation we're in

944
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,820
would be to have a temporary media fast,

945
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:22,160
particularly the most prominent electric media of television.

946
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,020
Television.

947
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:28,160
Yeah, and temporary. I never would take a point of view that any solution would be the final absolute solution.

948
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,260
Is it because the media is tainted?

949
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:39,700
No, it's because of the electronic dissonance, which is the formal effect of the electronic media archetypes battling it out and fighting the battle of Jericho today.

950
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,240
The content is only mere appendages, which we interpret as anthropomorphic.

951
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:50,160
But is that medium inherently bad? Can it be used at all?

952
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,460
Oh, yeah, it's good and bad. You know, it has services and disservices.

953
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,440
I don't like to use the word good and bad. It has services and disservices.

954
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,980
The point is, moderation may be the best policy as we have moved into a totally new dimension,

955
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:06,520
which the anthropomorphic element or the pinks of our time do not understand.

956
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:12,440
They cannot relate to. So let's give them a break and turn off the new element, the new water we're swimming in, so they can get a breather.

957
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,800
Us subgeniuses can take the new any time.

958
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,660
But we've got to take a sense of managerial responsibility.

959
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:26,240
The ecological effects that we're all involved in to give the pinks a chance to understand what has happened to them.

960
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:35,320
We have to have this extreme response of turning everything off in order to, because we've been so overcome with media and media technology,

961
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,240
that we have to do this to balance it out.

962
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:43,480
How about this, Wayne? This is my response to that. It is a balancing effort, but it will not happen.

963
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:49,400
The point is that since content is irrelevant, let's make the most irrelevant conceptual program.

964
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,460
Something that hogs all media content over the whole globe.

965
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:58,600
In other words, just as George Bush hijacks the global media with his Iraq theater,

966
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:04,940
why don't we hijack it and prop up a continuous Chinese water torture of talking about media ecology,

967
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,220
even though we know we never could implement it?

968
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,020
And you watch the effects of that.

969
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,280
See, that's why we have Slack. We can implement this as an idea just by talking about it,

970
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,380
but we don't have to worry about bureaucratizing the responsibility of implementing it.

971
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:19,380


972
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,820
We can implement that program or that idea.

973
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,380
We hand the ball over to whoever's listening.

974
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,120
There's nobody to hand it to. There's nobody at the switchboard. And we know that.

975
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:36,100
See, no idea, no program can have a continuous stronghold or watershed on the situation.

976
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,240
That's the flux and fluidity of the electric environment.

977
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,380
There is no ground for us to stand on.

978
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:47,520
And there's no ground for any media archetype to flow and hold a position.

979
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,320
No rock for it to connect with.

980
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,260
Everything's basically disappeared.

981
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:33,900
Speaking of the polarity of electricity,

982
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:33,900


983
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:33,900


984
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:33,900


985
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:33,980
You'll be comforted in yours so the organization can be of little use.

986
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,020
Yeah.

987
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:46,140
So that's why we've built up ongoingike that kaity which is트

988
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:47,980
are miniature integrated complexes Mexico

989
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,380
of energy supply,

990
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:53,580
Thank you.

991
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,520
Thank you.

992
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,360
Thank you.

993
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,800
Thank you.

994
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,400
Thank you.

995
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,020
Thank you.

996
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,560
Thank you.

997
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,080
Thank you.

998
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,360
Thank you.

999
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,420
Thank you.

1000
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:32,620
Thank you.

1001
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,160
Thank you.

1002
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,220
Thank you.

1003
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:18,600
Okay, so I've got to touch yourself back on this because I'm not saying anything because

1004
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:18,600


1005
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,400
and women right now.

1006
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,160
And we're just,

1007
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,280
we're human-discarnished

1008
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,940
things right now.

1009
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,220
Give me body.

1010
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:46,340
Give me body.

1011
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:54,500
If we turn off

1012
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,340
the electric environment,

1013
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,140
then we wouldn't be extended

1014
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:58,300
in a discarnate situation.
