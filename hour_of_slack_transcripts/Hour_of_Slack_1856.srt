1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,520
You find out about Bob.

3
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,640
Now, Bob, tell us the truth.

4
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,600
Have I mentioned I'm immense and immortal?

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,820
Station Bremen and station DXB on the 31 meter band.

6
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,640
You are about to hear our news in English.

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,720
Now, Bob, tell us the truth.

8
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,540
All right, you primitive screwheads, listen up.

9
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,500
You're a loony.

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,080
You're not going crazy.

11
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,520
You're going sane in a crazy world.

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,440
Now, Bob, tell us the truth.

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,960
This man is no ordinary man.

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,180
Now, Bob, tell us the truth.

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,180
There can be only one.

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,480
Ooh, spooky.

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,740
Yeah, whatever.

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,920
And now, here with an unlimited supply of misinformation is Bob.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,260
Okay, man, start it up.

20
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,340
You haven't heard it?

21
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,320
You mean to tell me that you haven't heard it?

22
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,040
No, I haven't heard it.

23
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,040
Here, play it.

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,820
It's really true.

25
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,120
Terrific.

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,900
When you hear it.

27
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,000
Excuse me, ladies.

28
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,320
I have a special request.

29
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,280
Perversion for profit.

30
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,680
A flood tide of filth is engulfing our country in the form of newsstand obscenity.

31
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,900
It is threatening to pervert an entire generation of our American children.

32
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,440
Do you want your son enticed into the world of homosexuals?

33
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,860
Or your daughter lured into lesbianism?

34
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:56,000
Do you want either of them to discover how to get sexual gratification by inflicting pain on themselves or by torturing other people?

35
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,500
Perversion for profit.

36
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,720
Perversion for profit.

37
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,620
Do you want your children stimulated?

38
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,020
Do you want your children stimulated?

39
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,300
What is fetishism?

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,360
The costuming and the significance of the extreme spiked heel and the tight boot.

41
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,680
The burning cigarettes.

42
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,480
The lace leather garments.

43
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,860
The burning cigarettes.

44
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:27,860


45
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,180
The lace leather garments.

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,180
The nakedness.

47
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,320


48
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,240
The nakedness.

49
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,740
Perversion for profit.

50
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:38,860
Perversion for profit.

51
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,300
Strange flagellation cults.

52
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,040
Spiritual sadism.

53
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,160
Abnormal sex practices of every kind,

54
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:47,880
Obrigada, Benjo.

55
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,260
are described with intimate,

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,720
loves their sex,

57
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,360
the burning cigarette.

58
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,840
The worship of the whip.

59
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,560
The riding trough. Rubber and leather garment.

60
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,300
Her version of trough.

61
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,900
There were shepherds in the same country, wrapped in strips of cloth,

62
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,720
and keeping watch by night over their feeding trough.

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,880
Behold, two young pigeons stood by them.

64
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,960
The pigeons said to them,

65
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,220
When is a dobshead not a dobshead?

66
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,920
Not a dobshead.

67
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,980
Not a dobshead, friends.

68
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,960
When it's be dobs hide.

69
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,840
Thanks to Lee Murr, and before that,

70
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:51,400
perversion for profit from the Branflakes' new album, Bounce.

71
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,700

More from them later.

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,940
The background music for this show is from the new album

84
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,700
album by our friends

85
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,360
the Flyin' Ryan

86
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,560
Brothers. An album called

87
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,760
Legacy, and their address

88
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,760
will be coming up too. And this is

89
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,240
the Hour of

90
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,740
Slackulator.

91
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,340
This particular one is the

92
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,460
Love episode.

93
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,640
Love is not that odd

94
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,480
of a subject matter for some

95
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,700
genii, due to its similarity

96
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,620
on the luck plane to

97
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,940
Slack.

98
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,720
Yes,

99
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,920
love and Slack often

100
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,740
go hand in hand.

101
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,700
Since time

102
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,060
immemorial,

103
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,140
love has been one of the golden

104
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,900
carrots of the

105
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,120
subgenius. For instance,

106
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,520
what

107
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,620
do you think is playing

108
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,960
at the Roxy?

109
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,960
What's playing

110
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,840
at the Roxy? I'll tell you what's

111
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,800
playing at the Roxy. A picture about

112
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,980
a Minnesota man so in love with a Mississippi

113
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,560
girl that he sacrifices

114
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,540
everything and moves all the way to

115
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,600
Biloxi. That's

116
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,860
what's playing at the Roxy.

117
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,100
What's in the daily news?

118
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,440
I'll tell you what's in the daily news.

119
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,620
Story about a guy who bought his

120
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,380
wife a small ruby with what

121
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,340
otherwise would have been his union dues.

122
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,720
That's what's in the daily

123
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,760
news. What's happening

124
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,740
all over? I'll tell you what's

125
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,640
happening all over. Guy sitting at

126
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,580
home by a television set who used to be

127
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,560
something of a rover.

128
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,540
That's what's happening all over.

129
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,920
Love

130
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,620
is a thing that has licked him

131
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,980
and it looks like Nathan's

132
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,300
just another victim.

133
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,260
Yes sir, when you see

134
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,520
a guy reach for stars

135
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,420
in the sky, you can

136
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,520
bet that he's doing it for

137
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,340
some doll.

138
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,540
When you spot a John

139
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,500
waiting out in the rain,

140
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,520
chances are he's insane

141
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,620
as only a John can be for a

142
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,680
Jane. When you meet

143
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,340
a gent paying

144
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,820
all kinds of rent

145
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,400
for a flat that could flatten

146
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,520
a Taj Mahal.

147
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,340
Call it sad, call

148
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,380
it funny, but it's better than

149
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,840
even money that the guy's

150
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,460
only doing it for some

151
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:39,780
doll.

152
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,960
When you see a Joe

153
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,240
saving half of his dough,

154
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,400
you can bet they'll be

155
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,300
making it for some doll.

156
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,240
When a bum

157
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,480
buys wine like a bum

158
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:53,960
can't afford,

159
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,120
it's a cinch that the bum is under

160
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,640
the thumb of some little bra.

161
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,460
When you meet a mug

162
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,340
lately out of the

163
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,180
jug, and he's still

164
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,640
lifting platinum,

165
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,520
fa'al diral.

166
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,980
Call it hell, call it heaven,

167
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,340
it's a probable twelve to seven

168
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,100
that the guy's only

169
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,780
doing it for some doll.

170
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,060
When you see

171
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,020
a sport, and his

172
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,040
cash has run short, you

173
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,000
can bet that he's banking

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,320
it with some doll.

175
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,880
When a guy wears

176
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,220
tails with the front gleaming white,

177
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,140
who the hell do you

178
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,900
think he's tickling pink on

179
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,740
Saturday night?

180
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,600
When a lazy slob

181
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,760
takes a good steady job,

182
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,720
and he smells from

183
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,640
Vitalis and Barbasol.

184
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,940
Call it dumb,

185
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,100
call it clever,

186
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,260
but you can get odds forever

187
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,000
that the guy's only doing it

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,780
for some doll, some doll,

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,860
some doll, the guy's only

190
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,640
doing it for some doll.

191
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,140
For some doll!

192
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,520
Stubby K, dear friends,

193
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,780
guys and dolls from the

194
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,740
1951 musical

195
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,600
of the same name.

196
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,920
Ah, love, love,

197
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,720
love, part of love

198
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,980
is, of course,

199
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:19,980
sex.

200
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,640
And the bonobo

201
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,920
yeti buried within each subgenie,

202
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,880
it must have come

203
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,400
sproinging out as displayed

204
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,980
by Lemur as he

205
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,700
manipulates the god

206
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,300
Shatner into sexing

207
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,400
his crew.

208
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,560
Human flesh against human

209
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,260
flesh and blood. No, not on me.

210
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,200
On you, lieutenant.

211
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,500
That's where our duty lies.

212
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,900
How can I? Man or woman, it makes

213
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,720
no difference. You know so much

214
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,220
of love.

215
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,920
And the only thing that's truly you

216
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,540
is.

217
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,840
It's the wonderful bathing suit.

218
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,960
Enterprise to Kirk, Captain.

219
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,420
Enterprise, Enterprise.

220
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,300
Come in, Kirk, Captain.

221
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,380
Kirk, Captain.

222
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,300
Not all of us are satisfied with having them feel too hard.

223
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,360
Captain, we've got to do something.

224
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,660
We were doing something.

225
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,120
Got any more good ideas, Jim?

226
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,140
How can I? Increase my breast size

227
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,060
and not gain weight anywhere else.

228
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,740
We can fire our phaser banks.

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,860
That's how you do it, lieutenant. What's happened to her?

230
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,820
We better get used to it. Go.

231
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,340
It's smaller bus.

232
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,920
You think that mysterious organ could have something to do with the

233
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,620
transmission of energy?

234
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,260
What's happened to her?

235
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,400
Well?

236
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,220
He wants us to just love it when a man

237
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,400
comes up and flirts with you.

238
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,340
He'll give us increasing bus sizes

239
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,160
too. Then I'd better handle it.

240
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,080
Perhaps if I assist it.

241
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,480
Captain. Yes?

242
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,060
I would recommend a discreet

243
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,400
distance. What?

244
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,180
You alright?

245
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,380
Oh, yes, I'm alright.

246
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,080
I have an all-natural hormone stimulant for you.

247
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,100
And you will supply the clothes.

248
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,580
Captain. Captain.

249
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:05,900
Captain.

250
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,700
Yes, I know. I know, Scotty.

251
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,920
I know. I know.

252
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,840
Nothing abnormal at all.

253
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,360
I don't believe it.

254
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,500
Well, the dogs and cats

255
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,660
were living together.

256
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,600
Raps and raccoons, birds of a feather.

257
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,760
Excessuous beasts,

258
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,260
provocating freaks.

259
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,760
Sitting with their hooves and their horns and their beaks.

260
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,160
It's morally wrong.

261
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,340
It's morally wrong.

262
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,820
It's deplorably wrong.

263
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,000
Abnormally wrong.

264
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,440
It's morally wrong.

265
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,740
It's a morally wrong.

266
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,460
Philosophically at the clip.

267
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,380
Morally wrong.

268
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,160
Well, betting on a horse that you know is gonna win.

269
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,820
Eating chocolate cake when you're trying to stay thin.

270
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,360
Shooting the bird at the holly pole.

271
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,100
And smoking that loco.

272
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,060
I go dope.

273
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,500
Well, it's morally wrong.

274
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,680
It's morally wrong.

275
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,060
It's traditionally wrong.

276
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,360
Unconditionally wrong.

277
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,680
It's morally wrong.

278
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,140
It's a morally wrong.

279
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,980
It's philosophically wrong.

280
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,800
I'm so glad you have to click,

281
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,060
Yay the late Molly,

282
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,060
Go Hall-Haan workshops,

283
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:09,500
Watch more Spirituality and Janitorial先生 on youtube

284
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,060
Hope you all are okay.

285
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:13,480
Stay safe.

286
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,420
Stay Parceanko.

292
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,980
Thank you.

293
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,360
Thank you.

294
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,980
Ah! Ah!

295
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,900
Shoo!

296
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,720
Excuse me.

297
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:00,140
Ah! Ah!

298
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,600
Yeah!

299
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,000
Consortium of Genius, dear friends.

And now, a message from

303
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,540
Amy Leamer.

304
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,800
Hello, everybody.

305
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,620
My name is Amy,

306
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,200
and I have an important message for you.

307
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,480
Okay.

308
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,980
Mm-hmm.

309
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,540
Uh...

310
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:56,860
Uh...

311
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,380
Uh...

312
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,240
Uh...

313
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,580
Uh...

314
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,000
Uh...

315
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,420
Uh...

316
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,700
Uh...

317
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,000
Uh...

318
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,540
Uh...

319
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,600
Uh...

320
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,460
Uh...

321
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,380
This has been another fine message from the Anti-Sex League.

322
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,680
Thank you for listening.

323
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,720
And, oh yeah, my name is Amy.

324
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,800
To.

325
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,740
Mark Mothersbaugh.

326
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,540
And now, The Rainmakers.

327
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,760
Who am I? I don't know. I have no idea.

328
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,260
When my friends look at me, I wonder who they think they're seeing.

329
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,560
Search me, layer by layer.

330
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,400
But inside, I'm afraid you'll find thin air.

331
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,920
Hey, yes, guess again.

332
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,520
We might be underneath this skin.

333
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,940
What makes me...

334
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,220
How should I know?

335
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,900
I've been trained like a monkey.

336
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,680
The bell rings and I start to jones like a junkie.

337
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,560
What turns me on?

338
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,460
I wish I knew.

339
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,160
Wish I could tell the real thing.

340
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,400
My honest desire from my conditioning.

341
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,320
Touch me now, now touch me again.

342
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,940
I want to feel something real coming through this skin.

343
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,940
I've been boxing with my friends.

344
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:24,940


345
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:24,940


346
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:24,940


347
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:24,940


348
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:24,940


349
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,440
My shadow ended and tagged.

350
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,440
I can't punch my way out of a paper bag.

351
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,660
It's as thick as you think.

352
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,540
Thin as the reasoning you bought.

353
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,340
I'm a mummy wrapped in a gauze of my own thoughts.

354
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:45,360
And I want to know who I'd be if I never had bathed in the static, the snow, and the radio wave.

355
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,360
The flickering image.

356
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,160
The pandering thought that's been passed off and on to be the blueprint of God.

357
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,520
Hey, yes, yes, again.

358
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,240
We might be if we could shed this skin.

359
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,360
There.

360
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,840
I really am all right.

361
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,620
You're Mildred the Almore Woman.

362
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,880
You gotta understand that I really am all right.

363
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,120
You can understand how a girl, even if she is nice, can get into a lot of trouble.

364
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,280
I am nice, aren't I?

365
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:45,880
Sure.

366
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,720
I'd like to play dolls with you.

367
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,880
Hello, honey.

368
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,140
Hello, honey.

369
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,140


370
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,900
Get up.

371
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,780
Aren't you gonna speak to me, honey?

372
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:57,740
Get up.

373
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,320
Oh, don't look so surprised.

374
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,140
That wasn't you, the felon.

375
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,760
The light that was just...

376
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,040
He doesn't like you anymore, Mildred.

377
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,020
We don't like tin horns around here.

378
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,680
Oh, yes, he does, don't you, honey?

379
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:08,900
Get up.

380
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:09,820
You...

381
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,660
He's gonna kill you, Mildred.

382
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Please, please, please get me out of here.

383
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,380
Take me with you.

384
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,540
We don't like tin horns.

385
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:16,960
Who?

386
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,220
Every time you look at a man, he falls over, doesn't he?

387
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:19,880
Get up.

388
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,140
I got into trouble, but I really didn't.

389
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,140


390
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,060
I really am a nice girl.

391
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,540
You can understand how a girl, even if she is nice, can get into a lot of trouble.

392
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,500
Sure.

393
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,820
I'd like to play it with you.

394
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,420
Carlos, you losers can help yourself to what's on the table.

395
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,760
Cut it out, will you?

396
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,480
He'll get me.

397
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:47,880
Shut up.

398
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,600
Get up.

399
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,860
Get up.

400
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,460
Those things happen sometimes.

401
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,460
So please, don't let Bob keep you from having nothing.

402
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,380
But it's wonderful.

403
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,140
Shut up.

404
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,840
He'll get me.

405
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,320
Shut up.

406
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,820
Bob is what you have been waiting for.

407
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,660
He'll get me.

408
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,040
Shut up.

409
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,620
Bob is what you have been waiting for.

410
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:17,860
He'll get me.

411
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:17,860


412
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:17,860


413
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:17,860


414
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,340
He'll get me.

415
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:18,880
Shut up.

416
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,200
He'll get me.

417
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,260
Shut up.

418
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,480
The giant beaver was no different.

419
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,020
Are you like the giant beaver, my friend?

420
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:35,040
Well, Fernanda Dan Delimere cut that up, but now Sain Alio or Stalio has a message just

421
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,680

Take your clothes off.

425
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,900

428
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,920

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,360

Oh take off your clothes. Oh take off your clothes. Oh take off your clothes with my clothes on

Without wearing your jeans

447
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,820
He refused to take his clothes off

448
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:19,680
Let's go to Bob right now hi Bob. Hi well I I have a

449
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,380
past of

450
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,640
homosexuality

451
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,900
however, I don't deal in that anymore and

452
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,100
I have anxiety

453
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,700

454
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,940
Love Bob and I live for him

455
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:42,360
Amen, I wish I was attracted to ladies Bob, but I'm most I can do is be a friend to them

456
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,300

460
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,340
So it's never too late. You know Bob. I want to testify so bad. I believe in this stuff

461
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:10,320
It's not exactly easy to listen to with all the screaming, but it's no condemnation towards that because it's necessary

462
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,480
It made me feel uneasy

463
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,580
in

464
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,280

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,080

476
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,080
I toy with my mustache.

477
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,580
He's been toy with me.

478
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,880

I grew my mustache.

482
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:16,700
On the balcony in my tight corduroy shorts.

483
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,100

My mustache just giggles.

489
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,800
He knows he's the only hair for me.

490
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,340

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,440

Oh yeah, oh yeah, and we'll set the world on the end

567
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,940
A holiday woman, a little soul, and a side of man

568
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,360
Sounds totally loud, loud and clear

569
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,940
Keep your cotton picking fingers out my curly hair

570
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,880
Oh yeah, oh yeah, and we'll set the world on the end

571
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,860
A holiday woman, a little soul, and a side of man

572
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:27,260
I heard about a king who was doing swell

573
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,620
Until he started playing with that evil Jezebel

574
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,660
Oh yeah, oh yeah, and we'll set the world on the end

575
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,500
A holiday woman, a little soul, and a side of man

576
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,540
I got a woman, a head like a rock

577
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,220
Is she ever when a man cry around the talk of old?

578
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,800
Oh yeah, oh yeah, and we'll set the world on the end

579
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,680
A holiday woman, a little soul, and a side of man

580
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,520
My heart had a woman's soul and I'm flying over

581
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:30,820
Do you like to see dried coffee and things like that around people's necks?

582
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,400
Sure, I like to see that.

583
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,820
Are you making an offer, Dave?

584
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,260
Well, I'm making an offer. I'd like to see the drive.

585
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,300
Are you asking him out?

586
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,760
I'm asking him up, if you know what I mean.

587
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,300
Yeah, man.

588
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,660
Sure.

589
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,660
Yeah, yeah, let's have a serious adult discussion.

590
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,940
Okay, let's rap, man. Remember in the 70s you used to say, let's rap and stuff like that?

591
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,660
I didn't actually say that.

592
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,540
Did you just ever?

593
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,580
I didn't say that until it was sort of camp to say that in the 90s, then I oversaid it.

594
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,640
Did you ever get one of those rubber mallets and just bang on your wagon until you cried

595
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,720
and then maybe take pictures of it and stuff?

596
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,400
Were you ever in a rap session?

597
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,280
I've never seen experiments with hitting themselves like that.

598
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,720
On the cutting edge, the Schwarzkogar crew.

599
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,120
Rubber hammer. It was a rubber hammer.

600
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,940
Oh, of course.

601
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,620
Safe hammer.

602
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,120
Because the chisel will slide out of your hand if it's not a rubber hammer.

603
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,660
I wouldn't do that without a rubber.

604
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,240
No.

605
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,140
Small talk. Everybody does it.

606
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,320
Small talk. Nobody gets a dick.

607
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,440
Small talk. Nature sucks great.

608
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,800
Small talk.

609
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:41,260
Sharks out and brainwaves out of hand.

610
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,040
F*** you too.

611
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,180
Have a nice day.

612
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,380
Eat up all your hay.

613
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,240
Take it slow.

614
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,500
Have a good blow.

615
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,380
See you around.

616
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,780
If you're not, I'll do the groom.

617
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,700
Small talk.

618
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,400
Puts me in a trap.

619
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,760
Small talk.

620
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,480
Is nothing but verbal crap.

621
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,780
Small talk.

622
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,800
Must we open for him?

623
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,840
Small talk.

624
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,680
Is that why we were born?

625
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,140
It's so cold.

626
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,240
You're already old.

627
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,380
It's so hot.

628
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,420
What you haven't got?

629
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,600
I should have stayed in bed.

630
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,620
You're feeling all dead.

631
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,880
I can't wait to go home.

632
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,720
Just wait with me alone.

633
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,820
Small talk.

634
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,500
We never ask why.

635
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,820
Small talk.

636
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,560
To the very day we die.

637
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,000
Small talk.

638
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,420
Covers up the quiet.

639
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,540
Shout out just one sight.

640
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,580
Dare you to try it.

641
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,800
Small talk.

642
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,200
We never ask why.

643
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,960
We never ask why.

644
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,980
We never ask why.

645
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,720
We never ask why.

646
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,300
We never ask why.

647
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,400
We never ask why.

648
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,240
We never ask why.

649
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:03,900
We never ask why.

650
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,900
I can't wait to go home.

651
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:04,900


652
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,880
We never ask why.

653
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,100
I'm feeling like I'm dying.

654
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,020
I'm feeling like I'm dying.

655
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,040
I'm feeling like I'm dying.

656
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:27,500
I'm feeling like I'm dying.

657
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,700
I don't wait for you.

658
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,740
I don't hide away.

659
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,320
But I feel like I'm dying.

660
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,880
Whipping Post, friends.

661
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,600
That's ESO Einstein's Secret Outlaws at 5X day.

662
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:30,080
And before that, small talk by Little Theodore from Beneath the Uber Putts.

663
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:37,260
And you can get more from email, littletheodore at yahoo.com.

664
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,340
Theodore is spelled F as in Frank, Y-O-D-O-R.

665
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,480
Or 3277 Raleigh Street, Denver, Colorado.

666
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,540
802.

667
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,260
212.

668
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,540
1707.

669
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,400
And before that, ESO Swamp Radio on WCSB Cleveland.

670
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,460
And the king singing Bible stories.

671
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,140
Now, stay tuned for a real treat.

672
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:13,920
Dr. Philo Drummond, the overman, unearthed an excellent recording of the Swinging Love Corpses.

673
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:20,560
His band, live at Off-Broadway in St. Louis in May of 1991.

674
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,180
What follows, then, in keeping with this theme of love,

675
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:31,800
the treasure hit oldie by the Swinging Love Corpses' Pick a Booger.

676
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,540
Pick a Booger.

677
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,680
Pick a Booger.

678
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,920
Pick a Booger.

679
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,380
Pick a Booger.

680
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,640
Pick a Booger.

681
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,000
Pick a Booger.

682
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,760
Pick a Booger.

683
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,540
Thank you.

684
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:24,860
Thank you.

685
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,240
Thank you.

686
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,600
Thank you.

687
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,300
Thank you.

688
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,540
Thank you.

689
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,320
Thank you.

690
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,340
Thank you.

691
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,780
Thank you.

692
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,940
Thank you.

693
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,960
Thank you.

694
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:53,940
Thank you.

695
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:58,980
Thank you.

696
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:21,600


697
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:23,460
Yeah!

698
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:24,660
Yeah!

699
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,160
Yeah!

700
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,100
You come on in with a body stick

701
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,380
And a finger in your nose

702
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,480
You pick a bug around

703
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,100
And wipe it on your nose

704
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,360
You don't know how you feel

705
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,740
One way or another

706
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,860
You need to make sure

707
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:40,580
You're happy and white

708
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,520
Without your brother

709
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,700
You're driving in your car

710
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,080
And you're looking at the light

711
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,320
And I heard it's from a star

712
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,760
So I can save her in the day

713
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,240
She's pulling, she's tugging

714
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,440
She's shaking on the sleigh

715
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,740
It's a long time of dreams

716
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,220
But you make her do the brain

717
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,340
Pick a bugger

718
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,760
Pick a bugger

719
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,800
Pick a bugger

720
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,100
Pick a bugger

721
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,060
Everybody do it

722
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,200
Pick it, pick it, pick it

723
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,740
Pick a bugger

724
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:13,700
Pick it!

725
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,200
Yeah!

726
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,240
Thank you!

727
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:20,720
Thank you!

728
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:20,820
Thank you!

729
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,620
If you relax the rubber band quickly

730
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,720
While it's between your lips

731
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,000
It's distinctly cool

732
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,740
I was praying last night

733
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,080
When an angel broke the light

734
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,620
He said, I'm gonna have to put you on hold

735
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,740
For a time

736
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,020
I said, hold like hell

737
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,320
Let me talk to the boss

738
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,480
He said, sorry, slow consider

739
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,980
It's the boss's day off

740
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,220
And I realized then

741
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,720
That the wages of sin was too high

742
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,040
Two bucks an hour

743
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,060
And working weekends

744
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,460
I was ignoring the fee

745
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,320
He was latched to the cross and cried

746
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,100
Help me get this son of a bitch off

747
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,760
I said I would if I could

748
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,000
I can't so I won't

749
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,780
Well, I wouldn't want you messing your hair up

750
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,740
So don't

751
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,900
And I realized then

752
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,200
That the wages of sin

753
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,700
Was all the lumber you can carry

754
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,840
All the nails you can bend

755
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,120
The wages of sin

756
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,520
The reward of fear

757
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,900
It's worrying and threatening

758
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,200
Every second of the year

759
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,360
And heaven is guilt

760
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,620
No sex and no show

761
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,940
And I'm not sure

762
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,260
If I really wanna go

763
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,040
Oh

764
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,760
Five times if you believe me

765
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:04,160
Could I ever imagine

766
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,140
A day where you WOMAN

767
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,440
Ae in between

768
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:08,440


769
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:08,440


770
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,240
The wages of sin

771
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,520
Sh mening theée

772
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,220
For a sue

773
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,280
Every brawl

774
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:16,840
And a mental pull

775
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,880
Like free stuff

776
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:17,880


777
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,480
The grandesande

778
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,680
And has comebacked

779
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,900
You're God and country kind

780
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,200
One gets your body

781
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,620
The other gets your mind

782
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,340
Mary, Mary Magdalene

783
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,060
How about a date?

784
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,300
You've been wasting your time

785
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,600
Staying up so late

786
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,660
Your boyfriend's dead

787
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:40,420
The word is you're a whore

788
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:44,960
Just about then I heard a knock on the door

789
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,460
And I realized then that the wages of sin

790
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:54,100
Was a bad reputation and too many friends

791
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,460
The wages of sin

792
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,080
The wages of sin

793
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,640
The wages of sin

794
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,240
The wages of sin

795
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,780
The wages of sin

796
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:19,420
The wages of sin

797
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:24,000
The wages of sin

798
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,620
The wages of sin

799
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:33,200

800
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,780
The wages of sin

801
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,380
The wages of sin

802
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:51,460
