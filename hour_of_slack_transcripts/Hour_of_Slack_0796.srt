1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:09,920
The Subgenius Hour of Slack at URW is specially designed only to be made on radio station and only in the city of...

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,580
Dave, some people think that we're evolved from whales.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,880
Who thinks that we're evolved from whales?

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,420
Aliens.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,140
Aliens think that they...

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,560
They think that we are evolved from whales, and they've been giving Bob a hard time about that.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,540
I don't know. I don't understand that.

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:37,420
Well, even as a fructose child, with our gathered blitherings as we sat and watched the cranial tube,

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:45,520
there was Mr. Science telling us that an early date and time, one mammal hit the road and the other one hit the swimming pool.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,600
So there is a strong belief in our common ancestral things.

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,520
They often say that the pitches that seals here and the habits and social...

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,920
Order of seals is very much similar to a dog.

14
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,540
So to call a sealist a dog is not as unusual as one might think.

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,840
It's not as brad, but it's a normalistic...

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,200
Oh, yeah!

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,700
Stand aside, Slade.

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,900
Right, you got me, too.

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,760
Stand up, stand aside.

20
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,660
Here we go.

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,120
Yee-haw!

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:36,980
Your vision is going to be altered, but not by the standard operating methods used in so many historical events in the past.

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,640
It's a new, modern method developed here at our laboratories.

24
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,880
Here at our...

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,020
Point of text.

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:53,120
Point of text is important for a man who's developed these systems over years and years of trial and error.

27
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,200
So the next time you plug in and go online,

28
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,540
you're about to...

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,840
You're about to see anything you want to see as long as you've still got the visual context with which to do it.

30
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,660
That means operating eyeballs and your other four senses.

31
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,720
Outside of that, you're going to be left very, very alone.

32
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,160
I am dry, baby.

33
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,140
You don't mind being dry, and some of you don't mind being high.

34
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,180
Of course, the understanding was that someday you'd be able to come down.

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,680
Yeah.

36
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,120
Mm-hmm.

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,320
Mm-hmm.

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,520
And that to be high without lubrication is to be high as...

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,540
In a sarcophagus awaiting one's second smotherment at the end of time.

40
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,620
It...

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,200
Well, I think we're just about ready to take calls here on the victory line.

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,540
Now, between the hours of 2.23 in the morning and 3.45 in the morning,

43
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,620
we're going to be receiving special gamma ray...

44
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,540
...from your gamma and gamma.

45
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,720
They're deep in the cosmic sweaty poop.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,880
We're going to be taking them all on to our prefrontal areas,

47
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,600
and we're going to be sucking them down through the diaphragm,

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
shown here and given to you by Nurse Cobb and some of the other nurse helpers.

49
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:19,280
For those of you who can no longer sweat and whose pores are now closed by the duck ointments passed out earlier,

50
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:25,500
those of you who passed out will find themselves in a very, very safe...

51
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,540
...place.

52
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:37,960
And, friend, you can be safe, too, if you'll just give your mind, wallet, and heart over to J.R. Bob Dogg

53
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,840
and his Church of the Subgenius, yes?

54
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,500
You, too, can be clean.

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,520
Clean, clean, clean, like Dave here.

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,980
Yes, much like Dave.

57
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,060
All smooth and beautiful.

58
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,660
Vegetables cleaned and cluttered.

59
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,180
Like an eggplant.

60
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,120
Like a crisp array of sonny below the fryer.

61
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,100
Your brain doesn't need to be all wrinkled and confluent.

62
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,680
It's not polluted anymore.

63
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,780
Nay, nay, nay, nay.

64
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,360
It could be clean.

65
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,660
It's better that way, doesn't it?

66
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,440
Now, now, now that you've given over that $30 check to Bob,

67
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,260
you are in our clutches.

68
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,840
Great.

69
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,840
Now, now, now, now.

70
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:26,860
You're in our control.

71
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,140
Right under our control.

72
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,140
Well, now that we've got him, what do we do with him?

73
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,440
You're done.

74
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:32,740
You're done.

75
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,360
Dave?

76
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,440
I say we eliminate all the fat vesicles from their knees and from their calves.

77
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,660
We make the pores on the top of their head much bigger than the ones on their nose, so

78
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,380
for next time they pick a pimple, their brains explode.

79
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,400
I say we fry them.

80
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,500
I say we kick them into joy juice and poop them out later.

81
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,100
I say we...

82
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,360
I say we...

83
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,080
We...

84
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,400
We...

85
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,400


86
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,620
We...

87
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:58,620


88
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:58,620


89
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:58,640
We...

90
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,780
We...

91
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,120
We...

92
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,040
We...

93
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,080
We...

94
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,100
We...

95
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,980
Well, that's a description for greatness.

96
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,280
I heard one here on the subgenius radio network.

97
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,100
That was an idea whose time has come in its pants and your head.

98
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,580
That's an idea whose fruition has gone smelly.

99
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,080
And that's what I mean when I say we keep on the conversation in photos, our brain demands

100
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,080


101
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:36,920
I'd like to supply some of our subliminal listeners with some exercises for the upcoming week.

102
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,420
First week.

103
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,540
Beginning on Wednesday.

104
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,920
Those with the blue sticker on the back of the freight dungarees.

105
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,200
You cannot wash off.

106
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,960
Remember, it is your time for free food at the mall.

107
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,820
Don't ask.

108
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,940
Don't pay.

109
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,340
Take it.

110
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,320
It's being taken care of by our friends at...

111
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,920
What did I say, the man?

112
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,700
At WCSB in Cleveland.

113
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,440
Yeah, yeah, right.

114
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,680
None of those places near Washington.

115
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,320
Oh, praise Bob, my friends.

116
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,140
Praise.

117
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,740
Praise that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

118
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,380
This is going to be one of those happy, tossed-together, thrown-up hours of slack.

119
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,240
Because, my friend, my behind is behind Dragon.

120
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,520
Because we just got back from that weirdo festival, Starwood.

121
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,040
Also held at Brushwood in rural New York.

122
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,720
Like our Phil Saiten 4X Day.

123
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,800
Day of the First Trojan.

124
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,500
So I'm swamped in recordings from those live concerts.

125
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,900
And those souls surfing.

126
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,580
D-Vitals, friends, safing souls from their selves.

127
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,740
Ah, yes.

128
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,180
But, friends, those things take time to cut.

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,380
I've got to do a lot of up-cutting before those fine, filthy rants can be played.

130
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,480
And my mail is behind.

131
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,580
My behind's behind, friends.

132
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,300
Over behind that trash bin there.

133
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,720
Full of stuff and fish.

134
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,080
And so, so, my friend, for your delectification and mental indelibility,

135
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:37,780
I'm just going to whip together anything old or new that happens to already be laying around here all digitized.

136
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:45,820
And next week, there'll be more of XXXX Day.

137
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,220
And Starwood.

138
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,980
And the such-like.

139
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,040
But.

140
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,460
But like I say, I've got to catch up.

141
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,820
I've got a lot to catch up on.

142
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:01,040
And, friends, to do that quickly, I'm going to read to you from something I don't have to worry about cutting cuss words from.

143
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,200
And that's a Christian publication.

144
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,140
It was sent to me by my good friend, Dr. Lake Hume.

145
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:12,800
This publication called The Answer to Raptures by the great pastor, Harry Walter.

146
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,720
And my copy is an autograph, my friends.

147
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,200
Thanks to Dr. Lake Hume, who is helping Mr. Walter on his website.

148
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,940
This is completely sincere.

149
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,780
Not a subgenius takeoff or anything.

150
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:37,900
This is the real thing from a great Christian preacher who's explaining what lays in store for the believers of our nation during the tribulation and the end times to come.

151
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,920
As predicted not only in the Bible, but, friends, also in the book of the subgenius.

152
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:50,300
Yes, the book of Bob has predicted these very same things that Pastor Walter, from a completely different direction, discovered.

153
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:50,440
Yes.

154
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:59,720
Also true, friends, because as he says here on page 96, as the satanic Luciferian forces are getting things ready,

155
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,220
then the Christians will be tossed into their death chambers.

156
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:12,680
No doubt they will be stripped naked and kept in handcuffs so they cannot resist what is soon to come later on.

157
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,660
They will probably be fed nothing, nor given any water, and they will have to lay in their own feces,

158
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,180
and urine, possibly stale bread, will be thrown onto the floor,

159
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:36,200
and possibly water will be sprayed in with hoses so that they are forced to lap it up as dogs amidst the urine,

160
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,420
wasted blood from injuries and many new illustrations.

161
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,880
But who will be the future prison guards, friends?

162
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:50,880
Who will be the most sadistic, sick, and savage ex-prisoners, ex-Christians, become the new prisoners?

163
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,620
Of course, the most brutal, rapist, murderers, and perverts will be assigned to take care of the Christians.

164
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,000
No doubt, Christians will be selected for daily beatings and tortures.

165
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,740
Select girls, boys, and women will be chosen for sexual rapes in front of all.

166
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:14,600
Pregnant women will no doubt be booted several times in the stomachs to prevent the birth of another Christian.

167
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,720
My friends, this is prophecy from a Christian publication.

168
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,540
The answer to raptures by Harry Walford.

169
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,020
And the answer to the question of the Bible.

170
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,400
And of Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love, my friend.

171
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,200
And, oh, friend, wait until you hear this next section coming right up.

172
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,560
Christians will be led to their deaths.

173
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,720
They will be taken to the giant sports stadiums and complexes of the world,

174
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,420
such as the Los Angeles Coliseum, the Houston Astrodome, the Madison Square Park Gardens,

175
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,840
a veteran's stadium in Philadelphia, the Roman Coliseum, and great soccer stadiums of Europe,

176
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,940
all naked and handcuffed, beaten and abused.

177
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,980
And before the Luciferic juries and the field stadiums,

178
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,700
Christians will be given their last chance to worship Satan as God

179
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,700
and take the Satanic initiation 666 or be put to death.

180
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:09,160
And the method of death will be decapitation, beheading, as we're told in Revelation chapter 20.

181
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,420
Why beheading? Because when the cartoroid arteries in your neck are severed,

182
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,000
the blood literally spurts out everywhere.

183
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,680
And sometimes your head is alive.

184
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,660
For up to 10 to 15 seconds, looking around at a Satanic stadium, cheering madly.

185
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,860
And then you are gone.

186
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,680
This terrifying form of death is perfectly designed to terrify the Christian

187
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,180
as he or she is carried to the Satanic altar.

188
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,000
And no doubt, as they are led to slaughter in these giant sports stadiums,

189
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,580
the rock bands will be blaring away some Satanic tune, possibly the old Rolling Stones classic.

190
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,680
The devil will be the one to be slain.

191
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,460
Led Zeppelin's A Whole Lotta Love, the Emerson, Lake and Palmer classic of Jerusalem,

192
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,740
Atlantis by Donovan or possibly even Pat Benatar's We Are Invincible.

193
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:10,820
Maybe they will even slice or chop the heads off of Christians in synchronicity to the beat of the rock bands.

194
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,180
So, my friend, for three and a half years, blood shall flow through the streets of the world.

195
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:24,820
Today, the blood on this book cover, The Answer, by Harry Walters, is only simulated ink.

196
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:34,400
One day in the future, it shall be real human blood, the blood of the saints and possibly even your own blood.

197
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,880
Ah, yes.

198
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,160
I already know your name.

199
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,300
Yeah, yeah.

200
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,400
We've walked around and seen you, your eyes.

201
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,740
Don't worry, no one lies in vain.

202
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm gonna cry for the death of the man.

203
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,080
And the victory reigns and the right is back.

204
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,220
We are gonna continue now.

205
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,280
We hope that you don't die.

206
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,120
Oh, yes, my baby.

207
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,380
Oh, it's lovely to meet you.

208
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,580
And you're my heaven.

209
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,200
Oh, yeah.

210
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,420
We hope that you don't die.

211
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,220
Oh, yes, my baby.

212
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,660
Oh, yes, my baby.

213
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,900
Oh, yes, my baby.

214
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh, yes, my baby.

215
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,600
Oh, well, we'll see about that.

216
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,420
We meet and сердö should be e Olha, loveanAND

217
00:13:51,420 --> 00:14:02,940
We should shut him up, of Gosa

218
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,000
Opa pulau?

219
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,840
She's still rejected me,

220
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:06,840


221
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:06,840


222
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:06,840


223
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,640
A dustman like this,

224
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,980
is like that soul.

225
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:09,980


226
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,960
Let's go.

227
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,340
Let's go.

228
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,300
Let's go.

229
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,040
Let's go.

230
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,860
Let's go.

231
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,940
Let's go.

232
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,160
Let's go.

233
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,460
Oh, friends, it was a spectacle.

234
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:28,280
All those half-naked and half-covered human and subgenius creatures

235
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,020
all mingled together in a strange spectacle of violence and love

236
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,420
all mingled in X-Day Drill the 4th, 4X Day.

237
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,800
Oh, praise God.

238
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,760
Oh, my God.

239
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,920
My Bob, my slack galore.

240
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,540
Friend, won't you join us on July 5th, 2002

241
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,460
when the world will surely end and we'll all be lifted up.

242
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,740
Praise Bob.

243
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,920
Praise Einstein Secret Orchestra.

244
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,520

248
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,180
Actually, Dave on rhythm guitar.

249
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,060
Well, it depends.

250
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,700
And Michelle George on electric violin.

251
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,300
And Nikki on bass.

252
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,440
Oh, yes.

253
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,800
Oh, yes.

254
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,060
Oh, yes.

Oh, yes.

256
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,180


257
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,180


258
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,180

00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,400


275
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,400


276
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,400


277
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,400


278
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,400


279
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:03,980
Oh, yes.

280
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,600
Oh, yes.

281
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,340
Oh, yes.

282
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm a hero, I'm a hero, I'm a hero, I'm a hero

283
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,840
Maniacal sickness

284
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,780
Some genius mountains

285
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,900
Annihilated fate

286
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,920
We're heading to hell, gang

287
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,820
Our holy land will be

288
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,900
The time to leave, hey

289
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,060
Sleep, hey, sleep, hey

290
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,020
Sleep, hey, sleep, hey

Hey, hey, to the devil's salvation

Hey, hey, to the dreamin' hell

293
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,300
Hey, hey, to the reincarnation

294
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,760
Hey, hey, to the broken hell

295
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,500
This life is in the past

296
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,560
The harlequin heaven, here it lasts

297
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,520
Immortal forms for us to bear

298
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,440
Stop genius and affair

299
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,160
As the fighters lose

300
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,780
Work, tribulation, and true sex hurts

301
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,700
You the harlequin took the truth

302
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,740
All has a plan for you

303
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,140
Hey, hey, to the devil's salvation

304
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,160

Hey, hey, to the broken hell

307
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,620
Transcend your next plane

308
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,500
Higher goals to attain

309
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,600
As God, you've left behind

310
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,680
Super universe, unwind!

311
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,220
A tempest day shuns

312
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:30,960
Tremors!

313
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,340
Every temptation's overindulgent

314
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,780
There's a key, a surefire guarantee

315
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,040
Once you've proven your worth

316
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,880
You'll begin the rebirth

317
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,940
To the super universe

318
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,000
In which you will immerse

319
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,000
Now you're here to turn back

320
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,200
This is where your facts will slack

321
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,060
Nothing left to hide

322
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,900
Now you're on the inside

323
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,100
Put them to the forehand

324
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,000
And the truth comes straight ahead

325
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,240
All the myths and sub-divines

326
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,000
Bring it to the punchline

327
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,060

00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,220
Thank you.

358
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,020
Save your soul for Bob

359
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,300
is the name of that fine-flavored piece

360
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,940
there by the El Queso All-Stars.

361
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:47,480
And you can get more of their material by looking at www.mp3.com slash El Queso All Stars.

362
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:56,220
Or for that matter, you can check out www.mp3.com slash Saint N for Saint N.

363
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:01,060
You know, friends, we're Saint N-ick around here.

364
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,180
We will lead this damn nation to damn nation, as Dr. LeGames said.

365
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,360
We will lead this nation to damn nation.

366
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,740
Those weren't his real eyes. Those were the subgenius fake 3D eyes that he bought from Stank.

367
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:23,140
Or not, he didn't buy them from Stank. Stank approved them and sold them and endorsed them.

368
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,960
Hey, look, you guys do your business. I'll do my business.

369
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,380
Let me get reelected fair and square.

370
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,040
And I'll keep my mouth shut.

371
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,640
I'm sure you guys have stuff on me.

372
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,620
You keep your mouth shut, everything will be fine.

373
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,260
I got those ne'er-do-wells and have-nots to vote for me.

374
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,840
Because they thought I cared.

375
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,900
But I'm with you guys. I know the way the world really works.

376
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,360
I know how it makes the world turn.

377
00:26:53,540 --> 00:27:00,840
I am so glad that you masons and Disney CEOs and people let me into the circle.

378
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,040
It's a good thing.

379
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,720
It's a good thing.

380
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,320
And we're proud to have you, too.

381
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:08,680
I'm also glad that Mr. Rockefeller died and made a place for me.

382
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,540
That's a nice chair you're occupying, too.

383
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,720
Don't remember, there's a lot of tradition in that chair, Mr. Stank.

384
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,620
Believe me, I know it. I've done my homework.

385
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:24,600
And you can bet that the Church of the Subgenius will happily work with the conspiracy from now on.

386
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:30,940
Of course, we're going to make a lot more money if we can maintain our anti-conspiracy conspiracy image.

387
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,080
You know, I mean, I assume that's why you brought us in.

388
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,620
Just a minute, Mr. Stank. Could you please just sit down?

389
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,580
You're making some of the members of the team a little uncomfortable.

390
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,320
We certainly appreciate your attitude.

391
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,900
We're not monthly sort of behavior around here, boys.

392
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,300
Sorry, Colonel North.

393
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,680
Just relax.

394
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,780
We'd like to talk to you about some of your other activities.

395
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,320
You see, Mr. Pipe Mill and Mr. Crack Tuber,

396
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:00,800
they feel that some of your activities are encroaching on Will Halliday.

397
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,140
Oh, the gangsters, eh?

398
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,860
Encroaching on their turf, so to speak.

399
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,700
Uh, could you clarify that? I, uh, don't...

400
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,060
Wally, just sit down. Not now. Please put it away.

401
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,820
I'm sure we can work things out.

402
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,220
Well, we're definitely going to work things out now, Reverend Stank.

403
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,100
You see, uh, according to our figures,

404
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,880
you owe the conspiracy a lot of money.

405
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,880
What? But I owe the conspiracy?

406
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,720
I thought you guys were going to be paying me.

407
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,300
For a lot of airports, yes.

408
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,340
I gave you our mailing list.

409
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,160
Our mailing list doesn't pay our bills, Mr. Stank.

410
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,140
You know what kind of company you're sitting with.

411
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,440
The men next to you, these are men of power and wealth.

412
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,840
Now, you've dared to join our fraternity.

413
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,380
We've honored you.

414
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,960
The idea, and we've accepted you in our midst.

415
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,880
You're going to have to make amends.

416
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,380
You're going to have to do something about all this money you owe us.

417
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,760
What? What?

418
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,340
Now, wait a minute. What kind of...

419
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,920
You've got three weeks, Mr. Stank.

420
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,040
How have I encroached on you?

421
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,820
You're on the turf of any large conspiracy conglomerate.

422
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,140
The church had its own market.

423
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,580
It was completely different.

424
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,400
I'm sorry, Mr. Stank.

425
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,640
You're going to have to come up with money.

426
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,860
We paid our taxes.

427
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,700
Please respond.

428
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,380
It's the same way you guys do.

429
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,060
Now, come on.

430
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,900
Hey, we're in the circle.

431
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,700
You can...

432
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,420
Come on.

433
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,240
Come along.

434
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,820
Come along, Reverend Stank.

435
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,980
Let's go now.

436
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,900
Hey, Reverend.

437
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,720
Hey, Reverend.

438
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,160
How come you look so forlorn, man?

439
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,300
What you doing walking out of that alley anyway?

440
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,100
Oh, I'm feeling real goofy there, Dave.

441
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,260
Yeah, you don't look so good, buddy.

442
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,580
Oh, everything's okay, I guess.

443
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,200
You look like the world's on your shoulders, man.

444
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,660
Like a whole mess of trouble or something.

445
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,980
Like the weight of the world on your shoulders.

446
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,080
Yeah, well, you know when they talk about the man?

447
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,060
Yeah?

448
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,840
Well, I met the man just now.

449
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,600
What?

450
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,720
You know...

451
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,360
The man?

452
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,380
Yeah, the man.

453
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:10,480
And he said we owed him a whole lot of money, Dave.

454
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,300
What do you mean, we, King of Zombies?

455
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,200
Well, the church.

456
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,020
The church?

457
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,460
Yeah.

458
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,540
Owes the man?

459
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,220
Yeah.

460
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,020
Geez.

461
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,540
Everything we've got.

462
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,020
So, let me see your wallet, Dave.

463
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,920
I was just going to try and hit you up for a cup of soup, buddy.

464
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,980
Well, we don't...

465
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,560
Come on.

466
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,120
I gave you the office.

467
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:31,820
Come on, you.

468
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,880
Now fork it over.

469
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,400
Hey, look.

470
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,040
If you're a Dutch to the man, you know my 25 cents ain't going to be on a nun's belt.

471
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,500
Well, you've probably got a point.

472
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,140
But I'll tell you what.

473
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,880
Do some more panhandling and whatever you come up with.

474
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,680
But tonight, we'll let you live if you give it all to us.

475
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah.

476
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,220
It should be five or six bucks.

477
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,740
That'll be a start.

478
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:49,660
Damn.

479
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,180
Yeah, sure.

480
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:50,960
That sounds great.

481
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,880
Let me live.

482
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,580
Hey, hey, hey.

483
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,320
These guys are making me this broken down...

484
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,820
This bill is broken down.

485
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,240
Let's see.

486
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,040
For mind control, seven and a half billion dollars.

487
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,040


488
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,040


489
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:04,860
But I'm sure they spend eight and a half billion dollars for sabotage of computers

490
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,460
worldwide.

491
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,260
Let's see.

492
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,200
Eight and a half billion dollars.

493
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,020
How are we gonna pay him?

494
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:19,960
All the lonesome cowboy days in the world wouldn't be able to pay off this debt.

495
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,300
I wonder if they'll take it in souls.

496
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,300
But even then, we probably don't have more than about seven or eight bill.

497
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,020
Maybe it's time to let it go.

498
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,020


499
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,020


500
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,020


501
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,020


502
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,020


503
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,020


504
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,020


505
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,020


506
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,020


507
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,020


508
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,020


509
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,020


510
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,020


511
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,020


512
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,020


513
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,420
to use one of those four little Ukrainian nuclear weapons.

514
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,120
One of the federal built.

515
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,060
No, they did that already.

516
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,700
Damn.

517
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,960
This is your stop, sir.

518
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,640
Jim.

519
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,880
Sir, if Jim is off the bus, please get up, Jim.

520
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
I don't have anywhere to go.

521
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,920
I used to be world overlord.

522
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,080
I was president for five minutes.

523
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,180
I was in the circle of tens in your vault.

524
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,640
I know the seven demons for what they was.

525
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,220
And I know J.R. Bob knows.

526
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,360
I'll tell your story for 50 cents.

527
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,600
I'll listen to him.

528
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,320
I'll hold this sign for liquor.

529
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,200
He's been hot and old in the conspiracy.

530
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,140
I've run for the years.

531
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,760
I've been staying.

532
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,460
I was on the escape vessels for the crash.

533
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,560
I was given a special.

534
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,560
I wrote the most pamphlet number one in 1979.

535
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:41,520
I was there when J.R. Bob Dobbs was shot in the San Francisco theater.

536
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,780
There's a weird thing, though.

537
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,820
I've seen their pamphlets.

538
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,480
Just listen to them go on.

539
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:52,280
I was there when J.R. Hypercleats first launched the bleep.

540
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,160
I was a world overlord or Bob or something.

541
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,620
I was elected president.

542
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,640
1996.

543
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:03,220
Then lost it all in gambling on drugs.

544
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,160
I was Robert Ivan Stang's host of stage screen and radio.

545
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,800
No, he's on his last leg.

546
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,760
Never did make it to television.

547
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,800
But now I'm starting to take a nap.

548
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,280
I'm starting to wave.

549
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,260
Believe me, son.

550
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,740
I fought the conspiracy just like you.

551
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,080
I fought harder than anybody.

552
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,240
I'm going to show you this withered up old card.

553
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,180
Of course, first chance.

554
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,820
30 bucks is.

555
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,740
30 bucks.

556
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,580
I'm first.

557
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,740
First chance I got.

558
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,800
I joined them, of course.

559
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,260
Thought I didn't infiltrate.

560
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,700
Make Bob world overlord.

561
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,880
Just a bit off more than I could chew.

562
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,500
Give me a lesson to you.

563
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,520
Now, can you hand me.

564
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,860
Can you loan me.

565
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,160
I just got to get to the bus.

566
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,340
Get the bus back to my house.

567
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,220
I just loaned some old bum.

568
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,120
The last 50 cents.

569
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,840
He didn't loan me like 50, maybe dollars.

570
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,140
You don't have to have five, do you?

571
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,120
Because I'll pay you back.

572
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,660
Sit down, old son.

573
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,640
I was.

574
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,460
Let me stroke your gray head.

575
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,380
No.

576
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,980
I was.

577
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,940
You haven't washed your hair in a long time.

578
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,980
I was the first one to do the dog's head to the police fight.

579
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,040
And my hand dropped.

580
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,220
I was the first.

581
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,560
I will give you your money.

582
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,380
And I will drive you down to the edge of the old graveyard.

583
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,720
And leave you off.

584
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,020
And whatever.

585
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,480
Whatever sort of way you can make on your own.

586
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,620
Then you can do.

587
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,780
You ain't going to cart me off to the glue factory yet.

588
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,140
No, no.

589
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:23,960
Not the glue factory.

590
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,760
Just the cemetery.

591
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,100
It's a fine deal.

592
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,780
Take it, son.

593
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,520
You know, it just ain't fair.

594
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,480
Nothing's fair.

595
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,720
You trudged through life doing the best you can.

596
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,040
What's it all for?

597
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,340
You're getting the car.

598
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,080
Yeah.

599
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,660
Stars up there in Brooklyn shining away in the void.

600
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,660
Oh.

601
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,780
So this is it, man.

602
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,580
I should have believed in Jesus when I had the chance.

603
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,300
I asked him into my heart once.

604
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,360
He never showed up.

605
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,880
He broke the date.

606
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,320
Just shut up, old man.

607
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,080
We got four more hours to drive before we get to Philly.

608
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,980
I don't want to hear nothing more about the church.

609
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,660
It is some genius.

610
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,460
I need to use the bathroom.

611
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,940
Pull over next stop.

612
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,380
Yeah.

613
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,780
That's the last time we're going to pull over for you.

614
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,740
The next time I'm going to piss a whip your hair.

615
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,660
Now shut up, old Tyler.

616
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,940
Oh, my God.

617
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,560
There's no respect for a holy man no more.

618
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,720
You actually believe all that stuff about Bob he's talking?

619
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,960
Well, don't you talk bad on Bob.

620
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:24,900
Hey, listen.

621
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,620
I told you to pipe down that thing.

622
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,060
I don't know about Bob.

623
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,060


624
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,060


625
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,060


626
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,440
He was.

627
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:27,900
Oh.

628
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,080
Where's my teeth?

629
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,300
Where's my teeth?

630
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,820
He's not my teeth.

631
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,240
I can't see nothing.

632
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,540
What are we going to do with him?

633
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,780
Man, I can't stand all this blitting all the way to Kansas City.

634
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,760
We're going backwards now.

635
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,420
Let him off at a rest stop or something.

636
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,320
Buy him a hamburger.

637
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:44,680
Do anything.

638
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,300
Get rid of him.

639
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,900
It's no kind of a world for an old man no more.

640
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:49,780
Yeah, well.

641
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,400
Men flying around the moon.

642
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,480
Yeah.

643
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,240
Pay no attention to the troubles down here on Earth.

644
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,600
You'll find it one day, old guy.

645
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,420
Just get doping after.

646
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,480
He thinks people are flying around the moon.

647
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,140
Shut up, will ya?

648
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:03,560
No.

649
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,520
Don't leave me.

650
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,820
You've only been on about 14 planets.

651
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,340
I'm just an old man.

652
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,660
I once owned 14 planets.

653
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,360
And then I lost it all.

654
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,560
Lost my faith in Bob.

655
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,100
You lost your teeth.

656
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,040
You lost your watch.

657
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,520
Let me tell you about the sun.

658
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,020
You don't shut up.

659
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,160
You're going to lose a lot more than that.

660
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,240
You're standing down at 44.

661
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:20,800
Now, shut up.

662
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,640
There's probably more planets than there are atoms in the universe.

663
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,340
You've only been on one.

664
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:26,940
Come on.

665
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,120
I met Colin Powell in his head.

666
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,860
I knowed all the world leaders briefly back then and not to that extent anymore.

667
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,660
Hey, give him a colon warmer.

668
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,840
I used to live at the mall.

669
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,080
Pass him the colon warmer, will ya, please, before he expires in the back seat.

670
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,900
I used to live at the mall, too, man.

671
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,100
Life 101.

672
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,400
You flunk.

673
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,360
You're a fucking moron.

674
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:56,920

726
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:01,840


727
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,620
It's alright, Ma.

728
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,780
My Bob Dylan.

729
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,260
One of them Bobs.

730
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,020
Oh, sure. It's call-in time.

731
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,060
It's always call-in time when it's in Bob time.

732
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,660
And here in Jinky Town, when the bells go off, it's always call time.

733
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,380
We're waiting for our first caller all the way from Topeka, Kwasniewski.

734
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:14,300
She's a man-woman with three eyes, each one distantly located and related to another cousin who's not present now.

735
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:20,240
The man has been accused of indecent behavior with his own personality.

736
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,480
And here she is now.

737
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,120
Now, what's the squeaky noise, babe?

738
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,140
What's that noise?

739
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,400
Is that Evangela?

740
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:27,960
Hi.

741
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:28,580
Hi.

742
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:34,200
The beautiful Evangela, star of this year's new Connie White calendar.

743
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,260
The star.

744
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,640
I'm just eating these cheese curls and they're making me so stupid.

745
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,700
Well, they do that if they've been dipped in the wrong substance.

746
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Cheese curls make you stupid?

747
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:46,960
Yes, they do.

748
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,140
Where do you get those?

749
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,460
At the dollar store.

750
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,160
It's the dip that does it.

751
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:56,860
The girl at the counter was like, mmm, you buying some cheese curls and lollipops? Them are my favorites.

752
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:57,820
It works.

753
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,980
That's because of the Alsatian wig.

754
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,520
You see, a woman like that will give you any kind of strange advice just to pass the time with you.

755
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:09,420
You thought she was giving you some sort of grand directive for the future.

756
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,180
But in reality, she was just trying to bring you down.

757
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,300
When we ate them, we got stupid.

758
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,520
And then we were very, very tired.

759
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:20,560
And I'm starting to wonder if it's the cheese curls that are sold to stupid people.

760
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,960
Or if the stupid people just buy the cheese curls because they're stupid.

761
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,720
You know, yeah, there may be a...

762
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,380
Stupid people.

763
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,660
We may have cause and effect.

764
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,300
Completely reversed there.

765
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,540
I'll thankfully sell you the cheese curls.

766
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,180
I never can quite tell anymore.

767
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:37,600
Well, that's what I like about those chips and about being stupid.

768
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,900
You know, when you're stupid, the beautiful and blessed thing is you don't even know.

769
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:43,540
No.

770
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:49,680
Or you might have sort of an inkling, but you don't have enough in there to get all upset about.

771
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:56,060
You think you're stupid and really think you are so hard that you become stupid or realize you were for a while there.

772
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:56,860
Well, here's the point.

773
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,500
Well, here's the point.

774
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,160
We can work towards that.

775
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,960
I think what happened was Evangeline and her friend.

776
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:02,920
I mean, Evangeline.

777
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,160
Evangeline.

778
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,160
I know, I know.

779
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,780
I like Evangeline because I like that name.

780
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:06,960
That's fine.

781
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,900
So I'll never say that again.

782
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,260
I'm sorry.

783
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,860
But anyway, Evangeline and her friend...

784
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:10,840
I'm going to kill you!

785
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:15,880
...bought the cheese curls in the hope of becoming either brighter or less liquid.

786
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,340
And at the same time, while the sponges were decaying, they placed little droplets in their heads, right?

787
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,980
That's the first part, part A.

788
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,720
Usually it's called or entitled sometimes.

789
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,780
And then the second part was...

790
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,620
...thought they were stupid.

791
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,460
After consuming the materials.

792
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,940
Here's the point that you just made, Stan, without even knowing.

793
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,960
As you notice, the little bell's gone off and it's time to make another charity donation.

794
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:43,840
But first, before we go on to that, I have to say that you just thought you were stupid because you were stupider in the beginning.

795
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,080
And after you ate them, you became aware of it.

796
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,540
And therefore, those cheese curls made you smarter.

797
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:50,380
You mean...

798
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,380
Wow.

799
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:51,860
Wow.

800
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,080
I didn't even know I was stupid until I...

801
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:54,900
Ate them.

802
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,240
...got smart enough to know that I'm temporary.

803
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,160
...that I was stupid.

804
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,040
Eating human hair will make you stupider or smarter, too.

805
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,220
You know, I think that's how the book of the subgenius got put together.

806
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,660
Do you eat human hair on some cowboy days?

807
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,940
Well, off of a diaphragm that's been recently used.

808
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:13,640
When I eat the hair of my enemy, I gain his hair, his mighty course.

809
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,840
I lick their paws.

810
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,560
The paws of my enemies.

811
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,560
The sweat makes me sweat like a glistening uber...

812
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,420
And if you eat the hair of your enemy while he's still alive...

813
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,860
...I want to go to the store and buy more cheese curls because...

814
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,860
...they make me feel very funny in the head and stupid.

815
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,560
When you talk to Evangela that way...

816
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:33,900
Is that Evangela?

817
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,920
...that really makes her condition worse.

818
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,120
Was that Evangela?

819
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,180
You're not making things better when you talk to her.

820
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,500
It hurts down there in the head.

821
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,040
It hurts way down there in the head.

822
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,500
It often hurts down there in the head if you don't take the proper precautions or use the proper headgear.

823
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,400
And that's a lesson we learned in third grade.

824
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,000
And the third grade is?

825
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,060
Oil lever condition.

826
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,360
Oil lever condition.

827
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,060
Correct.

828
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,400
Did you take your oil protection?

829
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,060
I took my protective hat off Evangela.

830
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:05,200
I left my hat at the store and the pink hat was there until we came back...

831
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,880
...but then it was in the back seat of the car.

832
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,940
Speaking of tarts...

833
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,200
Temporal dislocation.

834
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,060
She's losing time as well as to her memory because of the curls.

835
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,140
And I think now she probably was eating rodent hair instead of cheese.

836
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:19,720
No, I'm eating Nutella.

837
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,740
You're eating a color right now?

838
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,500
Nutella. Nutella. Nutella.

839
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,880
I thought you were eating a color like you were consuming red or...

840
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,240
...smoking blue or whatever.

841
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,400
I hear ice cream.

842
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,820
You hear ice cream?

843
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,900
I see music.

844
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:39,060
Isn't it a pleasure to hang out with these dyslexic children at all hours of the morning,

845
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,680
especially when you've got a paralytic condition that keeps you awake?

846
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,480
I mean, it's not...

847
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,160
I'm sorry.

848
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:45,840
Wait, who?

849
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,980
Well, no, I just noticed...

850
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:48,720
Are you saying something?

851
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,960
I'm saying that you should wear that bracelet that they gave you.

852
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,380
Are you saying the words?

853
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,160
Is that a word?

854
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,180
A word?

855
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,380
I don't know.

856
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:57,480
I don't know.

857
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,080
I don't understand.

858
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,920
How could you understand anything?

859
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,140
But come on now, you're...

860
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,160
It's so big.

861
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:04,700
Oh, thanks.

862
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,340
Well, you know, I tried real hard.

863
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,140
I got the bending solution.

864
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:13,480
Have you ever heard of Dr. Earl Smacky's bending solution for the prostrate humanoid?

865
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:14,700
Well...

866
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,780
If Angela doesn't have a prostate.

867
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:17,660
No, I do.

868
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,480
Or a prostrate.

869
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,120
Oh.

870
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,160
Okay, well, you know, I didn't think so.

871
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,040
I have a prostatacantata.

872
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,380
She shouted off...

873
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,940
Oh, eventually...

874
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:26,840
She couldn't get out of that.

875
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:32,780
I've been meaning to thank you, Angela, for your lovely dance at my bachelor party.

876
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,360
Yeah.

877
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,680
You had a bachelor party, too?

878
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,820
The pretty girls of the church got up and did dances and even stripped.

879
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:39,820
Some of them sort of...

880
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:40,580
I like that.

881
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:44,540
They put their clothes on, which is the way a subgenius gets turned on.

882
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:50,400
They start out naked, and then by the time they're all dolled up in the galoshes...

883
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:51,740
Nanook of the North, yeah.

884
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,140
...and the giant...

885
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:52,380
Yeah.

886
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,060
The big coat and everything.

887
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,540
The old skidoo in the back and the igloo.

888
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,400
They're all warmed up.

889
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,840
That way my new wife wasn't too angry at the whole bachelor party.

890
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,520
Thank you.

891
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:36,960
and PG. That spells blind pig, don't you see? Teacher said with some surprise, son, you

892
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:47,500
left out both the I's. Now I said, teacher, dear, won't you please and listen here? Blind

893
00:49:47,500 --> 00:50:07,480
pigs have no I's, you see. You're right, teacher said to me. Root for that acorn.

894
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:30,020
Hey, I got some dirty pictures here. Don't we see any bug porno? Are you talking to me?

895
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:36,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You look like a gentleman that can appreciate a special, uh, special

896
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,700
interest in photography, we like to call it here. What do you have? Yeah, look at this.
