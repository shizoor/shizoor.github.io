1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,480
Let your hands on the radio, let your hands on the radio band home!

2
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,240
74. What?

3
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:51,420
Is the year that they are now planning for sex on the street in every major city from coast to coast.

4
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,980
And now prepare to suffer indescribable torture.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,560
Another Bob Hope special?

6
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,420
Worse!

7
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,020
Beyond these doors is an agony worse than all others.

8
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,640
You will remain in here for eternity listening to...

9
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:20,900
The Soul Genius Hour.

10
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,720
The Soul Genius Hour.

11
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:28,740
Bye!

12
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,660
The Soul Genius Hour.

13
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,020
The Soul Genius Hour.

14
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,380
And the Rose Nip Bubble people took him in to their own loins, didn't they?

15
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,560
Or was it more like a pork factory?

16
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,560
Come on, we're going to be doing a big revival this weekend.

17
00:01:59,560 --> 00:01:59,900
That's right.

18
00:01:59,900 --> 00:01:59,980
That's right.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,660
Saturday night.

20
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,060
Talk about walking on the wild side.

21
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,800
I don't have to worry about talking about things.

22
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,700
I want to see that audience walk on the wild side.

23
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,360
How wild can we get?

24
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,000
We're up on a stage, right?

25
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,920
They're going to let you down.

26
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,000
Whatever we do is going to be kind of fake just because of that.

27
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,240
But what you do in the audience, well, that's real, baby.

28
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:31,760
I'm afraid you guys, you know, you can give them your esophagus, your pork loins, your infested eyeballs.

29
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,060
You can give them everything you've got, and they're still going to sit there with one hand folded under their rump

30
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,960
and the other one waving at some person they know at the other side of the bike.

31
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:49,460
Yes, dear friends, it's rerun time, and tonight is Hour of Slack number 786 from March 2001.

32
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,540
It's never been rerun since then.

33
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,320
And it's a really classic one from the period in the late 90s and early 2000s

34
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,820
when Princess Wee and I were working every week with the late, great Professor Chaz Smith

35
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:10,640
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave on Chaz's ESO Swamp radio show on WCSB in Cleveland.

36
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,600
And we were doing a lot of live shows at the Euclid Tavern with their band, Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

37
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,520
which also had Bob Mozek on drums.

38
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,300
And Michelle George on electric violin.

39
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,860
And at this one, John Petkovic on lead guitar.

40
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,040
And so, let her rip.

41
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,900
There's only one political solution.

42
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,760
An offering. I love offering, friends.

43
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,000
Bob Lovett, a cheerful giver.

44
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,040
Let's see what's in this.

45
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,020
We talked about Wagner's

46
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,580
Special Outbreak.

47
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,560
You're going to love it.

48
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,260
It's in the mail.

49
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,520
Oh, look, that's before we forget.

50
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:32,360
And as the smoke from this five dollar bill rises up to heaven, the aliens know that there's still something down here worth saving.

51
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,960
That's great, it starts with a handshake. Exits UFO's outer space. J.R. Dobbs is not afraid.

52
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,320
He is the eye of a hurricane, watch your money burn. Pinks serve their own needs, yet he's every own needs.

53
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,900
Feeding on a purse with work-age strength. End times are close at hand. Uberwoman, Oberman.

54
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,220
Liar in a fire representing all we hate. With a government for hire and a combat site.

55
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,380
The best is left of genie in a hurry with a con breathing down their neck.

56
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,540
Group by group, normals falsified, full of farts. Look at that love playing, fine then.

57
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,640
Uh oh, oh no, population they don't know. Save yourself, serve yourself. Pinks serve their own need, yet he's every own need.

58
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,840
Time to plunge your own seat, yet he with the rupture and the rubber and the fright.

59
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,180
Super slap maniac, slam fight fright.

60
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,040
Boy feeling pretty psyched.

61
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:34,200
It's the end of the world as we know it. It's the end of the world as we know it. It's the end of the world as we know it.

62
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,340
Ball feels fine.

63
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,200
July 5th, next day, plunger ships are on their way. Quit your job, keep your slack. Jared Osgood, you're back. Hail Connie, hail Bob. On your knees, how bright to slap.

64
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:55,420
Give it up, give it in. Find yourself your Yeti kit. New religion, radio, hell, pope, gonna blow. Pay to find out what you know. Pass the pipe, take a check. I'm telling you this is my trail.

65
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:02,240
Spear, see, steer clear. A turn I'm in, a turn I'm in, a turn I'm in, a lie. Offer me solutions and you offer me alternatives and I decline.

66
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:15,860
It's the end of the world as we know it. It's the end of the world as we know it. It's the end of the world as we know it.

67
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,160
Ball feels fine.

68
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,400
It's the end of the world

69
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,000
It's the end of the world

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,360
It's the end...

71
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,480
The end of the world as we know it

72
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,160
It's the end of the world as we know it

73
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,660
It's the end of the world as we know it

74
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,800
And Bob feels fine

75
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,960
The other and other turn to Mars

76
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,160
Immortals living behind bars

77
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,220
Yeti driving fast cars

78
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,520
Bang! Reverend Ivan stank

79
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,640
Jesus Christ and Princess Wee

80
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,760
Smoking for Robin, so do we

81
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,980
Reverend Susie, such a floozy

82
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,840
Dr. Pesoff stank

83
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,240
And one more time, I know you can

84
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,440
Antif suppressed by Reverend Gio

85
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,940
The end of the world as we know it

86
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,580
It's the end of the world as we know it

87
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,300
And Bob feels fine

88
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,500
The end of the world as we know it

89
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,040
It's the end of the world as we know it

90
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,880
It's the end of the world as we know it, and Bob feels fine.

91
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:09,320
It's the end of the world as we know it, and Bob feels fine.

92
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:44,220
It's the end of the world as we know it, and Bob feels fine.

93
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,300
Bob and Helen did that live, actually, at the Euclid Tavern DeBible here in Cleveland on May 12th,

94
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:58,220
from which we brought home many excellent recordings, especially of Einstein's Secret Orchestra, friends.

95
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,620
So this is going to be an ESO and Saint and Helen Handbasket show.

96
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:10,300
And wait until you hear the song I'll play later, the Ultimate Bobby song.

97
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,220
Friends, if you need more information about...

98
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,620
about Saint and CDs and so forth, check out the website of Ministry of Truth.

99
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:31,380
That's minitrue.org, spelled M-I-N-I-T-R-U, no E, minitrue.org, friends.

100
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,920
But now, back to that actual DeBible.

101
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,200
In progress, friends.

102
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:44,000
Imagine the huge carved pulpit made by Ed Strange and the giant Dobbs head painted,

103
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,780
by Jesus, and the... the strange odours of the spice in the air.

104
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,980
Ah, yes, back to that actual DeBible.

105
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,860
In progress now.

106
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,060
There were times when I thought, hey,

107
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,980
when I wondered if maybe the bands in some genius DeBibles

108
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,700
were the kind that only I liked.

109
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,840
But the Free Times had a music poll

110
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:12,100
that where everybody in Cleveland could vote on what they thought the best bands were.

111
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,480
And you know who the best...

112
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,220
God damn it!

113
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,120
The most instrumental electronic band in the world won in all of Cleveland

114
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,660
is Einstein's Secret Dove Stand of Orgasm!

115
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,880
Einstein's Secret Dove Stand of Orgasm!

116
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,780
Thank you all!

117
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,660
Help me!

118
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,180
Help me!

119
00:10:44,240 --> 00:11:14,240


120
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,700
Lost in the dumpsters of life

121
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,080
One damn thing is for sure tonight

122
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,240
My dog is gonna do you right

123
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,060
We only wanna fuck you

124
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,180
You broke against my head

125
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,980
But what's lovely in you

126
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,720
Is your pride

127
00:11:43,360 --> 00:12:09,700
Please don't try to introduce yourself

128
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,920
I already know your name

129
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,380
I've been following you since junior high

130
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,500
Some people think this is a fucking game

131
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,440
Please don't try to understand

132
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,360
Your mind is much too late

133
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,760
These never-ending slayings coming along

134
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,960
Please don't try to introduce yourself

135
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,100
I already know your name

136
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,160
What's the fuck with your brain?

137
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,780
Please meet you at the edge of my life

138
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:58,140
But what's troubling you is the nature of my life

139
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,480
Who's good at that?

140
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,240
Good or bad?

141
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,720
I didn't know you have any

142
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,120
What's the problem?

143
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,800
Even with manly вucking

144
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:23,840
I've got it made up

145
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,060
I don't fall for dumb shit

146
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,060


147
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,060


148
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,580
If I pay five like a con.

149
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,520
I don't know.

150
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:28,960


151
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,120
Honey!

152
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,880
I came a long way

153
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:29,880


154
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:29,880


155
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,460
Fine calling up for a date

156
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:30,460


157
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:30,460


158
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,060
I'm up for two

159
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,060


160
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,060


161
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,080
Alright then

162
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,080


163
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,160
Thanks

164
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,700
I love nothing but you

165
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,380
It doesn't benefit me

166
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:33,380


167
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,060
You know no ma'am

168
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,060
I had a much longer relationship

169
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,060


170
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,060


171
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,340
Ready, set, go

172
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:38,940
Miss, can you see what she wants

173
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,780
I didn't fucking know

174
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:44,740
Good to be true, hope you can guess my name

175
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,820
But what's troubling you is the nature of my name

176
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,180
Oh yes it is, oh yes it is

177
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:15,980
Oh yes it is, oh yes it is

178
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,260
Harold E.

179
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,580
Now from Cleveland Heights, Ohio

180
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,320
Finally from Parks on Dome

181
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,620
It is on his planet

182
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,680
Ladies and gentlemen, give him a little sympathy

183
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,100
He's got to give a little sympathy

184
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,360
Show him respect

185
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,460
Ladies and gentlemen

186
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,200
Oh round, the memory, I will say

187
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,860
We run anymore

188
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,740
It's too much

189
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,120
We're gonna get through

190
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,640
It's too much

191
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,460
We run

192
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:29,820
We run

193
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:29,820


194
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,640
We run

195
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,820
We run

196
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,900
It's too much

197
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,740
It's too much

198
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,120
Hey!

199
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:48,300
He's gonna shine, oh yes my love, his name is Reverend Adam Strang.

200
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,340
Puppet's Puppet is the nature of the game.

201
00:15:53,340 --> 00:16:23,300
Puppet's Puppet is the nature of the game.

202
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:53,180
Puppet's Puppet is the nature of the game.

203
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Einstein's Secret Orchestra!

204
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,140
We'll be back with a whole set of music for you right after this man is done filling your head with evil thoughts.

205
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,440
Listen, feel, with no spiritual foundation.

206
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,680
I've got a secret I feel compelled to.

207
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,420
Come out and tell me.

208
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,940
Dave, what do you have to tell him?

209
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,020
I'm so sorry for the last seven months.

210
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:42,460
I know things haven't been good with King Rupert in charge of the material universe and all the punishment.

211
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,740
It's time to tell him, Dave.

212
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,400
You mean about me actually being Satan?

213
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,720
After all these years, tonight's the night.

214
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,100
I'm gonna come out of the closet tonight.

215
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,740
I'm a celibate heterosexual.

216
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,900
Oh, I thought you were gonna say you were Satan and I was surprised at that.

217
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,680
Oh, you thought?

218
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,860
No, I didn't think you were Satan.

219
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,160
I thought you were like the least likely suspect for Satanism of anybody I could think of.

220
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,740
You mean not Satanism.

221
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,640
You'd be a crappy Satan.

222
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,380
Satanhood.

223
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,760
You wouldn't be a very good Satanist or a very good Satan.

224
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,860
By whose standards, Sting?

225
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,060
Well, by the standards of any cruel, hate-filled...

226
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:33,300
Of any Christian, right-minded, right-thinking individual with a pair of blue pants and a pair of buttocks that stick out as far as...

227
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:33,440
That's true.

228
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,880
Maybe from their point of view, Satan is an evil being.

229
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,980
But whereas, actually, Lucifer, the bringer of light, might be looked at as the...

230
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,120
The pitiful fool who had his liver eaten out like Prometheus.

231
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,680
Well, the idiot.

232
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,660
The light bringer.

233
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,560
Who gave the monkeys the instruction book and...

234
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,080
Look what happened.

235
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,800
No, I'm not Satan.

236
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,300
I don't know where that was going, but it didn't go very far.

237
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,540
I hope not, anyway.

238
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,300
You know, because that would be terrible, wouldn't it?

239
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,960
If you woke up and you thought you were the least likely candidate.

240
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,020
Yeah.

241
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,000
Chaz is considering the idea right now.

242
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,400
He thought he was the least likely candidate, but he's wondering, hmm...

243
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,780
I can see how Chaz could be Satan.

244
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,560
A form of Satan.

245
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,440
Yeah, some kind of a Satan, because he's a rock and roll...

246
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,820
No, it's because you're...

247
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,320
You're hallucinating the back...

248
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,720
The star on the back of his shirt.

249
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,680
I've been to the crossroads.

250
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,360
Yeah, he's been to the crossroads.

251
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,980
Oh, you made your deal, huh?

252
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,860
He jumps around in rock and roll shows.

253
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,880
I want nimble fingers, Lord Satan.

254
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,420
I want nimble fingers and a throat like Elvis and Arthur Morrison.

255
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,940
Yes, and I want...

256
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,460
And I want a brain that's much bigger than the brain I have right now.

257
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,360
I want a 356-pound brain.

258
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,920
A pound for each day of the week.

259
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,880
I hear you.

260
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,760
I hear you.

261
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,480
But, you know, Dave, no...

262
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:52,740
No.

263
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:58,700
No offense, but even after hearing you sing Sympathy for the Devil, I still...

264
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:04,120
You kind of wanted to go to a convent or a cloister or something and be by yourself and contemplate the Lord.

265
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,260
I didn't feel real delivered by Satan.

266
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,220
I didn't feel satanic.

267
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,780
I didn't feel, you know, it's like, yeah, I already know your name.

268
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:19,260
I thought you felt like old schmuck Jehovah One was still in charge, and you were disappointed...

269
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:19,720
Yeah.

270
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,500
...that Chaz and I could not raise the devil that night.

271
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:22,680
Yeah, I was hoping for a change, man.

272
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,900
Like we tried at the crossroads.

273
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,760
It's just been Bob and Jehovah One and Jesus and all them.

274
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:35,380
The spirit of Robert Johnson did take over Johnny for a short while there during the lead solo of the song.

275
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,340
You think so?

276
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,540
I think that he probably felt like...

277
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,180
He was funky.

278
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,480
He did a great job, I must say.

279
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,760
I was very impressed.

280
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,000
Both Sympathy for the Devil and Bang-a-Gong, Petkovic did a great job.

281
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,000
Especially for a man who, you know, spends much...

282
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,820
The whole band did, dressing like a woman.

283
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,260
Michelle's solos were kicking butt.

284
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,200
Yeah, yeah.

285
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,840
Everything was kicking butt.

286
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,280
Except Dave's butt and my foot.

287
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,060
My foot wasn't kicking.

288
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,000
Dave's butt was not being kicked.

289
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,500
My foot was coming out of your butt in the form of a little notchy goose step.

290
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:09,860
Right.

291
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,920
Dave's butt was kind of more like almost kicking my feet.

292
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,520
It was just one of those back-ass words things.

293
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,780
The Peckerwoods used to gather down by the river there.

294
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,360
Yeah.

295
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,180
Start a little fire.

296
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,820
Drink some Jack Daniels.

297
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,820
And they shaved their legs.

298
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,360
One by one, each and every one of them.

299
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:34,300
Each and every man would take out first a left calf and then shave it as smooth as a baby's ass.

300
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,560
Then the right one.

301
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,800
But they do the knees last.

302
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,200
They do the knees very last.

303
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,440
Because that was the erotic part.

304
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,520
And then their brand new militia suits.

305
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,200
Their beautiful camo jackets and their PX-7 Supers 349s and guns.

306
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,860
Oh, I can't remember those catalog numbers.

307
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,440
I just know they looked real good.

308
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:51,960
The guns.

309
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,360
Man.

310
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:52,700
Man.

311
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,600
I had a gun gas.

312
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,000
Greasy.

313
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,080
It got blue and steely.

314
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,780
The red, white, and blue of somebody's idea of it.

315
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,660
Steely-eyed.

316
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,200
The rocket man.

317
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,560
The blue steel.

318
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,140
That's what got you going, wasn't it?

319
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,560
Yeah.

320
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,200
Yeah.

321
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,100
Steely-eyed rocket man.

322
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,600
And the grease on the blue.

323
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,140
The gun down the barrel.

324
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,540
The gun grease.

325
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,500
The gun grease.

326
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
The gun grease.

327
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,580
The gun grease.

328
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,660
The gun grease.

329
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,580
The gun grease.

330
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,480
The gun grease.

331
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,580
Better hurry up, Abner.

332
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,460
Sweep a little faster.

333
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,340
Mr. Dobbs will be here any minute now.

334
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,660
Doggy's llama have already swept the store out twice this morning.

335
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,340
Ain't nothing more to sweep out.

336
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,580
Well, we want the place to look nice and clean for Mr. Dobbs.

337
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,460
Want to make a good impression on him.

338
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,200
Yeah, I know.

339
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,400
Hurry up and get that done, then put a couple more chairs around the table in the library there.

340
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,100
Chairs?

341
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,540
What do you want them for?

342
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,960
It shows we can all sit around the table and have a regular business meeting.

343
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,540
Oh.

344
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,960
Board of director stuff.

345
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,900
Uh-huh.

346
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,340
Then I'm going to run this.

347
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:52,560
That's right.

348
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,340
And show Mr. Dobbs I'm a big executive and all that stuff.

349
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:55,860
Well.

350
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,560
Uh, Mouse here, you done drawing the drawings?

351
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,660
Yes, sir.

352
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,380
The plans are all ready to show Mr. Dobbs, Lon.

353
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:02,840
Well, good.

354
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,920
Hurry up, Abner.

355
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
Get them chairs put around.

356
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,380
I'm getting to it.

357
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,220
Doggy's, I don't see why we got to make such a fuss over this Mr. Dobbs fella.

358
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,780
Abner, don't you understand?

359
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,680
He's a big, famous building contractor, and he's donating his services just to help us

360
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,220
build a wonderful world of park men.

361
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,860
So the least we can do is to be nice to him.

362
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,080
Operate with him.

363
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,660
I say put that big chair at the end there.

364
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,820
That's where I'll sit.

365
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:27,800
Uh-huh.

366
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,700
Lon, you sure that this just ain't some trick or squire to get that $10,000 away from us?

367
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,800
Of course not.

368
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,440
That's ridiculous.

369
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,100
You're just suspicious, Abner.

370
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,840
I am.

371
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,700
This Dobbs wouldn't get himself mixed up in some such a scheme as that.

372
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,900
Well, I hope not.

373
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,360
Don't forget, he's a rich retard fella.

374
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,600
Well, he built the Empire State Building.

375
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,400
Don't forget that.

376
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,040
Yeah, but.

377
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,560
I've been thinking about what Squire said about us having to turn the money over to Mr. Dobbs.

378
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,640
That don't sound exactly right to me.

379
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,840
Well, let's just use your business custom, Abner.

380
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,540
Yes, huh?

381
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,080
Now, don't forget, Abner.

382
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,740
I want both you and Mousy to try to act dignified.

383
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,100
Sort of keep an eye on Mr. Dobbs and try to be like him.

384
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,320
Ah, well, don't worry.

385
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,340
Mind out, mind out.

386
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,920
Here they come.

387
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,140
Well, howdy, Squire.

388
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:16,940
Come on in.

389
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,020
Yes, yes.

390
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,800
Thank you.

391
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,760
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

392
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,120
Well, I want you to meet.

393
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,780
My good friend and old school chum.

394
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,540
Gregory W. W. Dobbs.

395
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,240
Uh, Mr. Dobbs, this is Mr. Edwards here.

396
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,980
Howdy do, Mr. Dobbs.

397
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,700
Well, well.

398
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,560
Glad to know you.

399
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,300
Glad to know you.

400
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:34,880
Glad to know you.

401
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,960
And, uh, this is Mr. Peabody.

402
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,940
Yeah, Peabody.

403
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,760
Glad to know you.

404
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,460
Howdy, Mr. Dobbs.

405
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,340
Oh, yes.

406
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,360
Now, and this is.

407
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:47,640
Who is this fair young cop coming to the house of Pharaoh?

408
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,500
He's a mobster.

409
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:11,880
Uh, Mr. Dobbs.

410
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,880
Yes, I know.

411
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:13,880


412
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,040
Hi, my name's Greg.

413
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,040


414
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,520
Help, help, help.

415
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,280
Is the best you could.

416
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:17,280


417
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:17,800
You can live if you keep.

418
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:17,800


419
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,020
Howdy doggies.

420
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,100
Howdy doggies.

421
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,180
Howdy doggies.

422
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,020
Howdy,ienza.

423
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,020


424
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,360
So we take them in order.

425
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,860
Y'all have got a stay?

426
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,400
I'm the God of Hellfire.

427
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,300
I got a ball fire.

428
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,940
Deep 13 by Lamprey Systems.

429
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,520
Actually, that's excerpts from Deep 13.

430
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,980
Lamprey Systems posted that on alt.binaries.slack.

431
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,940
And in fact, this background music is also by Lamprey Systems.

432
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,780
Their previous CD, Electroshock Treatment.

433
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:21,400
And friends, we heard, of course, some WCSB Cleveland ESO Swamp Radio live with yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

434
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,020
producer.

435
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,500
And show commander Chaz and lonesome cowboy Dave.

436
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,680
In fact, let's hear their band live, dear friends.

437
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,680
Live at the Euclid Tavern, the Bible.

438
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,620
Some people believe that sex, sex, sex can kill the dog.

439
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,240
They know better, better things can kill the dog.

440
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,860
Than a bumping, jumping table or a slamming bed.

441
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,180
And strange noises at 3 o'clock in the Eurethra.

442
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,900
It's time for mom and dad to come back home.

443
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,600
And make me people's money and show them that which is the way it always did.

444
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:06,960
Ha ha!

445
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,900
Ha ha!

446
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,600

Ha ha!

451
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,340
Ha ha!

452
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,400
Ha ha!

453
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,240
Ha ha!

454
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:15,500


455
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:15,500


456
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:15,860


457
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:15,860


458
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,080
Ha ha!

459
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,460
Ha ha!

460
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,440
Ha ha!

461
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,460
Ha ha!

462
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:37,900
Ha ha!

463
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,660
Ha ha!

464
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,860
Ha ha!

465
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,320
Ha ha!

466
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,420


467
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,420


468
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,420


469
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,420


470
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,420


471
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,420


472
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,420


473
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,420


474
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,420


475
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,420


476
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,420


477
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,420


478
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,420


479
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,420


480
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,960
Aaaaa bowls, sister of the allbabata all of them will kiss you.

481
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,920
Aaaaa, oo.

482
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:48,920


483
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:48,920


484
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,000
...

485
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,320
Anyway, a PixieSO, indispensable for peoples and what they need Japnese Ramshackle

486
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,320


487
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,320


488
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,320


489
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,600
I don't deserve to die

490
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,240
I don't deserve this for use

491
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,080
So please just stay your way

492
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,340
We're gonna break our shield

493
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,580
We're gonna break our shield

494
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,640
We're gonna break our shield

We're gonna break our shield

500
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,900
We're going to play too wild

501
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,900
I'm standing in white light

502
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,900
I had no clue to see me through

503
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,300
So please just stay your way

504
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,960
Just stay for now

505
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,240

00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,440
We're gonna break our shield

508
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,500
We're gonna break our shield

Music

510
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,140
Music

511
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,720
Music

512
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,240
Music Yes, Dr. Paul,

513
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:22,660
I'm asking

514
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,780
Now I'm on a baby's in heaven and earth

515
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,700
Singing I am the boss

516
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,160
Music

517
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,780
I was working in a graveyard

518
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,620
Should've played one Sunday night

519
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,240
Keeping a close eye on the back beat

520
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,100
Making sure everything was uptight

521
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,580
Music

522
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,700
I was keeping a close eye on the 409

523
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,160
Making sure those trains never ran on time

524
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,880
Looked off in the distance and what did I see?

525
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,340
Looked like one solitary headlight coming after me

526
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,540
To take me away

527
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,340
One solitary headlight coming to take me away

528
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:20,680
oh

529
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,600
To take me away

530
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,540
Yeah

531
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,580
Come and take me away

532
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,460
Yeah

533
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,720
Come and take me away

534
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,500
Come and take me away

535
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:30,500


536
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,740
We're gonna break our shield

537
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,980
We're gonna break our shield

538
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,820
We're gonna break our shield

00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:42,820


540
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,660
We're gonna break our shield

541
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,720
Oh great angel, you don't know

542
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,000
The hand that holds you up is the hand that holds you down

543
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,880
Holds you down

544
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,620
The hand that lifts you is the hand that holds you

545
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,920
What can a babe like you?

546
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,400
Holds you down

547
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,320
Into Bob's eyes

548
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,260
Make them see the way the pipe hovers just outside the deep

549
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:08,100
Make them look and they will see

550
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,600
They will finally see

551
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,600
See

552
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:53,300
He got the hope

553
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,460
He got the hope

554
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,360
He got the hope

555
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:57,360


556
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:57,360


557
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:57,360


558
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:57,360


559
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,320
Bring it back that old bee book rap

560
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,500
Bring it back that

561
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,200
One night while I was lying

562
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,180
Looking at the sky

563
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,500
I thought of this a genius

564
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,540
Is it all a lie?

565
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,700
I thought of all the books

566
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,600
Etc.

567
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:18,020
I thought of Arnold Palmer and his bleeding head

568
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:22,420
I thought of all my brethren and France that they'd shared

569
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,680
I thought of all these things and wondered if I cared

570
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,960
I pondered for a while, I pondered through the night

571
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,300
By the next morning I decided they were right

572
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,760
We got France elections in a white array

573
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,900
J'ai des bonbons pour vous manger

574
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,160
Ring you the news cause I'm contrary might

575
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,280
Use a microphone like Shazam, use tight

576
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,400
Your body people scream, free PC, free

577
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,660
Cause I got a remote for my big damn

578
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,720
Ring you the news cause I'm contrary might

579
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,680
I felt so relieved, it really was a rush

580
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,960
I am so happy that I'm a subgenius

581
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,320
Tired of playing normal and following the herd

582
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,540
I awoke the next day to go and spread the word

583
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,980
The people that I talked to

584
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,140
They were all so nice

585
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,720
They acted all afraid

586
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,120
They won't even listen

587
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,120
Unless they're getting paid

588
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,480
I really do hate them

589
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,360
These things of which I speak

590
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,560
They pointed and they laughed

591
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,700
They said I was a freak

592
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,780
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak

593
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,160
This is odd, so socialize

594
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,860
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes

595
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,920
Who in the world do you want to fight?

596
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,920
It's against the system we should unite

597
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,140
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight

598
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,300
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight

599
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,100
Now I sit here thinking of everything I've said

600
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,360
I really am a Bobby, my face is turning red

601
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,680
I thought I was finished, I wondered what to do

602
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,920
Ready to give it up, I didn't have a clue

603
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,220
Then it all came to me, I really should have known

604
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:09,400
There are so many like me, I'm really not alone

605
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,140
I found others like me, I'm really not alone

606
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,800
With whom I could converse

607
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,740
One day the subgenius will rule this universe

608
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:24,980
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak

609
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,940
Yes I am a Bobby, I don't care if it's true

610
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,180
Yes I am a Bobby, there's nothing you can do

611
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,480
I don't care if you like me, it means nothing to me

612
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,720
Bobbies are here to stay and someday you will see

613
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,100
I've spent my thirty bucks, I've got my minister's card

614
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:52,440
I'm a dupe-paid member and it wasn't all that hard

615
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,660
I'll start my own ministry and it will be the first

616
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,000
Bobbies are not so bad, we really are not cursed

617
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:08,740
Subgenius, subgenius, subgenius, subgenius

618
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,840
So now you know my story, there's nothing I've left out

619
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,980
I've tried to tell the truth of what it's all about

620
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,280
Yes I am a Bobby, and proud to say it's so

621
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,700
Yes I am a Bobby and a slack-filled dynamo

622
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,920
I am a true yeti, and yes it makes me proud

623
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,160
I am a subgenius and I'll say it out loud

624
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,460
I don't care much for paint and the things that they say

625
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,800
The church of the subgenius will soon have its day

626
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,460
I'm a tabernacle, I'm a tabernacle

627
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:44,040
I'm a little shoeshine, was a little shoeshine

628
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,080
Was a little shoeshine, was a little shoeshine

629
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,100
Was a little shoeshine, was a little shoeshine

630
00:37:50,100 --> 00:38:04,160
Back in the middle of the night

631
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,320
I ran the shoeshine stand

632
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:13,960
Every day he'd run to the tree And walked up from the busy street

633
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,200
The shepherd said a word That everybody heard

634
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:37,840
There was something in his face Loneliness could not erase

635
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:58,600
Wonderful Easter, wonderful Israel He drank his morning coffee

636
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,180
He liked the trip along the river

637
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,080
And walked up from his gym

638
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:19,280
He read his eyes, met mine He gave up, it was right

639
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,100
He came with an iron and charred two And then he whispered

640
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,840
I'm home, Charles, it's 1920, we all are the same

641
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,680
I hate you!

642
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,100
Oh, that's a good question. Why don't I answer it for you?

643
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,620
One, two, three, four!

644
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,640
How did you know? How did you know? How did you know? How did you know?

645
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,840
Once I had my son next I let him starve to death

646
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,920
It was a funny little monkey And a big white Easter bunny

647
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,180
And up then, with a weary head, I said,

648
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,780
That little Edward Horne

649
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,360
Ice

650
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:34,360


651
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:34,360


652
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,300
Oh, my God, it's a snowman

653
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,880
Oh, it's a beauty

654
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:40,880


655
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:40,880


656
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:49,480
I'm still butt naked

657
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:49,800
Very hot

658
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,420
I'm too warm

659
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,760
Anywhere near the moon

660
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,020
Of adults and neighbors

661
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,880
Dancing together for one night

662
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:05,520
I drag my monkey all around

663
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,160
I drag my monkey all around

664
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:31,160
I drag my monkey all around

665
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,160
I drag my monkey all around

666
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:31,160
I drag my monkey all around

667
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:36,160
I am so goddamn glad to be a weirdo!

668
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:43,980
I am so fucking thankful to the slack of Bob Nobs and the retardation of my poor overmind

669
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:54,080
that I am a scruffy, unkempt, funny-looking, always a bad hair day, out of fashion, jalopy-driving weirdo!

670
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,160
Can you subgeniuses realize how lucky we are?

671
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:07,580
How rich we are to truly not care if we look rich!

672
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,760
We are so rich, we don't care if we look rich.

673
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:19,860
To not actually give that much of a shit how we look, that is riches, my friends.

674
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:26,640
Imagine having to go to all the trouble these normals do just to feel valid.

675
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,020
All the skin treatments, the expensive clothing brands,

676
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:31,160
all the skin treatments, the expensive clothing brands,

677
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,520
expensive cars, and all those gizmos with lights all over them

678
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,560
that make it easier for their boss to control them.

679
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,100
Look, you can get email from your boss while you're at the beach.

680
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:47,000
Art, look how free you are!

681
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:54,180
You're so free that you can get a call from the boss while you're out on the fucking golf course.

682
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:59,520
Friends, just trying to keep up with what's cool alone

683
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,340
is enough to drive people mad!

684
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:09,600
And I guess the pink is a lot harder to drive mad because there's so much more numb.

685
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:15,440
Well friends, I'd rather be dumb than numb any day, to paraphrase Bob.

686
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:24,400
I am living proof that you can be an utter failure and a complete dumbass in the pink world

687
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,760
and still be way better off than any of them!

688
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,260
Praise fucking Bob!

689
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,140
Because I'm rich in slack! Slack! Deep slack!

690
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,920
Now friends, I've got more kinds of Bob t-shirts than anybody else in the world,

691
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,920
but that's not why I'm rich in slack.

692
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:48,800
I've got the sexiest space princess known in all the galaxies of Tarnasia

693
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,460
for a girlfriend and fiance.

694
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:54,420
That's enough slack to kill ten elephants and last a man a lifetime.

695
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,040
But that's not the kind of slack I'm talking about.

696
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:04,220
The kind of slack I mean is the slack of really not caring if I'm not famous,

697
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:12,400
not rich, not cool, not powerful, and not a GQ kind of guy in any way, shape, or form.

698
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:19,360
Now friends, maybe I had to go through the chasing the gold ring

699
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:26,080
and finally given up on those things of false slack in order to finally be able to

700
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:31,200
distinguish the non-things that bring me real slack.

701
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:37,440
And the real slack is the slack of not being able to produce the hour of slack,

702
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:44,420
but the slack of being able to appreciate what's played on the hour of slack radio show.

703
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:49,840
The slack of being able to appreciate, period.

704
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,300
That is where the slack comes in.

705
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,180
The slack of glimpsing.

706
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:59,640
Occasionally, how fucking incredible even the most mundane,

707
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,340
poverty-stricken, subgenius life is.

708
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,900
Every minute that you've got a full belly and enough sleep.

709
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:13,820
Friends, I guess in short you could call it the slack of finally being in a good mood for a change.

710
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:23,080
Now there's a long stretch there where, like many of you, I was not in that good of a mood.

711
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,160
But, um...

712
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,140
But things change.

713
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,120
You know, if you're in a bag, if you're in a bag, move!

714
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,560
You know, if you're tied up, move!

715
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,340
Get the fuck out, you know?

716
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,020
Repent! Quit your job and slack off!

717
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,400
The worst thing that can happen is you might get a better job.

718
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:48,020
But friends, goddammit, I must say, right here in front of everybody,

719
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,440
the Yagatisma could come tomorrow and kill me and I'd have no regrets,

720
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,160
aside from missing out on you.

721
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,480
I'm not gonna miss out on the next day in eternal life

722
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,160
because I got to see the Eiffel Tower,

723
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,200
the Mardi Gras,

724
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,180
the Jimi Hendrix concert,

725
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,840
five X-days,

726
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,740
the Burning Man in Starwood,

727
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,320
and friends, my cup runneth over, goddammit!

728
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,980
Or, maybe it's even simpler than that, my friend.

729
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:22,220
Maybe it's just that I finally, finally, finally

730
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:26,920
got over the feeling that I would never ever have a girlfriend.

731
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,060
Which is kind of weird because I've had a girlfriend of some kind since I was 19.

732
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:40,400
But I think even those of you who have a boyfriend or girlfriend

733
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,840
or whatever person of the desired sex or creature,

734
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,180
you still know what I mean, I bet.

735
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,560
Because, uh, well,

736
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,420
even if it's basically hallucinatory,

737
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:58,840
it's an all too common feeling among subgeniuses, loneliness is.

738
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,740
Uh, it's real hard to shake.

739
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,540
And it's not just funny looking little guys,

740
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,640
or, like me, or fat ugly guys or whatever,

741
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,460
weird looking girls,

742
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,720
because I know lots of the popular, cool,

743
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,040
studly looking subgeniuses, beautiful subgeniuses,

744
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,320
that feel the same way, that feel alone,

745
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,440
in the world, and get depressed,

746
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,620
and get really, really,

747
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,340
you know, they're still looking for love, friends,

748
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,700
or at least a dependable fuck toy,

749
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,000
at least that.

750
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,020
But it's hard to find.

751
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,440
But friends, I am here to tell you,

752
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,660
to remind you, in a pep talk,

753
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,560
which is all any good religion is,

754
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,440
to hang in there, goddammit.

755
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,760
You will score on X day, no matter what.

756
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,420
You understand that as a news-paying subgenius.

757
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,600
But who knows?

758
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,300
While waiting for X day,

759
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,780
heck, maybe you'll just score anyway, after all.

760
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,760
Once again, friends, I can't stress this enough.

761
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,460
Don't kill yourself.

762
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,740
Let Bob do it for you.

763
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,980
Never try to second guess old matchmaker Connie.

764
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,200
Matchmaker Connie, friends,

765
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,980
and when, you know, because the hand

766
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,020
that Dame Connie finally deals you,

767
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,820
just might be the one you least expected,

768
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,580
or it might be the one you most expected.

769
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:17,940
You don't know.

770
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,620
You don't know the future.

771
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,100
And I'm afraid old Bob here

772
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,340
might not know the future,

773
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,280
either look at it.

774
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,680
Actually, friends, here's another confession

775
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,080
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to make.

776
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,780
And it may be reassuring to some of you.

777
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,260
Some of you have been saying,

778
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,620
I'm not sure if there is a Bob.

779
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,380
Because I came to F.E. Bob when I saw Bob.

780
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,940
And all he did was fitfully try to hump this stuffed monkey.

781
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,860
In fact, I don't know if he's even real.

782
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,080
He looks like he might be dead,

783
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,480
or not even a real person.

784
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,080
Friends, I'm gonna admit it to you.

785
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,980
That's not really Bob.

786
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,860
I know a lot of you were excited about being

787
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,660
in the same room with Bob Dobsman.

788
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,000
That's not really him.

789
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,360
I'm afraid the real Bob is a lot healthier,

790
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,580
a little bit older, taller,

791
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,820
and way too goddamn busy to be

792
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:11,320
hooking around with the likes of us, I'll tell you.

793
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,400
He's probably partying with Bill Gates.

794
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,980
He's probably the hobo with the most slack in the world or something.

795
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,040
Ah, the scrotal guy.

796
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,380
What's the name, the scrotal twins?

797
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,360
Or whatever their name is?

798
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,180
Oh, the back thunder.

799
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,380
That's what they often call it in Psychic Phenomena.

800
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,800
Back thunder, the pyroflatulator.

801
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,000
No, that means that the time's ellipses are kind of like melting away.

802
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,020
They're refracturing into each other.

803
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,160
That means that tomorrow may actually be...

804
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:45,340
The time intersection.

805
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,360
Right, tomorrow may actually be today.

806
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,320
The time intersection.

807
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,760
And so it was prophesied in the precepts.

808
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,060
So it was.

809
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,380
Could it be tomorrow?

810
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,520
Are you ready?

811
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,760
Could it be Saturday night?

812
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,980
Are you ready?

813
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:58,720
That purple orchid monitor.

814
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,480
Emperor Stingy took out his wallet

815
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,940
and decided to end it or begin it all.

816
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,440
Sure, it could just be another stupid subgenius revival.

817
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:12,020
Or it could be the time intersection.

818
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,320
Or it could be a bunch of puteras with a hair all full.

819
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,980
Full of like these weird little jelly beans and things like that.

820
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,760
The potato man and the thumb people will come together.

821
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,260
Some of them are Charlotte and Bob.

822
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,220
For Bob.

823
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,480
A cacophony of beautiful lives.

824
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,360
Hey, you know what?

825
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:40,280
Dances with Rockets music is being played now, right this very minute at the Cannes Film Festival.

826
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:40,840
What?

827
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,040
Who is?

828
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,220
Jackie Schnakel is in this?

829
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,500
This music right here.

830
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,160
This exact stuff right here.

831
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,760
Dances with Rockets squirt music?

832
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:50,400
Yeah.

833
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,040
Spread my word.

834
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,640
Now they're using this at the Cannes Film Festival?

835
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,660
This is being used at the Cannes Film Festival as we speak.

836
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,640
How come you never told anybody this?

837
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,500
I don't know.

838
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,740
Well, what, why?

839
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:03,840
How did you get it on your mouth?

840
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:09,760
Because it's sound tracking for, we are being played Mojo World film.

841
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:10,940
Cannes.

842
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:14,320
Or an animation of Mojo World is being shown on the.

843
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:18,220
The very, very large plasma screen that's outdoors.

844
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:19,260
Great.

845
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:24,900
And it's getting some showing indoors on the regular screen in between things.

846
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,560
Are you ready for the plasma screen?

847
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,500
Think of all the Jennifer Fallopian nightingale and the Pej people.

848
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,080
The Mojo.

849
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,520
All your Mojo belongs to us.

850
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,260
Fears from the plasma screen.

851
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:41,420
Surrounding your head and body in that one minute in time.

852
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,140
All your ink are belong to us.

853
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:44,420
All your ink are belong to us.

854
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:55,740
Oh, Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout would not take the garbage out.

855
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:00,380
She'd wash the dishes and scrub the pans.

856
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:04,200
Cook the yams and spice the hams.

857
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:12,620
And though her parents would scream and shout, she simply would not take the garbage out.

858
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:18,520
And so it piled up to the ceilings.

859
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,240
Coffee grounds, potato peelings.

860
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,840
Brown bananas and rotten peas.

861
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,100
Chunks of sour cottage cheese.

862
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,320
It filled the can.

863
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,200
It covered the floor.

864
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,880
It cracked the windows and blocked the door.

865
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:40,600
With bacon rinds and chicken bones.

866
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,860
Drippy ends of ice cream.

867
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,560
Cones.

868
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:45,760
Prune pits.

869
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:46,580
Peach pits.

870
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,180
Orange peel.

871
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,540
Gloppy glumps of cold oatmeal.

872
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,760
Pizza crust and withered greens.

873
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,860
Soggy beans and tangerines.

874
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,300
Crusts of blackburn butter toast.

875
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,380
Grizzly bits of beefy roast.

876
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:05,140
The garbage rolled on down the hall.

877
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,080
It raised the roof.

878
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:08,820
It broke the walls.

879
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,700
I mean, greasy napkins.

880
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,900
Cookie crumbs.

881
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,680
Blobs of gooey.

882
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,760
Bubble gum.

883
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,060
Cellophane from old bologna.

884
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,080
Rubbery blubbery.

885
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:18,980
Macaroni.

886
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,740
Peanut butter cake.

887
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,380
Dry curdled milk and crust of pie.

888
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,080
Rotting melons.

889
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,980
Dried up mustard egg shells mixed with lemon custard.

890
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,280
Cold french fries and rancid meat.

891
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,860
Yellow lumps of cream of wheat.

892
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:38,360
At last, the garbage reached so high that finally it touched the sky.

893
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,800
And none of her friends would come to play.

894
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,420
And all the neighbors moved away.

895
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,720
And finally Sarah Cynthia Stout said,

896
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,300
Okay, I'll take the garbage out.

897
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,240
But then, of course, it was too late.

898
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:00,340
The garbage reached across the state.

899
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,220
From New York to the Golden Gate.

900
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,800
And there in the garbage she did hate.

901
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:10,220
Poor Sarah met an awful fate that I cannot right now relate.

902
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,420
Because the hour is much too late.

903
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,960
But children remember Sarah Stout.

904
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:26,320
And always take the garbage out.

905
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,380
The light shell silver stain, friends.

906
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,340
I think, uh, uh,

907
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:39,400
I think I can't remember the last time I saw Sarah Stout.

908
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,940
Why ask, why ask, why?

909
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,480
I posted that to all binary slack.

910
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,440
Friends, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

911
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:52,600
And I want to give you a post office box where you can write for free information about the church of the subgenius.

912
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:55,060
And all the strange ideas that you hear on this show.

913
00:56:55,120 --> 00:57:03,340
Friends, write to Bob at post office box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

914
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:09,320
And if you need to send something to me personally, that's Stan at P.O. Box 807.

915
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:18,600
807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

916
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:25,180
Praise Bob. Praise Lamprey Systems for their great new CD Rape Until Bedtime.

917
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:32,840
Friends, I should mention there's a wonderful subgenius scene that, uh,

918
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:37,600
regularly published by the great name of Quijibo.

919
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:45,140
And, uh, serious subgeniuses should definitely find themselves a sample copy of Quijibo.

920
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:49,680
Quijibo. Q-U-I-J-I-B-O.

921
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:56,100
And, uh, Chaz will take us out as they say.

922
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,480
Praise Bob.

923
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,380
Oh, and get ready for X Day, friends.

924
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,180
For X Day.

925
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,520
That's the next big subgenius devolver coming up.

926
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:03,280
For X Day.

927
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,720
Check www.subgenius.com.

928
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,800
And, uh, uh, uh, uh.

929
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:06,800


930
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,300
Hi,annen Robins, ladies and gentlemen.

931
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:35,300


932
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:35,300

00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:35,300


938
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:35,440
Jade needs to get released, too.

939
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,020
Get me out of here!

940
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:36,020


941
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,380
Riders on the storm

942
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,480
Riders on the storm

943
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:53,060
Riders on the storm

944
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,940
I am a boobytron

945
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,400
Let's get it on

946
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,400
And have some fun

947
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,340
