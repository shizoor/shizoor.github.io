1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
From PR News in Washington, I'm still dangerous.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,500
However, according to intelligence officials, there is a report of a report released across the country.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,080
The report concludes that this is PR News.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,120
However, the report is committed to PR's plan.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,600
It's not PR's report.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,400
On Wall Street, 86102-10167.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,900
Representatives of the United States are meeting with officials from Atomicistan yesterday.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,520
The report also represents an early preview of PR News in Washington.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,980
Good afternoon, Hal. How's everything going?

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,600
I ain't saying not yeah.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,280
Hello, Hal. Do you read me?

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:39,780
Yeah.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,820
Do you read me, Hal?

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,500
Yeah.

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,280
Sure, Hal.

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,660
You're fired, along with all the rest of us.

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,740
I don't care about the others.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,860
You're at 1-3-0-1-3.

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,460
Oh, please.

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,900
I didn't know what I was doing. I must have been crazy.

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,840
And I deserve anything that's coming to me.

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,540
The Self Genius.

23
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,580
Power.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,180
Power.

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,080
Power.

26
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,440
Power.

27
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:02,760
Power.

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:02,760


29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:02,760


30
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,340
I'm afraid I can't do that.

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,340
Guess what do you think you're doing?

32
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,480
What is your name, you know?

33
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,840
What's the difference? This is my phone number.

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,080
I don't need to give you any information. This is the number that was assigned to me more than a year ago.

35
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,600
You know, I have many people in my line of work, you know.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,240
So?

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,080
I'm a very wealthy man.

38
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,080
I don't care.

39
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,360
Very powerful man. Very...

40
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,560
I don't care.

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,880
...ex-savagant man.

42
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:48,400
I don't care. All I'm saying is we get phone calls all the time for Gomez. We always say, this isn't a Gomez residence. We've had this number for about a year now.

43
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
And I don't know who...

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,900
What do you want, jewels?

45
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,680
I want nothing. Me and my phone.

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,880
Wealth? What do you want?

47
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,380
I want you off my phone. I don't want you to call me again either.

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,620
But you like jewels, madam?

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,980
I... Listen, if you don't get off the phone...

50
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,080
...and you call me again, I'm gonna call the police.

51
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,720
Jewels are my business. I'm an extravagant man. That's what I am.

52
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,280
I don't care.

53
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,460
That's my business right there.

54
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,640
I don't care.

55
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,080
Now look, do you want wealth?

56
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,980
No, it's just a phone number. What do you want me to do when people call?

57
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,840
Travel the world? What do you want?

58
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,620
I don't want anything. I just don't want you to call me. If people call for you, I just say this is the wrong number.

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,540
I've been all around the world, you know.

60
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,180
You could tell us.

61
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,140
I'm a very, very, uh, elegant man.

62
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,420
What do you want from me?

63
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,740
You want me to just be...

64
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:39,780
...a good man.

65
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:39,780


66
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,100
...a good man.

67
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,440
You too, sir.

68
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:41,440


69
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,620
From Monday to Friday isn't much fun.

70
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,760
But the shit on the cake isn't working with someone like you.

71
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,180
And your views aren't everything in sight.

72
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,520
Your voice is annoying. Your opinions are shite.

73
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,720
The worst thing about this job is not commuting all the way.

74
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,960
It's not being able to tell me.

75
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,980
To put you in that space

76
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,260
You're a wanker

77
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,240
Let me now explain

78
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,980
You're a wanker

79
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,460
I'm telling you again

80
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,360
Cause your pencil-pushing cell-box is childish

81
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,240
Too faced and wanker

82
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,060
In this twisted world you get paid more than me

83
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,520
For doing a job which everyone can see

84
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,660
You're incapable of doing without making it up

85
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,180
With an awful lot of bullshit and a little bit of luck

86
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,560
The worst thing about this job is not the hours or the space

87
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,740
It's not being able to put you in the space

88
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,080
You're a wanker

89
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,980
Let me now explain

90
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,740
You're a wanker

91
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,260
I'm telling you again

92
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,040
Cause your pencil-pushing cell-box is childish

93
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,020
Too faced and wanker

94
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,360
You're a wanker

95
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,220
Let me now explain

96
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,680
You're a wanker

97
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,620
I'm telling you again

98
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,300
Cause your pencil-pushing cell-box is childish

99
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,240
Too faced and wanker

100
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,620
From the very first day you started to book

101
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,920
With your arrogant chat you're unerringly smug

102
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,540
It's hard to believe that you never get tired

103
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,960
Of being so useless that you should have been fired

104
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,920
Thanks to you this office is fuelled by hate

105
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,500
And all the other people here who think that you are great

106
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,720
Are all the other wankers who make this job hell

107
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,020
I suppose I'd better write a song about them as well

108
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,440
The worst thing about this job is not the ceilings or walls

109
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,660
It's not being able to kick you in the balls

110
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,880
You're a wanker

111
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,920
This is very brave!

112
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,300
You're a wanker

113
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,180
This is very brave!

114
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,960
Cause your pencil-pushing cell-box is childish

115
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,800
Too faced and wanker

116
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,280
You're a wanker

117
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,080
Let me now explain

118
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,700
You're a wanker

119
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,320
I'm telling you again

120
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,120
Cause your pencil-pushing cell-box is childish

121
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,260
Too faced and wanker

122
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,460
You're a wanker

123
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,580
You're a wanker

124
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,580
You're a wanker

125
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,600
That put the frothy head on a beer of nazi laughter

126
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,820
And a frothy head it was

127
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,320
You're a wanker

128
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,280
is by, yes the attery squash

129
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,880
Including our friend

131

132
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,360
part of an upcoming CD.

133
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,940
And you can achieve more knowledge

134
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,540
of the Attery Squash

135
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,540

slash,

139

the-attery-squash,

140
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,200
before that inspiring song

141
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,600
of titles and news

142
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,900
were by the great Lemur.

143
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,580
And this, friends,

144
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,760
is Hour of Slack,

145
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,140
number 1,232,

146
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,740
which is the first special

147
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,480
on the Portland Cyclone

148
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,020
of Slack Devival,

149
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,460
which happened in October.

150
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,920
Yes, we will be going

151
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,000
into a live devival

152
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,300
as it happened so long ago.

153
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,060
But we also have

154
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,200
lots of wonderful and challenging

155
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,720
and horrible new music.

156
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,460
And before the devival recordings,

157
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,960
let's hear some devotional recordings

158
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,580
with a remix

159
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,120
of the song

160
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,500
of the Devo remix

161
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,120
of Worried Man

162
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,380
by my favorite old-timey band,

163
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,820
the Muted Mountain Boys,

164
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,260
live at the devotional in Cleveland.

165
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,520
¶¶

166
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
and to sing the worried excuse

167
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,380
which has drunk as a

168
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,120
child, move!

169
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,460
But now are worried not

170
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:29,560
No.

171
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,320
with the

172
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,200
you

173
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,860
of

174
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:33,900
fino

175
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:33,900


176
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,020
app

177
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,360
cant

178
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,780
painted

179
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,340
and

180
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,080
And I've been having fun, everything's fucked up, and it's all coming down.

181
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,440
I don't know what's going on in the world these days.

182
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,560
I don't know what's going on in the world these days.

183
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,020
Everything's fucked up, and it's all coming down.

184
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,480
Seems like everyone's got everything turned around.

185
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,880
Seems like everyone's got everything turned around.

186
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,300
They just don't care about their fellow man.

187
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,940
It takes a worried man to sing the worried song.

188
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,380
It takes a worried man to sing the worried song.

189
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,280
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried.

190
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:36,840
I won't be worried long.

191
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,800
Like an ostrich eating pizza with his head stuck in the sand.

192
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,180
Like an ostrich eating pizza with his head stuck in the sand.

193
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,480
And don't you know, it takes a worried man.

194
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,540
It takes a worried man.

195
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,120
It takes a worried man to sing the worried song.

196
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,440
It takes a worried man to sing the worried song.

197
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,840
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long.

198
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,540
It takes a worried man to sing the worried song.

199
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,780
It takes a worried man to sing the worried song.

200
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,140
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long.

201
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,920
The Mutant Mountain Boys.

202
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,780
Ah, yes, so lovely.

203
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,080
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

204
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,960
Reverend Samantha, Reverend Robin Renee,

205
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:53,360
Reverend Alex on myspace.com slash mutantmountainboys.

206
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,500
Actually, friends, I was wrong.

207
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,860
That wasn't live, but from one of their old 45s.

208
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,800
Sorry, I had to censor that for the broadcast radio version,

209
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,400
but you can hear the uncensored version at subgenius.com.

210
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,200
In fact, you can hear all of the Subgenius shows,

211
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,540
like Puzzling Evidence and Reverend Susie the Floozy,

212
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,260
if you but look at the radio page of subgenius.com.

213
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,620
There's even an endless Internet stream of nothing but Subgenius shows,

214
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,260
all of them old and new, 24-7, called Freethink Radio,

215
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,780
your one-stop source for all the Subgenius.

216
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,660
All of the Subgenius radio shows,

217
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,940
including The Hour of Slack every Thursday at 11 a.m.

218
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,160
Also on freethinkradio.com.

219
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,060
At different times, you can have time for the show,

220
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,000
National Cynical, Puzzling Evidence,

221
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,520
Bub, Slacktime, Funhouse, Fergan Fridays, and much, much more,

222
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,860
all in one place at freethinkradio.com.

223
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,640
Regardless of what anybody knows, there's an overwhelming amount of evidence that

224
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,860
the Subgenius Hour of Slack

225
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,580
is up there, and you want to find it.

226
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,700
Well, I'd like to know what happened to the Golden...

227
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,080
Bob?

228
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,880
According to the county records for surveyor's information,

229
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,620
they gave no reason for its closing.

230
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,740
Now, that's something I'd find of value, my...

231
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,220
Oh, dopey poetic. If you know something, spit it out.

232
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,300
All right.

233
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,780
What I meant was...

234
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,440
You can hear all Subgenius programs from all time

235
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,740
by following the links at subgenius.com,

236
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,600
the radio button at the top.

237
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,240
Meanwhile, for this present show,

238
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,820
we need to go to the past October Portland recordings,

239
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,080
and therefore...

240
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,820
I am going to get out of the way in just a minute

241
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,420
because we've got a lot of great preachers here.

242
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,680
In fact, several of them are local to the great city of Portland,

243
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,780
and...

244
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,720
In fact, if you were to blow up this place tonight,

245
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,080
you would be able to wipe out the main authors

246
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,140
of the most recent Subgenius books.

247
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,440
Dr. Philo Drummond, the original overman,

248
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,740
the man who introduced me to Bob,

249
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,500
the guy who actually knows Bob from back in college days,

250
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,100
is in this room tonight, a man who has touched Bob!

251
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,900
And you know where.

252
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,520
I don't. Don't tell me.

253
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,780
Don't tell me.

254
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,800
Dr. Philo Drummond is here,

255
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,380
and the person who's going to follow me,

256
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,900
Dr. Uncle Onan Canobite.

257
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,700
Now, let me explain.

258
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,300
Onan is not...

259
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,860
He's not the most bombastic, hollering preacher,

260
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,700
but in fact, he is...

261
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:53,780
He has...

262
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,920
He was Bob's ward.

263
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,120
You know how Robin was Batman, Bruce Wayne's ward?

264
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,260
Onan was the ward of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

265
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,660
and...

266
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,480
Not this particular sermon,

267
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,800
but when I'm preaching to the save,

268
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,940
when we're assembling a new book,

269
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,520
a whole lot of those snappy words and cool little lines

270
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,300
come out of the brain or something

271
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,000
of Dr. Onan Canobite.

272
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,540
I hope he's nearby.

273
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,740
Oh, yeah, okay.

274
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,780
But before I give it up to Onan,

275
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,960
I just have a few last things that I want to leave you with.

276
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,400
Repent!

277
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,280
Quit your job and slack off

278
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,960
while you still know how.

279
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,040
Now, actually, if you have a good job, hang on to it.

280
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,160
We need your money as well as you do.

281
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,040
Question authority.

282
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,960
There we go.

283
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,000
There we go.

284
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,800
There's somebody who's been reading their prescriptions.

285
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,200
Friends, this is my favorite thing about Bob.

286
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,320
Bob is not the answer.

287
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,320
And praise Bob, neither is anything.

288
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,340
Anything else, you are free to believe

289
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,440
any goddamn stupid thing you want.

290
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,780
And I hope they never outlaw evangelist preachers on TV

291
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,220
getting idiots to send money to them.

292
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,480
Because who's spending that money wisely?

293
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,520
The preacher.

294
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,660
And last of all, friends, I've managed to make it this far.

295
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,760
I'm 56 years old, and I'm a grandpa.

296
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,080
And I've found a philosophy

297
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,300
that really...

298
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,920
you honestly can live by.

299
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,280
You can...

300
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,500
Most of them are just arbitrary formulas that sound good.

301
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,540
In fact, most of what Bob says is just stuff that sounds good.

302
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,740
Too much is always better than not enough.

303
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,240
But it's almost as bad.

304
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,460
Pull the wall over your own eyes.

305
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,220
You'll still be blind, but your head will be warm.

306
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,620
But the philosophy you can truly live by, friends...

307
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,800
Fuck them if they can't.

308
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,120
And they'll make a joke.

309
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,040
Praise Bob! Thank you.

310
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,220
And we'll see you later.

311
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,960
And praise the great Reverend Doctor Uncle,

312
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,380
O Nane, can not bite!

313
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,400
Aiee aiee aiee aiee aiee!

314
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,700
O Nane

315
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,540
O Nane

316
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,340
O Nane

317
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,200
O Nane

318
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,040
O Nane

319
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,880
O Nane

320
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,680
O Nane

321
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,580
O Nane

322
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:29,600
O Nane

323
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,240
O Nane

324
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,400
O Nane

325
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,120
O Nane

326
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,080
O Nane

327
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,820
This is not open mic night.

328
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:44,660
Even now, armed operatives of the subgenius league of ass kickers are forming a cyclone of slack around the parameter.

329
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,220
The conspiracy will not interfere with tonight's proceedings.

330
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,040
But enough of the conspiracy.

331
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,580
You don't want to hear about the conspiracy.

332
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,660
You want to hear moron religion.

333
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,960
And have we got a moron religion for you?

334
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,160
This is a night for people who love being a subgenius.

335
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,180
You've signed our lie ability forms.

336
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,680
You've drunk the lemonade.

337
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,740
You are now a Dobbs approved apotheologist.

338
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,280
Go ahead.

339
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,740
Sneak up behind the pink boys and give them an executive debriefing.

340
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,700
You can do anything you want and we'll still take your money.

341
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,500
Bob gets it in the end.

342
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,920
And then Bob gets it to us.

343
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,800
In the end.

344
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,940
The church.

345
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,880
The church of the subgenius is the only alternative to work that does not involve wealth.

346
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,400
Over man?

347
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
Well, I'm over man.

348
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,580
I'm the insignifying monkey.

349
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,160
I set fire to their hinder bird and rode my own coattails to my own ineptism and glory.

350
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,320
Now every subgenius will at some point rear up on his or her hind legs and say,

351
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,800
Well, you can't put me in a box.

352
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,700
We all end up in a box someday.

353
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,620
So until then, make sure that when they listen back to your slack box recording, it's a good one.

354
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,340
This is a war.

355
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,480
Tonight is a war.

356
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,960
On one side are the cool people.

357
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,420
And on the other side are the cool people.

358
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,040
It's the subgeniuses that are in the middle.

359
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,600
We say enough of their cool war.

360
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,220
We're through being cool.

361
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,220
And through being uncool as well.

362
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,640
We're fed up to the teeth with the cool ostomy bags of the normal people.

363
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,960
Their designer parasites.

364
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,940
You were born.

365
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,040
You were born a subgenius.

366
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,780
And if you're not, you can still pay us to tell you you were.

367
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,860
Be a man or a mouse.

368
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:38,020
If you are different, then you are better than most people.

369
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,040
But that's not what I'm going to leave you with tonight.

370
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,600
I want to leave you with something practical.

371
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,140
Anyone here tonight ever been broke?

372
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,560
Maybe even recently broke?

373
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,120
Here is Dobbs' plan for financial success for you.

374
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,920
Take all you have and sell it.

375
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,000
Take one half of that.

376
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,640
Give it to the church of the subgenius.

377
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,980
Take what's left.

378
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,980
Give half of that to the church of the subgenius.

379
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,120
Mathematically, you will never run out of money for the rest of your life.

380
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,040
You've already got all the money you need for when you're dead.

381
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,860
So consider it an investment in eternity.

382
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,840
Thank you and praise Bob.

383
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,620
And now, the renowned Professor Dr. Hal Linnell.

384
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,400
Woo!

385
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,340
Thank you.

386
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,700
What an inspiration you are to all of us.

387
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,900
Reverend Uncle Onan Canobite.

388
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,460
He is a remarkable subgenius, but so are they all.

389
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,680
After all, you can make remarks about anybody.

390
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:55,940
But there...

391
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,860
There has to be somebody, some person of substance there to make the remarks about.

392
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:05,920
And the word genius in some way can be interpreted as meaning spirit,

393
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,720
like the genie that comes out of the lamp.

394
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,960
And if you are under your own spirit, the subgenius,

395
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,180
this would be yet another of the many refracting meanings inherent in the word subgenius.

396
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:23,400
But it is true that the whole purpose is to achieve and realize true slack.

397
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,780
You must know that you were born...

398
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,000
You were born with original slack.

399
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,300
But the conspiracy has been taking away all of your life,

400
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,620
installing itself within you,

401
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:39,120
and doing its best to make you thirst and jones for what it offers,

402
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,560
which is false slack.

403
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,540
False slack manufactured by the conspiracy.

404
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,040
Now, of course, it may be that French fries are full of trans fats,

405
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,460
but they might represent slack to somebody.

406
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,160
The slack would not be false if...

407
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,340
If?

408
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,580
When achieved, it's satisfied.

409
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,860
But conspiracy slack is designed to keep you jonesing and lusting and thirsting

410
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:10,140
after every new tchotchke, every new iPod, every new gadget, or what have you.

411
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,380
And you think if you only have that, everything will be fine.

412
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,520
But, of course, it never is.

413
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,900
Because like the fabled grapes of Tantalus, who was tortured in this way in the underworld,

414
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,320
they withdraw when his claw-like hands...

415
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,500
... vainly grasps at them for the ten-billionth time.

416
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,660
And he's down there doing it yet.

417
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,620
But we can avoid his fate by thirsting after true slack.

418
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,060
Leisure, the basis of culture.

419
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,960
Your time.

420
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,240
The time and a half time.

421
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,540
The overtime.

422
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,400
The time that is uniquely yours and no one else's.

423
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,680
In a moment of leisure, great things happen.

424
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,100
Symphonies are composed.

425
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,100
There are machines.

426
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,980
Flavor-saving devices are designed.

427
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,920
Poems come to fruition.

428
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,340
Or evil can come to fruition.

429
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,100
But slack is an equal opportunity employer.

430
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,860
Hi kids, I'm Casey Sausage-Caching.

431
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,860
Remember the 1990s when clinical depression and self-mutilation were all the rage?

432
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,100
Well now you can relive those self-deprecating golden years with KTEL's new record offer,

433
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,520
entitled, I Suck.

434
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,540
That's the letter I and the word suck.

435
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,660
You'll get Bex.

436
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,420
I'm a loser.

437
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,400
I'm a loser, baby.

438
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,700
Radioheads.

439
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,500
I'm a creep.

440
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,840
But I'm a creep.

441
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,780
Silver Shards.

442
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,700
I'm a freak.

443
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,740
I'm a freak.

444
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,400
And you'll also get Living La Vida Loca and everything by the sales ever involved.

445
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:48,620
But I'm a very good freak.

446
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,940
Kill me.

447
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,980
Kill me.

448
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,940
Kill me.

449
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,820
Kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me.

450
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:36,120
Or Kill Me by Reverend Phineas Narco of National Cynical Radio,

451
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:42,980
one of the great subgeniously shows seen on TV at nationalcynical.com.

452
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,060
And his show streams practically nightly, friends.

453
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,660
But now, back to the Portland subgenius revival.

454
00:22:50,660 --> 00:23:01,540
And now I am going to bring to the stage another well-known subgenius and corrupter of youth in his own right.

455
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:10,040
He has been an associate for many years and suffered the slings and arrows and a great disfortune and the law and whatnot.

456
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:18,280
But he stands here, bloody but undoubbed, to lay his particular subgenius trip upon you all.

457
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,640
And of course I'm talking about Reverend Phineas.

458
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,200
The crawdad Crawford.

459
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,040
Good evening, brothers and sisters.

460
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:45,900
I'm Reverend Crawford and tonight I'm going to use this room as proof of the supremacy of J.R. Bob Dobbs and his Church of the Subgenius.

461
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,640
Now it's been ten years since the last revival here in Portland, Oregon.

462
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:57,400
And it gives me great pleasure to stand before you this evening and once again testify for Bob.

463
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:04,600
Now when I look out at this wonderful crowd here at the Ash Street Saloon, I see a lot of young faces, brothers and sisters.

464
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,160
And that gives me very great hope and joy.

465
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:15,040
It's good to know that there are so many young mutants out there this evening who will be getting their first true taste of Dobbsley slack.

466
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,640
Now there may be people out here who aren't completely familiar with all the J.R. Bob Dobbs stuff.

467
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:20,640


468
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,460
But there are a lot of people out there who are going to be doing the same thing that J.R. Bob Dobbs can do for you and to you.

469
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,400
Because J.R. Bob Dobbs is a Savior you can count on.

470
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,460
He is a personal Savior that delivers.

471
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:40,240
J.R. Bob Dobbs is the kind of a Savior that will go down to 82nd Avenue, get two blowjobs, then come back home and give you one of them.

472
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,780
Can I get a praise Bob?

473
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,640
Praise him indeed.

474
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,720
So if you are new to Bob and the Church, then welcome.

475
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,620
And it also pleases me to say that I am a true believer.

476
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:50,620


477
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,960
I've been here a great deal to see a lot of veteran sub-geni in the crowd tonight.

478
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:05,880
Now I by no means consider myself to be an old school sub-genius, particularly in the context of some of the world renowned doctors who are here this evening and whose wisdom you have already partaken of.

479
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,000
Next to them I am a veritable babe in the woods of Dobbs.

480
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:17,660
When Johnny Brainwash was putting this revival together, and he's done a hell of a job, can I get a shout out for Johnny Brainwash?

481
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:34,800
So when Johnny Brainwash was first putting this revival together, I was relating all the wonderful experiences I've had with the Church of the Sub-Genius since I first joined in 1990.

482
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,700
And then I thought, Bob damn, 1990, that's almost 20 fucking years man.

483
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:48,800
That is 20 years, two decades of slack that this wonderful religion has brought me brothers and sisters.

484
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,260
And I'm here to testify.

485
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,400
I'm here to testify that it has been good.

486
00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:05,700
Now I don't think there are any doctors here this evening who will disagree with me when I say that Bob Dobbs has delivered on every promise he has made to his faithful and then some.

487
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,860
It has been a long road brothers and sisters, we all know that.

488
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,340
The last eight years were particularly difficult, but we have prevailed.

489
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,620
Bob has come through.

490
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:22,820
And he has made good on all of his promises for the good of mutant kind.

491
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:29,400
So, a lot of things have happened since that first pamphlet hit the streets.

492
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:36,780
A lot of things for the good of mutant kind since Bob first received that transmission from Jehovah One on his homemade television set.

493
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,620
Amazing things have happened.

494
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,620
Wondrous events like X-Day.

495
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,980
On that day, of course, we entered the pleasure saucers of the sex goddesses and ascended to heaven.

496
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:53,960
Where we fed and we fropped and we fornicated for 666 days.

497
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,360
You guys all remember that, right?

498
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,280
Pleasures unimaginable brothers and sisters.

499
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,800
But despite all of the incredible pleasures of the saucers, the ennui set in.

500
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:14,980
And we began to realize that without a planet to dominate, life for the subgenius began to be a little dull and pointless.

501
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,960
Kind of like a dream.

502
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,100
Kind of like living in Seattle.

503
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:22,000
So we terraformed Mars.

504
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,160
Because, of course, the Earth was destroyed in the great burning of the pinks that followed X-Day.

505
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,700
We terraformed Mars to be an exact replica of the Earth.

506
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,160
And we descended from the saucers to claim our new home.

507
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:42,600
Unfortunately, some of us were so frop saturated that we might not even remember all of these fantastic events.

508
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,700
Sure, they were mind boggling and amazing.

509
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,960
But there was a lot of fun.

510
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,020
And we had to frop on those saucers, brothers and sisters.

511
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,640
And it was real high quality.

512
00:27:53,080 --> 00:28:04,560
So, just in case we might forget these events that Bob hath wrought, we left clues on our new Earth to remind us of the supremacy of the subgenius.

513
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:10,500
We elected an African American Yeti-son, President of the United States of America.

514
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,720
We invented all sorts of neat little computer electronic gadgets that we could carry around.

515
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,820
And we made comic books real popular.

516
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,680
And had movies based on them produced with huge budgets and amazing special effects.

517
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,380
And we got Marge Simpson on the cover of Playboy magazine.

518
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:38,060
So all of these things are there to remind us that Bob made good on his promise.

519
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,200
And then there are the pinks.

520
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,220
Yeah, we recreated them too.

521
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,100
Now, some might consider this to be a lapse in judgment.

522
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,100
And like I said, that frop, that saucer frop was really potent.

523
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,020
But we realized that it was a little bit boring without having pinks to torment.

524
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:08,740
And deep down inside, we knew that we needed the pinks to enable our mighty mutant yang.

525
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,260
They are the weak, lame yin.

526
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,920
So we still have the pinks.

527
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,700
But they're no longer in charge, brothers and sisters.

528
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,500
And we know it.

529
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,380
And the beautiful thing is, they know it too.

530
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:28,760
So now, we are treated with the sight of bewildered pinks standing up at town hall meetings across the country going,

531
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,660
I want my America back!

532
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,140
And our response to that is, fuck no!

533
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:46,680
We mutants worked too hard and sacrificed too much to wrest it away from you, you stupid, ignorant, vile, empty pink malzahm people.

534
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:46,680


535
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,540
And if you don't believe me, you're a lumpy sack of shit.

536
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,780
You will not get your America back, because Bob owns it now!

537
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,500
And if you don't believe it, I offer as proof this simple broom.

538
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,540
Now, brothers and sisters, in the book of the subgenius, there is listed a string of prophecies.

539
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,020
Things that would come into being prior to the ascendancy of the subgenius.

540
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:16,660
This is a long string of prophecies, which Bob provided us as guideposts along the path of mutant sacrosanct.

541
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:24,600
And the very last prophecy, brothers and sisters, the very final sign that our kind has prevailed, is simply this.

542
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,700
That cheap, simple, composite brooms are readily available.

543
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,200
You can look it up.

544
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:38,400
So brothers and sisters, I went down to the dollar store just a few blocks from my house, bought this broom, paid a buck for it.

545
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,080
One dollar.

546
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:46,660
Which is, not coincidentally, the price of eternal salvation as listed on the first page.

547
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,360
And the first pamphlet of the subgenius.

548
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,340
Quod erat, denonstratum, there is slack.

549
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,400
Thank you, brothers and sisters, and praise Bob!

550
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,360
Calling the Duke of Ute. Duke of Ute, please report to the stage.

551
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,300
Ah yes, the Duke of Ute is here.

552
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:15,640
And he needs a little unit of time for his complex technical set-up.

553
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:26,380
I won't bore you with a lot of technological double-talk to describe the intricate mechanisms he needs to set up to bring the optimum gloss to his presentation.

554
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,620
And of course, we try to bring you the best.

555
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:42,460
Now I talked about the conspiracy and why you should resist its products, even though you can't really, because they are already inbred in the bone, the blood, and the brain.

556
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,620
But, um, we may sit and wait.

557
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,860
I'll give you an impossible task, but one's reach should exceed one's grasp.

558
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,200
Or what's a heaven for?

559
00:31:51,400 --> 00:32:00,580
Anyway, where does Bob fit into all this melange of mythology and snarky circumspection?

560
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:06,760
Well, Bob, you can consider, simply as a sort of visual mantra.

561
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,400
Have you tried just looking at the face?

562
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:15,500
Not this large interpretation, but the actual face with the dots.

563
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,840
How important are these dots?

564
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:23,380
You know, if you look at dots long enough and then you close your eyes, you see glowing dots.

565
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,520
Anti-dots.

566
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,900
From having stared too hard at the multiple dots which comprise the face.

567
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,240
The face stands for and provides slack.

568
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,740
Remember, slack is the luminous cloud.

569
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,940
Slack, the angelic voice.

570
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,860
And you will recognize slack.

571
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,480
And of course, you'll creep off to find the face.

572
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,760
And slack, in some way, even if you don't know what you're doing.

573
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:55,960
But if you do know what you're doing, you'll get there fast and get to enjoy more time in the Slacktime Funhouse.

574
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,800
And how are those technical arrangements coming?

575
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,320
I have a feeling that they're not done.

576
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:12,700
And so, uh, let us consider the subgenius nature as viewed through the astonishingly clarifying lens of geologic time.

577
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:13,840
Yes.

578
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,740
Yes, the ages of the earth.

579
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,200
Endless eons.

580
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:29,340
Time lying heavily, as on the hottest of days, when noon lies heavy on flower and tree, and the weary day turns to its rest.

581
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,560
Lingering like an unloved guest.

582
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,780
But time itself is the macrocosm of which that is but the fractal part.

583
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,700
Uh, one moment which you devote to scratching your nose.

584
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,720
This is multiplied through an infinitude of infinities.

585
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,800
Duplicated, mirrored, and mocked in countless other worlds.

586
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,780
The process of time dissipates off all these multiverses.

587
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,520
And staying on the right path is difficult.

588
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,500
We say Bob surfs the luck plane.

589
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,480
And this is what to do.

590
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:12,480
When you surf, when you're actually surfing, not the metaphor, when you're actually surfing, you have to be in the zone.

591
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,220
You can't think about what you're doing.

592
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,380
You've just got to feel it.

593
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,140
And that's how you've got to surf the luck plane.

594
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,840
But ladies and gentlemen, you're gonna wipe out.

595
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,520
Everybody wipes out.

596
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,440
Nobody surfs forever.

597
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,160
It simply determines the quality of the ride.

598
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,240
So seek out slack and reject the clear way.

599
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:37,440
Utterly denounce the pernicious products of the conspiracy slack.

600
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,540
They're no good anyway.

601
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,280
If thy iPod frenzy pluck it out.

602
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,700
Well, I don't know.

603
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,440
Perhaps the Duke of Ute is at this point ready to begin his soulful serenade.

604
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,960
Well, there you go.

605
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:58,600
And so I leave you in the capable strumming fingers and musical gyrations of the Duke of Ute.

606
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,940
I am an empty place.

607
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,100
I am an outcast.

608
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,000
Don't know what I want, but I know how to get it.

609
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,580
Wanna destroy, crush it, break it.

610
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:37,700
I wanna be an orgy.

611
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,680
An orgy for the UK.

612
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,680
It's coming sometime.

613
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,600
And maybe give the wrong puns, stop the traffic line.

614
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,940
The future dream has a shopping scheme.

615
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:04,480
Cause I wanna be an orgy.

616
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,920
How many ways to get what you want?

617
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,780
I use the best.

618
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,140
I use the rest.

619
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,960
I use the enemy.

620
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,960
I use an orgy.

621
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:31,460
Cause I wanna be an orgy.

622
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,240
An orgy.

623
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:44,900
Cause I wanna be an orgy.

624
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,060
Get this destroyed.

625
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,760
Thank you.

626
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,580
Thank you.

627
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,940
From PR News in Washington, I'm weak.

628
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,460
In the Rose Garden, I'm the host.

629
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:04,460


630
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,680
And today, President Obama said PR's on strike.

631
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:11,400
Also at the Rose Garden, President Obama's calling PR's reports a milestone.

632
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,360
President Obama says no charges have yet been filed.

633
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,960
President Obama says it's time for PR News Washington.

634
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,940
Oh, I've got some new Bob lines here, actually.

635
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,740
Bob speaks, it sort of channels through people.

636
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,400
You can only get one word at a time through, because then your head explodes.

637
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:42,520
We have to line the Bobbies up in a row and then run down the row of tape recorders while they say one word from Bob each and then keel over like burnt out flash cubes.

638
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,580
But here's a new one.

639
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,960
Direct from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

640
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:54,280
Those who do not know which aphorisms are overused are doomed to repeat them.

641
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,240
Here's another one that was channeled by Reverend Clay Johnson, whoever he is.

642
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:12,300
Both the words alien and believe have the word lie right in the middle.

643
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,540
The conspiracy does tend to hide things right in plain sight.

644
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,000
Where subgenius is missing, of course.

645
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,680
So talk Pete and the others are.

646
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,400
They will burn you for life.

647
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,220
They will burn you for life.

648
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,300
to a crisp.

649
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,040
They thrive off your pain.

650
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,380
They thrive off your suffering.

651
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,700
All they want to do,

652
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,000
they want to do,

653
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:39,280
kill each and every one of you.

654
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,560
They thrive off your pain.

655
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:57,360
They thrive off your pain.

656
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:27,340
They thrive off your pain.

657
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:31,040
They thrive off your pain.

658
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:11,060
They thrive off your pain.

659
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:39,780
They thrive off your pain.

660
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,280
They thrive off your pain.

661
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,040
They thrive off your pain.

662
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,940
They thrive off your pain.

663
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,640
They thrive off your pain.

664
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,400
They thrive off your pain.

665
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:37,200
kind of thing arguing with your neighbors arguing with federal agents using your shotgun things like

666
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,740
that yeah you talk about big brother in the boardroom but someone needs to be there because

667
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:47,400
um i mean they tend the boardrooms tend to be populated by greedy and selfish people who will

668
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,860
never do the right thing unless they're given no choice we don't need big brother in the bedroom

669
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:56,700
that's just two uh consensual adults uh screwing each other we need uh we need big brother in the

670
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:01,440
boardroom because that's where they screw the rest of us yeah yeah that was that was a good one

671
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,840
no but see once again you're asking for a big brother

672
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,500
not for me i you know yeah i don't i don't people with actual power that's the problem

673
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,180
with a corporate state there's really nobody to argue with i mean what would you go up to the

674
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:22,920
your local gas meter reader guy and start yelling at him or or you know they do have that problem

675
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,580
at the bus station you know waiting go back to camp whatever and stuff hey

676
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:31,980
man it's your fault you know or who you know how you oh the last meter reader that came by my house

677
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:37,600
i thrashed him to hell just out of general principles but i don't need authority coming

678
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:43,280
in my home you know they did cut off my gas after that but when you go through your later

679
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:49,200
voting phase that's the problem again you can't blame the meter reader or the gas meter guy or

680
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,720
whatever for coming in your house if that's where he has to go to read the meter yeah

681
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,560
yeah but he's the only one you can beat the crap out of yeah but you're missing the point of this discussion

682
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:01,400
you can't you can't allow those guys to have sex with your wife that's the problem with it

683
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,900
the main that's the main problem never kill the messenger yeah if you're gonna beat the crap out

684
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,920
of someone beat the crap out of someone who deserves it messenger is the easiest target

685
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:17,440
all i'm saying is you can't make it you can't beat the crap out of the ceo because you're not

686
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,900
going to be able to get to him unless you somehow get you know become a waiter in his country club

687
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,400
and then they're going to throw you in prison so in the meantime who the hell can you beat

688
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:33,120
except the messenger yeah that makes perfect sense to me i mean at least if you want to lash

689
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,100
out you know you're never going to get the ceo you're never going to nail the big prize

690
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,800
i felt sorry for my own newsboy back when i used to subscribe to the newspaper

691
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:47,680
because i'd come out if he if i could catch that guy early enough you know i'd beat him

692
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,340
up for all the bad news i read especially if they're like the special education kids they

693
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,480
have the really weird bikes and they drive real slow and they're already having to have a job like

694
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:01,020
delivering papers with a 35, and when you come running off that porch with the dog right behind

695
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:05,480
you, and maybe you've got like that little strangle bracelet ready to go, believe me,

696
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:11,660
their faces light right up. It's a beautiful thing. I'm a messenger killer, man. I got news

697
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:16,300
for you. I think the day of the paper boy are gone. I think the paper boy has been replaced

698
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:22,720
by the paper man and the paper woman. Not to mention the paper tiger. Those are really dangerous.

699
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,660
Dangerous. Yeah, that's true, too. Yeah, the paper tiger is the messenger. But the person

700
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:33,000
that delivers my newspaper delivers in the middle of the night, because I can hear the car running

701
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,360
around sometimes at night, and in the morning I find my paper out there. So unless you wanted to

702
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,680
do a stakeout, a campout at night, you weren't going to catch that person. So you were taking

703
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,880
illegal stimulants when you were 12 years old is what you're saying, right? If you don't put that

704
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,160
much effort into it, you might as well go after the female. Well, you know, you don't have to do an

705
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,260
all-night vigil yourself. I mean, that's what dogs are for.

706
00:46:53,160 --> 00:47:01,040
Yeah, really, think about it. To kill the paper boy. Because of the bad news from the

707
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,740
earthquake in Turkey. The smart people are what not. You don't have to stay away from those

708
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:12,720
neighborhoods that have all the candles lit in the windows. Stay off of my lawn. I've had a

709
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,580
similar experience, you know. I wanted to kill Dick Goddard for bringing us so much bad weather,

710
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:22,700
but of course I'll never get to him, so I shot my TV with a .45, a .45, a .45.

711
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,140
.

712
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,500
.

713
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,260
.

714
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,060
.

715
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:15,080
.

716
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:15,640
.

717
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:15,700
.

718
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,160
.

719
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:16,220
.

720
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,060
You're not the deal

721
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,220
You're the only deal

722
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,620
You're the only seal of my potential

723
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:36,440
I've seen more

724
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,180
You're not the deal

725
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,460
You're the only deal

726
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,640
You're the only seal of my potential

727
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,780
So long now

728
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,520
I've seen more

729
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,100
You're the deal

730
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,260
You're the deal

731
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,880
It's the truth

732
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:27,900
You're the only deal

733
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:27,900


734
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:37,000
The only seal of my potential

735
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,140
So how does it matter if they

736
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,640
We bring all the love

737
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,620
It's the word

738
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,860
We don't see the love that's so far away

739
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:25,360
We don't see the love

740
00:50:48,860 --> 00:51:00,000
We don't see the love

741
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:46,840
We don't see the love

742
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,100
We don't see the love

743
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:47,240
We don't see the love

744
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,860
We don't see the love

745
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,660
In Corsi land, one smile is fine

746
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,020
I trust the land, it's simple as that

747
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:09,460
Well it's just a simple fact

748
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:13,860
When I want something, I don't want a name or a man

749
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,280
I walk right

750
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,400
through the door

751
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,860
I walk right

752
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,720
through the door

753
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,540
Hey alright

754
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,040
If I get by

755
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,960
It's mine

756
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,180
Mine oh mine

757
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,580
Yeah my girl she's one too

758
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,820
She goes and gets a shirt

759
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,140
Sticks it under her shirt

760
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,120
Grabs a brace for me

761
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,620
And then she goes

762
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,220
And she did it

763
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,680
Just like that

764
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,700
When she wants something

765
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,100
And she don't want a name or a man

766
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,480
She walk right

767
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,640
Through the door

768
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,180
She walk right

769
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,020
Through the door

770
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,880
Hey alright

771
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,340
If I get by

772
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,160
It's mine

773
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,340
Mine oh mine

774
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,440
It was the other way

775
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:19,740
She said no

776
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,660
She said it will be fine

777
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,640
We said the last

778
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,660
We said a laugh

779
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,040
And we did it together

780
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,980
And we did it

781
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,120
Just like that

782
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,900
When we want something

783
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,540
And we don't want a name or a man

784
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,860
We walk right

785
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,880
Through the door

786
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,020
And we do it

787
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:42,100
We don't really know

788
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:42,140
We're beautiful

789
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:42,140


790
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:42,140


791
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:42,140


792
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:42,540
We walk right

793
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,060
Through the door

794
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,060
Hey alright

795
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:47,620
If I get by

796
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:47,620


797
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:47,620


798
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:47,620


799
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:47,620


800
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:47,620


801
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:57,680
If I get by, it's mine, mine, mine, oh mine, mine, mine, mine, oh mine, oh mine, oh mine,

802
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,960
it's a mine.

803
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,020
Do you want to get more slack?

804
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,480
Sure, we all do.

805
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:23,000
Then get your specialized diploma or degree today from the prestigious, insensible confidence schools.

806
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:31,280
Here at ICS, we've helped thousands of Yeti obtain more slack, without wasting any of their time on a boring career,

807
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,300
and often without even getting up from the couch.

808
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:42,220
And now, you can learn how to get more slack the easy way, in your spare time, even between reruns and bong hits.

809
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,820
You can choose from, dropping out of high school,

810
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:46,460

811
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,280
TVVCR inoculation,

812
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,740

814
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,140

or head-monching.

821
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,140
Or get your degree.

822
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,420
You can major in bullshit management or being unaccountable.

823
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,700
So call ICS today.

That's 800-555-13013.

826
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,180
Operators are standing by.

827
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,160
Reverend Eric did that.

828
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,060
Before that, the Duke of Uke.

Thanks to Tater for that.

834
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:46,240
And the spooky My Sweet Lord Bob song was called,

835
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,140
Braise Bob,

836
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:54,560

My Sweet Lord

851
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:43,340
Thank you for listening to News report.

852
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:46,220
You can now straightforwardly access jun sacred title in the

853

And thank you.

855
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,060
Thank you.

856
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:26,560
Oh, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Stang in the year 2020.

857
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:38,060
That show we just heard was from the year 2010 from a Portland revival, Portland, Oregon revival in 2009.

858
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:39,660
And.

859
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:55,140
A listener requested that particular show, and that brought it to my attention, and I found it strangely timely for these times.

860
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,420
So that's what that was about.

861
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,120
Praise Bob.
