On the floor.
The self-genius.
Power of swatching.
Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?
Lying down on the floor.
The fun is over.
Oh, incidentally, friends, the next 30 minutes of the show was all done yesterday by Reverend Susie the Floozy.
Praise Susie.
The fact that some other civilizations are more advanced than we are may be humbling.
You don't understand how we live here.
You're an alien!
That's the way I am.
You know what would happen if they found out your visa had expired?
Uh, I...
Yeah.
It exists, and it's being kept secret by the same vested interests who control our destiny.
The aim of the game is a world government comprising members of the cabal who are elected by no one and accountable to no one.
And what are they up to?
I don't know.
Tomorrow morning I want you to start working on a completely new project.
What is the nature of this project?
Uh, I...
Yeah.
Who are these vested interests?
Who are you?
Who?
Who?
Whatever, man.
Well, the cabal comprises the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderbergers...
Mmm, burgers.
...the International Banking Cartel, the Oil Cartel, members of various intelligence organizations, and select members of the military union,
who together have become a shadow government of much of the Western world.
And the plan is well advanced.
Where did you hear about Project X, Dr. Hendricks?
Oh, I heard a couple of your younger boys saying something about it.
Starting tomorrow.
Oh, well, we're embarking on some sort of space program.
Space program? What for?
Space. It's freedom. You know what I mean?
Yes, I do.
Carry on.
They told me it was something very secret. That's right, Dr. Hendricks. It is an extremely secret research project.
Then there's the job itself. It entails certain, uh...
Well, you won't live in quite the same way as I do.
I know you did before.
I know this is what I want.
I hope so.
The salary was terrific, Steve.
Blood, whips, and guns. Or dollars. Take your choice.
I'm not sure.
I want the total figure of two of the nearest fifty million dollars.
Oh, that's not so much.
I'll offer you ten percent of my net profit.
Yes.
That's terrible.
Plus five percent of your corporate profits.
No, I don't think so.
I don't need your help, Steve.
Huh? Good. This is what I want.
Bob grinned.
I want it.
You want some kind of space, Bob?
No.
Yes, I do.
No.
I thought that you were applying me to help the project.
Bob's smile vanished.
I realize you've made certain assumptions about me.
Yeah.
I want you to think beyond that.
Is there no chance, though?
Of course there is a chance.
They looked at each other.
My interest is energy.
Transparency of energy.
Transparency of energy.
Yes.
Abandon all hope.
You who enter here.
I should have told you about my new project.





And it was the strangest thing.
It was amazing.
You turn to Bob.
Did you like it?
Not much.
You're lying.
Maybe he's not.
I know him.
Look at his face.
He's lying.
And then there was suppressed laughter.
I don't trust him.
Yes, Bob!
Who else am I talking about?
This man is obviously a psychotic.
The third nostril.
I'm not sure about that.




That whistling sound makes me sick.
All right, Bob is my only hope.
I think he's dangerous.
But please don't suppose I'm dangerous because I'm unfamiliar.
I ask that you believe in me.
As what?
As a friend of yours, your town, of all human beings.
That's all I'm taking from you.
Get back here, you jackal!
He should be destroyed.
Destroyed?
Yes, for our safety.
So I hear all the gossip, you know.
He got busted by the feds, numerous times.
Sure, sure.
Who are they?
Really?
Yeah.
Whoa, that's amazing.
Okay, okay.
Somebody should sue your ass for copyright.
You're under arrest!
You know you're my hero.
I've spent ten years getting ready for this day.
That is, if we don't let other forces destroy us before that time.
What other forces?
Never mind that now.
As if on cue.
I want to go home.
Well, not yet.
I want to go home.
Are you still now?
Help me!
Not later than 7am of July 5th.
It's too long.
Why is it too long?
Such nonsense.
Selling things to people who don't want them.
That's how a scam works!
I want to go home.
But please do not.
But this is a scam on a global scale!
Do you f***ing get me now?
Like a child.
Yeah, beautiful.
It's wonderful.
It's good.
Put his hands over his ears.
Blah, blah, blah.
I can't wait till that Bob-time train comes around the bend.
Make the man wish he had a third nostril.
Oh, look out, son.
Here it comes now.
We stand at a crossroads.
The tenuous slack that a subgenius may occasionally enjoy could be rent to shreds at any moment.
For the human puppets of the Elder Gods continue their senseless plunge into madness and anti-slack,
dragging us and our whole beloved planet ever closer to the brink of destruction,
be it by the nuclear kiss of Jehovah One, ecological disaster, or invasion by hostile aliens.
Which will it be?
Destruction of planet Earth, or eternal slack under the benevolent rule of Bob?
I don't know.
I don't know nothing of time like this.
We can't afford the luxury of thinking.
Hey, back off and give Bob some room to think.
You'll get to hear.
On the radio one day.
We hear most everything on the radio.
Turn something on.
I'm starting to think.
Click.
This is a Conor Brad's radio alert.
Normal broadcasting will be discontinued for an indefinite period.
Oh, Jesus! When you gonna cut me some slack, huh?
Does it worry you, Bob?
Ah!
Whoa!
Oh, my.
Yes?
Bob told me personally he will walk off this show to express himself freely.
Let him walk.
You want to make an omelet, you gotta break a cement.
What's going on here?
Bob, you're dead.
You're dead.
I mean it, Bob.
You're dead.
Yes!
And then he shut the door.
He can't do your nailing the damage as he did on the radio.
No, he can't.
Bob.
Hey, Bob.
Where you going?
I'm gonna get going.
Bob, don't leave me out here.
I wouldn't go too deep in the desert if I were you.
You might never come back.
In fact, maybe you better stay here with us till it's over.
Sorry, I gotta do this.
You come back here.
You idiots, you can't go down there.
You listen to me.
He went into the fields and into the towns and into the suburbs and gathered together
all those who despise pinks, perverts, and punks.
Silence, you perverts!
Bob, call for all of those that believe in his power to rise up and come to him.
Gather round.
They all turned to him as if they had been waiting for his voice and for that word.
High above.
He was naked.
He was naked.

He's got these eyes that like hypnotize you.
Whoa.
And then his thing.
It's huge.
It's like a rocket ship.
I dig.
Dig.
Time is running out on that big LP called life.
And the greatest disc jockey of them all is gonna come and take us by the hand and lead
us to the flip side of life called eternity.
Eternity.
I know all things beginning, end, and eternity.
Yeah, but before we grew that final date.
Before we head for that last eight bars.
We gotta make our peace.
Make it, Daddy.
Make it, Daddy.
Make it, Daddy.
Make it, Daddy.
You know I'm gonna make it.
And I want you cats to listen to everything I'm gonna lay on you as of this point.
Number one, thou shall not blow thy minds on school nights.
You're a very devout group.
Where'd you ever find?
I'm on a mailing list.
It's the church of the month club.
Number two, the pipe.
The pipe.



The pipe.
You're gonna really love this one.
It was a promise for anyone who smokes.
Will you teach us how to smoke?
Sure I will.
Sure.
Can I go first?
First what?
No, Susie.
Shut up.
I hope you're not claustrophobic.
Why?
Because it is sinful.
Hmm.
Oh, well.
Bob's smile vanished.
So I suggest if anybody's holding, drop it.
Drop her.
Ow.
Before the fuzz arrives.
Ugh.

Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, 700 tomorrow?
Good evening, guys.
Great.
I'm Italian.
Hey, yeah.
We get a bar.
Yeah.
We get a bar.
All right, boys.
Goodnight.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.

Good night.

Seeing the cards.
I see things.
He sees things.
What's this?
What?
Is that a little rocket ship of yours?
I don't mean that unkindly.
Ah!
Ah!
My ticket is open ended.
And my work here is never...
Never done.
Bob's eyes shot to him swiftly.
He was not smiling.
It's too late for this spooky .
It gets old.
I'm not gonna go back to bed.
Bob!
Take a social sleep.
Tonight's the night.
Tonight's the night they come.
It's a freak show.
Do you believe in UFOs?
We believe that the alien will come and land on our landing pad that we are going to build.
It's a structure that we're trying to raise funds for.
So far we have about...

And there are people and guests and they believe that they were abducted by aliens
and taken to Mars or whatever they call their alien planet.
Yeah!
What do you think?
Do you believe in UFOs?
Oh yeah.
Yes sir.
Definitely.
They're out there man.
I've seen them.
I've been out there.
Aurora, Texas.
They got them little graves and stuff.
Yeah.
I've been out there and...
I don't know.
I'm planning a trip.
We're going out to like Arizona or something.
We're not Arizona.
What was it?
Yeah.
It was Arizona, right?
The Air Force One where they found all that stuff.
I got pictures man.
I've seen them.
They're out there man.
And I'm flying in the plane.
I'm always hallucinating.
But who really knows what I'm looking at.
You know what I'm saying?
It's July.
Yeah.
July.
We can't wait for alien explorers to solve all our problems.
Do you believe in UFOs?
There's no such thing as UFOs.
Hold on.
I'm really lost now.
Radiation must have affected his mind.
Face it.
It's a mutation of this new atomic world of ours.
I'm no UFO freak.
If that's what you mean.
No.
He's a freak.
He's a freak.
He's really a freak.
What?
I don't mean that unkindly.
I like freaks.
That's why I like you.
Shut up freak.
Mmm.
Lord I love freaks.
Freak.
Freak.
Freak.
Freak.
Freak.

On the morning of the 15th
On a certain day called X
The sun came up at 6.45
This is a Conorrad radio alert
Set official broadcast on the 5th
There is no cause for alarm
Ah crap is that the time
Time to get out
Logan the engineer had known this would be the end of the journey

Of course that's just the start

of golden age








We're all going to die.
Then came the French purposeless movement of people.
People running out, running to one another, clattering in panic.
Armed forces blocking off the entrances to the city,
and we will take necessary precautions to ensure nobody leaves until we can contain this pandemic.
Or at least...
State and county police have set up an effective roadblock diverting traffic.
Keep your radio tuned to this frequency.
Remember, there is a traffic plan for the evacuation of the city.
All cars in the downtown area must follow the green lights.
They will lead you out of the danger area by the quickest route.
Do not try to cross the flow of traffic.
No!
This is the United States Army.
Civil defense is not apart from normal city functioning.
The same utilities involved in caring for...
the city in peace are those equipped to care for her in an emergency.
Great.
And when the siren sounds, each man knows his responsibility.
And now I would like a brief situation report from all departments on how we stand.
At the operations center, with time running out, only facts are considered.
Let's face facts, gentlemen.
There is this incident involving Vaseline.
Oh, my...
Oh, man.
That's ugly.
He did not have to continue.
It's based on fact.
Uh, Chief Simpson.
Oh, crap!
It's on fire!
Oh!
It's not fair!
Dr. Robert Slack.
We have constructed a mass deanimation facility and have nearly completed cleansing the region.
Witnesses have been located and silenced.
Local police have been supplied the misinformation outlined in film RT-514,
and it is being distributed to the...
to the area citizens.
It has been confirmed that four of these Soviet spies have direct involvement
and may be carrying on their work to spread airborne toxins.
These subjects have been captured, and information is being extracted.
It's not too bad.
I didn't even know about this.
I wasn't aware.
As the reports continue, it is obvious that the plan is working smoothly.
The place is torn to pieces.
They're asking for fire equipment, police equipment, and ambulances.
Okay.

Okay.

Okay.
and county courthouse are wrecked. Bob's staff find an undamaged office in the county jail
and go to work by flashlight. Watch your feet. I think his head is out there.
We've found parts of the bodies here. We've found parts of all the bodies,
but we've got to go back and hunt for some more. Oh, I'm keeping it. Oh,
I thought I dreamt that part.
I'm supposed to tell anybody about the secret of the man, but they're doing the whole world
anyway. So the man got pissed off and...
Our way of life has come to an end. The greater powers are coming to invade us.
Our way of life shall come to an end. They are at the door. Our time has come.
Oh, okay.
Is anyone here not a downer? Anyone?
And now, with a moment to breathe, it's time to be alone and think of the future.
All right, a show of hands. How many of you are suicidal?
No, I got nothing to live for. All right.
Wow. A lot. Okay, now...
God, you're so stupid. Don't you know anything about UFOs?
Wait a second. You think this is a UFO?
Cute.
So kind.
Space ship, right?
What the hell?
It's a rocket ship.
13, 12, 11.
Can you imagine the cost of that?
A spaceship?
Why the hell did they have to build this thing?
Stand by. It's such a waste. I don't know. It's such a waste of money.
Click.
Click.
Click.
akk l.
The matinng forums.
It's the end. It's the beginning.
Bob answered.
For a moment, they looked at each other as if neither could believe the other's reality.
Bob pressed a button under one of the dials.
Click.
Click.
A rectangle of tensely bluish light appeared on the wall behind Bob
Soもし inducting葉
a television screen to produce another version


the images now to see.
How would you like to be watching television now?
The strangest thing about television is that it
just braves in space.
On Eyewitness America
Crisis. Day one.
What's happening?
Screaming basket faces.
All right!
Telegraph poles fell like matchsticks.
Farmhouses collapsed into chips.
City buildings went down as if slashed
by a single second's blow,
with no time for a sound to be heard
by the twisted bodies of the victims.
I'm told we have a live shot coming in.
Let's take a look at that.
Well, it's just been so crazy out here,
as you can imagine.
But about an hour ago,
and I never heard no explosion.
It's just I have a huge TV,
and I kept seeing all these strange colors.
And I thought,
I walked out the door about 18,
and it looked like you were looking at
Afghanistan,
and they just blowed up two or three buses.
And thank God,
she was the only one at home.
But she said,
all I remember was I had something in a frying pan.
Could have been chicken.
And she walked away and was gone
just a little bit too long.
And it sparked a set of paper towels,
and from there,
all Hades broke loose.
And when I walked out,
I swear to God,
if this gentleman can pan over to that tallest tree,
the fireball was as high as that tree.
So you saw it was actually a place?
Oh my God, yeah.
Well, what would you call that?
50 yards?
But the garage was already collapsed.
And this was before I even knew it was happening.
And then when I walked out to the yard,
there was like 15 fire trucks.
The bedroom part of the house was collapsing.
And then,
boom,
the fireball went
the size of the house and up about 80 feet.
And thank God,
Tony wasn't home.
And she managed to get out of the house.
Can you hear what they were asking you to say?
Yes, ma'am.
But I didn't actually come in contact with her
until approximately two minutes after the fact.
And obviously, she was in a state of hysteria.
And,
they had a little dog,
and I'm really afraid the dog didn't make it,
but I don't know that.
Well, you're very welcome.
I mean, what's your name?
Jessica.
You're a very, very beautiful young lady.
We'll have more updates on that coming up.
But right now,
Dr. Bob from the Center of Disease Control
has some informative advice for people in the Red Zone.
Gentlemen,
a series of alarming events.
As documented in film RT 515,
the heretofore unknown plague.
The precise cause is still under investigation.
Victims of this plague exhibited advancing necrosis,
followed by clinical death.
Researchers from Department 37
are investigating the body's ability
to remain animated after death.
The only permanent solution appears to be incineration.
Scientists have found that applying fire to the bodies
and burning them to ash relieves symptoms
and ceases muscular animation.
Burying the animated bodies
did not offer a viable solution,
as they were able to claw their way free of the soil.
Oh, my God.
Your world is .
Yeah.
I don't want to live in this world anymore.
I don't.
I am going.
I am moving to Jupiter.
I cannot stay here.
Hey!
I am going to Jupiter.
Bye-bye.
Yeah.
So,
that.
Too late.
The day called X reaches its climax.
Ooh, hot, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
That's hot.
That is hot.
Bob grinned.
That's that.
He turned again to the sight of the Earth
tearing open before him.
Now I am become Death,
the destroyer of worlds.
How many times have I heard that before?
Tommy?
Tommy?
Tommy?
Tommy!
Tommy-
Yes.
Ah, yes.
Susie the Floozy did all that collage work we just heard.
How does she do it?
She did that just for X-Day.
How in the world does she do it?
And because this is the last show ever for, well.
It's not as if we didn't warn them again and again.
We tried because any human creature who could be saved would naturally be, well, on our side.
But it seems we ran into some kind of natural limit.
Many are called, but few are chosen.
Some plants are saved, but others are thrown with the tears into the furnace of ultimate destruction.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
And death where the worm dieth not.
Surrounded by infernal sights of crawling vertiginous horror.
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades where peace and rest can never dwell.
Hope never comes that comes to all but torture without end.
Still urges and a fiery deluge fed with ever burnings.
Suffer unconsumed.
So don't say we didn't warn you, because that's what's coming.
Only the elect will be saved.
I've got my ticket.
I'm going to be on the saucer.
How about you?
Well, friends, as you can tell, Dr. Howell is in the house.
That's me.
But you can't ask him anything.
Why?
Not yet.
Not to know.
Well, Dave can.
You have to be a member of the elect.
And who elected him?
I guess he, well, he's, yeah.
Well, in half an hour, Dr. Sinister's show will be on and we won't leave.
Then we can ask Dr. Howell.
That would be somewhat embarrassing.
And if you come to 17X Day at Wisteria, you'll be able to ask Johnny Depp.
He's taken over for Dr. Howell.
Yes, I've retired upward.
Johnny Depp thinks he can save his sorry epidermis at X Day by performing some menial duty that I used to have to do.
I let him persist in that illusion.
But as far as I can say here, between you and me in the gatepost, he has had his reward already.
In this world.
Well, he's got to make up for that stupid Tonto routine.
Yeah, that was a little bit hard.
Dave is going to be calling any second now.
And I wanted to say that although Susie prepared all that intense collage stuff last week, all night.
And all day.
Arthritically.
Hunched over.
Working her wonderful butt off.
She had originally made that thing an hour long and it was all interspersed with David Bowie song covers that were really terrible.
And I removed those.
So really what you heard was a bastardized Susie the floozy edit.
You said a bad word.
Yeah, I had to remove the.
The bad David Bowie covers.
Or it would have taken longer than an hour of slack.
And we'd never have room for you or me or Dave.
Goes on under the covers.
Sure.
You know, some sacrifice is necessary.
Particularly the unwitting victims we dragged to our altar at X day.
Yeah, I was going to say, other people should sacrifice.
We...
Have to...
Too much slack for sacrifice.
It's been developed.
A cultivated faculty.
And my slack is swollen.
Eons of time.
And I have developed it to a high degree, if I may say so.
I am perfectly, completely impervious to physical pain.
Not my own, you understand, but other people's physical pain.
Of which one might expect there will be quite a lot at that little warp in the continuum known as X.
X day.
Well, according to the weatherman, we're in for pain.
Well, you don't need one of those to know where the wind blows.
Well, I'm like Kim Jong-un.
I want to behead the royal meteorologists because they've given us bad news.
They claim that this year will be just exactly like last year.
And that we'll be lashed and scourged with heat, wind, tornadoes, rain all night and all day.
Shh.

Apparently there is a small reef under which every subgenius may huddle.
No, it'll be much worse wind than that.
We had tornadoes last time.
And we're expecting earthquakes and right in the middle of a heat spell, a blizzard.
That would be just perfect.
Beware the all-dreaded lightning flash and the feared thunderstorm.
And lightning might strike again as it did before.
When we rehearsed for this time right in the center of our camp.
And the brilliant blast flowed down the hill to the grindhouse.
Where, miraculously, no subgenius was hurt.
Cue sound clip of lightning strike.
Don't worry, folks.
Oh, yeah, we put all that stuff in in post, right?
Yeah.
We'll put that lightning in.
I have it very handy.
Well, we need lightning also for our medical procedures the next day.
Particularly our persisting experiments in the reanimation of dead tissue.
First performed by Victor Frankenstein more than a century and a half ago at Ingolstadt University.
But now, here in our private field lab,
our shambling servants will attend.
And to our every need.
That sounds pretty sexy.
Back! Back! I created you! Back!
Oh, they get out of whack sometimes.
Only as a succotinium, as a substitute,
until we actually encounter the pleasure saucers of the sex goddesses.
Is it just sex goddesses, Dr. Howell?
Well, that's good, because I was kind of nervous about them sex gods wanting to, you know,
sex me up in three ways or some kind of thing.
I don't know what these alien types are.
Well, they wouldn't do that, Ivan, unless, of course, it turned out that that was your secret wish,
because they penetrate to the center of all hearts
and know how to rip aside the veil covering the holy of holies,
your secret imaginative life of desire.
And that will be satisfied on the spot,
whether your conscious self will it or no,
because the secret...
Because...



The secrets of all hearts shall be made known
on that great day when the sea gives up its dead
and monsters walk the earth,
and in middle air the dreadful judge shall spread his throne.
Ah, yes.
And, you know, friends,
J.R. Bob Dobbs is like the Arnie Socknessium of your mind.
A great man.
He led the way to the center of your mind,
where there is a giant ocean full of dinosaurs and...
To a great man.
All kinds of cool stuff.
Giant mushrooms and...
Grow giant mushrooms in your cellar, kids.
And Pat Boone.
Yes.
Singing.
Right.
Yodeling.
No Boone to mankind there.
So step right up, ladies and gentlemen,
because we're going to reveal all.
It's too late for anyone to do anything about it.
Now you can understand what this...
Next day thing is going to be all about.
What is this?
What's happening?
Dave is calling, but you're not picking up.
Oh, Dave is calling.
Well, we'd better get him on the line.
Thank you for telling us, Princess Wee.
I haven't seen a...
No little red light came on.
A little light.
I haven't seen any kind of a...
No light.
Connection.
But rather darkness visible.
Oh, no.
No light?
Right.
No little light came on.
I've been sitting here waiting to catch Dave's call,
but apparently he's been...
Oh, look.
Now, Dave.
Dave is here.
Regular old experience.
Oh, I can hear your nostrils all the way out here.
There he is.
There he is.
And there you are.
Yes.
Man of Earth.
Sympathetic crew of...
Welcome.
Underweight, over-aged, over-militarized, hyper-industrialized...
Say, I take that personally.
...superfans.
I'm a spring chicken as far as some of these semi-immortal subs go.
Immortal culture, yeah.
Yeah, you know.
They give us the zap, the jolt, which keeps us going from century to century.
But sometimes it just gets tiresome,
and you just want to lie down in a nice, soft grave and rest
while the storms of mortality rage overhead.
Except you have to claw your way out through the mulch and the hummus,
which I understand now people eat,
in order to join the living at their pastimes.
Oh, yeah, that's what...
Oh.
Hi.

What are you guys talking about?
I had to go...
Oh, he's just talking about...
I had to go talk to Bob for a minute.
J.R. Bob Dobbs.
We get to walk around in broad daylight without disintegrating
because we put our native earth in our shoes underneath the soles.
It's an old...
And in or underpants.
That's right.
I know that's...
Oh, no.
Hal.
Now, look.
I smoked that stuff that was in your shoe.
Well, that was part of my native soil.
Well, there ain't none left.
I smoked it all up last night.
You did?
There's plenty in the other...
Well, no, no.
I finished all the last stuff off this afternoon.
When the sun comes up tomorrow, Dr. Hal, you're going to be dead.
You're the reason this happened.
Look at this.
My left foot is converted into a cloven hoof.
We call it an acute...
Right while we're speaking.
Wow.
But I'll shake it out when I get back.
There's enough in the other...
Oh, no, man.
I think you ought to do a few foot selfies and they'll go viral like the rest of us.
It's irregular.
It gives me an irregular gait, and I want to look good for certain people at X-Day.
Yes, I don't want to show myself in monstrous ugliness, but rather make the illusion stay for a few more hours and let them think all is well.
And then you...
Yeah, well, no, bandage it up real well.
Use a crutch.
No, bandages are a...
You can all hear these sympathetic noises from young ladies.
No, no, no.
They can see.
They've been there.
Bandages are a key, and so you really have to make a clean breast of things and just...
Well...
Well...
They know.
They're subgeniuses, so they know.
They can smell it with their third nostril or any other...
Well, I hope not.
Cleo Denial wears designer bandages.
Well, yes.
Her pop has a line on those things.
See, that's why I can't stand it is that you feed normans.
Yes, I...
And these others who...
Hate them.
The elitists of the crowd.
Crush them.
They are insignificant insects that deserve to be squashed.
Like pieces of little, little tiny pieces.
Or little tiny things crawling through under the roof.
But now to the hat of the inflicted.
Time?
Time to go.
And shoot them all with light.
Monsters, demons, many-headed things, and monstrous flapping creatures on black wings.
But also the regular guys and gals.
We're all going to be together at the campground.
M-O-N-S-T-E.
We are. Monsters, monsters.
Yes, we are.
Yeah.
Take that, repulsive normals.
Nelkies.
Yeah, normies.
We're going to get back at those normies.
Yes, spalpeens.
Abby Norman.
I remember that.
Abby Normal and Mal Adjusted are not welcome here.
Oh, Ab-Norm-Nighthill will be an ex-guy.
Ab-Duel personality.
Oh, Ab-Duel personality.
You mentioned him last week.
Yes.
An interesting case.
It's like a schizophrenic Sunni extremist, I think.
We differentiate them from the reanimated dead.
By the way, they started a new country this afternoon.
I've read in the news.
Skull-garia forever.
Yeah, that cult, the ISIS cult.
Oh, yeah.
Those ISIS worshippers, they've decided to call themselves the Caliphate of Islam or something like that.
And they've declared part of Iraq and Syria a new country.
Hail Hydra.
ISIS is tired.
ISIS is tired.
They're doing it.
They're doing it.


They're doing it.
They don't approve of the idea.
Well, there seem to be some arguments and mass executions and things like that going on.
I wouldn't want to turn on CNN with your kids watching right now.
It's not safe for kids to watch that kind of stuff.
Just tell them how ISIS...
Oh, that looks sharp.
Well, yeah.
It may look sharp to you, but it's breaking my neck.
Feel sharp?
And my wheel powers.
Well, the wheels might be retractable.
I don't know, but they say ISIS raised Osiris from the dead with this nifty little number.
I know what they really mean.
The scroll of thought.
It's the amazing new Horus timetable turn watch and extra degree of new inconsiderate.
And it's only $5.95 on the top of it.
But the commons read this document, which, pardon me, I do not mean to read.
And they would go and kiss poor Bob Dobbs' flesh and dip their napkins in his sacred blood.
Vast, polyphemus-like and loathsome, Bob darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith,
about which he flung his gigantic, scaly arms.
Hey, watch it.
The while he bowed his hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds.
I think I went mad then.
Again?
Again?
What?
Well, it happened a long time ago.
While we were pursuing our researches.
Don't get mad.
Get odd.
Well, that's all right for us.
For a certain experimental subject.
You see.
The monster scared me.
Holding with.
I want to turn the inner ear of the inner apparatus into our doings here tonight.
Especially the announcement of the profligate party down in Sunders, uh, uh, uh, Square Town, man.
Send me some of what they're having.
What about the prophet of Square Town?
A party, he says.
I was making fun of the mayor of, um, what's named Mayberry down there.
Party.
Oh, that guy.
The mayor.
That guy holding his pathetic small bit of authority as if it could withstand the subgenius tide of vengeance.
Well, he's a-keeping the sheriff from coming on down to X-Day, that's for sure.
Sheriff, we was just having a little fight.
Oh, let him up, boys.
Time to go.
They're just sacrificing this child.
To that huge turtle over there.
My bubbling cauldron is ready.
Who will be the first to drink its slimy contents?
I will.
Who's got the mustache cup?
Oh, well, yeah.
You know, um, holding with.
That means you want to talk Russian.
Oh, yeah.
We could do that.
Gewurst to studying.
But.
You don't need to.
I'm not a Russian.
Go for it.
Go for it.
This sounds deep.
Holding with Cagle that all life is a chemical and physical process and that the so-called soul is a myth.
Ivan believed that artificial reanimation of the dead can depend only on the condition of the tissues.
And that unless actual decomposition is set in, a corpse fully equipped with organs may, with suitable measures, be set going again.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.










In a peculiar fashion known as life.
What was that about organs again?
Well, the organs have to be in place.
But with this anti-catabolic, anti-entropic loop is what creates a nice undying monster.
What is it with these undying?
It's the spark.
The electricity.
It keeps them going.
We.
You've forgotten more than you'll ever know, Dr. Stang.
You know.
I've been working hard at that.
This was your great discovery.
You forgot.
You've forgotten many of the things.
But fortunately, as your amanuensis, I, Dr. Helen Dowell, am here to remind you that the psychic or intellectual life might be impaired by the slight deterioration of sensitive brain cells, which even a short period of death would be apt to cause.
I didn't even know boys could have an amanuensis.
Well, you can.
I thought he was talking about the synapses misfiring.
What's amanuensis?
The synapses.
The synapses.
The crackles and the pop-popses of the human brain.
They burned in the night over Orville and Wisconsin.
They burned all the night in the U.S.
Oh, those were the days.
His head was a fire.
It burned in fire.
Yeah, the fire burned you.
That's it.
The burnt child shuns the fire.
And the smoke of that burning goeth up forever.
Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.
It's me.
Pleasion has no inferiority to hunger.
Hefner has the habit of Chinese fishing.
He'll burn you out.


It's works and saying mister everything you've done in an hour for free.
The these there, Halo.

I'll see you think right.
And us, the Turnip.
Good fucking tes, Matty.


As precious as his life in the bright Paper은
I'm telling you what, respeucken your compliance period.
There, he you have it.
And how do you give that a Ш?
B free.
Never其實.
The best I can do is tell me,
That's what we're going to do.
What about you?
What are you going to do?
We're going to have the pleasure saucers of the sex god.
How are you going to spend X day?
Well, we're going to have an old-fashioned monarchy gathering.
We're going to appoint us a queen and a couple of dukes.
And then we're all going to rip our clothes off and start dashing our hairs.
Amen.
Yeah, amen.
Amen, indeed.
And we're going to praise the Lord while we're doing that.
And pass the ammunition?
And pass the onions, because we're on a mighty fight.
Look at this.
This is my personal side grime.
It's a Stahlgrat 16.
Nifty little number.
Can discharge a million mini-ampoules in one nanosecond.
Right into the gaping wound created by my special blue Whistler pistol.
Pistol.
Oh, I think I passed an ammunition.
That's all right.
Just somebody open a window.
Okay.
Just do it.
Yes, this is a...
For some reason, a lapse of memory.
I forget the name of this one.
But not only do you get a number of shots,
but you also can fire a shotgun shell and send a round of blue Whistlers.
So you are having an electro shot this year?
You're offering an electro shot?
I thought I was over that old thing.
I've already been reoriented.
But we do have it for the recalcitrant, the namby-pamby,
and those with regressive pinkish tendencies.
Nelkies and normals.
They're only a far thing.
They're past an apenny-penny or something very, very inexpensive.
Past is not over.
The past is not even past.
As Faulkner said,
No, one thing there will always be more of in the future is the past.
Until there is no room for anything else.
And then the future will be over.
And the past.
Time.
I'm a fencing seeper.
And all will be sucked into Bob's pipe
to join with the smoke of the frog
which riseth up to heaven
as Bob exhales or passes his ammunition.
Do you think I'll ever get to smoke some of that frog there, Grandpa?
Come on, you can let me know.
I'm a big boy.
And I can teach you.
No, that's upside down, isn't it?
Aww, isn't that cute?
Time to keep dancing, I say.
Dance! Dance!
Once we get rid of all these purple-skinned and blue-eyed monsters,
Oh, you can see them too?
we're gonna really, really make some money here in Sheds and Hughes and Platt.
Stop trying to make money.
That is something which is going to end on X-Day.
No money will be necessary any...
No, I'm... I'm...
I'm gonna miss worrying about money.
The predicted subgenius econoclasm.
Well, it's just something I'm so used to.
But it is the basis of all our woes.
You know, it is idolatrous to worship money,
and our entire world is in the grip of this supernatural force.
Well, but most of us have...
Something which does not actually exist.
Money.
That's right, because money is an abstraction itself of labor value.
And I don't want to sound like Tovaris or none of them guys.
Especially these new Groucho concepts and stuff.
It's too hard to grasp right now, but they certainly have us, Tovaris.
They sure do.
We have Stockholm Syndrome.
We love our prison... our warders, our jailers, the conspiracy.
That's why so many are...
When the time comes to lift off into outer space with the Xs,
you know, you can have anything you can imagine,
but a lot of subgeniuses won't imagine anything different from their...
cruddy apartment and their cruddy job.
Identifying with the old present.
They'll be on the sausage, but they'll just be going through the same old motions.
But haven't all of our imaginations been compromised by now?
Aren't we kind of... on the edge of everything?
Maybe primitive imaginations, such as the pinks think they are exercising,
but not true imagination.
What the romantic poets called fancy.
In other words, just fantasy castle building.
What a believer.

Creating imaginary scenarios where they achieve sexual success
or some measure of power over their fellow beings.
Not like us.
No.
You're talking about those OTO people, right?
Yes, exactly.
They already have their reward.
But we are to receive ours in a matter of a few short days.
Isn't that what Bob said last year, though, about this time?
Well, he was testing us.
It was a great X day, though.
I remember it.
Nothing I could have imagined would be in any way comparable to this.
I saw the demonic, blasphemous reality that I saw,
or believed I saw, last year at Wisteria.
I saw them, the subgeniuses, in a limitless stream,
flopping, hopping, croaking, bleating, urging inhumanly
through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque, malignant
of fantastic nightmare.
Well, they lack in grace what they possess in enthusiasm.
That's right.
They hopped and bleated into those fires just like we wanted them to.
Flapping their flippers.
But they will be given new bodies after X day.
At least that's what we tell them.
They pay extra for that.
They're happy to.
Well, we need every bit, as long as we do respect Moloch and Mammon
and those other creations.
But those gods will have to take a powder.
Render unto P-Dog that which is P-Dog's.
You ever seen a...
A personal check with a Bible verse on it?
I don't have them on mine, but yes, I have seen them.
But that's all part of these imbeciles with their prosperity gospel.
Yeah, once upon a time I worked at a job where I used to handle a lot of personal checks,
and I thought it was hilarious when I saw personal checks with Bible verses on them.
And I think that's in the book of Matthew,
where it says you can serve the Lord or you can serve Mammon,
but you cannot serve both.
So obviously they've decided what to do since they're about to write a check.
If you're gonna put a Bible verse on a check,
that should be the Bible verse.
In the Bible it says thou canst not both serve God and Mammon.
Even if you get a tattoo of Jesus, it's still heathen.
Thou shalt always walk this way.
Well, walk this way in the service of the Lord.
In the stupor of the Lord.
In the swooping...
A divine stupor.
...bender from a young...
...hungry...
...hungry...
Unless we went off the gold standard,
the existence of the dollar is proof that there is a God.
We know that God is the ultimate source of all dollars.
No, this is a supernatural invisible force which controls our world.
Supernatural because it does not actually have existence,
but a force because it controls everything.
Money is no longer keyed to any kind of actual standard of reality.
It has to do with millions of megabits-ls of information...
Philo said it was that...
...mated and destroyed with each nanosecond.
Philo said it was that invisible hand guy.
He should know, because...
I put all my money into doge coins.
Philo is right there at the heart of the nexus of the conspiracy.
So he knows.
There's some pause on top, but I don't know if there are any hands mixed in the follicle.
Let us pause.
Let's say a clove and hoof or two pushing a chest forward.
Hey, no personal remarks, buddy.
I'm going to get rid of this as soon as I can take the antidote.
Well, I'm not saying you're pushing the world around with your foot.
I'm just making fun of those with clove and hoof.
Yeah, but Ivan didn't know.
He took my dirt, and now I got my hoof, and I'll have to fix it up when I get back.
You have a disease that cannot be cured, my friend.
It is not a disease.
It's nothing more than a smelly old barbecue foot.
No, it's just a reversion, as it were, to one's trans-natural state.
It happens to us all.
You should see Ivan Stang when he forgets to take his...
Yeah, but you certainly got a revision when it comes to political theory and economics right now.
Well, we don't want to give away the store.
After all, remember, it's almost too late.
I suppose someone could...
Is it possible, Ivan?
They could still send in $35 and...
Yes, as a matter of fact, whether or not they get that subgenius membership card in the mail,
they are in the book of life at the moment that that PayPal button is pushed,
the one that says, send money.
Happy to see that there is a way out.
At that moment.
Checking the mail's postmark.
If you waited until 6-59, July 5th, 1998,
which we're hoping will be this upcoming Saturday morning,
That's close.
If 6-59, if you hit that PayPal button, you're in.
Your friends are either on the saucers or you're off the saucers.
And with that button push, you are on that saucer.
You know, some of us, and I'm one of those guys,
I'm always nervous about missing a plane or a train.
I like to be there plenty of time beforehand.
And you guys who wait to the last minute,
what would happen if you got shut off?
And you saw...
You saw the great adamantium doors sliding closed to clang in their valves
and the huge saucer ships ascending without you.
It'd feel like you were left off Noah's freaking ark.
But of course, we know from intense Bible study
that the Lord said he'd never send another giant flood
and there was no need to build an ark.
He said there'd never be another water inundation.
But he also said that there would be a fire inundation.
Coming soon in the fire age.
Being God means never having to say you're sorry.
Well, speaking of the end of the world and the end of all things,
it's almost the end of this show.
It's almost the end.
And there is an end to this show.
And it justifies the means.
With Susie the Fleece's final collage work,
which I'm about to play, no matter what anybody else says.
However, in...
By all her stunning grace.
Either next week or in the next ten minutes,
this show will somehow go on
because we're not going to leave the station.
So, friends...
How about that?
Tune in next week or in the next five minutes.
Same with you, Dave.
And we shall meet again.
In the place where there is no darkness.
Don't know when.
But I know we'll meet again, Josh.
And with that, we go back.
To Susie's work.
We are now approaching Planet X.
Be very careful.
Yes, sir.
Situation report.
I sure wish I had some company and some good dope.
Otherwise, I feel fine.
Making adjustments on a course right for Planet X.
And there's the planet.
That sandy-colored semi-sphere tilting up on the left there.
Focus out now there on the surface.
Looks like Pismo Beach out there.
We're coming in fast.
Woo-hoo!
Yeah!
Great job!
Great job!
Congratulations, Bob.
Thank you.
Thank you.





I'll admit, I thought you were bloody marvelous.
For he's a jolly good fellow.
Not so fast, Bob!
Oh, hi, guys.
You have something you want to say?
That's right, Bob.
What is it this time, Bob?
They looked at Bob in terror.
The playboy juggled the books.
This is an outrage.
I would like to stay for the record.
I've been had, I've been had, I've been had, had, had, had, had.
No!
No!
Fine!
And I'm alive!
Brian Barnes has !!
Young.

She's doing your mail!
Here, you gotta pay up erosion!
No way!
I'm out of your balls!
Got to shit.
Oh my God.
Oh, nice job.
This is insane.
My neck is running in shніo...
24 hours hasensitive.
23 hours an hour?


If you're trying to stop the�く
this time.
Excuse me?

What the hell is going on?
At that point, it was every man for himself.
What's going on? I got no go here.
We just lost power, like all of it.
Way to go.
Someone get down to the engine room and find out what the hell happened.
No, no way. That place is spooky.
Do you pay these people?
A secret sky patch or some such nonsense?
They looked at each other.
Bowie.
This is my place.
Come on, I want to go with you.
I don't love you.
Meanwhile, in time stands still land.
Flung from side to side, Logan the Engineer fought to pull the ship into a glide
for an attempt to make a belly.
Whatever, man.
Boy, was that a crash.
Had some problems landing my ship.
Great. Now what?
I think I've got athletes for you.
Shut up!
So, we're a bit stuck.
You're stuck, yeah?
Stuck?
Much.
And the irony is that...
I'll never get off.
Where's Bob?
Where is he?
Where's Bob?
He's gone.
He didn't leave.
He went to the store.
It had only been a matter of time.
The Smiler had been humoring them.
It was a joke.
Some joke.
He stole my gold tooth the night he left.
God, how cliche can one man get?
Oh, that's dumb.
We've been set up from the start.
We'd have probably treated you the same if you'd come over to our place.
Bob's right about you.
You're not a man at all.
I want you to go.

Now, Tom!
Oh, look at these guys.
Now, Tom!
Lord, I love you.
Get on up.
Let me help you up.
Oh, I just had to kick you in the diddly again.
How's your diddly?
Hope I broke it.
He turned away.
Well, you've got to run, love.
Fish is cute as squash.
Strangers jerks are cute.
You know how it tastes.
Both of you.
Tom!
He waved his arms in some shapeless gesture of farewell and ran out of the room.
What did we miss?
We missed the fish.








Blah, blah, blah.
End of the world.
Life on other planets.
Blah, blah, blah.
The guy from Labyrinth turned into a bird!
I want my pants.
I need my pee.
No matter what happens to Bob, we have our own lives to live.
Where are you going to go?
I don't know.
But I'm going to go someplace as far away from here as we can get.
I guess you're right.
I'm afraid the joke's on us.
The police will find out eventually.
But don't worry.
They cannot arrest all of us because we all have stupid friends.
Now to get me some fish.





I'll get you some caveman hookers.
This is the first thing anyone said that makes sense.
They're ready.
If there really were a day called X. How about you?
I ask you.
Is there anybody here as happy as I am?
