1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:07,240
Remember, people watch the line of drinking to make sure you have alcohol and fire on every level of your home.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:13,400
Remember, if someone in your household smokes or is under the influence of fire, you must be aware of Ontario.

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,660
Remember, I'm a dangerous drinker.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,760
Remember, there's more to responsible drinking than alcohol and fire on every level of your home.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,440
Remember.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,240
Hour of Slack.

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:48,740
Uh, yes dear friends, for about six months I've been collecting sounds for an Hour of Slack special on the subject of pagans and also the Starwood Neopagan Festival.

8
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,240
This is not that show.

9
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,420
For I swear.

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,660
I'm not done with it.

11
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,500
Yet it must be perfect.

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,860
And also I'm working on some videos.

13
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:17,280
And so this Hour of Slack number 924 will be a rerun, but not of an Hour of Slack, but of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse from Lymphnode Institute on WREK Atlanta.

14
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,120
Greatest of all college stations.

15
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,060
Press company excluded.

16
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,160
Oh.

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,420
Oh.

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:31,500
And so on from there, on the subject, which relates to pagans and the Neopagan festivals, which is fire...

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,400
Lymphnode Institute does fire.

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,320
By the way, the music in the background here is by Automattic Robot Fish.

21
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,460
Also known as Rev. Angry Larry.

22
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,640
And now, Lymphnode Institute.

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:47,900
Institute.

24
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,200
This time it really is Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,560
The Lymphnode Institute Edition.

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,180
You are listening to 91.1 FM, WREK Atlanta.

27
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,140
The student voice of Georgia Tech.

28
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,740
Fire.

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,600
You can't yell fire in a movie theater.

30
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,420
Well, you can, but people will be upset with you and possibly take you to jail.

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,660
They had big fires in the country recently.

32
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,660
Yes, they did.

33
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,980
And we don't call that terrorism.

34
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,560
I'm a lot more afraid of a 100,000 acre forest fire than I am of airplanes getting me.

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,120
Really?

36
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,500
Yeah.

37
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,220
That's not what the media would have us believe.

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,900
No, it's not.

39
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,940
They certainly downplay the natural disasters and upplay the external invaders.

40
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,600
And who's to say who sparked that up?

41
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,560
It's fairly easy to start a fire.

42
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,380
Fire wants to live.

43
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,280
Now, which fire?

44
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,580
Any of them.

45
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,780
Well, there's the Indian who set one, and then there's the brokenhearted gal who set the other.

46
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,180
Right.

47
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,720
But then there was a fire in South Georgia.

48
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,180
There was one going in Oregon.

49
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,800
I think one in Utah.

50
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,620
In your frock of yellow.

51
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,940
I look swell, but you look sweller, setting the woods on fire.

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,740
We're taking all the honky-tonks.

53
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,680
Tonight we're having fun.

54
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,660
We'll show the folks a brand new dance that never has been done.

55
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,440
I don't care who thinks we're silly.

56
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,300
You be daffy and I'll be dilly.

57
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,480
We'll order up two bowls of chili, setting the woods on fire.

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,960
Soed room or table fun for me.

59
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,960


60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,960


61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,960


62
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,880
Oh do I in the fang, try it.

63
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:00,880


64
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,100
In a wood plane.

65
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,840
Bring the

66
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:06,840


67
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:06,840


68
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,820
Eat that piece of wheat.

69
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:11,660
Almost.

70
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:12,960
Well, that's about enough.

71
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:12,960


72
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,600
I'll gas up my hot rod stoker

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
We'll get hotter than a poker

74
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,620
You'll be broke but I'll be broker

75
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,660
Tonight they're setting the woods on fire

76
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,460
We'll set close to one another

77
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,640
Up one street and down the other

78
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,560
We'll have a time, old brother

79
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,800
Setting the woods on fire

80
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,280
We'll put aside a little time

81
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,600
To fix a flat or two

82
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,160
My tires and cubes are doing fine

83
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,580
But the air is showing through

84
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,440
You clap hands and I'll start bowing

85
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,240
We'll do all the laws allowing

86
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Tomorrow I'll be right back plowing

87
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,480
Setting the woods on fire

88
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,860
So if there's no fire in space

89
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,380
because it's a vacuum,

90
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,640
what's the deal with stars?

91
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,660
I know it's a big nuclear furnace,

92
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,300
but it's not strictly fire then, is it?

93
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,280
Well, yeah, it's a nuclear fire.

94
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
But it's in the middle of a vacuum.

95
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,300
Which is odd.

96
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,480
That's pretty damn weird.

97
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,440
It's pretty damn weird.

98
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,460
They're engines, I guess, of a sort.

99
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:36,800
Chemical.

100
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,620
A combustion engine.

101
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:37,980
Sure.

102
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,780
They're burning their own resources.

103
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,420
Mm-hmm.

104
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,040
That's why they would have

105
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,220
a vacuum.

106
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,920
They would eventually deplete

107
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,400
and become a red dwarf,

108
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,500
which is a funny show.

109
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,480
I want to start a fire

110
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,260
on the space station.

111
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,420
Think of the news stories.

112
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,520
Hey, well, those pure oxygen environments

113
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,980
are made for fire.

114
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,780
It's not pure oxygen.

115
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,460
No, but it was

116
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,740
when those crispy critters

117
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,880
got cooked up in that capsule.

118
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,280
Gus Grissom, I think,

119
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,280
and a couple other guys

120
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,000
got a million miles of wire

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,900
or whatever running through

122
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,620
a space capsule

123
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,320
and they were in a pressurized

124
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,620
100% oxygen thing.

125
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,680
What were they doing in there?

126
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,300
You don't hang out in a...

127
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,400
It seemed like a good idea

128
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,780
at the time.

129
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,820
Well, yeah, for a buzz.

130
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,840
Well, no, but they were

131
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,220
in their suitcases.

132
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,180
What's the point?

133
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,920
Why would they do that?

134
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,800
It's so volatile.

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,080
That's an excellent question.

136
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,840
The variety of the

137
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,900
therapeutic experience.

138
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,040
Colleagues, let us ponder

139
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
the nature of fire.

140
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,320
It is the cleanest animal

141
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,660
and it is one of the least wasteful,

142
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,680
consuming everything that it touches

143
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,380
and reducing it to its elements.

144
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,640
It is an altruistic creature,

145
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,560
releasing atoms and molecules

146
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,340
back to their basic forms,

147
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,020
free and orderly,

148
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,300
floating through existence.

149
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,660
Of course, there are some

150
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,880
who would argue that fire

151
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,820
does not live.

152
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,500
I believe you should all

153
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,840
at this point know

154
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,900
how I feel about arguing.

155
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,360
But does it not move,

156
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,040
crawling inexorably

157
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,260
towards its next meal?

158
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,400
Does it not breathe air,

159
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,840
hungrily lapping

160
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,660
at the gases that sustain it?

161
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,740
Given the right circumstances,

162
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,120
a flame can manifest

163
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,880
a sort of spontaneous generation,

164
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,480
growing from a minuscule hot spot

165
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,560
to a giant conflagration.

166
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,160
And there is no denying

167
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,560
that this voracious predator

168
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,280
reproduces as its first order of existence.

169
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,920
Anyone who has ever seen

170
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,820
a beautiful specimen feed

171
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,500
on some inanimate matter

172
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,460
knows this.

173
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,480
Fire is the first animal

174
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,940
that Homo Saps ever trapped and contained

175
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,460
in a symbiotic relationship.

176
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,700
The Homo Saps got plenty of warmth

177
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,880
and the fire got plenty to eat.

178
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,200
The prestige of such an audacious animal

179
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,200


180
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:41,400
was that it was able to

181
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,400


182
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,400


183
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,400


184
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,400


185
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,400


186
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,400


187
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,400


188
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,280
This act, taming the untameable fire,

189
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,700
secured Homo Sap's position

190
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,000
of central maw in the food web.

191
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,420
The other creatures respected this

192
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,740
and many of Homo Sap's main competitors

193
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,960
soon entered into similar contracts.

194
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,620
Fire is one of the few animals

195
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,960
that exists on every continent,

196
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,800
even Antarctica.

197
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,780
Especially Antarctica.

198
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,720
One can assume,

199
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,780
without his best buddy fire in tow,

200
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,920
Homo Sap wouldn't have made much of a run of it

201
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,120
out on the ice caps.

202
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,320
Have I mentioned that it cleans as it eats?

203
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,740
Sadly,

204
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,620
even a noble strain

205
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,560
such as this

206
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,920
has its one fatal flaw.

207
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,960
Much like the pink scum,

208
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,940
it cannot or will not

209
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,480
control its own growth.

210
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,020
A single flame,

211
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,260
given enough to breathe and enough to eat,

212
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,160
will soon expand to consume

213
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,340
all available resources as quickly as possible,

214
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
leading to, of course, burnout.

215
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,600
Ah,

216
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,300
but twice as bright lives half as long.

217
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,580
There's almost a parable here.

218
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,380
Ha ha ha ha ha!

219
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:45,380


220
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,640
They're good, they're mad.

221
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,920
T-k-t-c-i-e-p-r.

222
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,260
There's something psychological,

223
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,220
psychologically wrong with you.

224
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,940
I mean, nobody I ever knew

225
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,500
in my entire life dreams about fire

226
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,060
practically every night.

227
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,140
Why not?

228
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:10,880
Fun!

229
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,680
Ha ha ha!

230
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,720
I just don't want anything to happen to the doorbell transformer.

231
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,040
Well, take it off.

232
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,840
Then everybody could knock on the door.

233
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,600
I've been meaning to go up there and get that thing.

234
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,900
The week might come along.

235
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,360
The darn thing is on all the time.

236
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,780
There are a lot of household fires on Christmas from those stupid damn lights.

237
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,460
Some ridiculous amount of household fires begin in your dryer, your clothes dryer,

238
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,040
when you don't clean the lint trap.

239
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,980
I didn't know that.

240
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,840
Well, you have to clean your lint trap, and it's right there when you get your clothes out.

241
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,820
Go ahead and people, clean your lint trap.

242
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,220
Clean the lint trap.

243
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,420
Live forever.

244
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,280
And I was lying in the grass by a river.

245
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,940
And as I lay, the grass turned to sand, and the river turned to a sea.

246
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,020
And suddenly the sea burst into flames, and the sand was burning.

247
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:35,280
And I breathed in, and there was smoke in my lungs, and there was fire in my brain.

248
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,420
And I looked around me, and there were all these shapes being sucked into the flames.

249
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,020
And they were writhing and trying to escape.

250
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,340
And I knew.

251
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,540
And I knew that I had to get out.

252
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,140
And I looked above me, and I saw a shape that was smiling down at me and beckoning, saying,

253
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,220
Come on home!

254
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,500
And I raised myself, and I tried to get out of the flames.

255
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,940
And I was getting higher, and higher, and higher, and higher.

256
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,460
And I reached out.

257
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,340
I reached out towards the shape.

258
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,920
And as I reached out, the shape shattered.

259
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,040
And my hands were empty.

260
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,600
And I was falling.

261
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,300
I was falling, falling, falling.

262
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:14,780
And I was falling.

263
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,700
I was falling into the flames.

264
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,720
And I knew that I was going to burn.

265
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,140
I was going to burn.

266
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,860
Oh, it's so hot in here.

267
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,920
Let me out.

268
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,740
Please.

269
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,000
I am the God of Hellfire.

270
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,040
And I bring you...

271
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,280
Fire!

272
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,680
Fire!

273
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,440
Fire!

274
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,460
Fire!

275
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,140
Fire!

276
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,140


277
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,140


278
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,140


279
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,140


280
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,140


281
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,140


282
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,140


283
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,140


284
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,160
Fire!

285
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,020
Fire!

286
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,960
Fire!

287
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,620
Fire!

288
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,740
Fire!

289
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,920
Fire!

290
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,160
Fire!

291
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,820
Fire!

292
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,040
Fire!

293
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,400
You've been living like a little girl

294
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,620
In the middle of your little world

295
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,860
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you

296
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,120
You've been a piece of luck

297
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,880
Now's your time to burn

298
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,560
You're like a fallen fortune for me

299
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,400
Like you

300
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,500
I'm gonna find a true world

301
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah

302
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,660
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire

303
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:57,300
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire

304
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,060
Let's get the fire, get the fire, get the fire

305
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,360
And you'll be in the middle

306
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,740
You're gonna burn

307
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,240
Liar, liar, pants on.

308
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,260
Whoa.

309
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:41,980
A traveling salesman is driving through a rural area between stops when his car breaks down just as night is falling.

310
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,800
The only sign of humanity for miles is an old farmhouse.

311
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,220
The salesman wearily lugs his briefcase to the front door and knocks.

312
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,580
The door is answered by an old farmer who eyes the salesman suspiciously.

313
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:03,540
The salesman explains his situation and the farmer warms to him, telling him that the only garage in the area is already closed, but he's welcome to stay the night.

314
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,780
Upon entering the small house, the man is bombarded by the smell of delicious food.

315
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:14,340
The farmer mentions that they are about to eat and tells the salesman to have a seat at the table.

316
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:24,160
Assuming that the farmer lives with his old wife, he is flabbergasted when dinner is brought in by the farmer's three beautiful daughters, all dressed like Daisy Duke.

317
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:32,360
They eat in silence, the salesman eyeing the daughters as they get up every few minutes and return with another course of the scrumptious meal.

318
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,760
After everyone is stuffed, the farmer pulls out his pipe and, lighting it, asks the salesman just exactly what he wants.

319
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:38,760


320
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:38,760


321
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:38,760


322
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,300
The farmer says exactly what it is he sells.

323
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,120
The salesman leans forward with a wolfish grin on his face.

324
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,980
Well, I'm glad you asked that, he says.

325
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:55,000
I am selling that which is your birthright, but which you deny yourself.

326
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,360
And I'd love to give you all a sample.

327
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,300
Well that I have to see, says the farmer as he leans forward.

328
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:08,400
The salesman opens his briefcase, whips out a pistol, and shoots the farmer and his daughters dead before they know what's happening.

329
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:14,860
Thumbing the bulge in his pants, the salesman eyes the three fresh, nubile corpses and says,

330
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,280
And now, my darlings, we shall all taste of the sour fruit of true love.

331
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,220
And promptly drops dead from the poison in this food.

332
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:35,180
The embers of tobacco in the farmer's pipe ignite the carpet on fire, which soon catches to the rest of the house, and the five of them all return to the commons together.

333
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,740
So what's the deal with the devil being a wolf?

334
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,540
The devil is a man associated with fire.

335
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,920
It's not the way the Norse had it.

336
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,360
They had hell with one L, and it was really cold.

337
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,720
Because they were Vikings, and it's really cold there.

338
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,020
And Dante took a page out of that when he wrote the Inferno.

339
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,000
The ninth circle where the real baddy-bads go.

340
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,540
It's really true.

341
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,320
Like Warhead, the sowers of discord.

342
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,860
It's very cold. Frozen.

343
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,640
And the worse you were, the further in ice you're frozen.

344
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,260
And then the devil's in the middle, like a three-headed cake topping.

345
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,840
They must all crave oblivion.

346
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,040
What's done with it? What's done with it?

347
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,120
Thirty families are homeless in fires.

348
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,660
Alarm fire.

349
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,040
Police said...

350
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,600
Come on, open the soap ducats.

351
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,740
Sure, who cares when you are through?

352
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,880
How do you know this?

353
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,780
Total twenty-three.

354
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,780
Fire. Factory that he was nowhere near.

355
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,000
It smoldered.

356
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,160
But it's now total...

357
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,940
Fire. Factory that he was nowhere near.

358
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,160
It smoldered.

359
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,880
But it's now total twenty-three.

360
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,000
Apartment blast kills twenty...

361
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,780
Okay, okay, I'm all through. Can't do another thing.

362
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,760
Twenty-three are killed. Five...

363
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,060
I was in the toilet.

364
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,080
The building put up in 1957 was part of the LaSalle Heights apartment...

365
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,000
Open the door I ran.

366
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,180
And no, it finally came to life.

367
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,180

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:15,840


371
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:15,840


372
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:15,840


373
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:15,840


374
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:15,840

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:15,840

S'is this all in?

378
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,520
23.

379
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,800
Apartment blast kills

380
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,260
20. Okay, okay, I'm all

381
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,900
through. Can't do another thing.

382
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,460
The White House got burned down.

383
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,260
Yes, it did. Don't try this

384
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,780
at home, but apparently somebody

385
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,140
burned the White House. The British. The Brits burned

386
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,540
the White House. Our good friends, the British.

387
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,140
But what about British humans? I don't see us bombing

388
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,120
them. Well, no, we're not going to bomb the Brits

389
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,740
because we've already seen that they can withstand

390
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,120
the best that bombing has to offer. Back then.

391
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,220
We're not going to nuke the Brits.

392
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,200
We love their comedy.

393
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,740
All of our men secretly pine for their

394
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,740
attractive women because the voices

395
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,920
make them that much better.

396
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,680
It's a fire in the heart.

397
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,120
It's a fire in the heart.

398
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,820
It's a fire in the heart.

399
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,220
You take my place in this

400
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,140
showdown. I'll observe

401
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,900
with a vivid blue eye

402
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,060
and humbly ask

403
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,040
for forgiveness.

404
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,500
And we'll ask for me on a

405
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:39,820
demand.

406
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,040
Heart and soul

407
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,080
what will

408
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,200
burn?

409
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,280
Heart and soul

410
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,040
what

411
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,560
will burn?

412
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:55,840
An

413
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
avid subluxation of creation.

414
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,000
A circus complete

415
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,260
with old fools.

416
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,940
Foundations have lasted the

417
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,120
ages. Never into

418
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,480
part of their rooms.

419
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,100
Beyond all this good is

420
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,120
in terror. The grip

421
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,840
of a mercenary hand.

422
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,140
When savagery turns

423
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,320
over reason.

424
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,400
There's no turning back

425
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,840
to last stand.

426
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,720
Heart and soul

427
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,960
what will

428
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,060
burn?

429
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,180
Heart and soul

430
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,800
what will burn?

431
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,600
An empty

432
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,740
cream of

433
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:05,760
でも

434
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,120
Will an

435
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,120


436
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,120


437
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,120


438
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,380
soul?

439
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,160
An

440
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,380
invalid

441
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:12,400
is

442
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,120
there

443
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,320
Now

444
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:27,960
an

445
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,340
Existence, well what does it matter?

446
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,840
I exist on the best terms I can

447
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,940
The past is now part of my future

448
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,860
The present is well out of hand

449
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,320
The present is well out of hand

450
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,680
Heart and soul

451
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,920
One will learn

452
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,100
Heart and soul

453
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,700
One will learn

454
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,880
One will learn

455
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,160
One will learn

456
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,140
Heart and soul

457
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,820
One will learn

458
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:55,080
One will learn

459
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,660
One will learn

460
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,500
One will learn

461
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,720
One will learn

462
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,060
One will learn

463
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,740
How my thoughts go flashing back again

464
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,000
Heart and soul

465
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,000


466
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,060
Heart and soul

467
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,060


468
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,060


469
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,060


470
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,060


471
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,060


472
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:29,320
My old flame

473
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,880
My new lovers all seem so tame

474
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,300
They won't even let me strangle them

475
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,560
For I haven't met a girl

476
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,260
So magnificent or elegant

477
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,520
As my old flame

478
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,800
I've met so many who had fascinating ways

479
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,620
A fascinating gaze in their eye

480
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,480
I saw this eye

481
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,060
So I removed the other eye

482
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:05,780
That eye that kept winking and blinking at other men

483
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,620
It was me

484
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,420
Some who took me up to the skies

485
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,920
But their attempts at love

486
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,980
Were only imitations of

487
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,140
My old flame

488
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,780
My new lovers all seem so tame

489
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:22,780


490
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,960
I can't even think of her name

491
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,320
What was her name?

492
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,800
Doris, Laura, Chloe, Manny, Moe, Jack

493
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,060
No, it couldn't have been Moe

494
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,880
I can't stand it, I tell you

495
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,860
This is driving me sane

496
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,160
She would always treat me mean

497
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,900
So I poured a can of gasoline

498
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,600
And struck a match to

499
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,340
Woo!

500
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:00,980
My old flame

501
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,040
Woo!

502
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:06,840
Woo!

503
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:06,880


504
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,300


505
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,000


506
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:10,300


507
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:10,760


508
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:10,940


509
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,060
Woo!

510
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,780
Woo!

511
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,740
Woo!

512
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,160
Woo!

513
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,300
Woo!

514
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,760
Woo!

515
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,040
Woo!

516
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,540
Woo!

517
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,200
Woo!

518
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:31,880
Woo!

519
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:31,880


520
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,800
Woo!

521
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,280
Woo!

522
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,820
Woo!

523
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:37,840
Woo!

524
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:37,840


525
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,320
Woo!

526
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,320


527
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,380
Woo!

528
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:38,620
Woo!

529
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:38,880
Woo!

530
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:38,880


531
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:38,880


532
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,280
Woo!

533
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,480
Woo!

534
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,480


535
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,480


536
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,480


537
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,480


538
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,480


539
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,480


540
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,480


541
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,540
Feel!

542
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:40,960
Feel!

543
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,980
For you baby!

544
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,760
For you baby!

545
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,680
Like a bomb

546
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,420
Now my love's gone

547
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,480
Up in flames

548
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,780
We're history, baby

549
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,720
Read it in a book

550
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,100
It ended in the fire

551
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,580
That started with a look

552
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,180
I fell for you, baby

553
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,740
Like a bomb

554
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,600
Now my love's gone

555
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,760
Up in flames

556
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,880
Up in flames

557
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,640
My head is full of smoke

558
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,580
Heart full of pain

559
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,140
That tender love is gone

560
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,520
Gone up in flames

561
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,300
You should have shot me, baby

562
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,760
My life is gone

563
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,840
My life is done

564
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,840
You could have shot me, baby

565
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,260
Shot me with a gun

566
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,060
I hear those sirens

567
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,160
Scream my name

568
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,760
I know that I'm not alone

569
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,440
Now my love is gone

570
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,740
Gone up in flames

571
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,240
guitar solo

572
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:47,660
guitar solo

573
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:47,660


574
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:48,660
guitar solo

575
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,340
And even Revelation X,

576
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,080
the cover of Revelation X,

577
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,340
which is the second real subgenius book

578
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,360
that wasn't short stories,

579
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,560
is covered in fire.

580
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,860
Computer-generated fire,

581
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,540
which is, I think,

582
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,900
hard for people to do.

583
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,140
Fire and water seem to be

584
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,280
really difficult for computers to fake.

585
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,940
Well, to make them look natural, yeah,

586
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,220
because they behave randomly

587
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,540
and computers just can't

588
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,700
dig on that.

589
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,840
Technically, a computer

590
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,680
wouldn't be able to see fire, I guess.

591
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,220
You know, it would see

592
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,000
the different fluctuations

593
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,780
in temperature.

594
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,800
It's all light waves

595
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,100
or whatever to it.

596
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:17,740
Right.

597
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,180
Infrared fire kicks ass.

598
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,860
I've never seen infrared fire.

599
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,460
Well, me neither.

600
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,840
It's impossible to see,

601
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,120
but apparently it kicks ass.

602
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:24,520
Really?

603
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:24,960
Who said?

604
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,520
You know.

605
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:25,840
They.

606
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,400
People.

607
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,060
Yeah, people.

608
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,440
The voices.

609
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,040
Billy Joel didn't start the fire.

610
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,220
It was always burning

611
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,560
since the world's been turning.

612
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,620
That sounds like a lame alibi to me.

613
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,620
Well, he went to treatment,

614
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,400
so maybe he's got

615
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,300
a better excuse now.

616
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,200
Well, there's smoke.

617
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,000
There's fire.

618
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:38,520
Whoa.

619
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,380
You can't smoke your frap

620
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,480
without a little fire, people,

621
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,980
so get down and worship

622
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,740
the fire like everyone else used to.

623
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,800
I could worship fire.

624
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,080
Yeah.

625
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,500
The sun.

626
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,460
No hot meals unless I pay tribute

627
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,640
to the burning red stuff.

628
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,500
Fire good.

629
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,560
So, fire good?

630
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,320
Fire good.

631
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:52,940
Fire good.

632
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,760
And even a Viking funeral,

633
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,360
the final respect you can pay

634
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,380
to the Viking's corpse,

635
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,200
its leavings,

636
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,040
is to burn it away.

637
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,600
Watch the smoke rise

638
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,280
up to the gods.

639
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,620
Fire may be good,

640
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,920
but human beings

641
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,000
and even, you know,

642
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,220
Yeti hybrids

643
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,200
are made of mostly water,

644
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,160
which doesn't tend to go so well

645
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,740
with fire.

646
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,040
-

647
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,400
我

648
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:21,560
你

649
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,240
我是

650
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,240


651
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,380
restrictions

652
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,440
watches

653
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:23,520
I am

654
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,460
Wanna

655
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:24,460


656
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,280
you

657
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,280


658
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,640
try

659
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,000
to

660
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,000


661
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,080
just

662
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,620
waste

663
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:40,820
time

664
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:40,840
on

665
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:40,840


666
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:40,840


667
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:40,840


668
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:40,840


669
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,600
Walsh

670
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,940
или

671
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:42,960
you

672
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,740
Love is a burning thing

673
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:04,180
And it is a firing

674
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,340
Bound by love's desire

675
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,260
I've been to a ring of fire

676
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,420
And I went down, down, down

677
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,260
Into a burning ring of fire

678
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,340
Down, down, down

679
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,220
And the flames are skinning iron

680
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,240
And it burned, burned, burned

681
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,020
The ring of fire

682
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,460
Oh, oh

683
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,220
The ring of

684
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,380
Fire

685
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,180
Fire

686
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,560
Fire

687
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,940
Fire

688
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,880
Now the taste

689
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,720
Of love is sweet

690
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,940
And it burns, burns, burns

691
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:12,940


692
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,980
When hearts

693
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,660
Like ours meet

694
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,000
Fell for you

695
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,820
Just like a child

696
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,360
Ooh, the fire and wine

697
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,600
And I went down, down, down

698
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,440
Into a burning ring of fire

699
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,460
Down, down, down

700
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,380
And the flames are skinning iron

701
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,840
Burned, Liuzzen

702
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,880
Some this way

703
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,520
Burned down

704
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:54,520


705
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:54,520


706
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:54,520


707
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:54,520


708
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,960
The ring of fire

709
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,460
x4

710
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:02,640
Fire

711
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:02,760
Fire

712
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:02,760


713
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,880
Fire named fire

714
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,700
Fire of fire

715
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,940
Fire of fire

716
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,980
Fire を river in the fire

717
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,940
Fire is the devil's only friend.

718
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,660
Who said that?

719
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,380
Don McLean.

720
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:32,280
I think it's pretty significant that many hell situations are imagined as being fiery,

721
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,760
brimstone-y, burning, volcano-y.

722
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,060
We really fear volcanoes.

723
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,460
One is moral, one is not.

724
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,860
It's super ego and it bought.

725
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,900
Well, it bought.

726
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,460
Now that we're in Hawaii, I hope you don't choose to embarrass me here, too.

727
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,400
Come on, get out of my way.

728
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,260
I need to get laid.

729
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,020
That wasn't funny at the airport, either.

730
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,700
Now, are you going to sit down and enjoy the luau or not?

731
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,020
You know very well that I can't sit.

732
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,380
Are you making fun of me?

733
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,560
Don't put a chip on your shoulder there.

734
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,560
Get it, chip robot.

735
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,040
I think you are making fun of me.

736
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,920
Of course I'm not.

737
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,700
I'm just happy.

738
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,440
I want the pig.

739
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,720
The pig is for everyone.

740
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,120
I will not share.

741
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,060
The pig will be mine.

742
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,360
I'm cutting you off.

743
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,300
I'm sick of this.

744
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,220
I can't take you anywhere.

745
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,520
Move these damn foreigners out of my way.

746
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,980
Move, move, move.

747
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,760
Now, it bought.

748
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,960
This is a foreign country.

749
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,300
We're all foreigners here.

750
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,480
Nom, nom, nom.

751
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:24,920
It bought.

752
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,780
Nom, nom, nom.

753
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,160
That's it.

754
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,520
This is the last time.

755
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,820
You, me, edge of the volcano, now.

756
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,280
All right, super ego, have it your way.

757
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,840
Just carry me safely to the lip of the volcano.

758
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,440
Meanwhile, the top of the volcano.

759
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,220
Ah, you have had this coming for years.

760
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,340
Mom always liked you better.

761
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,240
I'm sick of this.

762
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,700
I'm a robot personification of your id.

763
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,720
You made me vomit all over my prom date.

764
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,900
You turned me into a cybernetic organism.

765
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,720
You made me gain 50 pounds when I broke my leg and started smoking pot.

766
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,820
Ah, ah, you never lubricate me properly.

767
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,940
I built you.

768
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,880
You have a point.

769
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,540
I do.

770
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,800
Let's not fight.

771
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,520
No.

772
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,040
Ah, I tricked you.

773
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,360
Oh.

774
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:03,760
Ah.

775
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,300
One is moral, one is not.

776
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,680
It's super ego and it bought.

777
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,740
You know, you can get fired from your job.

778
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,020
Why do they call it that?

779
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,380
Do they?

780
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,680
Because it's like getting executed and when you get executed, they take fire.

781
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,600
Those bastards.

782
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,780
Do you think that's like an old nautical thing?

783
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,860
When you get kicked off the ship, they stuffed you in the cannon and fired you off?

784
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,420
No.

785
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,160
No?

786
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,760
Those pirates could be pretty frisky.

787
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,160
Yeah, I know, but if you're on a boat in the middle of the ocean and somebody says anything

788
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,360
about fire, it better be heating beans and that's about it.

789
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,840
I mean, you're at a wood boat.

790
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,180
Yeah, but you're surrounded by water.

791
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:42,860
What's the problem?

792
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,140
The lack of the boat after it's consumed by the fire?

793
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,940
Well, then you can just ride the fire to safety.

794
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,560
You know, if you could solidify fire, much like you solidify water into ice.

795
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,320
Uh-huh.

796
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,240
If you could freeze fire.

797
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:52,900
Yes.

798
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,700
But have it maintain its molecular thing.

799
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,540
Well, it would have to stop moving.

800
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,580
Fire is sort of an illusion.

801
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,020
Well, it's light play, but it's heat slash light play.

802
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,380
Yeah, which is kick ass.

803
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:03,860
Mm-hmm.

804
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,600
You'd have to freeze it instantaneously and I mean, no give or take because it would go

805
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:07,880
out.

806
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,820
But, you know, the fire is sort of defined by...

807
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,000
By the chemical reaction of what happens to carbon when it heats up or what happens

808
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,740
to anything when it heats up too much.

809
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,120
Sure, sure.

810
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,960
It starts to disintegrate.

811
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,580
Fire is pure anarchy.

812
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,340
Okay.

813
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:22,860
Okay.

814
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,120
Okay.

815
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,180
Okay.

816
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,580
Okay.

817
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,380
Okay.

818
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:31,820
Okay.

819
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,500
Okay.

820
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:32,500


821
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:32,520
Okay.

822
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,160
Okay.

823
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,220
Okay.

824
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,220


825
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,180
Okay.

826
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,360
Okay.

827
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:40,740
Okay.

828
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:40,820


829
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:40,820


830
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:40,820


831
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:40,820


832
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,760
Okay.

833
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,260
Your

834
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,080
belly's

835
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,800
burning

836
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,420
out.

837
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,720
You're

838
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:10,740
tight.

839
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,680
Don't take a shot, close the door.

840
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,100
Let me chase the summer under your arms.

841
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,840
Fire!

842
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,440
Yes, I'm on fire.

843
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,120
Oh, I'm on fire.

844
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,660
Oh, please set me on fire.

845
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,120
It's so hot, I have a lot of fire.

846
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,800
I've got a lot of fire.

847
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,180
It's so hot, my voice is blazing.

848
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,780
It's like I'm on fire.

849
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,760
I'm on fire.

850
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,320
I'm on fire.

851
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,380
This is all I've got.

852
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
I'm on fire.

853
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,840
This is all I've got.

854
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,520
I'm on fire.

855
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,560
Don't take a shot, close the door.

856
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,160
Let me chase the summer under your arms.

857
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:58,800
Fire!

858
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,820
Oh, I'm on fire.

859
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,060
Oh, I'm on fire.

860
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,300
Oh, please set me on fire.

861
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,680
Oh, I'm on fire.

862
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:19,400
Oh, I'm on fire.

863
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,380
Oh, I'm on fire.

864
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,700
Oh, I'm on fire.

865
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,340
Oh, I'm on fire.

866
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,280
Oh, I'm on fire.

867
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,280
Why don't you set me on fire!

868
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,280


869
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,280


870
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,280


871
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,280


872
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,280


873
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,280


874
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,280


875
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,280


876
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,280


877
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,480
Set me on fire.

878
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,240
Fire!

879
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,100
It's so hot, I have a lot of fire.

880
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,180
I've got a lot of burningsия.

881
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,920
Say hi to the ones that we've lost

882
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,120
Got a lot of hell of a day today

883
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,340
Your love is the season of kind

884
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,480
We'll see flames when we cry

885
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,020
Temptation glows in the dark

886
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,980
Living dresses and their hidden hearts

887
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,800
Fire!

888
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,760
This is our life

889
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,920
Fire!

890
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,760
Fire!

891
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,820
This is our life

892
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,700
Fire!

893
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:44,660


894
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,620
Alcohol is fire water

895
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,940
Which is odd in that one would extinguish the other normally

896
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,800
Yes, and imagine how surprised the first Indian was

897
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,480
When some toothless chuckling idiot handed him a shot glass of whiskey

898
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,880
And said drink it, what the hell, I'll drink it

899
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,920
And it burned him

900
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,480
Water that burned

901
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,620
Fire!

902
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,160
Fire!

903
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,440
Fire!

904
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:06,620


905
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:09,360
Fire!

906
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:09,760
Fire!

907
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,540
Well, don't know what gonna make me go blind

908
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,160
Fire!

909
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,580
Fire!

910
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,600
All white heat it tickled me down to my toes

911
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,000
Fire!

912
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,400
Fire!

913
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,320
Ooh, I love that white light having through the snows

914
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:20,780
Fire!

915
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,260
Fire!

916
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,900
White light on this, on my brain

917
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,460
Fire!

918
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,020
Fire!

919
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,620
All white light is gonna die me insane

920
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,300
Fire!

921
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:28,800
Fire!

922
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,820
All white heat it tickled me down to my toes

923
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,300
Fire!

924
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:32,580
Fire!

925
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,540
All white light I said now through the snows

926
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,220
Do it!

927
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:39,800
Fire!

928
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,060
Fire!

929
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:40,320
Fire!

930
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,740
All my eyes truly do love, watch that stuff just disappear

931
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:44,540
Fire!

932
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,460
Fire!

933
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:47,560
Fire!

934
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:47,800
Fire!

935
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:47,800


936
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:47,800


937
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:47,800


938
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:47,800


939
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:47,800


940
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,880
Watch that side, watch that side, no one's still gonna be dead to ride

941
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,140
Fire!

942
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:54,880
Fire!

943
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,080
Fire!

944
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,340
Fire!

945
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:55,540
Fire!

946
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:55,540


947
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:55,540


948
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:55,540


949
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,880
Bad foxy mama walks and walks down the street

950
00:41:59,140 --> 00:41:59,540
Fire!

951
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,440
Fire!

952
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:02,540


953
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:02,740


954
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:02,840
Fire!

955
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:02,860
Fire!

956
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:02,860


957
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:02,860


958
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:02,860


959
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,480
Come outside your head, gonna make you dead, ain't gonna be on your side

960
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,000
Fire!

961
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,440
Fire!

962
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:06,500
Fire!

963
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,040
White light no more in the air, clean my brain

964
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,160
Fire!

965
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,160


966
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:09,740
Fire!

967
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,220
Fire!

968
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,360
Fire!

969
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,620
The white light gone making me go insane

970
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,360
Fire!

971
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:13,820
Fire!

972
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,860
All white heat it tickled me down to my toes

973
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,320
Fire!

974
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:17,700
Fire!

975
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,540
All white light I said now through the snows

976
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,080
Do it!

977
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,400
Fire!

978
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:21,440
Fire!

979
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,260
All white light is lighting up my eyes

980
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:24,640
Fire!

981
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,680
Don't you know it fills me up with surprise

982
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,400
Fire!

983
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,580
All white heat it tickled me down to my toes

984
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,160
Do it!

985
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:32,620
Fire!

986
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,740
All white light I tell you now through the snows will work it

987
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,700
Oh, she's really doing it.

988
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,960
Watch this beat, watch this beat.

989
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,840
It's gonna go and make it every week.

990
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,940
Oh, Spudamodo, everybody's gonna kill him.

991
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,800
Here it comes, here it comes.

992
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,120
Everybody's gonna make me run to it.

993
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,920
Hiya.

994
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,520
Hiya.

995
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:09,460
Fire.

996
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,700
You can't give him fire,

997
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,360
because that's the thing that separated the gods

998
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,260
from the people besides the immortality.

999
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,060
Right, well, that's kind of nice, too.

1000
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,160
Well, if you hop religions, you still get it.

1001
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,440
It just changes channels.

1002
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,040
Right.

1003
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,020
So he brings him fire, and what does he get for it?

1004
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,360
He gets his liver and eyes ripped out every day

1005
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,920
by these ravenous birds.

1006
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,140
So fire is knowledge, illumination.

1007
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,820
Well, yeah, Lucifer, his name strictly means

1008
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,020
illuminated, wisdom and knowledge.

1009
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:34,820
The morning star.

1010
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,160
I mean, but that's all Satanism talk.

1011
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,080
Leontan LeVay feeds you that kind of,

1012
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,900
I mean, no matter what channel you're on,

1013
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,680
there's an infomercial about why you shouldn't

1014
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,380
turn the channel.

1015
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:48,980
I don't know.

1016
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:33,120
I don't know.

1020

I don't know.

1021
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,820
I don't know.

1022
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:16,940

1024

It's safe to say, Kendall, tonight's the day, Kendall.

1025
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,460
It's all right now, Kendall.

1026
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,600
The wind's the way, Kendall.

1027
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:34,600
Never thought I'd see a dark star falling.

1028
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,100
I'm the copy.

1029
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,300
On the rock

1030
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,540
Wind is whipping through my

1031
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,660
Stupid mouth

1032
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:15,000
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right , right, right, right, right, right

1033
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,040
My house burnt down this morning

1034
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,160
And my friends they came around

1035
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,620
I saved the master recordings

1036
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:32,000
But my girl was not to be found

1037
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,480
I ran inside the studios

1038
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,160
To save the tapes

1039
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:39,920
machine.

1040
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,140
But my girlfriend, she

1041
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,140
was fast asleep

1042
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,180
locked up right outside

1043
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:48,940
some dream.

1044
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,320
Look out your window, people. See that

1045
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,920
orb up in the sky? It's the moon.

1046
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,660
It's cool, reflected glow

1047
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,460
from fire. Yes.

1048
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,160
Of and from fire. So choke on that.

1049
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,220
So either worship fire or worship the

1050
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,120
sun or go to church and worship

1051
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,080
the son of God but visualize him as being

1052
