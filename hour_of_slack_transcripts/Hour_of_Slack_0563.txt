Ha, ha, ha.

Wistful, well let's fight,
a lil wistful my boy.
If it helps me to better prepare and present my program, I understand and agree to abide by that policy, the above policy.
Thank you.
This is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.
And I think we ought to blow that stuff off, man.
Let's just do the show.
Let's just go for it, man.
Let's just go, go, go, go.
Yes.
Yes.
And all I know is I'm going to have this show done in the time it takes you to hear this show.
We're just going to whip right on through it.
Yes, that's the only way to do it.
It's the best way to just gravitate.
Yes, a tape.
And not even know what it might be.
But because it is a subgenius tape sitting on a subgenius desk, then we know that it, well, actually could be a sorry piece of garbage.
I know that.
You know that.
But, you know, we just forged ahead.
We.
We go onwards.
We go straight ahead, baby.
Every spare.
Sure, the conspiracy may be out to strip your skin from your bones or strip your mind from inside your skull.
Strip your money from your wallet.
Well, friends, we want to also.
But, you know, as G. Gordon Gordon said so long ago, sure, you're getting ripped off every day.
But you can learn to enjoy it because some ways are fun.
Actually, come to think of it, I, as usual, malappropriated that.
I believe he said you're getting screwed every day, but you can learn to enjoy it.
Some ways are fun.

Kingsville, Texas.
Rutters.
Heaven, oh, how are you?
The greeting may take some getting used to, but Cleberg County commissioners have thrown their support behind a local man's campaign to take the hell out of hell-o.
County Judge Pete De La Garza said on Wednesday that the commissioners voted unanimously,
for a resolution urging the use of heaven-o instead of hello in greetings.
Is everybody using it?
The answer is, of course, no.
It's a very new thing, and everybody's a little apprehensive, De La Garza told Rutters.
I suppose it's like everything else.
Once you get adjusted to it, you might start using it.
Well, that's certainly true of frappy, cigarettes, sadomasochistic sex.
The idea was spawned by flea market operators.
Senator Leonzo Canales, who thought it sinister that the root of hello was hell,
he has led a three-year campaign to get the county to remove the offensive word.
His victory will result in telephones being answered in the county courthouse with the salutation heaven-o.
Well, our friend David McConville called that county courthouse,
and got a nice old lady on the phone, and you know what she said?
She said, hello.
And David said, heaven-o.
And she said, I don't say that.
Huh.

Whoa.
I don't want you to dried out.

This is my reaching a golf club.
This is my home.
I live close by a large beach.
Pогда scoob curious life.
Rough ass.
I don't know how we can use any of that tape.
You mean the coffee tape?
Man practicing about the coffee songs.
Well, they were going to do the, you know, that coffee song,
the one that used to be on TV.
I didn't talk to them about it.
Because I have a copy of it, and I'd never heard it before
until I bought that record.
You know the one I'm talking about, the famous...
It's with a fake percolator percolating the music.
That's the one I'm talking about.
Yeah, you're talking about the old, beautiful...
I used to love to watch that.
Where they send you, if you drink too much coffee,
they send you to the Maxwell House.
Yeah, that's right.
Well, you know, there's nothing better than
a long, deep, throaty pull of a cup of coffee
as rough as sandpaper and as strong as blue cheese.
There it goes.
Ah, just swill it down.
If you want something done right, do it yourself, you know.
We coffee connoisseurs here on the show
will climb the Andes for that perfect bean.
Yes, um...
Another cup of bubbling, searing, lava-like java.
I think lye's lovely.
Thick with Mexican chocolate.
Lye?
Lye?
You can see in the background there,
the band that dare not speak its name drinking too much coffee.
But for that perfect cup, you still have to do some work,
so...
Whether you're an old pro brushing up on your coffee skills
or new to the brew,
there's always something fun to learn.
Why go through the work of buying whole beans
that you have to grind yourself?
Simple.
Once you grind coffee,
the freshness and flavor last just a few days
and are then blown away by the winds of time,
never to be retrieved,
never to be enjoyed in the rich, throaty taste
of a cup of...
morning fresh breakfast coffee.
Coffee.
But withered away, winnowed into the winds of cold,
bleak eternity.
That's why I recommend grinding your beans in small batches
right before you brew.
And, um, just how should you grind?
Well, do I have to tell you everything?
Grind it the way you feel like it.
I mean, uh, time it, you know?
The flavor extracted from coffee depends on the fineness of the grind.
And the time it's exposed to the bubbling, boiling, searing hot water
that you prepare in your space-age tea kettle.
Oh, I've been there, friends.
I know how it is when you're producing coffee
that's a masterwork of culinary art.
Mmm-mmm.
And the best place to taste it is out in the desert.
Well, of course, if that works the best for you,
and that depends on your personal taste.
So take the time to experiment with the different methods of grinding, brewing,
perking, and dripping.
Now, you may have wondered if water quality really affects the quality of the coffee.
Of course, if you're brewing with untreated sewer water,
it may indeed impinge upon the bouquet and zest of that wake-up cup of java you've been craving.
Since water is the main ingredient in coffee,
water quality has a significant impact on your coffee's taste.
Tap water that is flat or loaded with chlorine or mineral water,
or any other mineral that is not
will produce coffee with that taste.
So always use clean, cold, fresh water.
Water trickling down from the mountains.
Let tap water run a few moments like a mountain waterfall.
Then you fill your pot with water that has not been sitting in pipes
or hot water tanks.
It's beautiful, yummy, brown.
But beware.
Water with a high mineral content can cause mineralization
of your internal stomach and inguinal canal.
Yes, these metallic structures form inside the body
when the mineral content of the water is too high.
Yes, but their crystalline sharpness is a danger to the rest of the health of the body.
We'll wait until you hit the old water.
I'll be the old head after the show.
Don't hit it too hard.
Until then...
God, you know, these things inside of me are so dangerous and beautiful.
But if the mineral content is too high,
they may brew a flat, sour cup of coffee.
Ah, but we'll drink it anyway because...
Oh, yeah, I drink it bitter or sweet, you know.
It is true that coffee will get a thick and bitter taste if it sits for too long.
Typically, a coffee pot squats on a heated burner to keep the coffee hot.
However, if it's on that burner for too long, water begins to evaporate.
The coffee becomes thick due to coffee solids that are left behind in the evaporation process.
Also, the evaporated water drifts up into the used grounds
and bitter coffee characteristics drip into the coffee pot.
Drip at a time.
Just like the locusts that stole Pharaoh's wheat.
Another locust came and carried away a grain of wheat.
Wait a minute.
And another locust came and carried away a grain of wheat.
And then another locust came and carried away a coffee bean.
Hey, bring that back here!
And then another locust came and carried away a paper cup.
The best ways to avoid thick, bitter coffee...
And the next locust came and carried away the half and half.
...immediately removed the used coffee grounds and filtered from the basket after the coffee cycle...
And the next one came and took a whole cappuccino machine and flew off into the sky.
You'd be amazed what difference that makes.

Only brew the amount of coffee that'll be consumed and store leftover coffee in a thermos or something like that.
Remember, don't let it go to waste.
Uh-uh.
There are kids somewhere in the world who can't drink coffee.
Tonight, as you listen to us live here on the show,
though the children have no coffee...
Before serving, always stir the coffee in the pot or thermos.
This will ensure that the coffee flavor is perfect for each cup.
Thank you for coffee, John!
And a final tip.
Never interrupt the brewing process.
Brew us, interrupt us,
by filling your cup in the pot.
In the middle of the brewing cycle.
This is a definite no-no.
Yes, coffee achievers, if you follow these simple rules and do not violate the coffee code,
you can break on through to the other side.
He said it!
Your Saturation type picture says to follow these rules.

Let's get back to the interview.
Now, Jimmy, where did...

Was this actually your own invention?
Was Bob involved?
Or did you hear somebody else doing it?
Or was it something you can adapt it?
Oh, here's what happened.
This is the truth.
You know, like...
Yes.
Can you hear that okay?
Yeah, splendid.
Thank you.
That was a good answer.
Thanks, Jimmy.

I just feel like rocking it out there.

The dog snarled and
left.
The young woman, I'll never forget that look of pure horror on her face as that dog brought
her to the ground, screaming for help. I held my stomach, doubled over, gleefully laughing.
The way the blood spurted out of her jugular vein reminded me of a horse left unattended.
I also will never forget her face when she finally spotted me at the top of my stairs,
pink in the face from laughing so hard, tears streaming down my face. I'm not sure exactly
what she was thinking at that point, but I'm sure it was her.
It was something equally amusing.
You can do.
If you live in a war area or small town that has preserved traditional American values,
stay there. Watch your family for signs of disobedience or strange behavior. Stay away
from the television. It has become infested with subliminal messages that lure you and
your loved ones into the cold.
Are you sick and tired of corrupt government bureaucrats sucking your paycheck dry? Do you
refuse to vote because you can't bear the burden of having to decide whether to elect a scum-sucking
baby murderer or a cloven-hoofed child-pimp to be your next president? There is an alternative.
Make your vote. Nolan Void.
Under Nolan Void's four-year plan, every American will receive two new cars and the
guns to protect them. Nolan Void promises to fill Snake River Canyon with lawyers and
politicians and then burn them to ashes with napalm. Nolan Void promises to restore our
beloved America to its former glory, even if it costs the lives of every man, woman,
and child on Earth. On November 5th, vote Nolan Void for your children's vote.
The next.
Anyway, I love the baby Jesus and I think he's the best thing and that he's really, it's
really great when he shares his love because he's got enough love for everybody. You know
what I mean?
I do, sir, but...
Yeah, he's like, I can't even see a manger without thinking about him, eh? Yeah, I just,
I love him.
I just love the Jesus and I just thought I'd phone up and just, uh, you know, you know,
uh, I've only been into him for a couple hours though, but I'm really into him.
Boom. Boom, boom, boom, boom...
Hello, Christian Rapture Line.
Uh, yeah, I just wanted to make sure you Christians were still there.
We sure are. Were you interested in accepting Jesus as your lord and savior?
Uh, I'll have to think about it some more. Uh, I've gotta get down to the beach and catch
some rays. Uh, see you later.
Boom.
Boom.
Boom.
Boom.
Boom.
Boom.
Having trouble planning that next vacation?
Famous world sights getting humdrum?
Are you tired of hotels, coffee shops, and cranky stewardesses?
Then why not take the eternal vacation?
That's right, Rapture Airlines.
You don't even have to go to the airport.
No, Rapture Airlines is taking off right from where you stand.
And your flight? Oh boy.
Plenty of lake space, music by the Archangel,
and complimentary glasses of living water.
And that's just the start.
When you arrive at your destination,
no waiting in a crummy hotel lobby.
The owner himself will be there to greet you
with the keys to your own
private mansion.
It's so beautiful, you'll think you're in heaven.
Well, you are.
So don't put it off.
Get your name written into the book today.
We could take off at any time.
Don't get caught up in the world.
Get caught up in Rapture Airlines.
Truly the only way to fly.
They were said when they saw Jesus was,
Oh, look at the magic monkey.
Look at the magic monkey.
The magic monkey Jesus.
But he was no magic monkey.
He was a plain old garden variety monkey like you,
but one with a real good line of bull.
And you bought it.
Oh yeah, you bought that line of bull, you little monkeys.
That's what humans always do.
Pathetic pink humans, you take a good thing,
and then you try to make it something that it's not.
I mean Jesus, he...a nice guy, did some good things.
Got around, you know, educated people.
hey, why don't we try being nice to one another for a change?
And you said, oh, great, but what if they don't want to be nice?
Oh, I know, we'll kill them.
Then they have to be nice.
Kind of distorts the message, don't it?
You wanted logos and catchphrases and packaging.
Well, you got that.
It's called the Christians.
Yeah, Christians.
You took a man and you turned him into clip art.
We here at the Subgenius, we took a piece of clip art and we made him a man,
and that man's name is Bob.
Amen.
And he don't care about you either.
But at least he comes out and he tells you he don't care.
He doesn't care about you.
He doesn't care about your wife.
He doesn't care about your family.
He doesn't care about your dog.
He doesn't care about anything but your money.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
At least he's honest.
At least he's honest.
That's more than any Christian can tell you.
It's true.
Bob will pimp you just like Jesus will.
But, hey, Jesus will only take half your money.
Bob will take it all and give you slack.
More slack than you could ever get with your money.
And Bob will pat you on the back and hand you a froth stick.
But Jesus, he'll just bend up a coat hanger and pimp with you.
You're talking monkeys.
You dirty talking monkeys.
You soiled little monkeys.
I was watching the news last night, you little monkeys.
And there was a group that did a test on holy water in the Catholic churches.
And they found that there was a high level of contamination in the holy waters
because of you talking monkeys coming in and dipping your fingers into the holy water
when you walk into church.
And you didn't wash your hands first.
I know that you were picking your nose.
I know that you were licking Kentucky Fried Chicken.
You were licking the chicken grease from between your fingernails.
Or wiping your baby's butts.
Or stroking your house pets with that hand.
You know what I mean.
And then you go to church and dip your fingers in that water.
And the guy before you, and the guy before you were doing the same thing.
Oh, sure.
Oh, yeah.
That old man looking out his window.
Looking at the schoolroom.

And the children.
And tugging at the crotch of his underwear.
Didn't wash his hands before he went into the church.
Now did he?
Oh, yeah.
Think of how slimy and filthy that water would be.
With you nose pickers dipping your dirty little monkey paws in it.
And crossing yourselves, you sanctimonious bastards.
You all deserve to burn.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
You'll burn.
You'll burn.
And when you're burning, you're going to be crying out, oh, Jesus.
Jesus, come and save me from this terrible burning.
And you brought it on yourselves.
You've been working up to this since the dawn of time.
It wasn't enough that there'd be great mysteries to the universe.
It wasn't enough that man could look to the sky and wonderment.
And ask himself, what is out there?
Why am I here?
What is the meaning of life?
It wasn't enough to have that wonder and live a life dedicated to reveling in the wonder
and having slack and being one with the universe.
No, man had to invent his own answers to those mysteries.
He had to solve his own riddles with lies.
And then to pay the bills, he had to sell the answers to others.
And if you didn't want to buy those answers, they'd force them upon you at the point of
a knife or the end of a gun.
And they made you believe.
They made you believe.
They dangled it in front of you, that belief.
Like a carrot on the end of a stick, and you're running forever.
You'll never get it.
Because it's false.
It's fake.
It's cardboard city made of lies.
All lies.
There's no salvation to be had.
It's not out there.
You can't have it.
It wasn't meant for you.
It wasn't meant for the ignorant inborn human.
It's not out there.
It's a lie.
It's a lie.
Oh, yeah.
But you bought it.
You believed every single word of it.
You snatched at that carrot, and it wasn't even a carrot.
It was just a picture of a carrot.
It wasn't even a picture of a real carrot.
It wasn't even a real picture.
It was just a drawing of a real picture of a fake carrot.
That's right.
And you bought it.
Just like that stupid ass John Salvey.
You know who John Salvey is, brothers and sisters?
Who's John Salvey?
Oh, John Salvey, couple years ago.
He decided that the Lord wanted him to go to the abortion clinic and start mowing down all those abortionists, those evil people.
They wanted him to go down.
The Lord wanted him to go down and kill those evil murderers.
Well, guess where John Salvey is today?
I know where his body is.
They found him hanged in his jail cell today.
That's right, brothers and sisters.
One more Christian in hell, and you're all hot on his heels.
Oh, yeah, the devil lacks nothing better than a good Christian.
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
But there's at least two or three out there.
At least two or three of it.
You're capable of better and bigger things.
You can cast off that oppressive yoke of the conspiracy.
Let someone else chase that fake picture of a fake real picture of a drawing of a fake carrot.
It don't matter.
You don't need it.
You don't need it.
Learn to use that opposable thumb, you silly monkey.
I mean, just stop right where you are.
Look around and say the hell with it.
Slack off.
Have some fun for once.
Don't worry about it.
Don't pay your bills.
What are they gonna do?
Take your stuff?
It's only stuff.
You're not gonna need that stuff come X-Day.
You have all the stuff you want, Dad.
Who cares?
Yeah, that stuff will be your memorial come X-Day.
That stuff.
That stuff will be the big pile that marks your grave.
And you can mark your grave with an even bigger pile of stuff from the Church of the Subgenius.
We won't lie to you about how much we're lying to you.
We're lying through our teeth.
But we do send you the stuff.
If you write for free information about the stuff from Bob at Post Office Box 140306,

That's Box 140306, Dallas 75214.
You were listening to Dr. Legume and Ed Strange on the Prozac Free Outtakes tapes.
We heard some Hatesville by Boyd Rice and Dog by Sean Partridge from the Hatesville CD.
And Indian Rope Burn doing spontaneous combustion.
I already said that.
Well, it's the end of the show.
Friends, I'm proud.
I'm proud most of the time.
But I'm going to have to come out and admit I'm really tired of working with a $10 microphone.
And we're down to one working tape deck now.
Oh, God.
