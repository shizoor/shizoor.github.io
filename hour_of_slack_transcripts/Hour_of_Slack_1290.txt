Stay tuned for the PR news, then next up, Bob and the genius, our old Spock.
I never miss it.
Yeah, right.
What's your name?
Bobby.
Party's moving to Bobby's house, everybody.
Come on!
We fought it best to curtail Jimmy's altar boy activities for the moment.
Come on, he thought it was grape juice.
No, I didn't.
He doesn't know what he's saying. He's drunk. Cut us some slack.
I'm a nun, mister. I don't do slack.
Slack.
All right.
No one would have believed in the last years of the 19th century that this world was being washed keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's.
They were scrutinized and studied.
Perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the trenchant craft.
Creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.
Relution.
And I'm out to do.
No one gave a thought to the older worlds of spaces.
So should you.
Or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable.
It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days.
Most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars.
Perhaps.
In.
inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise.
Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish.
Intellects, vast, cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.
Early in the 20th century came the great disillusionment.
The great disillusionment.
And before we judge them too harshly, we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought.
Not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its own inferior races.
The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants in the space of 50 years.
Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain?
Are we such warriors of the same spirit?
During the opposition of 1894, a great light was seen on the illuminated part of the disk, first in the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers.
English readers put it at first in the issue of Nature, dated August 7th.
So bring your...
I'm inclined to think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge guns.
So bring your...
The vast hits sunk into their planet from which their shots were fired.
The peculiar markings and different things behind it were seen near the site of that outbreak during the next two oppositions.
The storm burst upon us six years ago now.
As Mars approached opposition, the veil of Java set the wires of the astral-temporal exchange palpitating with the amazing intelligence of the huge outbreak of incandescent gas upon the planet.
It had occurred towards midnight of the 12th.
The spectroscope...
The lights of the telescope...
...to which the table once resorted indicated a mass of flaming gas.
Table.
Uhhhh

Thank you one and all.
I'm darn glad I drove from Danbury, Connecticut.
Thank you, people.
Great party.
All of this back and forth and debate implies that there are really choices in this country,
that we really have choices, freedom of choice.
It's an illusion.
It's an all-volunteer army.
Americans are having trouble filling the slots in this all-volunteer army.
I wonder why.
Raise the pay of the money.
Let me say one thing about choice.
There is no real choice.
They say freedom of choice.
You're given an illusion of choice.
Americans are meant to feel free.
Right.
The exercise of meaningless choices.
You don't have, you know what the choices are in this country?
Paper or plastic.
A file or window.
Smoking or non-smoking.
Those are your real choices.
You don't get to choose.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let's go.

This nonsense is the Hour of Slack, episode number 1290,
and that business there from Dimension X was pulled and yanked
by our friend Reverend Sweetness McGee of the Ministry of Slack,
one of the other shows from the Church of the Subgenius.
This episode, rather than going to church like normal,
we're back at the Church of Devo, you might say,
with recordings from the annual devotional held in Cleveland,
a gathering of bands and weirdos influenced by Devo.
And that certainly includes many subgenii,
such as most of the members of Devo itself.
Anyway, before the collage, we heard the Spud Boys,
the world's foremost Devo emulation band,
performing the new traditionalist theme.
And before that, some George Carlin on freedom of choice
and the good Malcolm...
...content with his song No Fishing,
recorded at the devotional in the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland.
The collages at the beginning were by The Large,
except for the Leonard Nimoy War of the Worlds bit,
which we found on the mysterious Berea, Kentucky collage tape.
The music in the background is by Rural War Room.
And next up, live at the devotional of 2010,
recorded by Regis Sedlock and crew,
the band Fartbarf, with an instrumental accent,
on the mental, called Hero of Time.

She starts off when I don't usually
Then I whip it out, rub her no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your mouth
Pull your G-string down fast
Blew that back out, in the parking lot
Buy a tariff fee and a green drop top
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Jeans skirt, what next?

Talkin' about a beautiful figure, astonishing as Greek mythology
Body be just like a girl in the
What's that movie?
Nevermind let me enter your atmosphere as you enter my world
And let me touch that booty
I can't believe that your mama that cold
Her daughter got such an astonishing soul
You need a model to grow
Still a player, no you got it when you climb up from the bottom to the top of the pole
Plus you can pop out control

It's making me say what I gotta do to get with that
You want some media baby, you need a better man
He come up politics, I'mma be your weatherman
Cause every time I'm lookin' up, I see more pasts
I'mma pass the least you can in the forecast
This a rave, battle rave

It's a celebration, you the champion, he is the better, better
Look it on the road
Walk, walk, fashion baby, work it with that bitch crazy
Walk, walk, fashion baby, work it with that bitch crazy
Nervous energy, yes
Um, this episode, by the way, fans, is not just devotionally oriented
But also collage oriented
And here's one from the strange and mysterious CD
That was sent to us, elaborately hand-labeled, Out Mouth
What do you say to the woman that's being raped by someone that's only half-born?
Now what do you say? You know what I say?
Call the police, don't set me up
I'm not a straw man, fool
I didn't fall off a turnip truck
And I didn't come here on a green banana boat
You may have, but I didn't
What do I say to a woman that's being raped?
Call the police, or kick the rapist in the balls
I'll kick you in the balls until you throw up
So climb your fucking river, bitch
It's time for Ask Dr. Stupid
One, two, three, four
I'll kick you in the balls
I'll kick you in the balls
I'll kick you in the balls
I'll kick you in the balls
I'll kick you in the balls
You be squatters in your own homes, don't you leave
Uh, follow the Japanese example
And say, I'm sorry
And then either do one of two things
Resign, or go commit suicide
I'm gonna go commit suicide
I'm gonna go kill yourself, good
I'm gonna go kill myself, good
So take the sword
All problems in common
Ha ha ha ha
Hard hard, cold, and furious
Falsehood, that identity
Sneaking in
Side with me
Solve the case
You got the detail
Leave the lines
And now you've memorized
If I know
You're about to start them
Think the same
Then move and play it again
We will know
When you will use it
Take your time
We know that's all you got
With the word
We can remove it
It's okay
It's not quite on the fly
Wake and see
You're not alone
Just the time
A phrase of words
In your mind
You said to me
You did not know
This seems alright
It starts to show
We got the salt
We got the sugar
Better said
From a pot of lye
What you got
Is not the same

What you think
It's a charm
That puts you on the spot
Took your lies
From all the seven
He just said
To reap with all the worst
In your brain
There is a message
Played by us
Because we got it first
You said to me
You did not know
This seems alright
It starts to show
That we're all in this together

This information is the key
That's why you stole it back from me
What do the dogs and broken heads do
Down the hall
Where you took your motion sensor
Up your soft feet
And five minutes through your head
You said I'm seeing your memory
To become a dent
You said to me
You did not know
This seems alright
It starts to show
This information is the key
That's why you stole it back from me
Let me tell you about where I live
Here in the Buckeye State
The wind blows fresh and the air is clear
And the living is really great
Big and busy
That's why I say
Akron, Canton
They're sure to love you
They're sure okay
Canton, Akron
That's where I'll stay
The whole darn world just rolls along
On the tires we send their way
We've got the feel of the bars of steel
We turn out every day
Derby Downs, Stadium Park
They're why I say
Akron, Canton
They're sure okay
Can
Akron
That's where I'll stay
Massillon, Cahoga Falls
Barberton and Stone
Kent Analyze and Portage Lakes
And Hello Radio
They're recommended for a lifetime
Or just a day
Akron, Canton
They're sure okay
Canton, Akron
That's where I'll stay
Akron, Canton
They're sure okay

Probably 12 seconds
Has expired
And I'm looking at him and he's
He's looking above me.
He's looking at the wall in back of my head.
And this is about 12 seconds between beet red and white as a sheet of paper.
He's white as 10,000 sheets of Xerox paper.
And then his shoulders drop.
And I thought, he's having a heart attack.
He's going to die on my shift.
I don't think this is good.
Or he's having a stroke or both.
And I start to talk and I feel this check.
It's almost like a hand went in front of my mouth.
Mike, don't say a word.
I'm taking care of this.
And so four or five minutes go by.
It seems like an eternity.
I don't say a word.
He doesn't either.
Then he starts to mumble.
And he says, uh, uh, we'll pay you.
And I thought, did I hear what I think I just heard?
And he goes, we'll pay you.
And then about four or five minutes later, the color comes back to his face.
His shoulders come up.
And he just looks at me for the first time, somewhat friendly.
And he goes, I think I'll go back to Colorado.
And I said, Bob, OK, those are the words.
The only words I said was, Bob, OK.

Why do you think they don't let doctors minister to their own families?
Why do you think they don't let doctors minister to their own families?
Because they're emotionally involved, and it's the same with lawyers.
You could deal with this case standing on your head, but throw in the landscape of your youth, the genetic co-dependence of your family, the subtext of sibling rivalry, and Bob's your uncle. Or your auntie. Or your brother and father, depending on the kind of family you come from.
Or your guru and slack master, depending on what kind of religion you come from. We and the devos all worship that man Bob, and there's nothing wrong with that.
Nothing any of us can do about it.
That collage and the one before it were by The Large.
That wild cover of Devo's Planet Earth was performed at the devotional by our friend Poopy Necropondy and Cream-Based Suits.
The Akron Canton Hometown song was, well, it was accompanied on theremin by the good Reverend K.R.K. Ryden of the band-like entity Ken the Magic Corner God.
K.R.K. is known for the graphics he did for Devo over the centuries.
And the spy rock fast number there was called Number Seven, meaning I think 007, and that band was International Espionage.
To me, they sound like a cross between Devo and the Ramones.
But now, some purely subgenius music, a piece called Stop the Conspiracy, from a subgenius about whom we know very little, but from whom we have plenty of music,
which you'll be hearing he or it or she or whatever goes by the name Slack T.
Praise Slack T.
We have been discovering that there is plenty of musicありがとうございました .
This is the idea that you wanted to know and we easily do that to old enough characters to pull up there.
They often do it for entertainment purposes and this was actually done to celebrate Devo's forthcoming album.

That Devo song cover was by Bottle
and was lifted from the latest devotional compilation,
not necessarily beautiful, but mutated.
Before that, the rocking synthesizer band was Fart Barf,
recorded live at the devotional.
And before that, and coming up, collage by The Large.
Friends, if you want to know more about the devotional
or what Devo itself is up to now,
you might see devo-obsesso.com

We're not always this Devo-ish at Church of the Subgenius,
but I could hardly just sit on these recordings
because they're too spiky.
