1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
From PR News in Washington, I have the ability to short out industrial equipment.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,660
There are continued reports of pirates. Officials say there's no direct evidence.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,480
I'm expensive and difficult.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,540
Britain is registering its hottest October day in recorded history.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,280
Right, the Sid Barrett enigma.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,860
There's an outbreak of 15,000 pirates.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,080
NATO says it's captured a senior leader of the biting ants.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,420
They're known as hairy crazy ants, and they tried to bring down a jet on Christmas in Yemen and potentially heading toward Bermuda.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,940
This is pure.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,540
Was it gray aliens? No.

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,880
Was it reptiles from another dimension? No.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,480
Was it the Vatican? No.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,160
It was the.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,120
And is what do you call it? It's normal.

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,880
I don't know what it is. I don't know.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,180
But, you know, of course, Hollywood's going to convince us differently.

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,940
All right. Bob, I think so. I'm not sure.

18
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,520
Beth, I hear you calling, but I can't come home right now.

19
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,580
What are y'all doing, like probing each other?

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,580
Just a few more hours and I'll be back home to you.

21
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,600
Oh, Beth, I hear them calling. Beth, what can I do? Yeah.

22
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,940
A load of crap. What are we talking about, Bob?

23
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,620
If I'm feeling generous.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,980
I will surprise you.

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,740
The Illuminati!

26
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,960
I'm undergoing a personality transformation now.

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,460
And, oh, yeah, white Southern American poor people.

28
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,260
Yeah, that's that.

29
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,100
Stop being stupid, people.

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,680
OK, are we that so brainwashed?

31
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,320
No. No.

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,580
Well, maybe yes.

33
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,980
Although, you know, Bob.

34
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:41,880
Oh, my God.

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,680
Obviously, Bob production.

36
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,880
I'm guessing something like that.

37
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,100
Yeah.

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,780
And that's why there's so many wonderful songs written for your children today,

39
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,660
like Booty Love and Booty Meat and Shake Your Ass, Bob,

40
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
and let them see what they get.

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:54,960
You.

42
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,160
You got and all these wonderful songs that will inspire your daughter to grow up and become a.

43
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,560
So where were we?

44
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,840
Bob, what are the odds of that?

45
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,660
And gee, let's see.

46
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,940
You know, I bet don't have to sneeze.

47
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,600
I don't have to sneeze.

48
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,680
Anyway, back to.

49
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:08,660
I.

50
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,960
So I witnessed more violence.

51
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,360
I'm.

52
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,520
They adore me.

53
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,160
They love me.

54
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,680
So anyway, women are big fans of Bob and the rednecks.

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,820
OK, they're good people.

56
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,240
Anyway, all of a sudden, the police, the police, like everybody's freaking out.

57
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,380
Damn, there's always a catch.

58
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,960
I don't want to talk to these cocksuckers, but you have to.

59
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,940
In life, you have to do a lot of things you don't fucking want to do.

60
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,260
Many times.

61
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,000
That's what the fuck life is.

62
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,120
One vile fucking task after another.

63
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,240
But don't get aggravated.

64
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,800
Then the enemy has you by the short hair.

65
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,020
Well, God damn it.

66
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,080
That cocksucker motherfucker shit.

67
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,520
Fuck his dick.

68
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:07,760
We drove all the way to Fredericksburg, Texas, and got a motel room specifically so that

69
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,620
we could go to Enchanted Rock, one of our very favorite places.

70
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:18,960
And as we left Fredericksburg for Enchanted Rock, we saw a sign that said park closed.

71
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,900
We pulled over and called the park.

72
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,740
And they said,

73
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:30,860
Yes, until three days from now, Enchanted Rock is closed for a public hunt, which has

74
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,240
been set up by the public cunt, who is, or cunts.

75
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:46,640
The park is closed so that people who signed up six months ago in advance can go shoot

76
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,840
innocent animals.

77
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,620
And people like us who just want to hike around the rock.

78
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,260
And explore the cave.

79
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,940
And fuck and fromp.

80
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,180
Can't do that.

81
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,760
All you can do is kill and shoot.

82
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:10,100
And we could not even park by the sign to take a picture of me in the Bob mask standing

83
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,200
with the rock and the Enchanted Rock sign in the background.

84
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:22,500
The minute we pulled over to take a picture, this rather unfriendly Texas redneck park ranger said,

85
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,520
You can't park here.

86
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,060
You can't even stop here.

87
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,740
I said, we were just going to take a picture with you.

88
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,780
No, you can't even stop here.

89
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,840
He didn't say why.

90
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,920
I said, the park is closed, right?

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,800
He goes, yeah, there's hunters and they aren't supposed to shoot towards the road, but you

92
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,240
never know.

93
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,020
And then he hung around and waited to see us leave.

94
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,400
So we have been fucked running.

95
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,100
It's a long, you know, we went out of our way to go to Enchanted Rock.

96
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,740
We really did.

97
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,480
To go to Enchanted Rock.

98
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,480


99
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,480


100
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,480


101
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,480


102
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,480


103
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,480


104
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,700
We've been here before.

105
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,440
We wanted to explore a certain cave that's kind of hidden away in the back that we didn't

106
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,340
get to last time.

107
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,740
Well, it's not going to be open again for three days.

108
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,240
We've got to be heading for California by then.

109
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:12,260
This natural place enchanted us and now it has infuriated us.

110
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:12,840
Yeah.

111
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,480
So I called the park services and they said, oh yeah, it's got cows.

112
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,780
He can't come out until January 13th.

113
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,460
Now she was kind of upset.

114
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,460


115
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,460


116
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,460


117
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,460


118
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,460


119
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,460


120
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,460


121
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,460


122
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,460


123
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,460


124
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,460


125
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,460


126
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,220
I said, oh, yeah, well, I'm going to leave it at that.

127
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,080
I said, do you have any other suggestions?

128
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,360
And she said, oh yeah, there's Inch Lake about 45 minutes from here.

129
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,400
But you better call.

130
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,140
Yeah.

131
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,300
But you better call first because they might be having a public hunt too.

132
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:48,900
So I did call and they're not having, and they are, they're having a public hunt on

133
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,320
the other side of the lake, but they do have two hiking trails open.

134
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,940
And Inch Lake was a place we considered going today.

135
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,920
We thought we might go there today and then spend all day tomorrow at Enchanted Rock.

136
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:09,740
But it looks like we're just going to be leaving this part of Texas and heading out west through

137
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,640
the most desolate parts of the world without ever getting a chance to get our rocks off

138
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,240
at the cave at Enchanted Rock.

139
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,940
So all we can hope is that Inch Lake, which is another

140
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,060
hour from here actually, is worth the hike.

141
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:34,700
All we want is a nice little privacy hike with some gorgeous earth, eyeball shattering

142
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,000
landscapes and eroded rocks everywhere.

143
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,120
That's all we ask.

144
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,480
Blind railing scenery.

145
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,220
That's it.

146
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,100
Just, you know.

147
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:51,220
Oh, and just so we don't sound totally stupid, it's not like we didn't read up every possible

148
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,400
aspect of Enchanted Rock, even though we've been here before.

149
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:02,540
I've got like dozens of tourist books and guides and websites and not one of them mentioned

150
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,540
this public hunt.

151
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,960
God damn!

152
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,620
Oh, fuck you, Jack!

153
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,620
And your dick shit!

154
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,000
God.

155
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,200
Oh, fuck you, Jack!

156
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,200


157
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,200


158
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,480
None of them said they'd ever be closed ever!

159
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,840
No, that's an extra little surprise that the Texas Parks Department and everything leaves

160
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:35,960
for you.

161
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,140
Why don't you just recalculate your goddamn ass off, Jack?

162
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,840
Or dick, or whatever your name is.

163
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,500
I'm fucking high on the road.

164
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,560
I wanna face camera when you're old.

165
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,440
Don't you want a snitch from blah blah blah.

166
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,200
But you're a snitch from blah blah blah.

167
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,200


168
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,200


169
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,200


170
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,400
But you and me never had a laugh.

171
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,540
I'm fucking high on the road.

172
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,600
I wanna face camera when you're old.

173
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:56,860
I'm fucking high on the road.

174
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,420
Don't you want a snitch from blah blah blah.

175
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,440
But you and me never had a laugh.

176
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,540
I'm fucking high on the road.

177
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,760
I wanna face camera when you're old.

178
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,600
I'm fucking high on the road.

179
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,600
I wanna face camera when you're old.

180
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:21,180
Well, it turned out to be a good thing, despite all my cussing, that Enchanted Rock was not

181
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,800
Tanted Rock was closed for the public hunt.

182
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,980
Indeed.

183
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,660
Because there wasn't much else we could do, but sort of a secondary choice on our list called Inks Lake.

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,520
And Sphinx said that Inks was not all that hot, but he didn't know.

185
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,000
No, he really didn't know.

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:55,360
Most of Inks Lake is pretty ordinary, but there's a section called the Devil's Waterhole, or as Princess Wee and I call it, Bob's Waterhole.

187
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:02,640
I think they call it the Devil's Waterhole because it's so cool, they don't want the uncool people going down in there.

188
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:10,620
They want to scare off the idiots so that only the subgeniuses will be attracted to a place with a name like the Devil's Waterhole.

189
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,900
It actually looks like God's.

190
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:21,660
It's an incredibly beautiful section of river rocks that are granite.

191
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:32,660
It's kind of like it's part of Enchanted Rock, but it's a more crumbly part and is carved as if the...

192
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:39,900
I would say it is kind of carved as if the devil was let loose on it before he was cast into hell.

193
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,980
You know, because he originally was one of God's favorite angels of life.

194
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,200
His waterhole looks like an angel carved it.

195
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,920
It really does.

196
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,240
It's just beautiful.

197
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,540
It was a bit of a climb to get down in there because that's what we like to do.

198
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,700
That's the whole idea on these hikes is to get down in there.

199
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:13,300
Anyway, ironically and yet subgeniously enough, the fact that our original goal, Enchanted Rock, was closed turned out to be a stroke of luck.

200
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,620
Because otherwise we probably would have blown off the Devil's Waterhole at Inks Lake.

201
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,100
Yes.

202
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,120
And I'm really glad we came here.

203
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,760
Me too.

204
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,260
Because it's an out-of-the-way hoodoo-filled amazing spot.

205
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,240
Mm-hmm.

206
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,220
Not too many poe-buckers here at all.

207
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,660
Now we have to go back to Fredericksburg though.

208
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,860
That's an hour.

209
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,620
And then I have to do an hour of slack, which I don't think will be this one.

210
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,320
No.

211
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,200
I think this one will be heard months after.

212
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,260
No.

213
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:43,260


214
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:43,260


215
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,100
It's recorded.

216
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,640
So, praise Bob.

217
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,040
Blah, blah.

218
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,300
Whoo!

219
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:08,560
You know, I was walking down the beach trying to get to my woody.

220
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,960
Well, I had my suds cold and my buds was gold.

221
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,280
I was walking down the beach.

222
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,760
I was trying to get high and get real drunk.

223
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,580
Huh!

224
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,400
Lay in the sand.

225
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,160
With my beach buddy.

226
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,960
With my beach buddy.

227
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:31,960
But out to the side of my eye, I saw the ultimate wave.

228
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,460
The super wave.

229
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,000
It was the most stoked-out stud wave in all reality.

230
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,060
It was 900 feet tall.

231
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,340
And on the backside of reality too.

232
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,780
I saw a black hole right in the middle of it.

233
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,920
A vortex.

234
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,240
Where the...

235
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,760
I was ready to shoot through that black hole.

236
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,820
And my molecules rearranged.

237
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,520
I'm going to hang five as I shoot through the black hole and the vortex of the super

238
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,560
wave.

239
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,700
The most God awful wave in reality.

240
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,960
On the backside of reality.

241
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,040
I'm going to hang five at the back.

242
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,040


243
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,040


244
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,040


245
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,040


246
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,040


247
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,040


248
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,040


249
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,580
The front side and the left and the right side

250
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,580
Whoo!

251
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:20,880
Whoo!

252
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,080
I was tubing

253
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,680
Whoo!

254
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,500
Whoo!

255
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,260
I was fixing to cut out

256
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,500
Whoo!

257
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,920
Whoo!

258
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,240


259
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,320
And then

260
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,920
Whoo!

261
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,520
And then

262
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,240
The giant

263
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,460
Whatchamacallit

264
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,300
It was one of those whatchamacallits

265
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,840
Just opened up right out of the sea

266
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,620
String on that one and start sucking me down

267
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,400
It was like a vortex funnel

268
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,180
Sucking me down to the bottom of the ocean

269
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,080
I was getting sucked down

270
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,220
And you know

271
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,000
As much as I hate to admit it

272
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,740
It felt pretty good

273
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,140
It felt pretty good

274
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,000
Getting sucked down in that vortex wave

275
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,260
All the way down to the bottom of the ocean

276
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,040
But God, I hate to admit it

277
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,180
But God, I hate to admit it

278
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,540
Whoo!

279
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,800
It felt pretty good

280
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,740
But I hate to admit it

281
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,240
Whoo!

282
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,160


283
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,840
Moving on

284
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,560
On the backside of reality

285
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,280
My bad boy's on the side

286
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,300
Right the way

287
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,960
I'm stoking on my five things

288
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,960
And on down to the backside of reality

289
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,660
Riding on my bad boy's

290
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,060
Stoking on my five things

291
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,020
guitar solo

292
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,940
Our hands in pilgrim bags

293
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,060
And slugs

294
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,400
guitar solo

295
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,640
guitar solo

296
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,140
guitar solo

297
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,140


298
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,140


299
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,320
That was the Swingin' Love Corpses, dear friends.

300
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,980
The title tune from their late 80s or early 90s album,

301
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,440
The Backside of Reality.

302
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,980
Colonel Sphinx drumming on vocals

303
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,420
with Dr. Philo drumming on vocals and sax,

304
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,840
Ray Hay on guitar,

305
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,980
Doug Fowler on bass,

306
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,340
and Skippy Mojo Butcher on drums.

307
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,080
You can find infinite hours of this band,

308
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,360
the Swingin' Love Corpses,

309
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,880
is on Philo's website,

310
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,000
quiveringbrain.com,

311
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,480
which also leads to

312
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,620
high-quality puzzling evidence show recordings.

313
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,560
The music in the background

314
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,240
is from that same album.

315
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,680
Before that,

316
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,520
some of The Devil's Family Vacation,

317
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,360
which is the theme of this hour of Slack,

318
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,520
number 1,358.

319
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,360
The new PR news

320
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,300
is by Reverend Cosmic Debris.

321
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,480
The intro collage

322
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,340
was by Reverend Royal Debris,

323
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,280
the Decapitator.

324
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,240
We heard my hero,

325
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,820
or Shorderpersav,

326
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,860
Al Swearingen,

327
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,060
from that ancient show,

328
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,780
Deadwood.

329
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,940
And the little bit of music mash there

330
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,360
was by The Large.

331
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,520
Now, back to our vacation recordings,

332
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,360
which, incidentally,

333
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,040
we were inspired to do

334
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,120
by similar ones

335
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,260
made by Reverend Tawdry Milktoast

336
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,160
and Dr. Zeronius

337
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,860
on their way to 14X Day last year.

338
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,800
Incidentally,

339
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,660
probably by the time you hear this,

340
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,980
we'll have selected photos

341
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,400
and or movies

342
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,400
of these various places we visited.

343
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,360
All I can say now is

344
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,580
check the news section of subgenius.com,

345
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,120
which gets you to my blog,

346
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,780
or the log for this episode

347
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,200
in the radio section,

348
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,500
or, for that matter,

349
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,280
you can look at YouTube,

350
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,440
RevStang,

351
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,820
one word, RevStang,

352
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,060
and look for

353
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,300
Subgenius Family Vacation.

354
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,600
Subgenius Family Vacation.

355
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,160
It's probably no surprise

356
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,900
that everywhere we went,

357
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,680
from friends' yards in the cities

358
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,740
to state parks,

359
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,280
we saw endless numbers of...

360
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,100
Hello, little deer.

361
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,380
They are so tame.

362
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,440
I guess they're just used to

363
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,160
humans feeding them or something.

364
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,000
There's tons of them.

365
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,960
There's people everywhere around here.

366
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,140
Oh, well.

367
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,940
This guy's right in the road behind us.

368
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,540
There's one...

369
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,680
Yeah, oh, they're waiting for us

370
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,540
to hand him an apple.

371
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,700
They don't even know how to eat

372
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,780
deer food.

373
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,960
...food anymore, probably.

374
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,760
Poor deer things.

375
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,260
Poor, poor deer little doe.

376
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,320
Oh, oh.

377
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,060
Dope.

378
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,060
Hey, watch how you say that.

379
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,760
Yes, princess, we are tame.

380
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,620
Turn left at park road four.

381
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,380
Oh, shut up!

382
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,680
A listener has sent a letter in

383
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,500
to the show.

384
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,760
But what did he...

385
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,580
It's not a letter that was meant for the show.

386
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,840
It was a letter that was obviously

387
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,420
found somewhere.

388
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,700
Like, outside of a junior high school.

389
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,560
Oh, yeah, Violet's got this crazy letter he found.

390
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,900
A junior high school?

391
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,140
Actually, it was found by a chaos maker.

392
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,780
Mama Cat.

393
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,840
Now, what's the thing about the junior high school game?

394
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,900
I found a letter.

395
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,540
You should see this letter I found.

396
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,660
It's just amazing.

397
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,800
But it's about a junior high school?

398
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,540
Yeah, it starts out,

399
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,340
I like rainbows, do you?

400
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,600
I like rainbows, do you?

401
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
And then it's addressed to someone named James.

402
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,680
James?

403
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,440
Says, hi, this is a little odd.

404
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:08,760
I'm not a junior high school.

405
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,080
I know, lol, but I'm bored.

406
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,300
Lol, it's that damn three-letter acronym again.

407
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,320
Anywho, how are you?

408
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,920
Well, I probably know

409
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,340
because I'm probably texting you.

410
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:21,660
This is torture.

411
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,260
Lol, jeez.

412
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,080
Really, wish I did just like you.

413
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,460
In a way, I do.

414
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,140
Maybe we can hang

415
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,300
and chill like you.

416
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,800
I hope you make

417
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,600
a football team so I can go

418
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,480
to your game and cheer you on

419
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:38,580
and cheer you on.

420
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,180
My cousin said

421
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,100
she will drive me there.

422
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,640
I just need money.

423
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,840
I like giraffes.

424
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,820
Just thought you should know that again.

425
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,760
I kind of wish you did stay

426
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,340
the week at my casa.

427
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,840
Lol.

428
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,720
It would be fun.

429
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,920
This is real.

430
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,180
It's written on lined paper

431
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,980
with different colored pencils.

432
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,660
Play with my dogs, chase my goats,

433
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,880
go on walks,

434
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,700
ride my quad.

435
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,120
I don't know what else.

436
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,740
Holy balls.

437
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,240
My wrist hurts.

438
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,580
I haven't written this much since school.

439
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,280
At the moment,

440
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,140
you're not texting back.

441
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,180
I'm going to draw you a picture

442
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,740
with a giraffe

443
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,720
and a sexy dragon.

444
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,020
Ten minutes later,

445
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,960
look on the back.

446
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,860
Oh my gosh.

447
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,640
The dragon and the giraffe

448
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,260
are having mad sex.

449
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,780
That didn't happen.

450
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,660
There is a dragon says,

451
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,060
I just jizzed.

452
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,520
And the giraffe says,

453
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,980
Oh, harder, babe.

454
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,160
Oh my gosh.

455
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,320
Sorry, I was bored.

456
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,240
I didn't want to wait.

457
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,100
My ass hurts right now.

458
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,240
And I need to shave soon.

459
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,020
Balls.

460
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,280
Writing this letter

461
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,520
kind of made me like you

462
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,340
a wee bit more.

463
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,820
I'm not the best drawer.

464
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,600
And my ankle hurts too.

465
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,320
Ball, do you like my ladder?

466
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,600
Hey, anyways,

467
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,260
I can't wait to hang with you.

468
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,680
We can make sandcastles.

469
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,900
I wish that the listeners

470
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,620
could see this lined paper

471
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,120
that Philo's reading from.

472
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,540
It really was found on the ground

473
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,120
outside of school.

474
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,280
It kind of looks like sandwiches.

475
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,480
And it really is written

476
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,900
in multicolored

477
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,900
colored pencil.

478
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:36,800
It's a colored pencil.

479
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,320
Certain words like lol

480
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
will be in blue or red.

481
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,040
Well, I'm a go-go now.

482
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,280
Talk to you later.

483
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,040
Duh.

484
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,880
Bye.

485
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,140
Wait, here's my address

486
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,220
and my phone number.

487
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,200
That's...

488
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,640
Do you think that that's a girl,

489
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,020
a young girl writing to a young boy?

490
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,820
Or a sleeve to a master?

491
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,200
A dominatrix to a Eugene?

492
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,200
Dr. Bell?

493
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,180
What the?

494
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,020
Here it is.

495
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,760
This is the document in question.

496
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,200
Oh, my gosh.

497
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,360
I'm touching this special...

498
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:13,620
Look, on the...

499
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,020
There's a rainbow on the top

500
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,640
and on the back.

501
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:15,660
It is.

502
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:15,960
It's decorated.

503
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,100
It shows the giraffes

504
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,120
having intercourse.

505
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,620
Giraffes and the dragons

506
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,700
are rainbows and...

507
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,960
Yeah, well, I can't see

508
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,620
what it says.

509
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,340
Oh, my.

510
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,400
Living life together.

511
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,020
Well, this is certainly

512
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,840
an explicit illustration here.

513
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,740
Singing in harmony.

514
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,700
It does indeed show

515
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,540
the intromission.

516
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,500
It certainly brings back

517
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:36,800
the...

518
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:36,800


519
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:36,800


520
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:36,800


521
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,960
The memories of the vapid conversations

522
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,940
I heard driving carpool

523
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,160
for teenagers

524
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,140
back in the 90s.

525
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,440
It is a dragon

526
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,900
and a giraffe.

527
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,020
It's almost like an aboriginal picture

528
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,500
of a Komodo dragon.

529
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,360
And it's reared up and then

530
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,140
inserting its...

531
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,280
One of them said

532
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,080
they just released

533
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,640
this ejaculatory edition.

534
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,760
This giraffe.

535
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,620
And it is immaculate giraffe.

536
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,980
It's a colorful...

537
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,680
It's a profound letter.

538
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,780
Maybe we should send it

539
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,040
to Found Magazine.

540
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,300
But I like rainbows.

541
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,620
To do a year-long...

542
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,700
Found Radio Show.

543
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,140
Well, she starts off

544
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,560
as being this cute little thing

545
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,480
and then she gets into

546
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,360
interspecies bestiality

547
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,240
and then...

548
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,140
We're leaving Llano

549
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,700
after a nice day

550
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,640
at the Devil's Waterhole.

551
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,500
But we...

552
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,060
On the way there,

553
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,860
we went by this yard

554
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,520
full of art really fast.

555
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,800
And Princess, we went out there.

556
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

557
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,500
I want to stop and turn around

558
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,020
and go back there.

559
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,120
I said, no, no, no.

560
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,660
We have to go and do the park

561
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,200
before the sun goes down,

562
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,140
which was true.

563
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,240
But on coming back,

564
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,180
she kept her eye open

565
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,920
and just outside of Llano

566
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,100
is a shop.

567
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,820
Or rather,

568
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,960
it's not really a shop,

569
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,500
I don't think.

570
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,700
It's more like a museum

571
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,980
in this woman's yard.

572
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,040
Her name is Kathleen Smith.

573
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,420
And her shop is called

574
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,600
the Tin Lizard

575
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,380
or her museum

576
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,600
or her website

577
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,560
or something.

578
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,480
But she basically

579
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,580
welds metal trees

580
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,540
on which you can hang

581
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,580
anything you want.

582
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,240
But her artwork

583
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,620
consisted of these metal trees

584
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,000
peppering her yard.

585
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,440
Dozens of them,

586
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,480
I would say.

587
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,180
Some were symmetrical.

588
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,980
Some were asymmetrical.

589
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,440
Some were whimsical.

590
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,500
They're metal trees

591
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,180
and they're covered

592
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,320
with glass bottles.

593
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,640
That was her art,

594
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,300
was putting glass bottles

595
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,700
on the ends of these trees.

596
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,160
Wine bottles, mostly.

597
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,940
So one tree might be all

598
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,200
a certain type of

599
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,800
big green wine bottle

600
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,040
and another tree might be

601
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,880
a certain type of

602
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,500
small bright blue bottle.

603
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,040
And others would be

604
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,500
all colors of bottles

605
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,920
plus kitschy coffee cups

606
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,260
and beer mugs

607
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,880
and stuff with funny animals

608
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,120
or faces on them.

609
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,280
Or one was fested

610
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,780
with ice.

611
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,940
Eyeglasses all over the place.

612
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,040
One had model birds

613
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,120
all over it.

614
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,360
And one had Elvis

615
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,360
at the top.

616
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,120
That was the one

617
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,220
that caught my eye.

618
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,540
So it was a psychedelic feast

619
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,280
of kitschiness

620
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,000
and bright colors.

621
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,500
And Kathleen herself

622
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,120
was hot.

623
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,540
Yeah, she was.

624
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,360
She's our age

625
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,680
so it's okay for us

626
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,940
to say a thing like that.

627
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,180
She might even be

628
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,740
a little bit older.

629
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:36,800
She might be a little bit

630
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,280
older than us.

631
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,060
If that's possible.

632
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,260
I don't think so.

633
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,200
Her grandkids were older

634
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,060
and her kids were older.

635
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,480
But I think she started young.

636
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,420
Anyway, she was a

637
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,320
really nice looking

638
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,660
Texas gilf.

639
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,100
Classic Texan gilf.

640
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,240
For your information,

641
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,260
Princess Wee.

642
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:54,640
Really?

643
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,660
Yeah, that was a

644
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,780
classic Texas gilf.

645
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,580
She just had that.

646
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,020
And look,

647
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,280
so the Tin Lizard

648
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,180
in Llano, Texas

649
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,280
is a great place

650
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,220
if you're rich.

651
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,960
We end up

652
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,060
in a lot of places

653
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,520
that are,

654
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,760
and they'd be great

655
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,160
if you're,

656
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,440
especially if you were rich.

657
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,700
They're great for us

658
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,540
to just look at.

659
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,800
And evidently,

660
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,720
if you happen to be

661
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,540
passing through

662
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,660
Fredericksburg or Llano

663
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,660
in sunset time,

664
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,680
she said the light

665
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
shining through

666
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,480
all the different

667
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,360
colored glass

668
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,000
vases and

669
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,060
glasses

670
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,960
is just

671
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,300
extraordinary.

672
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,340
But we got there

673
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,560
about five minutes

674
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,580
after sunset.

675
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,700
We missed it.

676
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,620
But maybe,

677
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,700
you'll see it.

678
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Yeah, so.

679
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,160
When you're passing through.

680
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,380
Eleventh,

681
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,000
tenth,

682
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,900
ninth,

683
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,720
seventh,

684
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,380
five,

685
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,160
three,

686
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,760
sound,

687
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,340
one,

688
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,100
start.

689
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,620
Murphy Classroom Films

690
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,080
presents

691
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,900
educational film

B-151,

693
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,700
Exorcism

694
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,720
and Your Daily Life.

695
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,120
Music

Music

703

704
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:15,860


705
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:15,860


706
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,740
Gee, Dad,

707
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,900
what a bummer.

708
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,420
Why, what's the matter, Jimmy?

709
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,120
My civics teacher assigned me

710
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,920
this dumb paper on exorcism,

711
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,060
and I'm supposed to go

712
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,260
play ring ball with Bruce.

713
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,140
I mean, what does exorcism

714
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,100
have to do with me,

715
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,260
and ring ball,

716
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,080
and Bruce?

717
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,300
More than you can ever imagine.

718
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,780
I used to feel

719
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,460
the same way

720
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,760
you do about exorcism,

721
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:37,940
Billy,

722
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,320
but your mom and I

723
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,220
learned long before

724
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:40,920
you were born

725
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,860
the real importance

726
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,440
that it has

727
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,560
in all our lives.

728
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,320
But I don't even understand

729
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,380
what it means, Dad.

730
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,360
Oh, well,

731
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,020
in a manner of speaking,

732
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,280
Willie,

733
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,600
exorcism is a transitive verb

734
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,760
meaning to expel

735
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,360
an evil spirit

736
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,580
from or out of

737
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,500
a person or place

738
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,340
by invocation

739
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,520
or use of holy names.

740
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,060
It's akin to the Greek

741
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,560
herkos,

742
00:27:59,680 --> 00:27:59,920
offense,

743
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,240
with its cognate

744
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,760
horkos,

745
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,240
an oath,

746
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,200
whence hokazine,

747
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,520
to bind with an oath,

748
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,460
thence exocesare,

749
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,440
exocesare,

750
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,500
that's low Latin.

751
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,220
Gee, Dad,

752
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,260
I still don't understand.

753
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:10,880
Oh.

754
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,600
Well, Timmy,

755
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,560
let's go see

756
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,680
my old friend Bob Brown

757
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,380
at the bank.

758
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,240
Again?

759
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,480
Good morning, Bob.

760
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,460
Morning, Bob.

761
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,080
Morning, Tommy.

762
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,140
Hi, Mr. Brown.

763
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,220
Well, how have you been

764
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:29,720
since you were here

765
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,140
this morning

766
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,700
asking about capillary action?

767
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,980
Fine, Mr. Brown.

768
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,840
Good, good.

769
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,360
Well, what is it now?

770
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,160
Wheat production

771
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,120
in the great northwest?

772
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:38,540
No.

773
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,960
The gross national product

774
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,520
of Sweden?

775
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,900
Golly, that's close.

776
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,060
Our animal friends?

777
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:43,580
Cold.

778
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:44,980
Exorcism?

779
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,720
Yes.

780
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,580
I have to write

781
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,580
this dumb paper.

782
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,840
Now, hold on.

783
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,400
Hold on, son.

784
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,420
You wouldn't call it dumb.

785
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,440
If you knew

786
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,600
about exorcism

787
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,480
what my old friend

788
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,060
Mayor Simmons

789
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,480
knows about exorcism,

790
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,840
why don't you

791
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,660
go and see him?

792
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,460
Good morning, Mayor Simmons.

793
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,360
Morning, Bob.

794
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,340
Morning, Freddy.

795
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,820
Well, what is it this time?

796
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,480
The Australian ballot?

797
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,020
Representative government

798
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,400
in post-war Indochina?

799
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,560
The cultivation of sea kelp?

800
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,040
Our internal waterways?

801
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:19,440
No.

802
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,220
Exorcism, Mr. Mayor.

803
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:21,980
Now, Billy,

804
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,620
I can tell you this.

805
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,060
If it weren't for exorcism,

806
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
Merleville wouldn't be

807
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,840
the town it is today.

808
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,880
Take a look at this graph.

809
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,340
Oh, that's very interesting,

810
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:33,860
Mr. Mayor,

811
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,620
but I already know

812
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,540
about the pancreas.

813
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,180
Oh, well,

814
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,260
then take a look

815
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:37,980
at this other graph.

816
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,500
Hmm, it's shaped like a pie.

817
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,500
Have a piece, Sammy.

818
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,320
Now,

819
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,440
that piece of pie

820
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,040
is equal to the 14%

821
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,000
of the Merleville town budget

822
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,660
that goes for exorcism.

823
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:48,840
Hmm.

824
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,380
Sounds like a lot,

825
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:50,900
doesn't it?

826
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,580
It sure does.

827
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,260
As a matter of fact,

828
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,360
I was meaning to talk to you

829
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:53,440
about it.

830
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:53,880
Well,

831
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,920
if it sounds like a lot now,

832
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,580
ha-ha,

833
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,960
just remember the trouble

834
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,600
we had when I first proposed

835
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,900
it at the town meeting.

836
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,460
Ah!

837
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,240
Boo!

838
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,020
Boo!

839
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,320
Boo!

840
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,120
Get him!

841
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,120


842
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,120


843
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:07,680
gentlemen,

844
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,980
get him!

845
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:09,540
Gentlemen,

846
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,860
citizens of Merleville.

847
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,520
Mr. Mayor?

848
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,900
Yes, Miss Cratch?

849
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,740
How can you expect

850
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,140
the citizens of Merleville

851
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,300
already bled white

852
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,280
by your corrupt machine

853
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,860
to spend another 14%

854
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,520
of our pie on exorcism?

855
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,760
Whatever that is.

856
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,200
That's right.

857
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,240
Tell him, Miss Cratch.

858
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,080
Miss Cratch,

859
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,940
as our civics teacher,

860
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,440
you of all people

861
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,140
should realize

862
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,860
the importance of exorcism

863
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,920
in this efficient

864
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,520
and democratic

865
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,100
working model township.

866
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,560
That's all very well,

867
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,120
Mr. Mayor,

868
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,260
but aren't we here

869
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,940
to talk about the corn smut

870
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,360
that's ruining our crops?

871
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,200
Ah, grumble, corn smut,

872
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,880
grumble, grumble.

873
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,140
Exactly, Ollie.

874
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:46,360
Grumble.

875
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,220
Take a look at this working model.

876
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,580
We already know about

877
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,360
the refining of petroleum byproducts.

878
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,320
Shh!

879
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,680
Exactly, Miss Cratch.

880
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,480
Let me turn the working model on.

881
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,560
Now,

882
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,080
as you can see,

883
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,000
these little red trucks here

884
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,120
with the two and a half men

885
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,700
on the side

886
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,400
drive up with their 118%

887
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,200
of 1964 capacity

888
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,120
oil loads

889
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,320
and deposit them

890
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,540
in those five and a half

891
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,280
black buckets,

892
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,740
which are then lifted

893
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,000
to the 75% over parity mark

894
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,660
through these little broken lines,

895
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,080
ending finally

896
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,580
in John's gas station

897
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,940
as fuel for our cars

898
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,000
and farm machinery.

899
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,820
At the lignite mine

900
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,740
as kerosene

901
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,700
to light the lamps

902
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,380
of the workers.

903
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,880
To Mr. Foster's cola factory

904
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,380
as artificial coloring.

905
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,500
And the rest

906
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,520
is exported abroad

907
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,760
by Mr. Artunian

908
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,640
to make nylon stockings.

909
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,860
Then there's none

910
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,120
left.

911
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,480
And therefore,

912
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,200
insecticide.

913
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,520
Exactly, Ollie.

914
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,340
And that's why

915
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,060
we got a corn smut epidemic.

916
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,320
Impeach him!

917
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,380
Awesome, man!

918
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,440
Exercise!

919
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,960
And that's...

920
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,200
And that's how

921
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,560
it all happened, Frankie.

922
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,920
Gee, Mr. Mayor,

923
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,620
I sure see how exorcism

924
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,900
ties into oil refining,

925
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,180
but I still don't think

926
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,660
I have enough

927
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,920
for my dumb civics paper.

928
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,720
I mean,

929
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,800
how does it all fit

930
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,320
into our American way of life?

931
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,940
What Ronnie means, Mayor,

932
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,000
is how does it all fit

933
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,320
into our American way of life?

934
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,440
I might be able

935
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,540
to fill you in on that.

936
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,220
I've got a working model

937
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,460
working over here somewhere.

938
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,380
Oh, but actually,

939
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,920
you'd probably do better

940
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,700
to talk to my friend

941
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,280
Bob Brown

942
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,100
down at the bank.

943
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,000
Again?

944
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,520
Well, actually, Mayor Tweed,

945
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,940
we just came from Bob's office

946
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,100
and, you know, we...

947
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,140
Oh, I see.

948
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:25,900
Well, let's see.

949
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,260
Who else is open

950
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,060
at this time of night?

951
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,520
Uh, you might try

952
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,860
kindly old Dr. Philith

953
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,320
down at the

954
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,540
Armenian Medical Association.

955
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,900
Now, just soak it

956
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,220
12 times a day

957
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,320
and keep off your side

958
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,360
as much as possible.

959
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,760
I'll give you a subscription

960
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,860
for petroleum jelly.

961
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,660
Oh, hello, Kenny

962
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,260
and your dad.

963
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,760
What's troubling you?

964
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,720
You don't look at all well.

965
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,660
Want an upper?

966
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,820
Uh, no, Doc.

967
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,280
No.

968
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,980
No, my teeth are fine.

969
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,640
It's Lenny here.

970
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,600
He's got to write

971
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,540
a dumb civics paper

972
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,480
on exorcism

973
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,280
and Mayor Simmons

974
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,800
suggested that we visit you.

975
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,100
Well, fine, fine.

976
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,380
You just take off your shirt

977
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,120
and sit over there.

978
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,400
Hmm.

979
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,480
I'll turn the lights out

980
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:04,820
and...

981
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,680
No.

982
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,960
This first slide

983
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,060
is the gestation

984
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,760
of the frog.

985
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,320
Gee!

986
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,900
Uh, no, no, no, Doc.

987
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,740
What Mickey wanted

988
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,680
to learn about this week

989
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,380
was something entirely...

990
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,260
This is one of the many

991
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,840
great Impressionist cathedrals.

992
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,140
Uh, no, no, no, Doc.

993
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,260
Wowee!

994
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,780
No, no, exorcism, Doc.

995
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,160
Oh.

996
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,100
Well, why didn't you say so?

997
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,480
Let me just set up

998
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,040
this audio-visual projector.

999
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:24,900
Yeah.

1000
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,300
Here we go.

1001
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,660
11, 10, 9, 7, 5, 3...

1002
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,160
Sound.

1003
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,020
1, start.

1004
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,920
1, 2, 3, 4...

1005
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,220
1, 2, 3, 4...

1006
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:39,880
1, 2, 3, 4...

1007
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,320
Herpy Classroom Films presents

1008
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,640
educational film B-152,

1009
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,440
Ring Ball and Your Daily Life.

1010
00:33:53,500 --> 00:34:02,060
Gee, Dad, what a bummer.

1011
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,820
Why, uh, what's the matter, Jimmy?

1012
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,480
My civics teacher assigned me

1013
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:05,980
this dumbass to do.

1014
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,260
I'm supposed to do some paper

1015
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,000
on Ring Ball,

1016
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,220
and I'm supposed to go

1017
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,660
exercise a dibbick with Bruce.

1018
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,660
I mean, what does Ring Ball

1019
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,620
have to do with me?

1020
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,880
Or exorcism?

1021
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,520
Or Bruce?

1022
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,300
Ah, more than you can ever imagine.

1023
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,900
I used to feel the same way

1024
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,880
you do about Ring Ball, Harold,

1025
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,940
but, uh...

1026
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,420
The Firesign Theater did that

1027
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,240
in the year 1970, I believe,

1028
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,040
from the Duke of Madness

1029
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,920
Motors collection.

1030
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,680
Some of you may understand

1031
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,060
that subgenius radio

1032
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,860
owes much of its existence

1033
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,780
to those guys.

1034
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,960
Before the Texas Guild

1035
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,120
of Art commentary,

1036
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,220
and again, we'll have photos

1037
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,020
up soon at subgenius.com,

1038
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,780
we heard Dr. Drummond

1039
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,360
reading an actual found letter

1040
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,600
on the puzzling evidence show

1041
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,860
from KPFA Berkeley.

1042
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,120
And now, back in time

1043
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,440
to January,

1044
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,080
and a race against time.

1045
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,420
It'll be dark soon

1046
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,660
in the Devil's Hall,

1047
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,200
which is where we are.

1048
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,400
We're in the Devil's Hall.

1049
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,880
It's a slot canyon

1050
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,620
with incredible layers.

1051
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,160
Like...

1052
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,820
You just have to see the pictures.

1053
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,400
That's subgenius.com.

1054
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,440
But, uh...

1055
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,000
It's part of the

1056
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,080
Guadalupe National Monument.

1057
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,920
Guadalupe Mountains

1058
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,720
National Monument.

1059
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,040
Where we are hiking back,

1060
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,000
having walked for two and a half hours

1061
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,700
clambering up rocks

1062
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,900
the last half,

1063
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,300
which was fun.

1064
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,780
But now we...

1065
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,020
kind of have to make time

1066
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,720
getting back

1067
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,520
because it's 3.30 and...

1068
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,280
it'll get dark about 5.30.

1069
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,440
So we have to go faster

1070
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,260
than we came,

1071
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,080
which I think we can do.

1072
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,260
Don't you, Princess Wee?

1073
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,280
Yeah, I think we can.

1074
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,800
But the Devil's Hall

1075
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,280
was, like all the other

1076
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,780
devil-named places

1077
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,860
in national monuments

1078
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,720
and state parks and so forth,

1079
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,520
is so named

1080
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,920
to keep the pinks out.

1081
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,960
Because it's too cool

1082
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,620
for the pinks and nerds.

1083
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,240
They give it a devil name

1084
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,340
to scare them out.

1085
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,560
And only subgeniuses come

1086
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,520
and enjoy the incredible scenery.

1087
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,100
It's as incredible

1088
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,840
as the Devil's Waterhole.

1089
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,140
So we've been to his hall,

1090
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,200
his toilet,

1091
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,200
his waterhole.

1092
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,800
I've been to his kitchen.

1093
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,900
You haven't been there yet.

1094
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,320
But I've been to the Devil's Kitchen

1095
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,780
in Utah.

1096
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:35,780
And...

1097
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,160
They're wonderful.

1098
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,240
But it is a bit of a...

1099
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,520
Well, they called this one

1100
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,500
a moderate hike.

1101
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,100
And if this is moderate,

1102
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,120
we better not try strenuous.

1103
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,340
This involved

1104
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,580
quite a bit of rock

1105
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,240
clambering.

1106
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,640
Not exactly climbing,

1107
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,440
like you see in fancy magazines.

1108
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,860
You have to watch out

1109
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,700
for the twist-your-ankle rock.

1110
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,960
Because that's every rock.

1111
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,960
It could be.

1112
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,840
This is kind of tricky

1113
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,360
where I am now, in fact.

1114
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,940
But it's incredibly cool.

1115
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,880
There is a devil's staircase

1116
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,560
leading to the Devil's Hall.

1117
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,940
And it really looks like

1118
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,840
somebody carved a staircase

1119
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,020
out of this rock.

1120
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,460
But it's really just layers

1121
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,220
of whatever this is.

1122
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,760
It's darned cool looking.

1123
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,000
And multicolored.

1124
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,280
And textured and layered

1125
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,800
as if by an incredible

1126
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,880
abstract artist.

1127
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,620
Or landscape artist.

1128
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,720
Hence the name

1129
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,360
Bob's Staircase

1130
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,400
and Bob's Hall.

1131
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,080
Where I don't want to end up going

1132
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,720
is Bob's Hell.

1133
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,060
Because that would be called

1134
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,980
on the maps

1135
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,020
the Devil's Hell.

1136
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,840
And think if hell is bad for us.

1137
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,480
Think how bad the Devil's Hell would be.

1138
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,780
There's some nice craggy

1139
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,660
mountaintops

1140
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,220
around here.

1141
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,460
And lots of stabby yucca

1142
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,480
and cool trees.

1143
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,060
The bark looks like

1144
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,040
it's made of tile.

1145
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,160
It really honestly does.

1146
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,040
And the striata

1147
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,720
in the rocks

1148
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,240
is fantastic.

1149
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,700
Well defined.

1150
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,380
The colors are many

1151
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,060
and varied.

1152
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,120
So this is

1153
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,760
Princess Wee and Reverend Stang

1154
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,440
at Devil's Hall

1155
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,540
Guadalupe Mountains National Monument

1156
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,040
over and out.

1157
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,500
Look at this.

1158
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,280
I'm hauling butt

1159
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,320
to Bob's Hall.

1160
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,240
I feel like I'm in Bob's Hole.

1161
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,940
Man.

1162
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,100
That's Steve Jobs.

1163
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,060
And his son.

1164
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,280
I dared not get a picture of him

1165
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,360
because somebody would probably kill me.

1166
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,260
But Steve Jobs is supposed to be dead.

1167
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,160
He died a few months ago.

1168
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,260
And I'm certain

1169
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,020
that that was Steve Jobs

1170
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,360
who just walked by

1171
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,860
with a teenage boy.

1172
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,180
That was him.

1173
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,100
It was.

1174
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,380
The teenage boy is probably

1175
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,940
like his ninja bodyguard.

1176
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:30,440
Yeah.

1177
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,780
I made it up here

1178
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,080
on Cory's Spirits.

1179
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,580
Greed.

1180
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,540
Or Cory's

1181
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,260
Sleed or Sneed.

1182
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,640
I think it was Sneed actually.

1183
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,040
It's amazing.

1184
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,020
It's beautiful.

1185
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,000
Okay.

1186
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,660
Rocks.

1187
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:49,460
Path.

1188
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,320
Where's the path?

1189
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,860
Sun going down.

1190
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,340
Must find path.

1191
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,260
Must not be caught in desert at night.

1192
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,760
Must find path.

1193
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,200
Where's path?

1194
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,840
Oh there.

1195
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,900
There.

1196
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,940
We got out of the park

1197
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,540
with one minute to spare.

1198
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,360
These three park guys

1199
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,160
were standing by the gate

1200
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,020
waiting.

1201
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,620
In fact, yeah, there they...

1202
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,040
And there is a gate.

1203
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,300
We would have been locked in

1204
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,000
and we were literally like

1205
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,960
one minute till closing time.

1206
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,320
That is the kind of thing

1207
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,620
I have to deal with

1208
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,440
having a princessly wife

1209
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,700
who has to take her longest possible

1210
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,220
way to do anything.

1211
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,220
And now we're going into the sun

1212
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,580
but I honestly don't know

1213
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,320
where we're going.

1214
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,400
I don't know where we're going.

1215
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,100
Somewhere in New Mexico.

1216
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,980
From PR News in Washington,

1217
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,440
I'm sounding the alarm

1218
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,360
about the Republican borrowing limit.

1219
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,000
All they would do was criticize.

1220
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,220
Scotland Yard is opening

1221
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,000
a new investigation

1222
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,280
into possible crimes

1223
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,640
by the Republican proposal

1224
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,140
seeking to oust

1225
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,500
Yemen's longtime president.

1226
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,380
House Republicans are aiming

1227
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,360
to reject it.

1228
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,220
It's being reported

1229
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,860
that a senior military official

1230
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,900
was infected with a Trojan worm.

1231
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,740
The budget struggle in Washington

1232
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,880
is raising anxiety

1233
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,560
among seven Afghan soldiers

1234
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,700
and a translator.

1235
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,040
There's now enough evidence

1236
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,640
to move the investigation forward.

1237
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,780
Circumstances are extraordinary.

1238
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,900
I stuck my neck out a mile.

1239
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,440
PR's David Wellner reports

1240
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,620
Speaker John Boehner

1241
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,260
has crashed and broken in two

1242
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,540
while landing in Guyana.

1243
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,180
Had four more done the same

1244
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:29,960
it would have failed.

1245
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,260
And on PR News,

1246
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,200
I didn't even hear.

1247
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,500
What's this talking about

1248
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,800
unscrewing and...

1249
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,100
I carry this thing all the time.

1250
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,220
Pantiera gave it to me

1251
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,260
about six years ago.

1252
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:38,980
What is it?

1253
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,960
Is it a special opener?

1254
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
You go through the airport with it?

1255
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:41,980
It's a...

1256
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,860
It's a...

1257
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,220
It's my utility...

1258
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,220
Oh, sorry.

1259
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,300
Please, be careful there.

1260
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,820
It's my utility belt.

1261
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,740
It's just one little plastic

1262
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,840
and metal or two-piece thing

1263
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,280
that Reverend...

1264
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,960
Pope S. Pantiera gave me

1265
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,940
about six or seven years ago

1266
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,600
when she was like eight years old.

1267
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,860
And look at it.

1268
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,220
It's got a magnifying glass,

1269
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:02,860
a compass,

1270
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,020
a laser.

1271
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,160
It has a flashlight.

1272
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,200
It had a little tiny screwdriver.

1273
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,040
It's got a little bit of everything.

1274
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,120
An opener, a saw.

1275
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,120
And yet it doesn't unfold

1276
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,280
like a Swiss army knife.

1277
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,900
It's one piece of metal, basically,

1278
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,060
with a few insets.

1279
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,940
Well, the fewer parts...

1280
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,060
And did she get through

1281
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:18,880
the airport with it?

1282
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,080
I don't know.

1283
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,580
I have...

1284
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,780
I've been avoiding airplanes

1285
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,460
since Princess Marie retired.

1286
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,480
Yeah, me too.

1287
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,900
One avoids them

1288
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,700
if it is possible.

1289
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,300
Yeah.

1290
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,300
It changed.

1291
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,100
It changed.

1292
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,240
It changed.

1293
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,600
Is one of these bottles

1294
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,020
of beverage for me?

1295
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,860
Well, then let me

1296
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,580
drink your health.

1297
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,820
It's not every day

1298
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,220
that we have both

1299
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,060
Philo and Stang together.

1300
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,740
Yeah, we haven't been

1301
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,600
on the radio together

1302
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,060
in years.

1303
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:44,500
In the studio.

1304
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,060
Hours.

1305
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,700
That's right.

1306
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,820
Actually, I come out here

1307
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,300
every year.

1308
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,420
Let's measure

1309
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,080
every meaningful pulse.

1310
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,900
That's true.

1311
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,160
We haven't been on the radio

1312
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,040
that we could say

1313
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,740
bad words on in years.

1314
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,940
Well, that's true

1315
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,280
because we have to keep

1316
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,660
a certain consistency up

1317
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,000
with...

1318
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,380
our friends at KPFA.

1319
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,140
We don't want to harm

1320
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,460
Puz Ev's show

1321
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,780
by being our natural selves

1322
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,880
scratching and belching and...

1323
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,440
I can use almost all of this

1324
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,140
on our slack

1325
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,200
without cutting anything.

1326
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,640
This is good for prime time,

1327
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,260
mostly.

1328
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,440
Yes, I know.

1329
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:16,940
It's astonishing

1330
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,140
what people will put up with,

1331
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:18,740
isn't it?

1332
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,900
I mean, what they'll listen to.

1333
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,500
The worst tripe.

1334
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,440
Oh, is this on?

1335
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,140
Well, let's see.

1336
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,540
How long have we been

1337
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,000
doing this?

1338
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,220
Power?

1339
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,700
You mean doing this?

1340
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,340
The first...

1341
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:32,960
Okay.

1342
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,140
Bob founded the Church

1343
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,060
of the Subgenius

1344
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,800
in 1953

1345
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,400
after his immaculation.

1346
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,200
He kept it pretty secret

1347
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,620
until he told Philo

1348
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,080
to go ahead

1349
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,500
and hire somebody

1350
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,420
to put the publicity together.

1351
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,700
And we studied...

1352
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,660
He and I both studied

1353
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,080
the Masons

1354
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,360
and the Rosicrucians

1355
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,120
and other really popular ones.

1356
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,920
Yes, there was Jackie Mason,

1357
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,800
Mason Reese,

1358
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,140
Marsha Mason.

1359
00:43:59,160 --> 00:43:59,840
But Eckhinkar,

1360
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,080
and...

1361
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:00,200
Right.

1362
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,220
Scientology.

1363
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:01,840
Yeah.

1364
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,360
All those very...

1365
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:03,700
The Mayans.

1366
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,040
The Mayans.

1367
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,340
That was a little-known one

1368
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:05,640
from...

1369
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,200
Oh, you're out of your minds.

1370
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,460
And we got ordained

1371
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,140
in the Church

1372
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,220
of Universal Life Church.

1373
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,300
Oh, yes.

1374
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:15,920
Of course.

1375
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,460
Very important.

1376
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,000
Now, when were you ordained?

1377
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,620
What year was your ordainment?

1378
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,540
I think mine was

1379
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,840
around 1977 or 78.

1380
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,080
Mine was in 69.

1381
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:26,880
Wow.

1382
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,780
And I've got the certificate.

1383
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:30,980
I've got my certificate

1384
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:31,860
in my pocket.

1385
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,580
They sent me

1386
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,980
a new certificate.

1387
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,420
Well, Doug, my...

1388
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,480
I had to prove it.

1389
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,380
I married a couple in New York

1390
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,160
and they...

1391
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,100
The city

1392
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,160
wanted to see proof of me

1393
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,900
and they also wanted

1394
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,220
15 bucks from me.

1395
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,340
New York makes you do paperwork.

1396
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,400
Yeah.

1397
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,120
That's how they pay

1398
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,040
for all those people

1399
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,340
that are on their payroll.

1400
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,320
No, on the other hand,

1401
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,580
in rural New York State...

1402
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,300
They've got checkers

1403
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,100
checking checkers

1404
00:44:59,100 --> 00:44:59,180
and supervisors.

1405
00:44:59,180 --> 00:44:59,580
I'm married...

1406
00:44:59,580 --> 00:44:59,980
I'm married...

1407
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:00,680
Supervisor, supervisor,

1408
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,060
supervisor.

1409
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,100
Pope S. Lilith

1410
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,220
with Reverend Thea

1411
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,020
and they were both

1412
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,180
technically women,

1413
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:07,780
although he had

1414
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,220
a man's driver's license

1415
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,020
at the time.

1416
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,060
Why didn't he change

1417
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,240
that particular detail?

1418
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,160
Well, he was working on it.

1419
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,640
But at the time,

1420
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,240
Lil...

1421
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:16,860
I see.

1422
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,720
When they went to the court

1423
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,320
to get their marriage certificate,

1424
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,340
Lil's legal name had changed.

1425
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,220
And...

1426
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:24,540
And it said

1427
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,160
Lilith Dawn...

1428
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,580
Let's say Williams.

1429
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:29,780
Williams.

1430
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,380
Which it's not.

1431
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,600
And they said,

1432
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,880
why is your name Lilith?

1433
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,580
They actually asked that of...

1434
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:38,400
Lil.

1435
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,360
Yes.

1436
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,400
And Lil said,

1437
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,760
my parents were hippies.

1438
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,440
And the lady

1439
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,580
in the little town,

1440
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,280
you know,

1441
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:47,700
called,

1442
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,340
didn't blink,

1443
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:48,620
and went,

1444
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,200
oh, I get it.

1445
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:49,540
Okay.

1446
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,980
Throw it all over on your parents

1447
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,640
when it's your own willfulness

1448
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,020
that has made it.

1449
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:54,560
That was one of the

1450
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,400
ex-day weddings.

1451
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,320
Jesus and Magdalene

1452
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,080
were married there.

1453
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,040
Where?

1454
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,260
At ex-day.

1455
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,060
Oh, yes, of course.

1456
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,320
Nikki Death Chick

1457
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,360
and Bob Wilde

1458
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,060
were married there.

1459
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,980
Truly, it has been a place

1460
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,080
of coming together.

1461
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,660
I'd like to marry somebody,

1462
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:11,520
some people.

1463
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,340
You could.

1464
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:12,820
You haven't?

1465
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,440
Not for more than

1466
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,600
a short-duration marriage.

1467
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,280
You know,

1468
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,220
I've done those too,

1469
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:17,600
of course,

1470
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,000
at Chick and John's

1471
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,740
at Las Vegas.

1472
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,920
Especially in shorter...

1473
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,660
In marriages of 20 minutes

1474
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,140
or less.

1475
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,520
But I'd like to ask you,

1476
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,420
other guys

1477
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,500
who have married people,

1478
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,900
how many of your

1479
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,560
couples have been married?

1480
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:29,560


1481
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:29,560


1482
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:29,560


1483
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:29,560


1484
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:29,560


1485
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:29,580


1486
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,360
have stayed together?

1487
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,860
And how many have divorced?

1488
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,020
I'd say about half.

1489
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,540
Same as the human average.

1490
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,540
Well, so far,

1491
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,300
all of mine

1492
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,480
have stayed together.

1493
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,600
But, of course,

1494
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,060
I'm sure

1495
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,540
someone will break

1496
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,260
that record fairly soon.

1497
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,620
I had a subgenius minister

1498
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,380
marry me

1499
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,380
in my last marriage.

1500
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,140
And then I performed

1501
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,180
some sort of marriage

1502
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:48,940
at Burning Man

1503
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,960
this year

1504
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,260
when a couple

1505
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,720
requested that I do it.

1506
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,300
On the steps

1507
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,280
of the Temple of Oblivion,

1508
00:46:59,280 --> 00:46:59,560
actually,

1509
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,160
it turned out

1510
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,300
to be a great place for him.

1511
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,400
I'm not sure

1512
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,700
what Reverend J. Kenny's

1513
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,040
rank is in the...

1514
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,000
In the Gnostic Church?

1515
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:09,880
In the Gnostic Church.

1516
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,660
But he's a high-ranking member

1517
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,740
in several churches.

1518
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,040
So we thought

1519
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,200
it was extra special

1520
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,420
to have him marry us.

1521
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,000
Oh, yeah.

1522
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,180
Yeah, I guess so.

1523
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,300
He really knows

1524
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,220
what he's talking about.

1525
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,920
When he wore

1526
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,660
his highfalutin garb

1527
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,580
and stuff, you know,

1528
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,780
with arcane symbols

1529
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,340
and things,

1530
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:29,560
I thought,

1531
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,660
yeah, my highfalutin garb

1532
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:32,740
all looks like cheesy

1533
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,580
leftover theatrical costumes,

1534
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,140
which is exactly

1535
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:36,820
what they are.

1536
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,820
Well, that's all

1537
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,440
just part of showbiz,

1538
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:41,880
isn't it?

1539
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:42,920
Right, exactly.

1540
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,540
I mean, we have to look

1541
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:44,400
at this legitimately,

1542
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,060
realistically.

1543
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,780
Religion is just showbiz.

1544
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:48,820
Oh, I've been to

1545
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,920
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

1546
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:50,720
All those costumes

1547
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,780
look pathetic

1548
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,400
up close in real life.

1549
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:54,980
And they're tiny.

1550
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,540
But they look great

1551
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,120
under the lights.

1552
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,100
You see, it's...

1553
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,260
You're looking at a piece.

1554
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,360
A piece of the illusion,

1555
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,880
not the entire illusion.

1556
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:02,380
Right.

1557
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,300
Just a piece.

1558
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,240
All those dead rock stars.

1559
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,380
Their ghosts add glamour.

1560
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,900
Do you want to be free

1561
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,280
yet find that credit cards

1562
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,660
are still tying you down?

1563
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,840
Month after month,

1564
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,020
payment after payment.

1565
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,240
Do you wish that there was

1566
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,800
some way to end this slavery

1567
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,220
and save your family?

1568
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,580
The cult has a solution

1569
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,720
you've been waiting for.

1570
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,480
Since seven,

1571
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,640
we've been implementing

1572
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,680
an advanced program

1573
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,920
which legally ends

1574
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,920
money and property.

1575
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,340
This is a true process

1576
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,040
that's helped

1577
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,840
hundreds of Americans

1578
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,220
all across the country

1579
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:48,860
start living

1580
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,440
and prepare

1581
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,960
for an uncertain consultation.

1582
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,080
To learn more,

at 777-RIGHT-NOW.

1585
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,040
That clip was from

1586
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,260
Reverend D. Cappell.

1587
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:58,820
Apetitor.

1588
00:48:59,080 --> 00:48:59,980
Before that,

1589
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,760
by the large.

1590
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,400
Before that,

1591
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,400
some church history

1592
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,200
from the Ask Dr. Howell Show

1593
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,000

for more.

1596
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,380
And before that,

1597
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,100
PR news by

1598
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,560
Reverend Cosmic Debris.

1599
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,580
You're listening to

1600
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,360
the Hour of Slack

1601
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,940
from the Church of the Subgenius.

1602
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,960
Everything you might want

1603
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,300
to know about anything

1604
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,620
can be found

1605
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,580
at subgenius.com.

1606
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,980
You might want to

1607
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:25,580
actually examine

1608
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,680
the buttons at the top

1609
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,600
to avoid confusion.

1610
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,260
Sometimes,

1611
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:28,700
people ignore

1612
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,440
those first prominent parts

1613
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,080
then tell me

1614
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,000
it's hard to navigate.

1615
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,300
Coming up,

1616
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:33,760
we'll have more

1617
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,400
puzzling evidence.

1618
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,120
Pardon me

1619
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:35,720
if there's some

1620
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,100
gag repetition

1621
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,200
or reflex.

1622
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,480
Clips by Ministry of Slack

1623
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,500
and Decapitator.

1624
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,620
Al's greatest rant.

1625
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,500
But first,

1626
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,620
we cut to

1627
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,120
WCSB Cleveland's

1628
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,060
Radio Synesthesia,

1629
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,380
which I started recording

1630
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,160
from the WCSB.org stream

1631
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,620
just after

1632
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,140
frequent caller

1633
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,020
No Money Mark

1634
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:56,980
pointed out

1635
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,200
that Mitt Romney

1636
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,540
in certain ways

1637
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,920
bears an uncanny

1638
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,660
resemblance

1639
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,620
to our guru,

1640
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,740
the high E-pop

1641
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:06,380
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1642
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:07,880
Actually,

1643
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,000
now that you mention it,

1644
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,180
that really

1645
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,160
scares me.

1646
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,720
That really

1647
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,440
scares me.

1648
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,320
Although,

1649
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,360
I think that

1650
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:18,940
the comparison

1651
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,660
is not apt

1652
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:20,040
because,

1653
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,240
I mean,

1654
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:21,780
Bob,

1655
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,160
he's a

1656
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:23,760
quintessential

1657
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,580
salesman.

1658
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,640
He gets

1659
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,800
people to like him,

1660
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,080
whereas,

1661
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:28,600
if Mitt,

1662
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,760
he can't sell himself

1663
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,420
to anybody.

1664
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,800
The only reason

1665
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,280
that he can't

1666
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:33,540
That's it.

1667
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,400
He's the fake Bob.

1668
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,520
He's the anti-Bob.

1669
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:35,960
Anti-Bob.

1670
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,340
Romney is the anti-Bob.

1671
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,260
Big Romney

1672
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,160
has no Bob in him.

1673
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:42,700
I'd like to see

1674
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,200
Oh my God,

1675
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:43,880
that's uncanny.

1676
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,320
I can't believe

1677
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,280
I never noticed that before.

1678
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,640
Does Bob Dobbs

1679
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,160
know how to fight?

1680
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,460
These really are

1681
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:51,900
the end times.

1682
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:52,900
Bob doesn't have to fight.

1683
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:53,860
Yeah.

1684
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,120
Bob just

1685
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,520
What can he do?

1686
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,180
You can't fight.

1687
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:58,480
Bob.

1688
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,860
No, but can Bob

1689
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,560
Well, you can,

1690
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,500
but, you know,

1691
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,060
he'll be fine.

1692
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,120
Yeah.

1693
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,100
Even if you,

1694
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:04,940
even if you kill him,

1695
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:05,560
he'll just come back.

1696
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,000
It's okay.

1697
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,240
He can respond.

1698
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,000
He's already done it

1699
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,020
like dozens of times.

1700
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,340
Yeah, like Dick Cheney.

1701
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:10,780
You kill him

1702
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:11,300
and he comes back.

1703
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:13,640
You know, see,

1704
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,680
Jesus only died

1705
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,480
and came back once,

1706
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,300
but Bob Dobbs,

1707
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,480
people lost count

1708
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,820
of that centuries ago.

1709
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:19,600
Probably died

1710
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,520
billions of times.

1711
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:21,780
Anyway,

1712
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,580
I just wanted

1713
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,440
to make that point.

1714
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,280
Keith,

1715
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,040
hopefully I'll be

1716
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,220
calling crap later.

1717
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,680
Until then,

1718
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,960
everybody have a good night.

1719
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:29,920
And watch your phone.

1720
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1721
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:34,420
Whoa.

1722
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,980
Man, this is giving me,

1723
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,220
this is going to give me

1724
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:39,840
nightmares now.

1725
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,480
It's really going to

1726
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,000
give me nightmares.

1727
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:44,400
Yeah.

1728
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,540
That door's open.

1729
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,520
You can't close it again.

1730
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:48,980
That was the issue

1731
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,620
with me and Bob.

1732
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,940
They stopped finding time

1733
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:51,400
for each other.

1734
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,540
Bob sought sexual fulfillment

1735
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,500
outside the marriage.

1736
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,320
Dr. Bob.

1737
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,260
Dr. Bob.

1738
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,160
I'll tell you something.

1739
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:57,580
I like to,

1740
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,260
I like to really

1741
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,500
teach that bastard a lesson.

1742
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,720
I happen to have

1743
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,160
this new address.

1744
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,400
Perhaps you and I

1745
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,100
should sneak in there

1746
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:04,800
one night and plant

1747
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,960
a tiny explosive device

1748
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,600
in the stove.

1749
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,340
Make it look like

1750
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,060
a gas leak.

1751
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,380
Yeah, yeah.

1752
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:14,780
Hello?

1753
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,040
Sorry to interrupt

1754
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,740
your recreation.

1755
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,280
Hello?

1756
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,820
Oh, I'm there.

1757
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,620
Hello?

1758
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:26,260
Hello?

1759
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,200
Hello?

1760
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,100
Oh, you need to take

1761
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:30,900
your doctors

1762
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,360
and sleep with your medicine

1763
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,900
and drink plenty

1764
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,480
of bodily fluids.

1765
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,060
Yes.

1766
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,240
Bodily fluids?

1767
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,440
That's what I had

1768
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:39,520
to say.

1769
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,260
Bodily fluids?

1770
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,200
Bodily,

1771
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,760
they come in little

1772
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,340
boblets and the bottles

1773
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,260
and the,

1774
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,000
you gotta take them.

1775
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,580
Who's volunteering?

1776
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:54,640
Well, it's,

1777
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,660
it's a group effort.

1778
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,940
We all contribute.

1779
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:57,660
We all contribute.

1780
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:57,660


1781
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:57,660


1782
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:57,660


1783
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:57,660


1784
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:57,660


1785
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,120
We all contribute.

1786
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,580
We all do.

1787
00:52:59,580 --> 00:52:59,580


1788
00:52:59,580 --> 00:52:59,580


1789
00:52:59,580 --> 00:52:59,580


1790
00:52:59,580 --> 00:52:59,580


1791
00:52:59,580 --> 00:52:59,580


1792
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,700
Put them in the cups,

1793
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,380
the glasses,

1794
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,060
put them around

1795
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,380
like musical chairs.

1796
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,340
Just try to make you

1797
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,220
drink them without

1798
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,380
making you do this

1799
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,200
shit call over.

1800
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,400
By the same token,

1801
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,440
whenever they name

1802
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,080
a spot in a national park

1803
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:17,880
or a state park

1804
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,840
after the devil,

1805
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,920
they mean just the opposite

1806
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,440
because those parts,

1807
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,160
those areas,

1808
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,260
usually look as if

1809
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,020
they were carved

1810
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,340
by angels.

1811
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,340
Did you ever go

1812
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:27,500
to the park?

1813
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:34,360
They name them Devil's Waterhole or Devil's Toilet or Devil's Punchbowl because that scares the pinks away.

1814
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:34,980
Yeah.

1815
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,000
And only the cool people go.

1816
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,220
Did you ever go to...

1817
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,760
What it really means is Bob's Waterhole.

1818
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,240
Right.

1819
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:41,480
Bob's...

1820
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,780
It really means cool place to go.

1821
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,340
Bob, the Valley of Bob.

1822
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,540
What about...

1823
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,280
Have you ever been to the Devil's Wishbone?

1824
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,560
I haven't seen your face.

1825
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,320
No.

1826
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,880
I've been to the...

1827
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,960
I've wanted to go to the Devil's Pelvis, but that's so...

1828
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,980
Did you ever see the Devil's Backbone?

1829
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:57,180
Right.

1830
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,340
From the Devil's...

1831
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,120
No, I missed the Devil's Backbone.

1832
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:00,860
I wanted to see it.

1833
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:01,700
Because that's kind of south.

1834
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,440
I've been to the Devil's Clavicle.

1835
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,340
Have you been?

1836
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,300
It's north of the Devil's Wishbone.

1837
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,640
One time you did.

1838
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,860
You pulled on the Devil's Wishbone.

1839
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,500
The Devil's Skull is way up in Canada.

1840
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:15,340
But the Devil's Mandible and the Devil's Atlas Vertebra.

1841
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,980
I fell into the Devil's Nostril once.

1842
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,740
After Nostril.

1843
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,660
Those are always cool places.

1844
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,820
And I don't know why they always call them...

1845
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,880
They attribute them to the Devil, but I assume it was...

1846
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,600
You know, he's a fallen angel.

1847
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,060
Satan's scapula.

1848
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:36,880
And these places named after the Devil always look as if they were carved by angels, not devils.

1849
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,940
Not like that Satan's anus.

1850
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,420
That was a bad place to go.

1851
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,840
What about that photo?

1852
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:47,940
That color photo that I have seen of you standing with the Devil in front of a big fire.

1853
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,200
What about that picture?

1854
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,500
That's from Last Starwood.

1855
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,160
The Satan...

1856
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,320
Actually, Thayton.

1857
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,160
He has kind of a lisp.

1858
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,860
The way he pronounces his own name.

1859
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,700
Thayton appears almost every Starwood...

1860
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,920
He was at X-Day this year.

1861
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:01,400
Oh, he was?

1862
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:02,760
Yeah, he played...

1863
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,000
And in his human guise, he played guitar on stage with a bald head.

1864
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:08,960
The nice one.

1865
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,540
And the chum bag.

1866
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,640
Not the obnoxious one.

1867
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,880
Yes, I make my lumbago.

1868
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:21,900
Yeah, that famous photo shows me, Thayton, an angel of light who looks similar to Potter Nostril.

1869
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,740
And then there were the two babes.

1870
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,560
Two beautiful babes.

1871
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,580
One was kicked off.

1872
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:29,680
One was kicked off the stage at X-Day for interfering with Fat Mandy's eye.

1873
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:30,180
Why?

1874
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,280
Two years ago.

1875
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,160
Oh, is she the one who...

1876
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:40,000
And the other one is Carissa Bragg, who's my favorite young singer in Cleveland because she's so pretty.

1877
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:43,720
Was that one who jumped up on the stage naked?

1878
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,380
Is that the one?

1879
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,400
Yeah, that's the one that's in that same photo.

1880
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,320
I didn't realize that when the photo was taken.

1881
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,560
I didn't realize it either.

1882
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:56,000
No, in that same collection, there's a nice photo of me with Oberon Zell, the head of our rival cult,

1883
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,760
the Church of All Worlds.

1884
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:58,720
Very good.

1885
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:02,540
I'll file this under A for All Worlds.

1886
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,080
I was on his podcast.

1887
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,320
I was on the Church of All Worlds podcast.

1888
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:11,020
Well, we hope you'll join us for one more world, the Ask Dr. Hal show on Radio Valencia.

1889
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,060
I'm filing it in the X.

1890
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,500
The Ask Dr. Hal?

1891
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,960
I thought it was Ask Dr. Hal.

1892
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,620
It is.

1893
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,500
It's Ask.

1894
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,780
Ask not what you can do for Dr. Hal.

1895
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,620
Ask Dr. Hal.

1896
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,500
Originally, we were a giant.

1897
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,500
We had buttocks in the desert.

1898
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:28,620
It's not Dr. Hal's buttocks.

1899
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,260
But that was an early version that has passed away.

1900
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,700
What happened to Princess Wee?

1901
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,220
You mean it's not Axe Dr. Hal?

1902
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,500
A what?

1903
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,420
There's no tax on it.

1904
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:38,900
It's not Axe Dr. Hal?

1905
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:39,380
Oh, no.

1906
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,800
It's an axe.

1907
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,200
I think not.

1908
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:42,560
No.

1909
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,620
It's more like Occam's razor.

1910
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,000
The finely buttocked one.

1911
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:49,200
Oh, Occam's razor, Dr. Hal.

1912
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1913
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:51,880
Wait.

1914
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1915
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1916
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,300
Now you turn on Shaw Street.

1917
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,080
I know.

1918
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1919
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,360
.1 miles.

1920
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,140
Turn left.

1921
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,040
It's Shaw Street.

1922
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,780
I can't move to the next.

1923
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,860
Oh, this is Steve's.

1924
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,600
Look at the traffic cameras.

1925
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:10,760
Where?

1926
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:11,120
What?

1927
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,600
I don't see traffic cameras.

1928
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:15,400
Way, way up there.

1929
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,100
Way, way up there.

1930
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:16,100


1931
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,660
Way, way up there.

1932
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,860
You think that's funny?

1933
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:19,540
Yeah.

1934
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:20,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1935
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,760
I think the whole world is laughing.

1936
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:25,980
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1937
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:25,980


1938
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:25,980


1939
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,540
Well, that was funny.

1940
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,500
I'm gonna go.

1941
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:29,920
I'm gonna go.

1942
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:31,640
What's up?

1943
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:32,300


1944
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1945
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,040
You know, you keep...

1946
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,360
You just have to go around the block.

1947
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1948
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,520
Continue 200 feet.

1949
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,080
I have pain in my belly from laughing now.

1950
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,700
I'm not kidding.

1951
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,320
I'm not kidding.

1952
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:44,580
I'm not kidding.

1953
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:44,920
I'm not kidding.

1954
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,220
You, you, you...

1955
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:48,460
.

1956
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:48,800
.

1957
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:48,800


1958
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:48,840
.

1959
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:48,840


1960
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:48,840


1961
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:48,840


1962
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,860
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1963
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:51,420
.

1964
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:51,460
.

1965
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:51,460


1966
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,280
.

1967
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,940
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1968
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:55,980
.

1969
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:01,840
I've had it with Bob

1970
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,940
making phone calls

1971
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:03,540
and then the movie

1972
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,260
Now I see what the fuck's in front of me

1973
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,860
and I don't pretend it's something else

1974
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,660
I was fucking her

1975
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,840
and now

1976
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,600
I'm gonna fuck you

1977
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,240
if you don't piss me off

1978
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,760
or open your yap at the wrong fucking time

1979
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,760
The only time you're supposed to open your yap

1980
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,520
is so I can put my fucking prick in it

1981
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,600
Otherwise you shut the fuck up

1982
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,600
Now hold on to that

1983
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,860
Point is

1984
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,640
this minister's gonna fucking die

1985
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,220
I mean that's the

1986
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:47,840
that's the fucking point

1987
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,080
He's gonna die sooner or later

1988
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,820
I mean he's making a fucking jerk of himself

1989
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,420
I mean well

1990
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:54,580
what's the point

1991
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,680
Why go on with that?

1992
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,540
Who's gonna benefit from that, huh?

1993
00:58:59,060 --> 00:58:59,980
You just gotta

1994
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,380
kill it and

1995
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,120
put an end to it

1996
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,880
You don't linger on about it

1997
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,560
You don't fucking go around weeping about it

1998
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,700
You don't behave like a kid with a sore fucking thumb

1999
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,840
You know, a loco sucking it

2000
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,480
My poor fucking thumb

2001
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,440
I mean you gotta behave like a grown

2002
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,280
fucking man

2003
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,640
You gotta shut the fuck up

2004
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,860
Don't be sorry

2005
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,280
Don't look fucking back because

2006
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,500
believe me no one gives a fuck

2007
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,400
You understand?

2008
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,440
Yeah

2009
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,240
Shut the fuck up huh?

2010
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,200
Give me that

2011
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:33,880
Hey

2012
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:35,460
You

2013
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,400
suck my dick

2014
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,480
and shut the fuck up, huh?

2015
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,540
Come here

2016
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,100
Come on

2017
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,440
Now then, here

2018
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,840
The place where I found you, huh?

2019
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,180
That's where this warrants file

2020
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,320
Could you believe?

2021
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:53,760
Yeah?

2022
00:59:54,580 --> 01:00:00,100
that I may have stuck a knife in someone's guts 12 hours before you got on the wagon we headed out for fucking Laramie?

2023
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,600
No, because I don't look fucking backwards.

2024
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,720
I do what I have to do and go on.

2025
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2026
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,720
You got a stagecoach to catch or something, huh?

2027
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,000
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

2028
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:21,300
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

2029
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:26,340
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

2030
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:33,420
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

2031
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:40,900
you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages

2032
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,260
and help out financially as best you can.

2033
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,620
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

2034
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,280
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own stuff.

2035
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,280
We want to make our situations worse.

2036
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:55,240
But some of you still have jobs.

2037
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:02,120
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

2038
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,520
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

2039
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:12,980
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs if you don't pay dogs.

2040
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:19,760
We also take checks and money orders to subgeniusfoundation.com.

2041
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,280
P-O-B-O-X.com.

2042
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:21,280


2043
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:21,280


2044
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:21,280


2045
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:31,260
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

2046
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,480
Thanks for anything you can do to help Let There Be Slack.
