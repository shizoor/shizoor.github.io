1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,440
Let's go!

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,840
This is a test of the emergency broadcast system.

3
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,220
The broadcasters of your area, in voluntary cooperation with the FCC and other authorities,

4
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,940
have developed this system to keep you informed in the event of an emergency.

5
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,020
If this had been an actual emergency, you would have been instructed where to tune in your area.

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,740
For Bob.

7
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,220
Praise Bob.

8
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,060
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sets adjusted.

9
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:53,720
We're having operating difficulties, which has necessitated a delay in the beginning of our Sunday movie.

10
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,060
Praise Bob.

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,060
Bob.

12
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,820
Ah, yes, dear friend.

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,520
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the moon.

14
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,180
We subjected it to careful editing.

15
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,120
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,200
You are about to experience the awe and mystery of the moon.

17
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,080
A mystery, which reaches from the inner mind to...

18
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,020
The Subgenius Hour of Slack.

19
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,840
Sponsored by the Church of The Subgenius.

20
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,620
We have to gather our strength, because now there's clouds and thunder.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,220
The image of difficulty at the beginning.

22
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,400
Oh, but finally we shall bring order out of chaos.

23
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,960
You know what happened?

24
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,880
This won't make too much sense, but it's not intended to.

25
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,360
Well, I'm afraid of God.

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,840
God put money in that empty purse. Don't ever let it be broke again.

27
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,820
You do what you do, because you want to.

28
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,920
I do what I do, because...

29
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,920
Because Bob...

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,100
Bob told me to!

31
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:21,820
Ah, yes, dear friends.

32
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,220
And welcome to Hour of Slack number 697.

33
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,520
Can you believe it?

34
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,920
And I don't know what I'm going to do on this show again.

35
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,440
I've got all this new stuff on CD, including our new CDs.

36
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,700
The Double X Day Devival with ESO and the Starwood Devival without ESO.

37
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,040
And all these...

38
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,000
But I think I'm going to use a bunch of old stuff, too. Real old.

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,640
Like, I found the work tape for Hour of Slack.

40
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,100
Number 66 and 67.

41
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,140
So, God only knows what's on that ancient mess.

42
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,800
And this music in the background, by the way, is ancient music by me!

43
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,700
Hard to guess, huh?

44
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,820
Anyway, friends, onwards.

45
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:23,760
Okay, now, show begins when base show time reaches the main show time.

46
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,980
In case of the base show time or the stop show time.

47
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,240
And when the second show time reaches the...

48
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,100
Wait a minute, wait.

49
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,540
That's this switch here. Okay, I think we're ready to go.

50
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,140
Let's go!

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,480
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

52
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,220
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

53
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,120
Ah, it's so nice out here in the little studio.

54
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,420
But that's a very funny reading on the scope. It's turbulent, it looks like.

55
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,600
It's spiraling. What is that? You can identify it.

56
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,440
It's a local control panel sending out the wrong image to the show here.

57
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,800
Can we correct it from long distance?

58
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,180
Sure.

59
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,460
We've got to beef the energy up.

60
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,760
You see, the entire show deadline caught me napping.

61
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,520
Right, we'll read it on the e-scope here.

62
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,240
We have bought a record for you. Would you like to listen to it?

63
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,820
I'm not sure.

64
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,360
Would you like to hear that record on sex again?

65
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,220
I don't understand.

66
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,700
I brought some drawings so that you can actually see the things I'm going to describe.

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,320
Mm-hmm.

68
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,460
There is a larger opening called the vagina.

69
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,320
Man.

70
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,600
The vagina is capable of being stretched a great deal.

71
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,720
What are testicles?

72
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,640
Testicles?

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,340
Mm-hmm.

74
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,360
The testicles manufacture seed.

75
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,480
When too much of this seed is produced, it overflows and comes out of the penis.

76
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,620
Usually during the night when the boy or man is asleep.

77
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,620
This is called a wet dream.

78
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,660
Sometimes boys worry about this, but it's really nothing to worry about at all.

79
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,060
It's a perfectly normal, natural thing.

80
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,120
Perfect concentration.

81
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,760
No distractions.

82
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,320
No anxiety.

83
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,880
No fear.

84
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,440
Greetings, my friends.

85
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,460
We are all interested in the future.

86
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,040
For that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.

87
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,800
And remember, my friends, future events such as these will affect you in the future.

88
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,800
You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.

89
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,700
That is why you are here.

90
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,620
So in this violent city, Philadelphia, full of derelicts and drugs, just realize we're

91
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,540
going to take it from you right there on home turf.

92
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,260
Which means that these tape recordings I'm making are for the sake of future history.

93
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,220
You're telling me?

94
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,020
Future history, you said?

95
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,400
The world grows ever stranger, and our traditional values seem to lose their meaning.

96
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:16,000
Thousands of Americans have rushed into the arms of bizarre religious cults to find a sense of spiritual security.

97
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,480
Perhaps the strangest of these cults is a little known group called the Church of the Subgenius.

98
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,000
It began in the heart of the Bible Belt in Dallas, Texas, but its membership is spreading across the nation.

99
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:40,820
We at What's Up America, though not given to making predictions, feel that the Church of the Subgenius is surely the church of the future, or at least what's left of it.

100
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,460
We want God! We want God! We want God!

101
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:51,520
That's right. Doug and his friends sell their particular brand of comedy in the form of pamphlets and magazines.

102
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,800
To anyone who has a buck or two, the faithful.

103
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,240
And he talks here about the birth of conversion.

104
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:08,240
Conversion, he says, is a nice word for brainwashing.

105
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,780
And any study of brainwashing has to begin with the study of Christian revivalism in 18th century America.

106
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,500
Apparently, Jonathan Edwards actually accidentally discovered the techniques during a church.

107
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,320
He was a religious crusade in 1735 in Northampton, Massachusetts.

108
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:39,600
By inducing guilt and acute apprehension, and by increasing the tension, the quote sinners, unquote, attending his revival meetings would break down and completely submit.

109
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:50,680
Technically, what Edwards was doing was creating conditions that wipe the brain slate clean so that the mind accepts new programming.

110
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,340
The problem was that the new input was negative.

111
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,880
He would tell them, you're a sinner, you're destined for hell.

112
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,200
As a result, one person committed suicide and another attempted suicide.

113
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:11,980
And many others found that although they thought they'd achieved salvation, they were obsessed with a diabolical temptation to take their own lives.

114
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,760
Now friends, they have considerably modified that technique since then.

115
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,520
Pardon me, I'm not a scholar.

116
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,680
The这是 تھение.

117
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,400
And part of the problem here is, because this proposal was developed in the podría' Avenue Asianas context,

118
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,100
it was thought about as being heard speaking mixing with oversea children.

119
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,460
Invere outsiders who wanted to interfere with a subtext related to food Rechts,

120
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,820
was Luisa.

121
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,240
Now the problem was, the other knows knew of a situation that occurred,

122
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,020
though she was never więks.

123
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,540
pretty hard to live with. Some girls imagine they feel worse than they actually do. They get in a

124
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,760
dither just by thinking too much about themselves. So pay no attention to a little egg or two.

125
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,400
Now that you know what you can expect these few days every month, learn to live with them easily.

126
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:09,200
They needn't upset you. After all, menstruation is so right and normal. Once you understand it

127
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,200
and how little bother it is, paying attention to it makes about as much sense as worrying over

128
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,440
your breathing.

129
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,900
Science fiction novel. And sometimes it wasn't even his own. Sometimes it was ripped off from

130
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:58,380
somebody else. And yet, you know, religions that started as recently as, you know, 200 years ago

131
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:05,320
or 100 years ago or even 30 years ago are as big as some of the ones that started a thousand years

132
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:12,280
ago. So Church of the Subgenius happened to come along just when instant printing and the internet

133
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,920
were invented.

134
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,780
It is.

135
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,040
It is.

136
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,140
It's known as the Church of the Internet. A lot of people find Bob a lot easier on the internet.

137
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,940
And rather than buying the books, they would rather read the pamphlets online. Is there any way

138
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,900
of making that the Church of the Internet, the official Church of the Internet?

139
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:33,180
Well, we have more nude pictures of girls wearing glasses on our website than you'll see on almost

140
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:41,720
any other pay or free porno website. And it's not even pornography. It's just religion. It's freedom of expression.

141
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,080
We're just exploring our religion.

142
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,160
We're just exploring our religious rights as granted us in this great country.

143
00:10:49,860 --> 00:11:01,080
Earth, we must get off. Whether we leave it or leave it a cinder. Whether we blow it off or blow it up. Just don't blow it, friends.

144
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,480
That $30 to Bob proves that you consider your life to be worth $30.

145
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,480
$30.

146
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,520
Don't spend that much on printing rock stars anyway.

147
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,760
Oh, but some people think, well, Bob might be lying again. Oh, no.

148
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,080
Friends, Bob makes a million dollars every time he screws up.

149
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,080
By screwing up last time, he made $10 billion.

150
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:36,980
This next day, when the saucers do arrive, he won't lose that $10 billion because we already did.

151
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:43,540
We're out our $30. His fuck-up already happened. He has nothing to gain by us losing.

152
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,340
So this time, we will win.

153
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,760
And, uh, you know, even if X-Day didn't work out, we'll go for Sex Day.

154
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:05,040
We want you people to dance into the new century. Screw into the new century. Sleep and eat your way into the new century.

155
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,300
Whatever you're doing in the moment of turnover is what you'll be doing forever.

156
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,440
So make sure you're not asleep.

157
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,060
Make sure you're not walking.

158
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,600
Make sure you're not watching TV.

159
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,300
Make sure you're not listening to Pat Boone.

160
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,480
Make sure you're not reaching for an itch you'll never be able to scratch.

161
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,000
Friends, you're floating in a sea of pills.

162
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,320
A sea of Bob's pills.

163
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,900
But you're just too blind yet dumb to see them.

164
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:31,900
Oh.

165
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,400
Oh, friends.

166
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,360
I know you're not the dumb-asticated type.

167
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,840
I know you're the smart-asticated type.

168
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,880
Oh, but people say, Reverend Stagg, what is slack?

169
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,400
I want you to tell me what slack is.

170
00:12:52,440 --> 00:13:01,860
You know, friends, the television doesn't have to watch you as long as you are watching the television.

171
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:14,060
And a lot of people, a lot of people think that slack is that Miller beer commercial where everybody's good looking and you're rich and your team just won the game.

172
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,360
And you're drinking Miller beer and your favorite show is on.

173
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,400
And you know that's bullshit because slack is not laziness, friends.

174
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,140
Slack is getting into the zone.

175
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:34,860
It's being awake and alert and doing what you wanted to do until your eyes snap open and you're smart enough to realize that you are God.

176
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,880
Life is worth living.

177
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,940
And everything is just as psychedelic as that old t-shirt that you can't fit into anymore.

178
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,660
Now.

179
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,360
Hold that thought.

180
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,900
Hold it in your head.

181
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,380
Because that is what slack is all about, friends.

182
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,640
Slack is something for nothing.

183
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,020
So why not?

184
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,680
So why not?

185
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,900
Why not make a new beginning in your life and see what'll happen?

186
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,720
I don't know.

187
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,940
You don't know.

188
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,300
And you will never know.

189
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,100
You have signed the application.

190
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,420
You do have the kit.

191
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,780
Well, have you got your pipe through the mail?

192
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,880
Oh.

193
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,920
I'm going to go crazy.

194
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,560
We're not against it.

195
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,840
And so let's move on to the message.

196
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,740
The techniques and stagings will vary from church to church.

197
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:32,000
Many use speaking in tongues to generate catharsis in some while the spectacle creates intense excitement in others.

198
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:41,580
And it's becoming more and more sophisticated as professionals come into the market for brainwashing.

199
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,640
A man in Los Angeles is designing.

200
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,680
Building and reworking a lot of churches around the country.

201
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,080
He tells ministers what they need and how to use it.

202
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:57,500
And this man's track record indicates that the congregation and the monetary income will double if the minister follows his instructions.

203
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,460
He admits that about 80% of his efforts are in the sound system and lighting.

204
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:13,620
And dear friends, these conversion techniques, I mean, frankly, what I'm about to tell you is our secrets of how the church works.

205
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:13,620


206
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,440
The church of the subgenius works just like any other mind control cult.

207
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:25,980
We have studied these techniques non-professionally, not like your Falwells and your Criswells.

208
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,920
We're working strictly from an intuitive basis.

209
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,300
And also we admit what we're doing, which is what I'm doing right now.

210
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,320
Subgenie mind control gone out of control.

211
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,280
They handed me this jar and said my brain was in it.

212
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,300
And then when the police came, they poured it down.

213
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,600
The subgenius.

214
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:43,600


215
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,540
Bob?

216
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,600
Bob?

217
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,960
Bob?

218
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,860
Hello darkness my old friend

219
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,860
I've come to talk with you again

220
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,740
Because of vision softly creeping

221
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,840
Left its seeds while I was sleeping

222
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:49,020
And the vision that was planted in my brain

223
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:56,920
Still remains within the silence

224
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,380
Of silence!

225
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,680
In restless dreams I walk alone

226
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,800
Narrow streets of cobblestone

227
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,080
Neath the halo of an east street lamp

228
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,240
I turn my collar to the cold

229
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,820
And I'm in a daze

230
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:46,600
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash

231
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,880
Of a neon light

232
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,600
That split the night

233
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,920
And touched the sounds

234
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,360
Of silence!

235
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,540
In the naked light I saw

236
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,700
Ten thousand people maybe more

237
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,440
People talking without speaking

238
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,820
People hearing without listening

239
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,620
Writing songs

240
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,760
That voices never share

241
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,360
And no one dare

242
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,660
Disturb the sounds

243
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,320
Of silence!

244
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,240
Kanal's

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,440

248
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,820

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:29,380

Fool said I, you do not know

262
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,260
Silence like a cat that grows

263
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,280
Hear my words that I might teach you

264
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,480
Take my arms that I might reach you

265
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,180
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell

266
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,680
And echoed in the wells of silence

267
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,860
Silence

268
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,880
Silence

269
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,040
Silence

270
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,140
And the people bowed and prayed

271
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,260
To the neon god they made

272
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,760
And the sign flashed out its warning

273
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,420
In the words it was for me

274
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,720
And the sign said the words of the prophets

275
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,080
Are written on subway walls

276
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,640
And tenement halls

277
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,900
And whispered in the sounds

278
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:22,000
And whispered in the sounds

279
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,140
And whispered in the sounds

280
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,800
Of silence

281
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,580
Silence

00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,120

291
00:21:52,680 --> 00:22:01,200
Silence, you fool. Einstein's secret orchestra, of course.

292
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Chaz Smith, my cousin Chaz on vocals, Lonesome Cowboy Dave on guitar, Chaz also on keyboards.

293
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:14,860
Bob Mosick on drums and Michelle George, the Hendrix of the electric violin.

294
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,380
And friends, speaking of Einstein's secret orchestra, let's check their radio show.

295
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,260
...circular and groovy like it should.

296
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:28,860
Well, I dreamed that within the next three or four weeks the stock market crashed and burned.

297
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:36,500
And the Reverend Ivan Stang made a huge killing off profiteerage of strange religious values and virtues which none of us professed.

298
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,720
And it was not only...

299
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,520
It was a sacrilegious dream, but it was a salubrious, bright yellow and blue dream.

300
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,820
There was all kinds of little snakes dancing by with signs, holding up signs, saying what was gonna happen.

301
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,520
The Dow Jones down this day and the...

302
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,460
The Dow Jones versus Friday Jones.

303
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,460
Can you imagine what a conflagration that would be?

304
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,760
The battle of the stock market.

305
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,320
Two sumo wrestlers of sex.

306
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,540
The stock market and the...

307
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:03,820
Now where are stocks?

308
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,580
The stock market and the stock you went.

309
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,880
Oh, subgenius hell.

310
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,660
It's such a big party.

311
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:16,200
I wish I could die and move on to subgenius heaven like Bob promised me.

312
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,920
I wish I could be at the end of the post.

313
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,380
My arm will be so tired from flogging you all.

314
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,460
My little fingers will be so bruised from squeezing you all all over.

315
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,700
Hey, Friday, I can see your house from up here.

316
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,420
I can see you eyelashing this right now with your soft, silky, wisdom eye.

317
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,960
Giving this big, you know, like 3,000 eyelashes.

318
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,320
Lashed with the wisdom teeth.

319
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,980
Take out the optic nerve and crack it.

320
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,300
Oh, baby, I'm learning an awful lot from you now.

321
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,900
Oh, you've all been so bad.

322
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,160
I can see the M&M falling through the palms of your hands even now.

323
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:56,160
I would much rather lick the wisdom eye than have the wisdom eye give me a licking.

324
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,600
And I think it does it almost all the time.

325
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,400
Every day I learn something new and bad I don't want to learn.

326
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,940
Like just this afternoon, I learned that you can't run over another human being just because you're mad at them.

327
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,420
And not get in trouble with the authorities.

328
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,240
Oh, you learned that today?

329
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,900
Yeah, they're chasing me and everything.

330
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,380
I don't know if they got my license number.

331
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:13,860
I hope not.

332
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,200
We learn something important every day.

333
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:24,220
And also I learned that you can't, you know, just grab some old lady and unscrew her, like, artificial prosthetic kneecap device on the bus.

334
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,680
And without her getting in an argument with you.

335
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:26,960
You can't?

336
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,200
Well, you can if you're here to learn.

337
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,800
You can't wake her up.

338
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,000
You're learning experientially.

339
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,620
You've got to grab an old lady's knee on the bus and you've got to torque it.

340
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,540
Torque it?

341
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,040
Torque it.

342
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,760
Hey, I've got to flip it.

343
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,280
Torque.

344
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,480
So I'm being left here alone again in the studio.

345
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,720
The rats are dancing.

346
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,740
The water is puddling up around my feet.

347
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,020
And Stang and Chaz took off the other room.

348
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,100
They're making CDs for themselves.

349
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,840
So it's just you and me, Dave?

350
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,660
Well, let's make our own CD on the air right now.

351
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,360
That's right.

352
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,620
Let's both get close in this little blue canister.

353
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,700
Mind if Dr. Mo watches?

354
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,920
Do you mind if I bring one of these little rats along to snuggle up with us?

355
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,980
Oh, no.

356
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,840
The sweet little rat.

357
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,980
We'll name him Ben.

358
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:11,920
Ben.

359
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:17,680
Ah, well, let's leave Friday and Dave alone in the little tuna can in space.

360
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,900
Dear friends, that's from Einstein's Secret Orchestra Radio.

361
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:28,140
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Reverend Chaz Smith and Irreverent Friday Jones.

362
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,520
That show from a while back.

363
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,200
Einstein's Secret Orchestra Sounds of Silence.

364
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,920
We heard some editing.

365
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:42,060
Some editing this show has been by Puzzling Evidence, our old, old friend from Berkeley.

366
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:48,360
And we've heard some of the Berkeley KPFA Subgenius Show.

367
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,680
It's always going to be a little sad to play the KPFA Subgenius Show from now on.

368
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,420
Partly because KPFA just changed.

369
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,940
That station in Berkeley just became a sort of a corporate liberal station.

370
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,660
It's just sort of a fake NPR now.

371
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,280
And I don't know if Negative Land or the Subgeniuses are even still on.

372
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,880
It was a corporate takeover.

373
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:25,020
Friends, those of you who are listening to this show, the very fact that you have a station like this in your town makes you very lucky.

374
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,680
You are in a rare situation.

375
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:34,540
Pity those of us in Dallas or Austin, Texas, where there is no radio worth listening to.

376
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,200
At all.

377
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,320
Or now, even San Francisco.

378
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:45,160
Well, anyway, friends, we also heard some music edits from the Brand Flakes.

379
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,820
A wonderful subgenius-oriented collage band.

380
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,060
And what else?

381
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,020
What else have we got here?

382
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,800
Oh, I think I did the credits.

383
00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:00,840
Anyway, friends, let's listen to our latest new discovery, Little Theodore.

384
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,820
From this recorded at X Day.

385
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,320
Or actually, Double X Day, 1999.

386
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,540
Uh-huh.

387
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:27,700
Mr. Roboto! Mr. Roboto!

388
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,060
I don't know what to do!

389
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,980
I don't know what to do!

390
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,880
I don't know what to do!

391
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,760
I don't know what to do!

392
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,600
I don't know what to do!

393
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,420
I don't know what to do!

394
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,340
I don't know what to do!

395
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,240
I don't know what to do!

396
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,140
I don't know what to do!

397
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,940
I don't know what to do!

398
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,780
I don't know what to do!

399
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,600
I don't know what to do!

400
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,320
I don't know what to do!

401
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:55,500
I don't know what to do!

402
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,280
I don't know what to do!

403
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,640
I don't know what to do!

404
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,720
I don't know what to do!

405
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,160


406
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,160


407
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,680
I don't know what to do!

408
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,440
I don't know what to do!

409
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,740
Let's try to imagine a sort of a cross between Janer, the hyperclades, me, and Pee Wee Herman

410
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,820
on amphetamines and muscular dystrophy or something like that.

411
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,920
But real cool, though.

412
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,380
I spin around in circles till I think that I might fall.

413
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,040
And if I take two steps in a row, I walk into the wall.

414
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,880
I don't know what to do.

415
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,840
I don't know what to do.

416
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,680
I don't know what to do.

417
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,540
I don't know what to do.

418
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,460
I don't know what to do.

419
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,280
I don't know what to do.

420
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,200
I don't know what to do.

421
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,000
I don't know what to do.

422
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,980
I don't know what to do.

423
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,340
The only time I'm happy is when I'm sitting on the floor

424
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,020
And if I seem to go somewhere, I can't make it to the door

425
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,840
I don't know what to do

426
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,900
I'm going to tell you what to do, though, friends.

427
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,520
You can contact Little Fiodore directly at

428
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,320
GotToBeAuto.com

429
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:58,980
Got that pencil ready?

430
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,060
P.O. Box 973 Boulder, Colorado

431
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,140
That's Box 973 Boulder, Colorado

432
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,280
80306

433
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,000
P.O. Box 973 Boulder, Colorado

434
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,160
80306

435
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,180
Little Fiodore

436
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,300
And Babushka on keyboards

437
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,540
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere

438
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,260
Where are you leading us, Bob?

439
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,280
Is he?

440
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,760
And where is Bob leading them?

441
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,600
Right now it acts like it's going to make me rich

442
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,480
Doug's been standing out in the sun too long, I think

443
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,320
I don't think it's going to be a marvelous time for people to put their hands on the radio and say,

444
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:58,520
Oh, I'm going to put my hands on the radio

445
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,580
Or if you have a stereo

446
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,260
Ah, yes

447
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,420
If you have a stereo, you could go out and put your hands on maybe one speaker

448
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,600
Lay your hands down

449
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,540
Let your old lady put it on another speaker, you know

450
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,360
On that radio or that tape recorder if you're listening

451
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,100
Because that's where the real edge comes from

452
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,160
Really, really sit cross-legged

453
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,920
Feel those little molecules coming right out from Bob

454
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,580
Well, it's almost out of jack time and there's only one Gary here

455
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,780
Gee, Doug's

456
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,480
18 Bob's

457
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,780
And the show with its own

458
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,320
Tune the drums

459
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,320


460
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,320


461
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:28,960
It's a shout-out generation

462
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
Yes, they're here too

463
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,260
What's going on here?

464
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:32,660
I don't know

465
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,140
Well, we're tuning in on you right now

466
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,240
Well, let's hope for better progress

467
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,420
And there, we're centered on

468
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,600
Oh, okay, we're on lock

469
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,280
Oh, okay

470
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,680
Is there anything we can do?

471
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,740
There's got to be something we can do

472
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,900
Now someone figure out what we're supposed to do

473
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,480
On an interview show

474
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,640
Hey, I don't want to listen to a recording

475
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,340
I want to talk to somebody who's doing something

476
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,600
Bob loves you

477
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,340
Bob, Bob, love you

478
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,080
Bob, Bob, love you

479
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:20,240
I mean, Bob

480
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,360
We've been waiting on you

481
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,860
Well, no, actually, Bob, you don't really want

482
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,700
Bob's been waiting on us now, well

483
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,700
We're real close to J.R. Bob, God

484
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,900
Because his perfect slack has to come from somewhere

485
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,320
All I know is that that pipe is glued to his teeth

486
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,860
He actually has a hole in his teeth

487
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:43,060
During the first autopsy, it was found that there was a growth

488
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,520
That went all the way back into the lower portion of Bob's brain

489
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,280
From the pipe

490
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,440
And some speculate that it is indeed the pipe itself

491
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,920
That is the controlling entity

492
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,520
It's true

493
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,880
He also has a tumor in his eyes, see?

494
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,680
If you look, when he talks, you'll actually see the list of the people he's talking to

495
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,820
I can feel Bob

496
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,520
Oh, is that what they call it now?

497
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,080
The slips of the pipe

498
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,740
I think Bob is love

499
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,660
Gone horribly, horribly wrong

500
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,320
Like a big fist up your ass

501
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:10,900
That's Bob

502
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,200
When you're drowning in the middle of the ocean

503
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,200
Bob is a grilled cheese sandwich

504
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,740
Bob is a real live breathing person whose existence

505
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,840
The more you try to prove that he exists

506
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,560
The more you cannot prove that he exists

507
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,900
And therefore the more you prove that the conspiracy exists

508
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,840
That's a deep one

509
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,000
We shall have paradise

510
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,100
Such an ever-revealing night

511
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,200
And sex every night!

512
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,560
Subgenie of the world

513
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,180
Subgenie of the world

514
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,560
Subgenie of the world, you guys!

515
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,260
Sid... Channeling Sid Vicious

516
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,120
Sid Vicious, Vicious

517
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,040
Long... Sid...

518
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,000
The early...

519
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,500
The cancerous days

520
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,060
King of Spanish horror

521
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,640
Spandex manteldez

522
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,780
Spandex manteldez

523
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,080
Oh! We were gonna...

524
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,100
Friends, how would you like to get laid with him?

525
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,680
He's here tonight!

526
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,380
How would you...

527
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,180
He is here!

528
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,080
He ain't got no other place to go, man

529
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,860
He's lonely as hell

530
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,940
The imp of punity has finally come

531
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,240
And I am an ordained minister

532
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,320
I am an officially approved holy man

533
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,260
By the government's orders

534
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,480
And by virtue of the Universal Life Church

535
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,920
And of J.R. Bob Dobbs

536
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,280
And Connie Dobbs

537
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,180
Hail Connie, praise God

538
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:51,180


539
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:51,460
Praise Bob

540
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,340
And friends, there's a tradition in our church

541
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,960
That says...

542
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,760
That says...

543
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,400
That...

544
00:34:59,400 --> 00:34:59,540
That says...

545
00:34:59,540 --> 00:34:59,540


546
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,240
Well, you know, we're outnumbered by conspiracy pinks

547
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,760
Barbies and kins

548
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,600
Caged men

549
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,680
Box dwellers

550
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,180
Mediocratons

551
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,520
And so forth

552
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,820
And that means, friends, that we have to

553
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,780
Overpopulate the planet

554
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,820
With as many little subgeniuses as we possibly can

555
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,160
Until the whole planet is so overpopulated with pinks

556
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,020
That it practically tips over

557
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,840
And you know what that means, friends

558
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,620
To repopulate the planet with subgeniuses?

559
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,920
That means simply that you have to love more

560
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,660
Well, love doesn't have anything to do with it

561
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,780
It just means you have to reproduce

562
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,000
Like animals

563
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,720
It's a natural thing

564
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,840
But it's not natural unless it's approved

565
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,760
By God and the state

566
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,940
And that's why you're in luck

567
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,000
Whether your idea of great sex

568
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,160
Is with that babe or stud or animal sitting next to you

569
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,560
Or with just your right hand

570
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,060
Or your left hand if it's sort of a kinky night

571
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,000
Why, friends, all you need

572
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,400
Just as all the scarecrow needed was his diploma

573
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,620
And just as all the tin man needed was his certificate

574
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:19,700
All you need is a short duration subgenius marriage

575
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,880
And I know you are probably going to sin or not sin tonight

576
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,580
No matter whether we officially did it or not

577
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,440
But this way you won't go to hell

578
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,740
So, friends

579
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,280
Praise God

580
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,160
Oh, yes dear friends

581
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,360
Do you voyeurs and weirdos here

582
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,660
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth

583
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,060
So help me, Bob, Connie, say I do, I do, okay

584
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,620
Friend, are there any here who

585
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,760
Any jealous losers and uptight puritanical idiots who

586
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,100
Think that these couples and the triples and a whole damn room

587
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,680
Shouldn't be united in some disgusting way of sexual love

588
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,400
And wedding official matrimony

589
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,020
Speak now or well, we don't care

590
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,820
Are there any?

591
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,060
Well, do you

592
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,240
Insert name here

593
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,840
Male and or female or whatever type of

594
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,640
Subgenius

595
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,700
Swear upon the eyes of

596
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,500
Dobbs' sainted dead mother, Jane

597
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,180
To take this other subgenius or pet

598
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,180
At home or favorite porno star

599
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,740
Or fantasy

600
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,820
Your shoe, your wedding ring, your condom in your wallet

601
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:44,260
Do you swear to take this mate, this right hand, this left hand, whatever

602
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:49,120
As your permanent will for the next 24 hours

603
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,740
To have and to hold

604
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,400
For richer or poorer, in sickness and in kinkiness

605
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:01,040
Forever and well for the next 24 hours starting now, 1 a.m.

606
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,180
Say I do

607
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,820
I do

608
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,060
Okay, now, now, here's the tricky part

609
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,880
You must now kiss each other

610
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,100
And, oh wait, no, no, we forgot, the ring

611
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,840
What a ill prescription

612
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,380
You didn't forget the ring, did you?

613
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,240
Well, I tell Britannia

614
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,220
We'll do it the Devo style

615
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,300
This is your handy temple of Devo

616
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,800
This represents the ring of bondage

617
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,980
Sacred matrimonial bondage

618
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:39,340
And this, of course, represents the other temple of Devo part of it

619
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,440
Which some has to, some do, birds and bees, I don't know

620
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,460
Stick it in there like that and say, I do again

621
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,840
No, shake hands on it and say, it's a deal!

622
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,300
It's a deal!

623
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,380
It's a deal!

624
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,860
We're all married now, so we're all friends here

625
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,000
You can go ahead and start farting and

626
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,980
And

627
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,440
Actually, to tell the truth, friends

628
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,280
The very first time I came to this Starwood thing

629
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,520
Oh, you must now kiss the bride and consummate that

630
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,860
Or else you make a mockery of the sacred institution of marriage

631
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,260
Oh, my God!

632
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,740
Actually, the first time I came to Starwood

633
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,980
Uh, this beautiful woman came up to me in this diaphanous gown

634
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,240
It was Linda Murphy

635
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,080
And said, hi

636
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,600
And she handed me like a little marble or something

637
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,700
Said, this is a magic group, we're married now

638
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,360
And I kind of went, huh?

639
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,360
She goes, yeah, and that means I'm married to her and her and her

640
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,280
And him and him and him

641
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,880
And that means you're married to all those people too

642
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,920
And I went, oh, I guess we didn't come up with that routine ourselves, huh?

643
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,960
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen

644
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,980
Welcome to Rhythms of Spring

645
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,440
Second night

646
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,920
The very first stop on Pega Palooza 1999

647
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,020
The tour which is destined to be

648
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,200
Traveling home for pagans far and wide

649
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,160
Wanna live life

650
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,920
Having a good time dancing, drumming

651
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,920
Now, allow me to introduce ourselves

652
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,960
We're Loke E. Coyote

653
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,920
And we are Super Mischievous

654
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:47,900
Super Mischievous

655
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,400
Super Mischievous

656
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:17,320
Well, we're Loke E. Coyote

657
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,660
We got some tricky ways

658
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,460
We're gonna knock you out with the music that we plays

659
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,260
We're hoping everybody in the audience stays

660
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,100
To help us groove and move the cone of power we will raise

661
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,900
Yes, I'm talking about raising a cone of power

662
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,740
Raising energy by the minute and the hour

663
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,340
Raising it higher than the Eiffel Tower

664
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,260
By the time we get done, we're gonna all need a shower

665
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,520
Cause we're gonna jump around

666
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,040
Gonna play it safe

667
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,660
Gonna let the crack bell of liberty ring

668
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,340
We're gonna poke fun at everyone and everything

669
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,140
And we're gonna do our part to bring about the quickening

670
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,600
Super Mischievous

671
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,400
Super Mischievous

672
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,160
Super Mischievous

673
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,660
Super Mischievous

674
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,020
I'm not talking about the Highlanders

675
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,080
So don't you lose your head

676
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,580
But the winter time is over

677
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,780
Spring is here instead

678
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,680
Now it's time to wake up Mother Earth

679
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,680
Just like Maven said

680
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,380
Time to wake her up and feed her breakfast in bed

681
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,980
Because the Earth is our mother

682
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,280
Of that there is no doubt

683
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,780
And she'd rather see us celebrate

684
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,120
Than listen to us howl

685
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,720
So we're gonna have a good time

686
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,840
Make you scream and shout

687
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,560
Now I'm gonna whip my harmonica out

688
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,240
Music

689
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,100
Music

690
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,760
Well, it's true friends that the harmonica part is really pretty awful

691
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:54,120
But this Loki E. Coyote guy walked up to me at Starwood

692
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,240
And gave me this CD

693
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,920
And I thought it sounded like a whole bunch of fun

694
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:09,220
It proves that occasionally the pagans can work their way up to the Dobbs Head

695
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,460
So to speak

696
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,220
Or down actually I should say

697
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:17,320
They have to lower themselves down to the mud plain that we inhabit

698
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,220
Scratching and picking and grinning and eating and poking and fiddling with it

699
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:27,720
And you know, frapping and crapping

700
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,300
All like that

701
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,200
Loki E. Coyote

702
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,680
E Pluribus Funum

703
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,860
It says here

704
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:43,340

rightvision.com

712
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,540
I'm Dots.

713
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:29,160
Now, as I told you before, we are Loki and Coyote.

714
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,600
And not only do we play the funky pagan groove,

715
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,180
gonna make your funky pagan feet move,

716
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,680
and don't be afraid to dance out there,

717
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,640
because that's what we're here for.

718
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,720
Not only do we have songs about subjects near and dear to all our hearts,

719
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,880
like dancing naked around fires and playing on drums,

720
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,140
and running off Jehovah Witnesses, and drinking mead, stuff like that.

721
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,820
Not only do we have a killer website at wickabilly.com,

722
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,560
that's wickabilly.com,

723
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,220
and if you're pagan, you know how to spell it already, I hope.

724
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,540
Not only do we have all those things,

725
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,940
but we got our very own God and Goddess chant.

726
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,660
Now, when was the last time you heard of a band

727
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,480
that had their own God and Goddess chant?

728
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,400
I'm not talking about people out there,

729
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,840
when Velvet Hammer's playing, going,

730
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,060
Ginger, Linda, Tawny Nighthawk.

731
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,200
No, I'm talking, we got old God and Goddesses,

732
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,520
new God and Goddesses.

733
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,400
And maybe you say to me,

734
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,640
hey, uh, Trickster,

735
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,560
I heard you chant something a little while back,

736
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,900
but I didn't quite make it out.

737
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,340
Would you mind going through it one more time for me, please?

738
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,560
Loki, Coyote, you turp, a turp, sicker,

739
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,260
a pandion, Isis, Bob dolls.

740
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,440
Loki, Coyote, that's us.

741
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,280
From Loki, the Norse god of mischief.

742
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,300
Loki, who was able to convince the thunder god, Thor,

743
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,320
to dress in drag.

744
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,220
And Coyote, the Trickster,

745
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,480
always getting himself and other people in trouble,

746
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,140
in all those Native American tales.

747
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,240
Always in the name of fun.

748
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,320
Coyote, spirit guide of Homer Simpson.

749
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,700
Got the voice of Johnny Cash.

750
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,740
Loki, Coyote, you turp, a turp, sicker, a pandion,

751
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:36,920
Isis, Bob dolls.

752
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,200
Now the ancient Greeks personified the arts

753
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,820
as goddesses known as muses.

754
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,340
And the two that we're concerned with here

755
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:46,180
are Euterpa, the goddess of music,

756
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,460
and Euterpa, the goddess of music.

757
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,620
And Terpsichore, the goddess of dance.

758
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,220
Loki, Coyote, Euterpa, Terpsichore,

759
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,860
Pandion, Isis.

760
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,120
Ah, Pan.

761
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,940
Pan is my favorite personal deity.

762
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,700
He's the horn god of the forests and the fields.

763
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,780
Pan plays his pipes in the moonlight.

764
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,280
Dances under the stars.

765
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,180
Like y'all been doing out here tonight.

766
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,040
He loves women.

767
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,640
He loves animals.

768
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,080
He loves animals in very different ways of course.

769
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,660
And there's Dionysus, the god of revelry.

770
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,820
Now Dionysus traveled from one end of the land

771
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,600
to the others to spread the secret of making wine.

772
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,500
And he is one of my childhood heroes.

773
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,480
Let me tell you right now.

774
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:57,600
Loki, Coyote, Euterpe, Terpsichore, Pandionysus, Bob Dobbs.

775
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,540
Bob Dobbs of the Church of the Subgenius.

776
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,500
Bob Dobbs, the divine drilling equipment salesman.

777
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,420
Bob Dobbs.

778
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,520
Who gives us words of wisdom such as,

779
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,900
the more ridiculous it seems,

780
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,700
the more important it probably is.

781
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:18,860
Yeah.

782
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,220
And based on that, my friends,

783
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:26,000
Loki, Coyote may well be the most important band that ever was.

784
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:35,540
Loki, Coyote, Euterpe, Terpsichore, Pandionysus, Bob Dobbs.

785
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:40,800
Loki, Coyote, Euterpe, Terpsichore, Pandionysus, Bob Dobbs.

786
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,920
Quick, oh, oh, quick.

787
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,600
Quick, oh, yes.

788
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,200
Yes!

789
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,440
Quick, oh, oh.

790
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,260
Quick, oh, oh.

791
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,100
Quick, oh, yes.

792
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,240
Quick, oh, oh.

793
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,080
Quick, oh, oh.

794
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,460
Quick, oh...

795
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,140
Oh

796
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:07,800
Oh

797
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,320
Oh, oh, oh.

798
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:22,520
Oh, oh, oh.

799
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,260
We know each other now, don't we?

800
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,640
Dorothy! Dorothy! Where are you?

801
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,460
She's followed us here.

802
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,120
Uncle Henry, we've got to get away.

803
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,400
Uncle Henry, we've got to run away.

804
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,380
Dorothy, don't bother us now, honey.

805
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,580
I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

806
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:50,320
For 23 years. For 23 years. For 23 years.

807
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,380
For 23 years. For 23 years.

808
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,140
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

809
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,520
I saw you. I saw you.

810
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,520
Open, open. He doesn't do it every day.

811
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,960
He just wants it twice a week.

812
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,280
Annie M., really?

813
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,620
For 23 years, I've been dying to know.

814
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,700
Oh, no, no. Oh, no, no. Oh, no, no.

815
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,760
Please, that's him.

816
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,100
Oh, no.

817
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,280
Uncle Henry.

818
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:07,980
Help.

819
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,140
Uncle Henry.

820
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:09,760
Stop her.

821
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,980
Don't let her take him.

822
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:11,040


823
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,120
No, I won't let you take him.

824
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:14,580
Ah! She locked me in.

825
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,420
Come back. Come back.

826
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,220
Uncle Henry.

827
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,420
Don't go and knock me. Please, come back.

828
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:23,080
Oh, he got away. He got away.

829
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,400
I let him go.

830
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,080
And I was so happy.

831
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,760
I'll never forget myself.

832
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,140
Never, never, never.

833
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,160
Ouch.

834
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:50,160


835
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,280
An amazing piece of editing there,

836
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:05,400
friends, from a CD called Extracted ahceluloid.

837
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,100
This audio was mainly used for deriding child data.

838
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,600
that is a release of Sealand Records,

839
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,960
Negative Lands, Sealand Records.

840
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,720
And that amazing little artistic edit

841
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,400
was by Natasha Spencer

842
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,220
and is called The House She Flew In On.

843
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:31,980
You can find the details on this particular product

844
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:36,960
at www.negativeland.com

845
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,200
And now, the next cut up on there,

846
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:44,380
Pedro Rebello's Just Cartoon Music.

847
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,240
Just Cartoon Music

848
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:01,760
Just Cartoon Music

849
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:15,140
I should also mention that Negative Land

850
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,540
does not have an E in it

851
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:21,520
when you go to www.negativeland.com

852
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,800
Also, on studying this

853
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,140
sort of homemade looking label on this CD,

854
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,860
I noticed that this is sponsored by

855
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:31,480
Negative Land.

friends, you are listening to

Close encounters of the fourth kind are by far the most frightening.

888
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,960
Abductions of human beings by aliens.

889
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,080
According to those who claim to have been abducted,

890
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,380
they're transported by a beam of light aboard a spacecraft,

891
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,400
set up on an examination table, surrounded by strange creatures,

892
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,540
probed and prodded as tissue and fluid samples are taken,

893
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:55,300
and then returned to the point from which they were abducted,

894
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,460
most often with little or no recollection of what happened.

895
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:02,240
The one thing they know for certain is that minutes, even hours,

896
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,880
have passed that they can't account for.

897
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,600
This form of amnesia is known as missing time.

898
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:27,860
Uh, yes, friends, and this music in the background is known as Gehenna.

899
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,440
Gehenna.

900
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:28,440


901
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:28,440


902
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:28,440


903
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:32,720
It's a band called Gehenna, an album called Malice,

904
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:36,460
and the song is Made to Suffer.

905
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:40,460
Actually, I think it's a whole album side, you might say.

906
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:46,460
It's a long operatic Germanic death rock or power metal,

907
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,180
gloom, speed thrash metal type song.

908
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:58,160
And friends, friends, I've got all these documentary recordings,

909
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:03,380
of the XX Day Adventurers, that I would love to share with y'all.

910
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,640
And I've been editing the videotape of all that, and I'm debating,

911
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:13,120
is it worthwhile to try to share one of those,

912
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:17,800
you had to have seen the video things, with a radio audience?

913
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,560
Or should I just, I don't know.

914
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,540
You know, even though I'm a holy man, sometimes I find myself in doubt.

915
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,320
In doubt, my friend.

916
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,120
I'm not knowing which way to go.

917
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,040
And at times like this, if you're like me,

918
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:42,040
there's only one thing to do, and that's to just dive right into the bowl of Bob's great big pot.

919
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:50,020
Let him light you up and inhale your burnt fragmentary smoke into his lungs,

920
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,920
and absorb you into his bloodstream, so that you rush to his brain,

921
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:57,240
so that for one billionth of a nanosecond,

922
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,320
Bob Dobbs,

923
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,280
notices you.

924
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,760
And Bob Dobbs could notice you, friend,

925
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,220
if you would just write to Bob at

926
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:12,160
Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

927
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,840
www.subgenius.com

928
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,120
And there's not an O in subgenius.

929
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,200
Ah, yeah.

930
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:29,740
Bob?

931
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:30,140
Bob?

932
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:35,740
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

933
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:41,060
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

934
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,020
Bob?

935
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,840
That's your key phrase.

936
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:48,680
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

937
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,060
We are controlling transmission.

938
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:52,060
Bob?

939
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,840
Get down the rope and go!

940
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,280
Run after the whole baby!

941
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,620
Turn out your knees!

942
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,020
Oh!

943
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:58,020


944
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:58,020


945
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,800
Yeah, he's been hopping to the barbershop with more slack!

946
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,660
I gotta have my slack.

947
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,620
Give it to me!

948
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:16,680
Yeah!

949
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,560
Praise Bob!

950
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,720
Hey!

951
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,340
On top of that smokey!

952
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,160
All covered with sand!

953
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,300
All covered in smoke!

954
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:28,300


955
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:28,300


956
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:28,300


957
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:28,300


958
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:33,160
I shot my boy teacher with a red rubber band.

959
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,120
I shot her with pleasure.

960
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,340
I shot her with fleas.

961
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,360
I couldn't have missed her.

962
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,600
She was 40 feet wide.

963
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,660
I went to her funeral.

964
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,160
I went to her grave.

965
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:58,700
Everybody threw flowers where I threw a grenade.

966
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,880
The police came and got me and put me in jail.

967
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:10,660
I brought a bazooka and shot him to H-E-L-L.

968
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,580
You can find out the truth.

969
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,620
They beat me every day.

970
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:30,740
It's a hell of a day.

971
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,720
They forced you to sleep on boards.

972
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:39,060
They put me in a place.

973
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,480
They put me in a place.

974
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:46,240
It's alright that you stay in the house.

975
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,460
When the subgeniuses came in, they took all my furniture.

976
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:52,940
I'm going to the hospital.

977
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,620
They wanted to buy me this neck brace that I can't take off now.

978
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:59,560
They said it was a living being.

979
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,480
Bring the upper lip down below the upper teeth.

980
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,220
Be sure to keep it down until the fingers are in position.

981
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,820
At each corner of the mouth, insert a thumb under...
