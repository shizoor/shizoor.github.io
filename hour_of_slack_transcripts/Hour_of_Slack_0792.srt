1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,980
No, no, no. How does that start? I can't remember.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,860
I, I, yes, friends. No, I, yes, dear friends.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,840
You're listening, no, uh, radio ministry.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,120
It's the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,740
Brought to you by the Church of the Subgenius.

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,580
Produced here at the beautiful studios of WCSB, Cleveland, the home.

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,360
I love that show. It's so iconoclastic.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,460
And, you know, everything is worthy of poking at and making fun.

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,420
And sometimes throwing dirt on the shoes and pulling a knife at it.

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,480
Yeah, they're just a mirror that reflects the illness in society.

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,860
Oh, please don't look in the mirror.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,920
You're not going to like what you see there.

13
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,260
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Drew Pearson.

14
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,900
We bring you this special radio television broadcast

15
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,860
in order to give you the very latest information on an amazing phenomenon.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,820
The arrival of a spaceship in Washington.

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,140
The rumors of invading armies and mass destruction.

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,500
Are based on hysteria and are absolutely false.

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,760
And you are not alone.

20
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,540
And you are not alone.

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,260
Remember it's true.

22
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:56,720
Remember it's true.

23
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,880
And easy prey.

24
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,600
We'll make great friends.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,040
We'll make great friends.

26
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,060
We'll make great friends.

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
We'll make great friends.

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,600
The Exist will descend with their scientifically magic implements.

29
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,560
There will be stalls of technology that will be too much for us to handle.

30
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,640
In one instant, all the handovers will disappear.

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,340
Along with all pollution.

32
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,500
And all the nuclear weapons.

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,400
But in return, the human race will have to take on living machinery so complex that though it is peaceful,

34
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,660
the end result will be equivalent to letting toddlers play with a nuclear arsenal.

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,260
Bob, and not some conspiracy world government, must be there in a position of world leadership

36
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,360
to explain humanity's behavior to the Exists in ways they can understand

37
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,960
so they don't put us out of our misery with a snap of their cosmic finger

38
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,600
like they did the dinosaurs.

39
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,400
The right people, us, must be the ones that the Exists make into superhuman over men.

40
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,000
By 1950, some of these characters were beginning to spin their stories of fantastic conversations

41
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,060
with alleged space people.

42
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,220
Some of them expanded the stories to include alleged rides in the UFOs.

43
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,460
Suddenly everything went black and I realized that I'd been cut off and shut off in a little tiny room

44
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,820
where nobody was listening to me.

45
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,420
And I was talking to this hot little plush felt red rubber tip microphone

46
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,200
and not hearing a thing and seeing only little tiny lights

47
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,060
and wondering why I was strapped to this chair and put into this studio that seemed to be rotating very rapidly

48
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,920
with lights flashing off rhythmically.

49
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:47,260
And it was a small man with a swollen head and hideously deformed eyes sitting behind the console

50
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,560
pushing the buttons while pencils of light and energy flashed across my body.

51
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,800
And I wondered why I was there and what did they want of me.

52
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,220
And I couldn't figure out why I was sitting there.

53
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,560
And they didn't say anything.

54
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,100
They just kept flashing those lights at me and pumping those strange chemicals into me.

55
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,140
And the man with the funny head, the leader, the man with the strange grin and the pipe.

56
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,220
Well, I just want to know if you want to be in the church or out of the church.

57
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,800
And where's your wallet?

58
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,480
The DC9 pushed the button.

59
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:15,680
Yeah.

60
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:22,500
I didn't know that I'd been snatched up, but it wasn't really a dream until I saw these sacred nasal positions.

61
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,640
And suddenly it all came back.

62
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,820
And I realized that they'd stolen four and a half hours out of my life

63
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,780
when they put me in that tiny room and plugged all those wires into me and made me talk.

64
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,460
Well, it's only an hour and a half tonight, mister.

65
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,960
And talk because you only paid for an hour and a half.

66
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,840
If this was indeed an extraterrestrial spacecraft with living occupants,

67
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,960
it must have been very disconcerting for them to cross millions of miles of space

68
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,860
only to be hit on the head with rotten oranges.

69
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,480
The dramatic advent of such fascinating objects as those which were first called flying saucers

70
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:05,980
attracted the inevitable attention of those individuals who let their imaginations run away with their veracity.

71
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:16,780
Friends, if you've ever noticed those little houses spotting up everywhere in the hills near your home,

72
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:23,100
those people with indistinguishable physical characteristics and facial features,

73
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,440
those with names you can't really remember,

74
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:34,620
that vast sea of faces out there that wants to eat your liver and sing about it on a rock,

75
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,240
they're about to get you.

76
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,180
They're about to get you tonight at exactly 4 a.m.

77
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,760
They are coming, Radio...

78
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,460
Sleep light. Sleep light, Radio Land.

79
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,840
I do not know they are coming to take you away.

80
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,080
I mean, they are coming.

81
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,080


82
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,220
They are coming for you.

83
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,460
Thanks for coming, Dad. I wouldn't be here without you.

84
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,660
Mom, I'm glad you came too, just for your own sake, I suppose.

85
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,740
But I guess not before...

86
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,020
Dave, get out of the way. The doors are opening.

87
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,700
This is it. This is what we've been waiting for.

88
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,360
No, no. We've got to think good thoughts.

89
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,420
Stan, Stan, stop peeing in your pants, man. You're getting the floor all wet.

90
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,200
We've got to...

91
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,400
He said... He said...

92
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,960
I'll be right here.

93
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it.

94
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,160
I'll show you. Be back. I feel better.

95
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,540
Hello.

96
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,140
You've got to think good thoughts, man. They can read your mind.

97
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,460
They're starting to pie bar into our heads right now.

98
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,840
I'm ready to bend over and spread them.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,780
They're opening the slaughterhouse doors.

100
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,280
Did you happen to see...

101
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,980
Finally, we can get inside.

102
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,240
It's so funny, Landon.

103
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,460
Yeah, remember.

104
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:58,040
Two monsters get the shock of a lifetime when they close and counter the third time for the first time.

105
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,400
Then they wake up.

106
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,660
Morning America.

107
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,100
Morning America.

108
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,740
Morning America.

109
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,560
Morning America.

110
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,760
Morning America.

111
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,280
Morning America.

112
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,640
Morning America.

113
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,000
Morning America.

114
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,640
The Exes.

115
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,380
The Exes.

116
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,440
The Exes.

117
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,120
have landed Earth's under their control

118
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,260
Dobbs vision stands proven

119
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:41,320
The city's radioactive holes

120
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,140
We don't know what they're gaming

121
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:54,280
But their name is unpronounceable

122
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:01,220
We don't know what they came for

123
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:07,120
But what they aim for is impossible

124
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,740
Despair not, ye beings

125
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,680
In the second year before the millennium of the day of God

126
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,300
Come Wednesday

127
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,120
And the day of the Lord is nigh

128
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,340
As in the twinkling of night there will come along the Yark of Tisra

129
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,840
Which are like unto thy great white brothers

130
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,780
They come as men, as brave and courageous

131
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,140
As the war-branded, as the cloud

132
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,320
And beyond all the heavens, they're equal for thee

133
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,440
Have landed their machines

134
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,300
Following our tracks

135
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,480
Dobbs vision stands proven

136
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,280
A world without slack

137
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,060
And they spoke to me

138
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,880
With the enshrinement of knowledge came prosperity

139
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,380
No longer would superstition divide mankind

140
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,160
With great bounty came a great peace

141
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,920
Institutions fell not because they were toppled

142
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,480
But because they fulfilled their purpose

143
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,080
And yielded to the greater good

144
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,320
Prosperity? Knowledge? But when?

145
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,680
Could it have been that mankind will enter an age of enlightenment

146
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,140
That lasted so long that dates will be meaningless?

147
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,700
And yet the seed of religion survived to flower again

148
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,280
This time it embraced not a deity

149
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,300
But a new spirituality

150
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,860
Built upon the discarded belief of the old

151
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,740
Whatever inspires man to dream

152
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,040
He is bound to awaken to reality

153
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,980
Give me a date, dammit!

154
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,000
When did these things happen?

155
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,020
The new faith sanctioned a value placed upon all living things

156
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,680
Rendering some higher and some lower

157
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,420
This piteous division of utility created an ever widening discrepancy

158
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,800
Between those who shape the world to their own needs

159
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,760
And those whose world is shaped by others

160
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,860
The two factions were driven farther and farther apart

161
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,160
When did the bifurcation begin?

162
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,300
How long ago?

163
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,160
What good's a museum without years?

164
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,680
Mankind held its own place until nature herself rebelled

165
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,660
Not from within

166
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:39,880
Or not

167
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,980
But from within the human organism itself

168
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,680
With a terrible plague

169
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,900
Nation by nation

170
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,860
Species by species

171
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,120
Its onset so subtle

172
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,480
That it took hold before anyone knew to stop it

173
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,740
Not one is safe

174
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,100
That's right, before the cock crawls

175
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,460
It's a new day!

176
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,340
Thank God!

177
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,220
And praise Bob!

178
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,380
A new day dawns, friends!

179
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,840
Which may be the last time you'll ever have to listen to the right thing on the brain

180
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,820
Because David would be in space aboard a tunic

181
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,540
He'd have to make another with the same tone

182
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,040
And he'd automatically have one of the same length

183
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,400
Preserving the standard

184
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,880
Standards of length were vital for building pyramids

185
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,680
Trading cloth or setting boundaries

186
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,760
And evidence indicates that rigid standards existed long before recorded history

187
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,440
What do you think about that?

188
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,880
Rigid...what was that?

189
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,860
Rigid standards?

190
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,700
I like the rigid part

191
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,880
I'm General Rigid Standard

192
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,520
I was making some...

193
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm going to tell you my...

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,040
Physicist Lyle Borst at the State University of New York

195
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,540
Has studied the origins of units of length

196
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,060
And...

197
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,660
Uh, do we really want to know how this man studied the origins of units of length?

198
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,320
Especially after he got so rigid

199
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,840
Now he's going to get out the little...

200
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,340
He's like, rigid and origins of length

201
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,220
He's going to get out the little school ruler

202
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,200
And put it right up there on the...

203
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,440
And say, how am I doing?

204
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,320
I've reached my 58th birthday

205
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,240
Let's see how many penis I have

206
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,660
Billions of galaxies inhabit our universe

207
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,980
Each with billions upon billions of stars and planets

208
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,260
Do you really believe this stuff?

209
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,180
Scientists doubt that intelligent life lives on some of the planets scattered through the cosmos

210
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,360
Oh come on, when Colonel Sagan was a young boy in a muster filled universe

211
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,920
You're going to wish there wasn't so much intelligent life out there

212
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,700
And according to Dr. Cyril Panamperouma

213
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,360
Wait a minute, wait

214
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,680
Play that backwards

215
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,360
We gotta hear that one backwards

216
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,960
That's the kind of comment they're trying to address

217
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,980
I'm a man of research

218
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,220
Cyril Panamperouma

219
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:44,360
Alanis Morissette

220
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,620
Alanis Morissette is an alien?

221
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,300
Cyril Panamperouma

222
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,020
I'm a man of research

223
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,360
Almost certainly such alien life will have the same chemistry as we do

224
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,840
That's a laugh

225
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,860
That's a laugh if I...

226
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,660
That's a scientific impossibility

227
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,260
A nucleic acid protein based...

228
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,600
Listen

229
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,200
One of the main pillars of organic life is the proteins

230
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,300
Which are constructed of amino acids

231
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,080
It is our genetic material

232
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,580
We're the same as hamburgers

233
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,120
Speak for yourself pink boy

234
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,900
It is our genetic...

235
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,680
Sal-o-acid

236
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,140
Sal-o-acid

237
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,480
Sal-o-acids

238
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,000
It is our genetic material

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,740
Commonly known as DNA and RNA

240
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,140
That directs a given amino acid to the right spot of a particular protein

241
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,340
And in laboratory research

242
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:44,160
Dr. Panamperouma has created the materials which constitute DNA

243
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,860
And the amino acids

244
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,020
That are the building blocks of protein

245
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,180
From spark discharges

246
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,840
What the world doesn't know is that experiment is still going on inside Dave's head

247
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,480
The way these constituents of biological materials join together

248
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,140
Is determined by certain chemical laws

249
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,320
Which are the same throughout the universe

250
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,380
For this reason alien life will probably have the same or similar genetic code as we do

251
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:15,720
It would be unthinkable for God's creatures to be formed in any other way than after his image

252
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,220
We have the same or similar genetic code as we do

253
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,400
Be built of protein

254
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,560
Have internal organs

255
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,460
And contain blood

256
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,740
Or its equivalent to nourish its cells

257
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,440
That's all you need

258
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,000
And what does alien life look like?

259
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,600
According to Dr. Panamperouma

260
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,200
Hyper writers

261
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,460
The guess of movie producers as to the form alien life takes is as good as any

262
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,520
Hollywood, wait Hollywood movie producers?

263
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,020
They look like Hollywood movie producers

264
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,360
Far, far away

265
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,000
E.T. may be mistaken for...

266
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,160
And there is G2?

267
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:38,920
And there is a radio program

268
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,640
It's the gas

269
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,440
Just as you are now on the planet earth

270
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,440
It's all the gas

271
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,100
Right where you are sitting now

272
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,860
A feature of the American Institute of Physics

273
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,820
The American Institute of Pissix

274
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,300
The mental institution of psychically benowted

275
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,360
And these are experts, friends

276
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,920
You know people are sitting there going

277
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,620
X's, end of the world, 1998

278
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,060
If they don't buy the book

279
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,100
When 1998 comes

280
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,120
And the world

281
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,160
Is a nuclear waste

282
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,660
When we're all slaves or ground beef

283
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,280
They're gonna go

284
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,220
Oh I guess these guys weren't kidding

285
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,460
Yeah I should have read the start fist a little more carefully

286
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,840
Your blood is your heart of space

287
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,300
I'm coming with advanced knowledge

288
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,240
To help super race

289
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,160
To help super race

290
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,440
To help the human race

291
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,680
My friends

292
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,420
To serve man

293
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,700
To save you

294
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,160
From the terrifying secret

295
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,860
Of space

296
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,320
Well friends Nina Hagen heard there

297
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,460
Trusts the aliens

298
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,680
But Bob

299
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,040
Make sure he has a contract

300
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,920
And a deposit

301
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,680
And that deposit my friend

302
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,720
Is your soul

303
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:22,920
And maybe it was a joke

304
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,540
nicer than the awakening

305
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:23,640
True your thing

306
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:23,920
means more than a shock

307
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,840
Oh hey

308
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:35,820
Oh what the heck

309
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:35,820


310
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,780
I is bubble tea

311
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,200
uc

312
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,600
I have many radio stations to thank and talk about tonight, actually, friends.

313
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:52,780
And there was some post-X Day prophecy from H.G. Wells, the time machine from the turn of the century before.

314
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,940
Bits of last year's triple X Day CDs from Subgenius Foundation.

315
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:07,280
And of course, friends, this is the last of the X Day shows, as usual, being heard after the fact.

316
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,200
If it's heard at all, I hope it's never heard in human ways.

317
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,820
And this music in the background, by the way, is with Professor Chaz Smith himself.

318
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,500
But friends, I'm going to crank out a bunch of shows in advance because I'm heading for Brushwood for 4X Day.

319
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,660
As you're about to hear now.

320
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,660
Me Bizarro Bob hates slack.

321
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,600
It looks like folks are about ready to be baptized.

322
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,060
Look, there's a pretty girl there who's on the outside.

323
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,300
That's me.

324
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:48,420
I'm baptized with this special preaching finger dipped in the very center of the circle of babes.

325
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,760
Before I even go.

326
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:05,520
Wow, look at all those naked Subgenius.

327
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,640
I'm going to videotape.

328
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,060
And then I don't know what I'll do with it later, but it'll be cool.

329
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,360
Wow.

330
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,300
Oh, they're almost all guys.

331
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:16,840
Darn.

332
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,080
I was hoping there'd be more chicks.

333
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,720
God, they're kind of scary looking.

334
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,740
Oh my God, even the chicks.

335
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,980
Oh, that is a chick.

336
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,140
I can't tell the chicks from the guys in this bizarre place.

337
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,540
I'm a frog.

338
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,620
I'm what Dr. Lagune calls a frog watcher.

339
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,200
I admit that I'm a frog watcher.

340
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,240
Reverend Stang said that the true artist is a jack-off artist, and that's me.

341
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,500
I can smell the sin on you, brothers and sisters.

342
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,020
And that sin needs to be washed away.

343
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,260
You're a frog watcher, Reverend Stang.

344
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,240
Every year you get stained with a little bit of sin.

345
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,460
The sin you get from working in your day-to-day jobs and just putting up with stuff that you

346
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,640
just don't want to have to put up with.

347
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,200
Hey!

348
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,820
But this year things are going to be a little different.

349
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,120


350
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:19,120
Every year I walk out into this bar and I make some unlucky person fear for their life.

351
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,460
Last night, it happened.

352
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:38,980
I'm going to walk out of the bar and I have to go to the bathroom to bathe.

353
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,040
And the baptism is basically to wash away that pink taint from rubbing elbows with and

354
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,100
kind of purify them.

355
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,780
The baptism is a very beautiful event because most of us need a bath.

356
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,900
I love you.

357
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,380
Oh.

358
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:07,080
I'm gonna see them again and again.

359
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,260
In the next episode, I'm going to see them again.

360
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,900
Is that before or after the Bob pills?

361
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,380
Friends, we're going on a long journey now.

362
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,480
Get ready. Pack your bags.

363
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,340
You'll have one foot on the platform and one foot on the train,

364
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,380
but when the train takes off, it's going to split you right down the middle.

365
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,940
Hookah, hookah, hookah, hookah.

366
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,140
Look, look, look at the rhythm.

367
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,680
The conductor's coming.

368
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,560
The conductors are chasing.

369
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,680
I like that rhythm.

370
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,300
Look, look, look, there's five conductors.

371
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,660
Sounds like an audience.

372
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,540
They've got guns.

373
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,580
Look, look, look, they've got guns.

374
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,280
Little toys, sweat guns, like the kind you had with Mom made a cherry pie.

375
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,920
There he goes, Dave, heading off down the trail.

376
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,960
Yes, I remember when Mom made those hot, stinky cherry pies every night after school.

377
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,560
We're on board with him again.

378
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,040
This happens every time.

379
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,980
We think we're waving to Dave.

380
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,040
He's in the window.

381
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,540
Come and have some pie, dear.

382
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,480
And we think we're waving goodbye to him, and then he pulls out,

383
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,460
and then we turn around, and as we turn around,

384
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,700
he's pulling into the station.

385
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,380
And you're back on the train with him.

386
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,260
And look, he's pulling in like Plastic Man.

387
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,460
And the front part is moving much slower than the back part.

388
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,900
Babbling nonstop.

389
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,700
This is a bad time loop, dude.

390
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,940
For some reason, drinking this cup of coffee makes me feel like I'm at the airport.

391
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,420
We're in a state of psychokinesis.

392
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,260
It's like I'm going somewhere.

393
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,200
Well, you're just waiting.

394
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,680
We're in the waiting room here.

395
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,860
Well, it's not the airport.

396
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,580
I can't wait to get to Amsterdam again.

397
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,120
Coffee.

398
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,120
For our weekly trip.

399
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,900
I don't think you're going to be going to Mr. Amsterdam for a very long time, Mr. Amsterdam.

400
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,080
Just plop your identification poopers down there on the table.

401
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,640
We're only going to rattle it for a little while.

402
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,340
Stand clear.

403
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,260
That's right.

404
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,080
There you go.

405
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:58,540
No, no.

406
00:21:59,460 --> 00:21:59,920
No, no.

407
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,060
No, no, no, no.

408
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,740
Oh, thanks.

409
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,960
You got my heart going again.

410
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,860
Part of the job.

411
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,000
Where are we, by the way?

412
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,640
Well, it's part of the job wherever the hell we are right now.

413
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,260
Down here at whatever we're doing.

414
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,540
It changes from moment to moment.

415
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,240
Yeah, I'm glad, too.

416
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,520
It's frightening.

417
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,700
I hate it when I know what's going on.

418
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,480
Having to create each scene, looking out the window, wondering if it's going to be Indians or weird psychic pirates.

419
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,740
Yeah, but it's always something different.

420
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,160
So if it's bad, you know, it's going to go away soon.

421
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,000
Yeah, what about the last conductor who lost his hand?

422
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,800
Well, I mean, it wasn't our fault.

423
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,840
Well, that's what happens when you try to choose your life.

424
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,020
You try to force your own reality, man.

425
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:36,780
Yeah, really.

426
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,540
And you leave your body parts in the locker room.

427
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:39,800
Just let it flow.

428
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,380
Really?

429
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,660
Quit trying to, like, force your own reality on these escape vessels, man.

430
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,900
It's like, it's just going to backfire on you.

431
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,400
You've just got to ride the snake, you know?

432
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,540
You've just got to just...

433
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,180
Oh, coming in the access tunnel now.

434
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,000
It's like a river.

435
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,380
You've just got to flow with it.

436
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,440
It's...

437
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,560
Oh, Hitler, you know.

438
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,840
Oh, well, we'll be here for about another 45 seconds.

439
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,140
I wonder what they've got programmed.

440
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,180
Is that the program coming up right now?

441
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,580
Oh, there it is.

442
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,080
The conductor's passing out little hand whistles.

443
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:09,960
October 14.

444
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,780
We can all hear better now.

445
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,220
I can smell better now.

446
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,740
Oh, look, it's a communist.

447
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,780
Everything's better now.

448
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,220
There's Abraham Lincoln.

449
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,100
There's Martin Luther King Jr.

450
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
Look, it's Art Borey's flag.

451
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,140
There's Art Bell.

452
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,060
There's Jerry Lee Lewis.

453
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,060
Jerry Lewis.

454
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,900
Wow, they're all here together.

455
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,640
October 19.

456
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,480
The wrong dragon.

457
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,060
They're laying down their arms.

458
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,000
Oh, my God.

459
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,820
Look, they're laying down their arms.

460
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,080
And everyone's dropping their body parts.

461
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,380
Laying down their legs.

462
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,280
Oh, my God.

463
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,100
How are they going to move?

464
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,780
They're not going to be able to move when it happens.

465
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,580
This is...

466
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,720
Then you found you came to Smith in Water.

467
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,840
That is...

468
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:13,420
It's green and growing in the night sky of a land beyond, beyond a world of hope and fear.

469
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,160
And so have you, spaceman.

470
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,760
Now up here.

471
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,160
Now up here.

472
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,520
Now up here.

473
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,740
Now up here.

474
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,060
until the sun shines out need ARMADA

475
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,700
That's the...

476
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,360
Oh, that's the monkey.

477
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,960
There's no...

478
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,800
Oh increases

479
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,700
a little bit of exhibited

480
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,700
leaders

481
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,120
There's no communists, just poets in favor and electric mist.

482
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,540
What do you know?

483
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,800
What do you know?

484
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,560
What do you know? What do you know? What do you know?

485
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,800
What do you know?

486
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:31,420
This is my last chance to pluck the unsaved subgeniuses out of this planetary swim.

487
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:38,540
This is the final opportunity for redemption before the X's grip hand comes down.

488
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,140
And oh, I can't let you down now.

489
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:48,820
I have a sacred obligation to my ministry and to the true Yeti stock among us.

490
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,260
Because children, our heritage awaits us in the stars.

491
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:06,000
And soon, oh yes, soon, as Bob is my witness, we'll never be slackless again.

492
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,220
Let the judgment begin. I'll get the ball rolling.

493
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,960
The end of the world.

494
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,320
How near is it?

495
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,220
We heard a great deal today about the end of the world.

496
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,100
When is it going to come?

497
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,140
Some have been so presumptuous as to set dates.

498
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,600
As a result, people have sold their worldly goods, gone to a mountaintop somewhere,

499
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,420
and waited for the end of the world to come.

500
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,160
Others have taught and preached that there will be no end,

501
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,660
that everything will go on as it is.

502
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,660
And both parties are wrong.

503
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:39,380
And I alluded to the fact that certain traditions of men teach that

504
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,120
when a planet goes to the moon,

505
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,120


506
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,120


507
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,320
or a comet goes through a certain field,

508
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,480
was it the great hunter?

509
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,300
I think it was.

510
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,140
That that means the earth is coming to an end.

511
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,980
And I made the statement that it would be impossible for Haley Bopp to hit the states

512
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,840
of the Americas unless a chunk broke off.

513
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,880
And this lady thought I said a chunk was going to break off of Haley Bopp and me and the world.

514
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,460
I didn't say that, all right?

515
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,400
That would be an impossibility, is what I was actually saying.

516
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,940
There's nothing out there that's going to run into Haley Bopp.

517
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,280
But I had fun doing that.

518
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,640
I hope you all enjoyed it.

519
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:29,200
But no dates were mentioned other than astronomical signs in the heavens were taking place at those times.

520
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,880
The church of the subgenius is surely the church of the future,

521
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,220
or at least what's left of it.

522
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,940
The world as we know it will end in war.

523
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,100
The world as we know it will end in war.

524
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,000
Things won't be the same no more.

525
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,960
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

526
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,180
Subgeniuses come from a better world and they're going to a better world.

527
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,100
They descended from abominable snowmen and will evolve overnight on some evening in late

528
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,100
1998 into overmen and aliens.

529
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,100


530
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,100


531
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,100


532
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,100


533
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:17,820
It is an unbroken line of continuous change as opposed to that of pinks who are an evolutionary

534
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,360
dead end and have been spinning their wheels as mere humans for the last million years

535
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:22,780
or so.

536
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,980
Part of that involves freeing the, let's call them the normals, pinks, the pink boys,

537
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:34,100
the mediocrities from the repressions that the conspiracy is laying on them.

538
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,180
Hurry, you've got no time to lose.

539
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,400
Theрем Get ready for our next episode.

540
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,040
The core issue of The Dream Family is Bie B

541
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,060
ek falls in love with the orientaladel.

542
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:59,400
The story I tell about them so that they can trust me, it's just that it's too lonely.

543
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:05,180
They say they'll come and sit there again.

544
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:11,900
But they can't dryer on people that they just don't trust.

545
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,460
It's time to pray.

546
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,240
There's a new sitcom coming, folks.

547
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,840
It's called Armageddon.

548
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,080
That's what it's called, Armageddon!

549
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,280
The greatest war of all wars will be fought.

550
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,980
The Battle of Armageddon will be fought.

551
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,040
The blood will flow in the streets up to the bridles of the horses for 200 miles.

552
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,620
Oh, she's a cat!

553
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,540
Lean forward to it, Mrs. Starr.

554
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,380
You are the basic truth in us.

555
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,460
You are the reality.

556
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,220
We will never let you down.

557
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,700
And we will always be grateful.

558
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,860
I'll tell you what.

559
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,100
Five dogs came to town to set you free!

560
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,220
Surely, I come quickly. Amen.

561
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,020
My!

562
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,620
People come and go so quickly here.

563
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,120
In both instances, he's coming literally, visibly, and bodily.

564
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,080
Brother, every time I see you, I'm like,

565
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,480
I see another spaceship going to the moon in the exploration of the moon

566
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,780
and soon driving the new automobiles they're making for the moon.

567
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,440
I say, my heart, he must be coming soon now.

568
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,540
Let each one who hears them say the same.

569
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,420
Come.

570
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,940
Let the thirsty one come.

571
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,760
Anyone who wants to, without charge.

572
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,180
He who has said all things, declares,

573
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,060
Yes, I am coming.

574
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,060
Soon.

575
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,880
God said, taste and see.

576
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,700
Just try it for yourself.

577
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,500
You all be ashamed of yourself.

578
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,560
Frightening him like that when it came to you for help.

579
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,360
Quiet!

580
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:54,680
With a snapper, the beneficent Oz has every intention of granting your requests.

581
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,640
What's that?

582
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,480
What did he say?

583
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,080
What did he say?

584
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:04,720
At first, you must prove yourselves worthy by performing a very small task.

585
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,040
He didn't tell us to clean up the fish pond.

586
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
He said to fish in it.

587
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,020
He must be lost.

588
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,940
We're in a world.

589
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,840
Call of action.

590
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,360
Something is happening.

591
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,080
We're in the race of the young generation.

592
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,780
We're on the go.

593
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,680
We want to tell the nation.

594
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,320
Something is happening.

595
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,040
Something is happening.

596
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,660
Now.

597
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,120
Watch out for us.

598
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,760
We're in a tonic reaction.

599
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,480
Something is happening.

600
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,140
We've got the pressure of a new motivation.

601
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,060
We're going to live in a world of transformation.

602
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,500
Something is happening.

603
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,060
Something is happening.

604
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,920
Something is happening.

605
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:44,920


606
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:45,840
Now.

607
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,400
Now.

608
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:48,400


609
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:48,400


610
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:48,420
Now.

611
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:48,420


612
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:48,420


613
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:48,420


614
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:48,420


615
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:48,420


616
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:48,420


617
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:48,420


618
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:48,420


619
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,880
And now we are on the verge of the greatest and the final war.

620
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,560
If we have an all-out war now, let me tell you something.

621
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,680
It will be the last.

622
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,620
Those awful days that are still ahead for you and me.

623
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,660
Beginning in chapter 3 of 2 Peter, verses 10 through 14.

624
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,980
But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens shall

625
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,400
pass away with a great noise.

626
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,140
Mm.

627
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,540
And the earth shall be burned up.

628
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,680
Some have thought this means perhaps a nuclear blast.

629
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,100
And the elements shall melt with fervent heat.

630
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,760
That's tremendous heat, isn't it?

631
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,700
The earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.

632
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,820
Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye

633
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,320
to be in all holy conversation and godliness?

634
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:36,660
I suppose I could put on my black costume and fly over the Emerald City a few times

635
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,640
on my flaming broomstick.

636
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:39,940
Ha ha!

637
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:40,920


638
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,660
Ha ha!

639
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,180
Ha ha!

640
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,040
Double, double, toil and trouble.

641
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,620
Ha ha ha!

642
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,540
Fire burns and calls are involved.

643
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,580
Ha ha ha!

644
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,140
This is a potent wind.

645
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,800
That we've cooked up just for you.

646
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,120
Ha ha ha!

647
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,220
Just look inside.

648
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,460
Our pie.

649
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,200
And see what it is we've got.

650
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,760
It's made of uranium.

651
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,980
And it's called the atomic bomb.

652
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,100
But as soon as we're gone, you folks who are here unsaved, you folks listening by radio,

653
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,980
you folks listening by record, who know not Jesus,

654
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,840
once the church is gone, there is going to be a cataclysmic judgment.

655
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,560
And millions will die in those next few years.

656
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:54,880
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

657
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,680
Ha ha ha!

658
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,720
Ha ha ha!

659
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,680
Ha ha ha!

660
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,560
Ha ha ha!

661
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,660
Ha ha ha!

662
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:02,920


663
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:03,840
Ha ha ha!

664
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,540
Ha ha ha!

665
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:04,940
Ha ha ha!

666
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,340
Ha ha ha!

667
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,320


668
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,320


669
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,320


670
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,320


671
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,500
Ha ha ha!

672
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,340
Ha ha ha!

673
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,800
Ha ha ha!

674
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,020


675
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,280
Yeah!

676
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:27,320
You said longer than that, and I'm very bad with rubber!

677
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,520
Bad, you got that.

678
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,540
We're going to shave already?

679
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,260
Big girl.

680
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,260


681
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,260


682
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,260


683
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,260


684
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,260


685
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,520
Oh, boy.

686
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:30,900
I'm just so f Gotta go everywhere, cause we have to.

687
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,420
Why don't you go somewhere else?

688
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:31,660
Well, let's just let me change areas for a bit.

689
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,560
Lewis I don't have new gig, Lewis way out there to wait for it.

690
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:34,560


691
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,140
He says we're going somewhere else.

692
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,440
It's a harlet, but- Let's go somewhere else.

693
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,440


694
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,960
Started waiting on your truck,irishου.ق

695
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,680
They destroyed the world, the entire Los Angeles area.

696
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,160
Already hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain.

697
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,620
And civil defense authorities state that the situation is much the same across the entire country.

698
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,160
Martial law is now nationwide.

699
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,280
Our fellow countrymen are dying.

700
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:03,600
The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble under the dread assault of that horror long feared.

701
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,280
Mob?

702
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,260
Call all that channels. This is a class one emergency.

703
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,300
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.

704
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,840
Boys, stay in your homes. Stay in your homes.

705
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,540
I got exactly what I wanted!

706
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,440
Time for tubby bye bye. Time for tubby bye bye.

707
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,680
And now a new one!

708
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,940
I hate this job!

709
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,100
Die, arrogant earth scum!

710
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:40,300


711
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,960
I'll see you now, you slippery tree!

cookie

713
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:07,980
I said you knew why everything!

714
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,020
You want it?

715
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,360
I got it!

716
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,820
Wario 14 development, I'm here!

717
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,560
You can never destroy!

718
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,560
You can never destroy!

719
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,100
No!

720
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,880
You have sealed your fate!

721
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,840
You have sealed your fate!

722
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,920
You have sealed your fate!

723
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,940
Adios, you

724
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,840
sick and blocking little stinker!

725
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,820
You have made me very angry!

726
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,680
Very angry indeed!

727
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,780
Of course you realize this means war!

728
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,600
Oh no! We're all doomed!

729
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,660
Launch authorization received.

730
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,620
Countdown sequence initiated.

731
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,520
Launch in progress.

732
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,320
Ah, crap!

733
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,720
Clear clutches my breast.

734
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,480
Launch in progress.

735
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,660
Oh crap, these computers, they're so naughty and so complex!

736
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,320
I couldn't get them to...

737
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,580
Launch in progress.

738
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,340
Launch in progress.

739
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,020
Launch in progress.

740
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,380
Launch in progress.

741
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,840
Launch in progress.

742
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,060
Launch in progress.

743
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,360
Launch in progress.

744
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:21,480
Launch in progress.

745
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:21,480


746
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,220
cop1

747
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,960
You have sealed your fate!

748
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,220
Check time!

749
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,040
10 minutes have passed.

750
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,660
qUEDtheYsq3q Kenya soften hem into bear7

751
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,860
This is my body.

752
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,980
This is my body.

753
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:41,880
As I was saying,

754
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,840
this finally made it up for the two of us.

755
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,040
Oh, here we go.

756
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,640
I got exactly what I wanted!

757
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:04,460
I got exactly what I wanted!

758
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,440
I got exactly what I wanted!

759
00:39:40,060 --> 00:40:04,420
I got exactly what I wanted!

760
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,880
The Black Pitcher is filled with people who are filled with shit

761
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,800
and the vermin of the world inhabit it!

762
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,780
But not for long.

763
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,400
They all deserve to die.

764
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,020
Tell me why, Mrs. Love.

765
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,120
Tell me why.

766
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,400
Because in all of the whole human race, Mrs. Love,

767
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,060
there are two kinds of men and only two.

768
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,060
There's the one staying put in his proper place

769
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,340
and the one with his foot in the other one's face.

770
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,580
Look at me, Mrs. Love.

771
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,120
Look at you.

772
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,120
No, we all deserve to die.

773
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,760
Even you, Mrs. Love,

774
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,800
it even I.

775
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,260
Because the lives of the wicked should be made brief

776
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,540
for the rest of us' death will be a relief.

777
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,920
We all deserve to die.

778
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:01,160
And I'll never see Johanna.

779
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,920
No, I'll never...

780
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,840
Never hug my girl to be finished!

781
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,760
All right.

782
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,740
You, sir.

783
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,080
How about a say?

784
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,360
Come and visit your good friend Sweeney.

785
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:19,560
You, sir.

786
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,580
Too, sir.

787
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,960
Welcome to the grave.

788
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,720
I will have vengeance.

789
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,660
I will have salvation.

790
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,340
So what, Mr. Dog?

791
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,520
We're in shape for the finals?

792
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,280
No, really, Mr. Dog.

793
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,260
And by the way, Bob,

794
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,240
just where is that long promised bucket of pills?

795
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,140
And tell me, Bob, what's this slack business?

796
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,880
Shouldn't the hierarchical slack holders

797
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,060
be getting unearthly dividends on a regular basis by now?

798
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,300
Or is it just really too much fun, Bob?

799
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,220
Well, there is a war on here, Bob.

800
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,180
And whatever happened to too much

801
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,260
is always better than not enough.

802
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,900
As of an inside trading,

803
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,020
in the souls repository in Dobstown?

804
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,800
Oh, come on, Bob.

805
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,600
Remember us?

806
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,420
Remember the old guys?

807
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,300
We used to sell froth mixture to you

808
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,380
way back in the good old days.

809
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,760
We've heard the old Dob's head snake oil routine before, Bob.

810
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,060
We know all about the bleeding head of AP.

811
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,360
But when will it come is what we want to know.

812
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,680
When shall the fabled luck plane tilt?

813
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:30,220
And when shall things at last begin to flow to all, all, all of us

814
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,700
who despite the perilous times in which we do live, plead,

815
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,140
until you still, oh Bob?

816
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,740
Next day's coming closer, Dobbs.

817
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,780
You haven't got all the time to the end of the world, have you?

818
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,540
Hadn't you better just get cracking, Mr. Dobbs?

819
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,240
Don't you think it's time to get your ass out of party mode

820
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,860
and back up the crack?

821
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,960
We're all in this together as a team

822
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,440
that we're gonna make it work.

823
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,580
And I don't know how to make it work.

824
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,680
I don't know how to do it.

825
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,240
I'm gonna do most of this mission.

826
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,620
But I do know that I can assure you that my piece of it is gonna work.

827
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,380
My piece of it?

828
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,300
It won't fail because of me.

829
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,700
It won't fail because of me.

830
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,420
I ain't gonna mess up.

831
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,660
You won't be wasting your $400 million on me.

832
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:23,160
I will be the first man from Norway to conquer the lunar surface.

833
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,280
This is reality, baby.

834
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,380
The force of my mighty huge propiscus.

835
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:26,640
Let's go.

836
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,120
And nothing will fail because of my propiscus.

837
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:31,720
Life's huge.

838
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:31,720


839
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,420
It's all been pre-packed and gelled and fudged around with for the last 25 weeks.

840
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,740
And here on the diphthong chart, you'll notice it's all the way up from here,

841
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,240
straight into the cosmos.

842
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,960
And we're not coming back because of...

843
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,540
Well, we're not allowed back.

844
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,380
But that's another story entirely.

845
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,820
And for those of you who enjoy stories,

846
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,040
Reverend Jim, I mean, Blary, is it?

847
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,800
I'm sorry if I'm reading this right.

848
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,420
From the Church of the Unctuous of Juniors,

849
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,440
we'll...

850
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,180
I would like to brief you.

851
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,620
If some of you are wearing, I notice, the french-fried boxer shorts.

852
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,780
These will not only not glow, but they may cause a toxic...

853
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,400
Could somebody turn that cowboy down?

854
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,940
I think I'm losing oxygen.

855
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,020
I'm sorry, but that's not oxygen you're breathing, sir.

856
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,520
I think it's got a leak in it.

857
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,380
No, you're breathing pure nitrogen all the way.

858
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,420
I thought it was something funny.

859
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,240
I'm sorry about this tank.

860
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,320
I can feel it in my muscles. Now I...

861
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,880
This is church air.

862
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,820
All of my capillaries are expanding.

863
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,960
It's been... It's actually been quite a few years.

864
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,980
A couple of years since we've tuned in to the Crazy Astronaut Channel.

865
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,100
So, so long ago he was set adrift.

866
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:53,980
But they thought that mighty Achilles may have lost his mighty, smelly, heel and solely surface.

867
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,840
But far beyond the rocks where Palimpus had lured him nearly to his death,

868
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:07,040
he could stop and look around the cosmos and see nothing but a bright panoply of stars.

869
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,420
I got a pitch and a roll program and this baby is really gone.

870
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,260
Somebody's having fun out there.

871
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,660
I didn't know they had daycare centers out here.

872
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:25,860
Which, they're putting little tiny babies in little tuna cans and shedding them adrift with maybe just a little...

873
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,500
They started putting the babies in the tuna cans long ago.

874
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:30,960
Yeah, we...

875
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,700
How do you think you got here, Dave?

876
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,620
Oh, for crying out loud, babies were the first thing we done, kid.

877
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:42,480
They send them off... They send them off actually as egg and sperm in their little, you know, spaceship.

878
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,320
And Dr. Schmula has been working with...

879
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:51,080
The spaceship nurtures them completely, supplies them the teat to suck on.

880
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:57,720
As they begin to approach the star that has the hospitable planet, a thousand years from now they'll be...

881
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,400
And the developed psychic...

882
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,620
A magic memory gland with which to nurture them.

883
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,340
Yeah, nurtured it to end...

884
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:09,320
So that the kid is actually born on the new planet.

885
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:16,780
But he's raised by robots and terry cloth wrapped wire mother scarecrows.

886
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,860
All right, he's moving into a junction now with the breast with the actual nipple itself.

887
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,960
The mouth has come open and the star child is ready to absorb the nuclear milk from the...

888
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,380
I mean, when they come back...

889
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:39,140
A hundred thousand years from now when those colonists, the civilizations born from those robot-nurtured colonist babies come back,

890
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:42,520
will they be anything like us?

891
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,700
Will we be able to call them human in anything but form?

892
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:54,560
And even then, think of the mutations that will occur with the radiations of a different star.

893
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,560
Yeah, after about a million years.

894
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,200
Not even that long.

895
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,580
Will they understand real estate?

896
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:08,980
I was about to grab the nearest object and smash the mirror into bits when I saw one with columns of numbers running across it.

897
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,600
I fancy myself comfortable with numerals, but these were beyond even me.

898
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,140
Fortunately, its words were not.

899
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:28,020
As cycles came and went in groupings of ten thousand years, the sixth ice age receded, leaving behind the muted landscape and...

900
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:28,760
...four continents.

901
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:34,640
By the four hundredth millennium, the genetic separation was irrevocable.

902
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:39,760
Occasional mutations proved the rule, rather than overturned it.

903
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:52,420
Separated into Eloatus humanus and Morloccus dishumanus, the former homo sapiens left no genetic trail by AD 492,965.

904
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:57,680
We've been tapping into the NASA radio signals for...

905
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:05,900
...quite a while here, and we've just caught up with July 1969, because this is the Apollo 11 stuff.

906
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,160
So are we going backwards or forwards now after we pass that?

907
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,360
We're going away from Earth.

908
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:12,780
Yeah.

909
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,060
So that means we're going to 1967?

910
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,120
We're caught...we've caught up to the 1969 radio waves.

911
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:25,200
So the further out we'll get, the closer we'll get to the further...we could listen to, like, radio from the Earth.

912
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:25,860
Oh, pretty soon.

913
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:29,780
Yeah, we'll be able to listen to some of them cool old sci-fi radio shows and stuff.

914
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,320
And then the last thing we'll hear will be Hitler.

915
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,960
And then we'll be past the radio waves from Earth.

916
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:43,660
Okay, that's how we'll know that the first focus, as the great drama-brama was calling it, the first focus will drift...

917
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:48,800
...after we hear a large hyster...planning to slaughter Poland or something, right?

918
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,480
But we've been typing the whole time, so we can just play it backwards.

919
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,120
And then Poland will never be raped?

920
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:54,540
Yeah.

921
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,280
Okay, that sounds fine.

922
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:56,720
Does that sound good?

923
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:56,940


924
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,820
What are they doing out there?

925
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,560
Perhaps they're applying the lubricant.

926
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:05,640
I know Poland is often very vociferous and recalcitrant as a sexual partner.

927
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:12,380
Roger, I'd like you to terminate charging battery Bravo at 111 plus 15, over.

928
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,420
Well, the one thing's for sure...

929
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,360
The battery wore out.

930
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:15,960
Yeah, they're having...

931
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,080
They're just changing the batteries.

932
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,260
At least those dildos...

933
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:18,940
Are you doing show tonight?

934
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:25,600
Well, I wouldn't want to be there in any kind of sexual encounter with Adolf Hitler.

935
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,380
Or Eva Braun without batteries.

936
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,260
You know?

937
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:34,980
Especially if we're going to be using one of those extremely, extremely large physical

938
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:35,900
re-tuburators.

939
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,200
Well, they're not catching up to Hitler and Eva Braun.

940
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:44,300
They're just the radio broadcasts of Hitler's speeches, which were some of the first television

941
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,160
signals actually.

942
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,480
Oh, I said that.

943
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:45,820
No.

944
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,240
They'll still be getting...

945
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,860
We're not going to actually see Adolf Hitler in space.

946
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,860
Oh, wow, man.

947
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,840
You guys had me going.

948
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,880
I thought we were going through these concurrent worlds.

949
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,580
You know, where I'd see Adolf Hister, and then...

950
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:55,580


951
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:59,600
I'd see Adolf Hitler climbing the podium and going to entrench and start screaming all

952
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,220
these weird...

953
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,080
And then I'll see...

954
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,400
That's for a different dream, Dave.

955
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,440
That's for another time in the future.

956
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,880
Why can't I have the dream I wanted to have?

957
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,540
See, Dave, this is your room right there.

958
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:11,920
Wow, man.

959
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:15,160
I didn't know it was so far up there on the top of the vesicle.

960
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:16,780
Geez, man.

961
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,180
And it's such a beautiful space station looking thing.

962
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,380
It's not a station.

963
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,180
It's just a part of a whole another...

964
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,040
Okay.

965
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:29,440
Now, you're way, way out on the furthest edge of the rim there, and where the gravity

966
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,820
is about four or five times what you're used to on Earth.

967
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:37,800
Well, that's why the chocolates, the circles put on your pillow keep floating off.

968
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:38,640
I get to live in the dome.

969
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,560
You live in the dome itself?

970
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,160
Yeah.

971
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,500
Oh, man.

972
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,240
There's no gravity there.

973
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,640
You never told me that while we were playing weightless ping pong.

974
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,020
He always said you went back to the hospital.

975
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:48,780
Christ, man.

976
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,080
If I would've known that, I would've tried to get your blue card.

977
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,680
At least get some access going.

978
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,020
Only the Christ man gets access to the dome.

979
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:58,620
See the little red dome at the bottom end of the whole thing?

980
00:50:59,260 --> 00:50:59,720
Well, yeah.

981
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,400
It looks like a pimple.

982
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,560
Have you ever been down to that room?

983
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,120
It looks like a little pimple on time, on the scrofulous of time.

984
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,900
Man, that's a cool room.

985
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,300
Is it just like a...

986
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,120
Well, what does it do?

987
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,180
We'll tell you next week.

988
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:12,600
Okay.

989
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,360
It's a chamber.

990
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,340
Until then, keep your head on tight.

991
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,100
A chamber.

992
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,060
And back to the wind.

993
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,180
A chamber.

994
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,420
And your sack and sack.

995
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,660
Packed with indecent energy.

996
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:22,660


997
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:22,660


998
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,320
That's Bob's bathroom.

999
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:25,820
I'm okay.

1000
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:36,360
And here on the tour of the south-northwest eastern wing of the Alesian bathrooms of Bob,

1001
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,020
where the first excrementations take place.

1002
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,820
And you notice here, there's also a little bit of a...

1003
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:42,440
What's that?

1004
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,500
A little extra.

1005
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,200
That's it.

1006
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:44,720
Uh-oh.

1007
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,300
Hello.

1008
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,460
Come in Houston.

1009
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,640
Friends on the radio.

1010
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:52,640


1011
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:52,640


1012
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:58,780
Einstein's secret orchestra ESO Swamp Radio is half of the hour of slack, and you can

1013
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:06,760
reach them at Box 81555, Cleveland, Ohio.

1014
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:12,480
That's Box 81555, Cleve, Ohio.

1015
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,380
44181.

1016
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:22,500
Before that, uh, old, uh, media barrage number.

1017
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:22,840
Number 11.

1018
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:28,640
Lots of the old, ancient media barrage 11 stuff cut up by Byron Werner and me in Puzzling

1019
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:28,960
Evidence.

1020
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,120
We heard G. Gordon Gordon on the finals.

1021
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:35,900
Uh, Reverend Chris Lee singing from Sweeney Todd.

1022
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:41,880
And, uh, When Cometh the Saucers, the long techno cartoon barrage.

1023
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,920
That's by our friend the Bishop.

1024
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:50,380
And the really, really tight end of the world collage work and rant there was, of course,

1025
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,480
Sister Reverend Susie the Flea.

1026
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:52,480


1027
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:57,300
And, uh, Reverend Lucy from Bob's Slack Time Fun House on WREK Atlanta.

1028
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,020
And I should thank all of the stations, friends.

1029
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,220
This is this last time that we even exist.

1030
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,880
WMUH, Ed Strange there in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

1031
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,420
Uh, WUVT in Blacksburg, Virginia.

1032
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:18,960
WEFT in Champaign, Illinois with, uh, uh, C. Mark and, uh, uh, Reverend Thalo.

1033
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,500
And, uh, let's see.

1034
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,480
We got the, some community members.

1035
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,900
We got the community station there in, uh, Dade City, Florida.

1036
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,100
And we had C. Jam, of course, in Detroit.

1037
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:32,860
And WORT in Madison where the crazy ape women live.

1038
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:37,000
And, uh, WICA, Wicca, you might say.

1039
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,400
And near Milwaukee, Reverend Yukon Jack and Aris Pagana.

1040
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:46,480
And, of course, never to forget WMPG in Portland, Maine, friends.

1041
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:50,720
Uh, WUTS in Sewanee, Tennessee.

1042
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,460
WHUS in New York.

1043
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,420
WHUS in Storrs, Connecticut.

1044
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:54,620
Goodbye forever.

1045
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,500
We're off.

1046
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:01,600
Oh, that song, Planet X-9, by the way, was by Einstein Secret Orchestra.

1047
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:10,480
And we're at www.subgenius.com or post office box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

1048
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,320
I'm staying at subgenius.com.

1049
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:13,920
Adios.

1050
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,880
We're all gonna go get ruptured now, baby!

1051
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,660
But you're gonna blister, aren't ya?

1052
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,100
You're gonna bang.

1053
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,740
You're gonna explode up.

1054
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,900
Yeah, that's right.

1055
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,500
Like a little grape.

1056
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,780
The planet's gonna go and you're gonna go on it.

1057
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:36,760
Dave.

1058
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,020
Yeah, you're gonna go on it.

1059
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:46,280
Tell them why they need to be out there at Brushwood to leave on the saucers on X-Day.

1060
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:52,460
Why they shouldn't stay at home and just lay in bed at 7 a.m. waiting for you.

1061
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:52,460


1062
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:52,620
Yeah, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom and get your ass checked.

1063
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,320
You're gonna be out there waiting for the saucers.

1064
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:59,940
Oh, if only their choices were so clear, dear RF, I understand.

1065
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:09,360
And we face not only the extremely, extremely possible possibility of a nuclear holoclast,

1066
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:17,580
we also find that on the dim horizon, not too far away, all of our, well, the civil

1067
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:22,440
liberties and rights that we know and will be taken away by a strange race of people.

1068
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:22,440


1069
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,660
They're gonna give it the arc by the light.

1070
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,660
And I don't mean to scratch them.

1071
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,100
Earthly roles may awhile later with the X-Day I think might expect us to get another

1072
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,420
ENTHER to do this with ourroclanthogen.

1073
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,260
UFO And Wow.

1074
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:51,840
When Earth ishome, and the Earth isn't, as we're doing now.

1075
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,400
The X-Day may well be Blackburn.

1076
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:52,400


1077
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,920
You are the crown of creation

1078
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,460
You are the crown of creation

1079
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,580
And you're coming all the way to the throne

1080
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,820
See the change, the very strangle

1081
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,480
In the only way it's granted

1082
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:39,300
The face of the possible

1083
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,980
Turn

1084
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,000
Royalty to the kind

1085
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,020
We cannot tolerate our minds

1086
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:13,720
And royalty to our kind

1087
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,460
Royalty to the kind

1088
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:16,560
Royalty to the kind

1089
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:45,400
We cannot tolerate our minds

1090
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:12,580
And royalty to the kind

1091
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:26,220
Royalty to the kind

1092
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:56,560
Royalty to the kind
