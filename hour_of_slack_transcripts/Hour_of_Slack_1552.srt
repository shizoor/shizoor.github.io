1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,540
You know who I'm talking about?

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,160
Yes.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,000

00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:32,900
You bet.

15
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,980
What does that mean?

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,000
Get ready, kids.

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,700
Hold on to your hats.

18
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:48,500
We're about to go to Radio Synesthesia with your host, Dr. Sinister.

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,480
Ooh, he's scary.

20
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,540
Yes, boys and ghouls.

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,020
Tonight's freaky feature.

22
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,800
We present Dr. Sinister and his terrible music.

23
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm scared.

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,740
I'm scared.

25
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,800
And his insane psychotic collars.

26
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,480
And his sarcastic asides.

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:19,800
You'll shiver and freak out and have acid flashbacks when you listen to the crazy music he'll be playing.

28
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,100
And the crazy collars he'll be getting.

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,100
And you can listen to it and you can see it and you can smell it and you can taste it.

30
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,020
Hello, you're on the air.

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,500
I am.

32
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,860
I'm so happy to...

33
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,580
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,600
Welcome to the program.

35
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,380
Welcome to myself.

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,100
And yes, it's a wonderful evening for spatting and chatting and barbecue and grilling.

37
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,960
I don't think I'm quite rich enough to wear spats, but...

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,380
Well, you never can tell.

39
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,560
You don't want to get snot on them, though, because immediately you're going to get a

40
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


41
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


42
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


43
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


45
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


47
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


48
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


49
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


50
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


51
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


52
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


53
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


54
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


55
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


56
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


57
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,560


58
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,800
little bit of a spat.

59
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,340
I think you're doing a 1920s rich boy thing and stuff.

60
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,880
And then they notice that you're just probably away from your therapy class for a moment.

61
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,000
You need to be rescued.

62
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,780
No, I do quite the opposite.

63
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,500
I turn my pockets inside out to show that I got nothing.

64
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,000
That was all the rage in 2015, according to Back to the Future.

65
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,620
And it was all the rage back in the 30s.

66
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,680
They called them Hoover flags.

67
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,400
Hoover flags.

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,980
Yeah, I mean, some people call that the elephant routine, though, too, you know?

69
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,120
Yeah.

70
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,020
Of course, what do they know about anything?

71
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,140
They're all a bunch of pretty bulls and freeloading snakes and so forth.

72
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,720
Snakes.

73
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,220
Why did it have to be snakes?

74
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,020
Culebras.

75
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,220
Culebras.

76
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,840
Culebras.

77
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:46,900
Culebras.

78
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,180
Culebras.

79
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,400
Culebras.

80
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,400


81
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,400


82
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,440
Culebras.

83
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,160
Culebras.

84
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,660
Culebras.

85
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,440
Culebras.

86
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:53,660
Culebras.

87
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:08,900
accompany members of the business school on the

88
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:08,900


89
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:08,900


90
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:08,900


91
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:08,900


92
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:08,900


93
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,700
You said, you've lost 100 pounds.

94
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:09,700


95
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:09,700


96
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:09,700


97
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:09,700


98
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:09,700


99
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:09,700


100
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:09,700


101
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:09,700


102
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,500
Gary said he's waiting for you to come none of us are strong, but you know,

103
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,440
here's this beep beep.

104
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,320
Oh, oh boy, thank God you're here.

105
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,600
Ree deda and a bunch of 훁sus.

106
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,660
아이� dear people.

107
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,360
Gee, that's what I believed back when I had, you know, foreskins in three years.

108
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,060
Oh, man, you had a foreskin for three years?

109
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:41,500
I've had one for the, well, for the past 25 years, I've had a durable reset put in by the Archduke or the Archdiocese.

110
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:48,360
Somebody thought he was very important, and I gave him the last of my remaining, my earthly goods.

111
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,160
And it seems to work. I don't know what it does, but it hasn't harmed me too much.

112
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:56,820
Yeah.

113
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:57,920
Yeah.

114
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:06,040
Well, you know, if it don't, if it doesn't hurt you, then, you know, what's the harm?

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,620
Well, it could maybe hurt you later, I think, or something. I don't know. Maybe. I don't think there's any harm to it.

116
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,060
I think people should get the inflatable scrotums.

117
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,100
And foreskins, they need on demand. I don't think people should be just...

118
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,640
You know, I oppose, I oppose inflatable, the inflatable scrotum. I oppose that.

119
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,440
The inflatable scrotum goes with a detachable penis.

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,040
Detachable penis.

121
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,420
The penis is taxable in various degrees.

122
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:44,400
Yeah, see, the thing is, it's like, I don't, I don't like the idea of my sack blowing up any bigger than it is already.

123
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,980
Yeah, that would be a hard time for...

124
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,740
And it's not very big to begin with, but let me tell you, that'd be pretty painful.

125
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:52,740
Yep.

126
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,640
I don't know if you could die from the pain, but you certainly could, you know, make a lot of noise in a parking lot trying to get out of a car.

127
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,100
Sometimes, you know, you hear the little whip, whip, whip, whip, you know, in the police.

128
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,820
At the same time, it's a hell of a strange, a Mayland's melody of odd, unusual sounds and voices.

129
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,860
I've recorded quite a few of them, but...

130
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,920
You know, I can see men trying to...

131
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,600
Artificially enlarge the size of their sack, you know, for status reasons.

132
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,220
I mean, Phil Collins sang about that once.

133
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,080
It's all been a sack of lies.

134
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:29,820
Yeah.

135
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,640
Yeah, I'd have to agree.

136
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:40,680
I don't know exactly what I'm agreeing with, but I'd certainly have to give that a kudos, a thumbs up, and a huzzah, huzzah, and a cheers.

137
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,400
Hey, careful where you're putting those thumbs up.

138
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,360
Yeah, I will.

139
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,140
I'll make sure.

140
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,220
I don't want to hurt anybody.

141
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,400
The local squirrels.

142
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,340
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.

143
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,340
That's Alabaster Cloddy.

144
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,140
That's right.

145
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,120
The man himself.

146
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,240
We got another caller on here, too.

147
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:01,980
Hello, you're on the air.

148
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,240
Yeah, well, I need to ask Dave for my foreskin back.

149
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,600
Hey, Dave, I want my foreskin back.

150
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,500
What are you going to do for me?

151
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,480
Yeah, I lost it several years ago.

152
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,980
You know what I think is going to...

153
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,720
I think I tracked you through the foreskin donation program.

154
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,180
I tell you what's even better than that, all right?

155
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,520
And I think this is the wave of the future.

156
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,360
I think we're going to start using stem cells to regrow foreskins.

157
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,620
I think this is where we're going.

158
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:33,960
Yeah.

159
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,420
We're going to use stem cells to start regrowing foreskins.

160
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,280
Yeah, well, you know, we need to grow foreskins in the whole of the law.

161
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,440
Yeah.

162
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,560
Yeah.

163
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,040
I don't believe that...

164
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,140
Supposedly, there's some kind of a religious observance around the ritual of Jesus' circumcision,

165
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,880
but I don't believe for a second that he was ever circumcised.

166
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,460
I think he was born circumcised.

167
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,240
I think he was born circumcised because, really, you can't cut anything off a perfect man.

168
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,120
And it would have just grown back on the third day anyway.

169
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,260
Yeah.

170
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,460
And it would have just grown back.

171
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,180
Back on the third day.

172
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,020
Because, you know, you had that kind of power.

173
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,480
This is the last one, though.

174
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,160
What's the last one, Joe?

175
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,480
He was born with the golden foreskin.

176
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,220
That warmer look.

177
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,700
The man with the golden foreskin.

178
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,900
Wasn't that a James Bond movie?

179
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,700
That was a great...

180
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,000
That was a 50s film more.

181
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,680
I remember that.

182
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,520
Oh, I don't actually remember it, but I remember it.

183
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,900
Yeah, the nice thing about a golden foreskin, you know, if it's made of gold instead of,

184
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,480
like, silver, it doesn't tarnish.

185
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,180
Hey, doctor, what's your real name, man?

186
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,260
My real name?

187
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
I just want to know...

188
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:47,560
I didn't know that.

189
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,060
It's Rumpelstiltskin.

190
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,540
Can you tell us this?

191
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,620
My real name is Rumpelstiltskin.

192
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,420
And he has long, golden locks, too.

193
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,280
Do you really think he's going to tell you?

194
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,220
Yeah, this is a public airwaves.

195
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,040
It is one's name or its nostril.

196
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,460
Oh, for dinner.

197
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,080
No, that's not mine.

198
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,200
From PR News in Washington, I'm outrageous.

199
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,240
President Obama has announced the administration has finished the

200
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,540
torture.

201
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,080
The administration says Obama did torture prisoners.

202
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,820
We did some things.

203
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,220
President Obama said...

204
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,220
We did a whole lot of things.

205
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,380
The CIA has been fighting PR News.

206
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,700
President Obama is calling children unworkable.

207
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,740
A spokesman for the New York City Medical Examiner says the death was caused by untaxed

208
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,040
cigarettes.

209
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,780
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is dragging PR News with New Jersey Hotel Elevator in

210
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,140
Washington.

211
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,120
See, but that leads into the whole colostomy question.

212
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,980
I don't know how that follows, but I suppose I'll go along with it if somebody nudges me

213
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,780
in the right direction.

214
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,300
I don't see...

215
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,720
Nah, that doesn't make any sense to me.

216
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,660
What, the Gumby colostomies?

217
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,280
A Gumby colostomy doesn't result in any kind of erstwhile movement in the air or the environment

218
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,600
or anything else other than the close proximity of the afflicted individual.

219
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,500
That is, if they're truly afflicted, they're not just walking around with a colostomy bag

220
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,720
baking at Walmart.

221
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,800
You know, like, trying to impress their friends.

222
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,660
You know, colostomy bags are available only by prescription because, because, you know,

223
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,420
there's a real danger with the recreational colostomy bag market out there.

224
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,760
Oh, yeah.

225
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,400
The trucker colostomy bag.

226
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,360
There needs to be plenty of legislation.

227
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,120
Yeah, isn't there a series of movies, The Human Colostomy Bag?

228
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,600
You were there.

229
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,000
And there were probably a thousand people there, but I thought there were 7,000 people

230
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,540
there because there was so much excitement.

231
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,500
And for once in my life, I found a place where I could be accepted for being me.

232
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,660
And that people loved you unconditionally, no matter who you were, no matter what you

233
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,080
looked like.

234
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,140
And everybody was going towards a common goal.

235
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,140
Everybody was excited for everybody else.

236
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,160
And all of a sudden, I felt like I was a big loving.

237
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,080
I just, I all of a sudden found a place that I felt like maybe I could grow into.

238
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,880
And of course, you know, that wasn't, you know, the beginning either.

239
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,940
It was, it's a long stretch.

240
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,520
It's a journey.

241
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,420
It's something you do every day that helps you get closer to your dream.

242
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,580
Well, Bill, I'm an admirer of Bob.

243
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,920
Does it worry you, Bob?

244
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,280
You can't let it just say.

245
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,320
I think they could take it a step beyond that.

246
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:25,600
To the bizarre, the grotesque, to intentionally mean-spirited injury of other innocent people.

247
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,180
It was, it had Bob's fingerprints all over it.

248
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,720
And he and I both would agree that Bob's not a nice person.

249
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,060
I saw him shoot Bob.

250
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,820
Ooh, friends.

251
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:53,200
Well, Dr. Sinister, when you started the show, you sounded kind of down.

252
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,960
And people were talking about.

253
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,480
You don't have to worry about me doing that.

254
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,060
I wouldn't want to draw Bob's attention to you.

255
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,300
Yeah, really, Bob's attention is the last thing I need.

256
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,060
Thank you very much.

257
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,360
No, I'm doing all right.

258
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,540
I'm doing all right.

259
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,020
Jesus isn't going to help you after all the mean things you've said about him and his fan club.

260
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,340
Right.

261
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,380
Well, the devil tunes in to all your prayers, too.

262
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:19,900
You understand?

263
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,240
I thought that people wanted Bob's attention.

264
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,240
It would bring them success in sex and business.

265
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,480
See, that's Bob's scam.

266
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,460
All right.

267
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,480
Right.

268
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,560
He is the greatest salesman who ever lived.

269
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:31,940
All right.

270
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,980
And he is selling himself to all of the Bobbies who don't.

271
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,820
You know, Bob said, give me slack or kill me.

272
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,400
Right.

273
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:39,980
Right.

274
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,400
Okay.

275
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,500
Two things.

276
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,920
Two things that come from that.

277
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,460
Naturally.

278
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:43,860
All right.

279
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,180
First of all, we know that Bob is the living avatar.

280
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:46,620
He is the living avatar of slack.

281
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,100
He is literally saturated with slack.

282
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,640
You cannot give slack to Bob.

283
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,460
He already has as much slack as anyone can have.

284
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,420
Am I right or am I right?

285
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:57,460
All right.

286
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,820
And if you kill Bob.

287
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,580
If Bob is ovulating.

288
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,940
So we have to kill Bob.

289
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,540
A different kind of temperance going.

290
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,760
So we have to kill Bob, but you know, he comes back.

291
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,400
He just keeps coming back for more.

292
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,100
Yeah.

293
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,340
Jesus only died and came back from the dead once.

294
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,680
But Bob, we lost count of that a long time ago.

295
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,820
Well, I guess a lot of people.

296
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:17,900
Yeah.

297
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,200
It actually got kind of boring.

298
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:19,860
Yeah.

299
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,420
Watching Bob die actually got to the point where it was a little bit boring.

300
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,100
Yeah.

301
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,580
I really just, I've lost my appetite for killing Bob and I've immolated him myself a couple

302
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:32,940
of times.

303
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,560
He does smell good.

304
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:34,960
He's burning.

305
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,560
He's at last.

306
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,500
By the way, guys, did you tell me that Bob's followers are called Bobbies?

307
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,160
Well, a Bobby is not necessarily.

308
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,480
I mean, there are followers of Bob and there are Bobbies.

309
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,600
Okay.

310
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:52,560
Does this mean that, uh, that, that the, uh, uh, subvenient church has infiltrated the

311
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,580
British police force?

312
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,520
As a matter of fact, yes.

313
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,080
Like the Bobbies and stuff.

314
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,140
Yeah.

315
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,180
That's the constables.

316
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,380
Instead of automatic weapons.

317
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:08,160
No, it's the English police force or people who joined the church of the subgenius.

318
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,000
They think they get it, but, uh, all they really do is just repeat the same tired old

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,580
slogans over and over again.

320
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:15,980
And yeah,

321
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,360
that's why we, that's why everybody calls them Bobbies.

322
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,180
Well, you know why we repeat the same tired old slogans over and over again?

323
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,020
I'll tell you why we can bore so many people simultaneously and then they can talk about

324
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,180
it.

325
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,640
We're good to take facts and stuff.

326
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,720
We're waiting for you, Reverend Stang.

327
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,640
We're waiting for you to write some new slogans for us to repeat.

328
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,380
That's why we're repeating the same old slogans.

329
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,280
Oh, wait a minute.

330
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:40,760
Hold on.

331
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,800
Let me go get my notes.

332
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,180
All right.

333
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,240
There, there are some good ones.

334
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,940
He's got the claw.

335
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,300
Okay.

336
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,600
Here's, here's one for you.

337
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,720
Uh, Bob loves the sin, but hates the center.

338
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,960
I can get behind that.

339
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,500
Your rights end where Bob's fist begins.

340
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:08,440
Actually, both of those were channeled through tighter Gumfries, but this is Dr.

341
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,700
Legame.

342
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,640
This is a very recent one from Dr.

343
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,660
Katan Legame.

344
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,840
And I'm going to have to paraphrase.

345
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,060
It slack is like screwing.

346
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,580
The more you put in, the more you pull out.

347
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,300
He's totally lost his marbles.

348
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,980
Oh, here's what, here's what I quote from Bob himself.

349
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,700
No more penis candling for me.

350
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,560
Is that like ear candling?

351
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:45,860
Is this in reference to these soul attack delusions or to the fact that there have been recent penis transplants that have worked?

352
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:51,640
Well, and I guess one of these penis transplant people is even fathering a child.

353
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,400
No, a baby is coming out of his, uh, issuance.

354
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,120
There's one more.

355
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,120
You'll like this one.

356
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,060
Uh, Dr.

357
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,600
Sinister.

358
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,000
Um, just as strongly as you believe I'm going to hell.

359
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,700
I believe you're not.

360
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,020
That's a Reverend that I've been staying quote.

361
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,960
Okay.

362
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:15,960


363
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:15,960


364
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:15,960


365
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:15,960


366
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:15,960


367
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:15,960


368
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:15,960


369
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:15,960


370
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:15,960


371
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:15,960


372
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:15,960


373
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah.

374
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,120
So yeah, I don't believe they're going to hell just because I, just because they think I'm going to hell.

375
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,340
I don't think they're going to hell.

376
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,640
Well, who needs hell when you have earth?

377
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,340
All right.

378
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,440
Hold on.

379
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,040
We're having phone line problems again.

380
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:43,780
He can say that although they think he's going to hell, he doesn't necessarily have to think they're going to hell because he doesn't necessarily believe in such a place.

381
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,760
Well, who needs hell?

382
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:58,080
When we have earth, which is about to be destroyed on July 5th, 1998 at 7 00 AM, which could be, which could be five minutes from now for all we know.

383
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,380
Three minutes from now.

384
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,160
Who needs hell when we have earth?

385
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,100
Whose name I don't remember right now.

386
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,560
Did an album called, how could hell be any worse?

387
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,140
How could who?

388
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,720
Herod?

389
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,240
I've, I can think of ways.

390
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,740
Wasn't Herod the king in Israel when Santa Claus?

391
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,140
Was born?

392
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,540
Or I don't know if it was the photopian police or somebody, but they were telling me that, um, hair, it was Herod.

393
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,260
They called him the great cheese man.

394
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,540
My, um, he was a, he was king or governor or something.

395
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,800
Not like Jeb Bush, but.

396
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,740
Well, there was the, the, the department store in London.

397
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,580
Like this, you see back in, back in, back in the old days.

398
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:40,940
Yeah.

399
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,720
And we're going back towards this now, but, uh, you know, before there was feudalism, we had, uh, another form of, you know, feudalism.

400
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,000
We had a lot of corporatism like we have right now.

401
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:53,180
And, and the Roman province of Judea was actually a subsidiary of that, uh, that department store in London.

402
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,380
Goldstein and Marx?

403
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,720
No, that's, that's Emmanuel Goldstein, the evil good guy in, uh, back to the future.

404
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,000
There's no good guy like an evil good guy.

405
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,800
That's right.

406
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,800
The do-gooder could be the death of us.

407
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,180
Yeah.

408
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,900
They've already tried numerous times.

409
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,860
I think we ought to get out the boxing gloves this time.

410
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,380
Just say, okay, do-gooders, try and do some good right now.

411
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,780
Punch it out, knock it out like a famous boxer would punch someone's head.

412
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:31,840
You know, people actually, uh, boxers, uh, actually suffer more injuries when they're wearing gloves than, uh, than in bare knuckle boxing.

413
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,320
Well, that's why the British lost the war back in 1900 when they were trying to give them opium.

414
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,480
The boxer rebellion in China?

415
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,600
Yeah.

416
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,820
They didn't want to get opium.

417
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,580
They'd rather just, you know, hang around.

418
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,860
I don't know how it happened, but I guess it was like, um, a lot of things we do nowadays.

419
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,460
We learn a lot from the British.

420
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,280
Yep.

421
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,860
The red folks are coming.

422
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,380
Yep.

423
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,560
They're coming all over everybody else.

424
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,360
It's out of disrespect.

425
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,500
I hear the drums beating slowly.

426
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,160
You hear them in the distance.

427
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,840
They're coming to ravage my town.

428
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,480
The Brits.

429
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,820
Redco.

430
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,580
Redco.

431
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:46,960
Right.

432
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,220
Well, it just sounds to me like you're taking leave of your senses.

433
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,320
Because that's what happens.

434
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,700
I check out of my senses every single time I get on the air.

435
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,580
Honestly, I feel like a bad person even for telling the stories that I've told.

436
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:09,180
What if that minister friend of mine is listening now and...

437
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,540
There you go.

438
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,160
You know, what if he thinks I was belittling his experience?

439
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,220
I certainly wasn't.

440
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,180
I'd go upstairs and lock and load and come out looking for you.

441
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,620
That's the way all those Christian Bible ministries,

442
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,280
misdrony heads are.

443
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,240
He never struck me as the violent type.

444
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,860
He never struck me as the violent type.

445
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,440
I tell you what.

446
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,180
You know, I feel...

447
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,340
I tell you what.

448
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,360
I'm going to say right now.

449
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,120
I'm going to say right now.

450
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,220
You know what I'm more afraid of?

451
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,680
I am more afraid of hurting my friends' feelings

452
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,480
than having them get angry and shoot me in the head.

453
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,440
I'm more afraid of their feelings being hurt than them killing me.

454
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,060
Well, that's what killed Buddha.

455
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,520
Well, I'll remember that next time you hurt my feelings, man.

456
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:03,120
And you will have the right to lord that over me for the rest of our days,

457
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,820
should that come to pass.

458
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,280
No, I'll prove that you were wrong.

459
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll prove that it was a dumb idea when you see that gun pointing at your face.

460
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,800
Dang, are you really going to...

461
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,580
I triple dog dare.

462
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,780
I dare you to stick a gun in my face, Reverend Stang.

463
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,640
I triple dog dare you to do that.

464
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,080
Well, yeah.

465
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,080
Well, but what if I do, man?

466
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,940
Stick a gun in your face and then go.

467
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,520
Well, so now are you more afraid of hurting my feelings?

468
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,540
Yeah, man, tell him.

469
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,920
I don't know what would happen.

470
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,320
I don't know what would happen.

471
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,900
You'd probably get like Popeye after eating spinach.

472
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,100
And you'd start beating up an old blue-toed Stang

473
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,600
with a pointed gun in his face.

474
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,160
That's the way I see it.

475
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,020
I wouldn't really shoot Dr. Sinister because then I wouldn't...

476
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,300
He wouldn't be alive to be humiliated further by being proved wrong.

477
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,120
So you have to like...

478
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,940
Because you're a Texan and you're a cowboy and you can shoot people.

479
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,480
I have to convince him, basically,

480
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:15,400
that he would much rather hurt my feelings than be shot by somebody.

481
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,360
Yeah.

482
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,820
Well, if I get shot in the head, I'd be too dead to care.

483
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,920
Right, yeah.

484
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,860
But since I'm not dead, I have to worry about how the people I care about feel.

485
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,900
Yeah, but then if you wore a nipple ring,

486
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,840
you'd be in quite some much trouble because the state law is against it now.

487
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,020
I hadn't thought about the nipple ring.

488
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,700
That's the nipple ring loophole you're referring to, Dave.

489
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,400
Yeah.

490
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,460
Well, if it's going to base your whole idea of happiness on your nipple ring,

491
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,500
then I just think that's a shallow way to go through life.

492
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,180
Hey, you got to live for something, right?

493
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,240
I mean, aren't we all hopelessly like tepid and shallow

494
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,820
and all those other words describing water?

495
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,580
What?

496
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,040
No.

497
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,360
We're not.

498
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,460
Well, maybe.

499
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,560
Just me, I guess.

500
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,720
Yeah, just saying.

501
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,920
You're a hydroelectric dam, I suppose.

502
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,640
This is my contribution to the theory

503
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,740
that science fiction is stranger than truth.

504
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,780
You know about the suppressed transmission, of course?

505
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,880
Sono i tempi moderni.

506
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,020
No? Ah, well.

507
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,140
It's the modern age.

508
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:46,940
How?

509
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,700
How?

510
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,760
Couldn't it be?

511
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,880
It's the modern age.

512
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,380
It's the modern age.

513
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,120
It's the modern age.

514
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,180
It's the modern age.

515
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:45,980
yes

516
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,840
Modern Time

517
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,960
It's the modern time!

518
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,200


519
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,140
It's the modern age!

520
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,140
Hey, let's go! Hey, let's go!

521
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,900
Let's go!

522
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,140
That thing if you want or if you want to leave it going.

523
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:16,500
That was Rural War Room, their album The Modern Age.

524
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:25,680
We would like to thank Dr. Sinister for letting us use his radio synesthesia show of December 6th on WCSB Cleveland.

525
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,540
And so we will. Thanks.

526
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,840
And thanks also to Dr. Sinister and WCSB.

527
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:37,700
For letting us also use the show of December 20th for our own purposes while we were out of town.

528
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,800
Praise Sin.

529
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,160
Hello, you're on the radio.

530
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,120
I'm on a radio?

531
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,480
You are on the radio.

532
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,600
I was on a squatting potty with my armpits in the air.

533
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,360
Well, you know, you can do both at the same time. It's possible.

534
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,960
Yeah, I enjoy doing both at the same time.

535
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,440
It's like rubbing your belly and scratching your head at the same time.

536
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,500
You know, I prefer to scratch my belly and rub my head.

537
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,420
I guess I'm just one of those people.

538
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:12,300
It's kind of like that whole divide about, you know, which way do you roll the toilet paper over or under.

539
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,400
I'm one of those guys who just prefers to rub his head and scratch his belly at the same time.

540
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,600
There's no paradigm argument.

541
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,340
It happens every semi-annually.

542
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,860
Semi-annually.

543
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,640
Semi-annually.

544
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,200
It could be.

545
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,320
You're saying anally wrong.

546
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,580
I'm wrong?

547
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,240
Nothing could be more wrong than saying it's wrong.

548
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,280
It's not wrong.

549
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,220
That's not wrong.

550
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,300
Does it?

551
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,960
Yeah, the question is, is it semi-annually or semi-annually?

552
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,500
There you go.

553
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,540
Yeah.

554
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,020
These are different things.

555
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,620
Two vastly, vastly, vastly different things.

556
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,840
I don't know different from what.

557
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,320
I mean, everything is the same to me.

558
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,340
I'm an illusionist.

559
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,540
What's the word?

560
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,680
What's that word?

561
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,520
Someone sees everything as the same.

562
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:14,040
Some have a human gland.

563
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,340
You mean the ground up glands of a pig perhaps or another animal?

564
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,980
I have a humorous.

565
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,380
I have a humorous too and I snap.

566
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,440
I have two of them actually.

567
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,420
Oh, well, I have two as well.

568
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,420
They're also known as a funny animal.

569
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,440
I have a funny bone, but it's not too funny if you smack it.

570
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,180
The funny bone is actually a nerve.

571
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,520
I know, but you know, humorous bone.

572
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:45,800
I've heard it said, and I've never been tased before, but I've heard it said that when you get tased, it's like your entire body had its funny bone hit.

573
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,720
That's what I've heard.

574
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:58,560
And you also urinate fabricatiously, quite, you undulate like a little, like a pig, which is probably, you know, the basis for a vast number of conspiracy theories.

575
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,380
What?

576
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,400
Well, I don't know.

577
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,500
I don't need excuses to urinate on myself.

578
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,420
Or be conspiratorial.

579
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,140
You didn't rhyme.

580
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,920
It's one of those things I'll do just because I can.

581
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,900
I'm really looking forward to getting old.

582
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:23,140
I'm looking forward to getting to the point where I can just piss on myself and nobody will think ill of it.

583
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,500
That's because nobody will be around you.

584
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,140
See, that's the great thing about getting old.

585
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,540
You know, because, you know, the sack gets real long and there's a divot on the front.

586
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:39,140
So when the little thing shrivels up and you get fat, so you end up pissing on your own sack.

587
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,940
But it's almost like a little water slide.

588
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,800
So it goes right out and ejects instead of dribbling down your knees like when you're young.

589
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,020
Wow.

590
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,980
And then, you know, to really impress the old lady because nothing turns her off.

591
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,920
Like, you know, showing her, you know, flapping it back and forth.

592
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,300
But you're doing the, you know, the big bend bell with the nuts.

593
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,940
It's great.

594
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,800
That's fascinating.

595
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,520
You know what?

596
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,620
There's one more person who wants to join our conversation here.

597
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,140
And again, that number is 216.

598
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,660
I got to get going anyways.

599
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,440
I got screaming little brats.

600
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,840
You guys have a great night.

601
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,900
It's been a pleasure.

602
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,200
And annually, not annually.

603
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,400
Stop pronouncing it wrong.

604
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,080
Have a great night.

605
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,660
Thank you.

606
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,500
I love you guys.

607
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:21,840
Bye.

608
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,060
No, no.

609
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,100
Hello, you are on the air.

610
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,300
It's been a long time.

611
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:28,900
What?

612
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,140
Huh?

613
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,060
Oh.

614
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:30,900
It's Daniel.

615
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,180
You're on the air.

616
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,860
Hey, I can rub my belly and slap Dave's head at the same time.

617
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,700
That's a valuable skill.

618
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:44,340
I can slap your mammy ten times and disagree with everything about you that you just said.

619
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,220
I can rub your belly and slap my mammy ten times at the same time.

620
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:57,360
I can rub the Buddha's belly, slap your mammy, and sing 20 songs before you get up in the morning.

621
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,400
I can belly.

622
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,080
I can build a wall between you and Canada and make you pay for it.

623
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:12,220
I can trump that one by saying I can build a wall between universes and stop the interdimensional creatures from bugging my thighs.

624
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,340
See, I'm going to come right out and say that I am not capable of building a wall at all.

625
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,940
I just, I lack the practical skills.

626
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,380
Have you tried Minecraft?

627
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,720
I have not tried Minecraft.

628
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,380
In Minecraft.

629
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,520
Yeah.

630
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,400
Isn't that just like...

631
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,940
It's like basically digital Legos.

632
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,100
Kind of, yeah.

633
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,880
Yeah, it is, but it's faster.

634
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,500
That's what kids seem to want this year, are Legos and fascist doctors.

635
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,300
Are you going to spew back when you're questioned by the...

636
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,360
Wait, you said they're fascist?

637
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,080
You said they're fascist Legos?

638
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,080
No, I said...

639
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,220
No, I didn't say that they're...

640
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,320
I was talking to Stan.

641
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,380
That's what the kids want for Christmas is Legos, blocks, and fascists.

642
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:00,820
I'll show you something.

643
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,320
At least the trains will run on time.

644
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,260
The little teeny tiny...

645
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,000
Look like little bridge trains.

646
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,680
That's what just got him some Soviet blocks.

647
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,200
No, that's just...

648
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:20,260
Sorry, it's all I got tonight.

649
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,360
It's not even your show.

650
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:23,940
You're doing...

651
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,780
You're already serving above and beyond the call of duty, Keith.

652
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,980
You got to do what you got to do.

653
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,040
Well, I haven't come in and done a show in a month and a half.

654
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,200
Well, you have a legitimate reason.

655
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,500
Well, I've been running around the building.

656
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,780
I've been locked out for the last month.

657
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:49,140
See, Stan, you have a legitimate reason for having not done a show in the last month.

658
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:56,980
I have no legitimate reason for having done a show in the last month and a half.

659
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,560
Well, that's not true.

660
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,980
You did wonderful shows.

661
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,720
The ones that I called in on, those were fabulous.

662
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,780
Or at least I've been called that.

663
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,300
That's just your narcissism talking.

664
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,240
Oh, darn it.

665
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:09,660
Oh.

666
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,980
What does a Greek mythological character have to do with this?

667
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,760
From PR News in Washington, I'm under investigation.

668
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,340
The Jongrong Company makes clouds of electroplated combustible dust.

669
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,660
Scorched and shredded, not far from PR News.

670
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,020
Residents of Toledo, Ohio, are being harmful.

671
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,960
Palestinian Health Ministry says showers and baths are fine,

672
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:37,040
but residents cannot blast fires in sparsely populated Central America.

673
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:42,020
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says this is PR News from Washington.

674
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,380
That's quite a voluminous lack of information right there.

675
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,140
Sorry.

676
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:56,780
I drove by our local big creationist museum today and it wasn't open on a Sunday.

677
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,040
You'd think on Sunday the creationist museum.

678
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,440
It would be open, but nay.

679
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,120
Well, yeah, you've got to go to churches and hear that story there.

680
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,200
So we went to the dinosaur park instead.

681
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:17,540
But, you know, they're not going to save any souls if they're not going to open their frog museum on Sundays

682
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,860
when everybody's most gullible for it.

683
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,500
Ah, but Trevor and Stan, you can just build a meditation mission anyway.

684
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,620
Of course not.

685
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,520
That's not what they have in mind.

686
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,600
They have in mind slavery.

687
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,180
The slavery of an entire human race.

688
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,500
Well, nobody's perfect.

689
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,880
Yeah, I just can't forgive them.

690
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,880
Just as the Lord would.

691
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,860
Remember, we all have our mistakes.

692
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,580
Like, what would Bob do or what would Doug do?

693
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,320
Bob is perfectly imperfect.

694
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:57,120
He does, every time he makes a mistake, which is continuously, he makes more money by accident.

695
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,520
Yeah, he fails upward no matter what you do.

696
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,240
Yeah.

697
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,320
Yeah.

698
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,380


699
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,380


700
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,380


701
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,380


702
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,380


703
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,380


704
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,380


705
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,380


706
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,380


707
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,820
I mean, come on, Dave.

708
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,360
You've killed Bob before, haven't you?

709
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,920
In my mind, so many times.

710
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,660
I've been part of the 82 murder, yeah.

711
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,660
I mean, how many times have you killed Bob?

712
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,740
I've made for the bullets.

713
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,520
I didn't kill him.

714
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,620
He comes back every time.

715
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,520
Not just, like...

716
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,060
He quit coming to our shows because he got fired of being shot.

717
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,580
But every time he gets shot, like, he's able to actually get money out of that.

718
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,820
Yeah, he wouldn't have gotten shot if he hadn't wanted to on some level.

719
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,420
He is kind of kinky that way.

720
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,740
What I can't understand is how he de-registers.

721
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,960
The impression of his having even been there and being shot.

722
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,520
There's never any EMS calls or police calls.

723
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,980
Nothing to back up the fact that he actually, you know, is kind of like Jesus in that way.

724
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,740
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

725
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,760
Dave, stop right there.

726
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,020
Look, he is nothing like Jesus.

727
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,120
Jesus only died and came back.

728
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,380
He only died and came back once.

729
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,700
That's...

730
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,780
There you go.

731
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,960
All right, Bob Dobbs has died and come back more times than anybody can count.

732
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,140
Well, not only that, but Bob was actually born.

733
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,940
Unlike Jesus, he was sort of, um...

734
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,440
Well...

735
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,420
Impish.

736
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,080
Whatever.

737
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,120
Whatever they...

738
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,360
Wherever they came from.

739
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:22,980
Look...

740
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,580
Everyone agrees it wasn't a normal birth.

741
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,680
And a lot of people think there wasn't any birth whatsoever.

742
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,100
Look, I've run into...

743
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,980
I've run into Bob all the time.

744
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,780
I never thought of Bob as a bird.

745
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,640
I thought he was like a...

746
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,660
Yeah, he always gets...

747
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,880
He always makes out on the insurance every time you run into him, right?

748
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,920
Oh, it's even worse than that.

749
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,720
You're insurance company has to pay him a bunch of money every time you run into Bob.

750
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,020
No, I'll tell you what.

751
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,500
No, I...

752
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,760
I encounter him...

753
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,200
On the streets all the time, okay?

754
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,100
I don't mean literally run into him.

755
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,980
But one time I went into this coffee shop.

756
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,000
And Bob was there.

757
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,560
And...

758
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,100
And...

759
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,900
You know you can't put out Bob's pipe, right?

760
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,220
You just...

761
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,700
You can't.

762
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,300
We don't know...

763
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,280
We don't know that it has ever gone out.

764
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,460
You could use...

765
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,160
You could use water.

766
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,100
You could use halon.

767
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,720
You could use whatever.

768
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,300
You're not going to be able to put out Bob's pipe.

769
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,580
It's like the ever-smoking pipe of Elminster the Sage in Forgotten Realms.

770
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,880
It's that kind of pipe.

771
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,400
It's never going to go out.

772
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:24,860
All right?

773
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,360
Yeah.

774
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,580
And we all know that it's permanently attached...

775
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,100
We all know that it's permanently attached to his mouth.

776
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,780
And I go into a coffee shop.

777
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,100
And...

778
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,540
And...

779
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,340
And there is Bob Dobbs right there.

780
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,420
With his pipe still burning.

781
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,140
And the management is telling him,

782
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,360
No, you can't smoke in here.

783
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,140
And he refuses to listen.

784
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,320
And so eventually they throw him out.

785
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,560
They throw him out.

786
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,260
And I...

787
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,500
I saw this happen once.

788
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,680
I swear to Jehovah One.

789
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,660
I actually saw this happen once.

790
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:04,140
They threw him out the front door right as a bus was coming along.

791
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,480
They literally threw him under the bus right as the bus was coming along.

792
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,400
We went out there.

793
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,220
We went out there after the bus went away.

794
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,900
And the only thing left over was the pipe.

795
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,680
It was still burning.

796
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,700
But you know what?

797
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,480
When we tried to pick it up, it just started fading away.

798
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,000
And a couple days later,

799
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:30,860
I saw Bob again.

800
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,240
Just walking down the street like any other man.

801
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,040
You can't...

802
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,340
You can kill Bob as many times as you want.

803
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,320
It all works out well for him in the end.

804
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,540
And he still had that...

805
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,120
That pipe in his mouth.

806
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,100
Man, miracles of miracles.

807
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,060
I just...

808
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,340
I don't know what this has to do with his...

809
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:48,580
...

810
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,080
...

811
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,420
...

812
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,000
...

813
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:53,920
...

814
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:53,920


815
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:53,920


816
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:53,920


817
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:53,920


818
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:53,920


819
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,020
...

820
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:54,080
...

821
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,560
...

822
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:54,640
...

823
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,100
...

824
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,120
...

825
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,120


826
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,120


827
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,120


828
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,120


829
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,120


830
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,200
...

831
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,200


832
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,200


833
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,200


834
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,200


835
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,240
...

836
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,240


837
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,240


838
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,240


839
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,240


840
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,240


841
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,360
...

842
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:56,700
...

843
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,640
...

844
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:57,640


845
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:57,640


846
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:57,640


847
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,100


848
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:00,720
...

849
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,080
...

850
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,080


851
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,080


852
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,080


853
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,080


854
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,080


855
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,080


856
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,080


857
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,080


858
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,440
It makes you want to kill him all the more.

859
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,980
Well, this is the duty of every subgenius, is to kill Bob.

860
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,000
If you see Bob, you have to kill him.

861
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,460
And this is why, all right?

862
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,380
He said...

863
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:13,720
That's what he said.

864
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,040
He said, give me slack or kill me.

865
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,160
But he's already perfectly saturated with slack.

866
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,800
You cannot possibly give him any more slack than he already has.

867
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,020
Therefore, you have to kill him.

868
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,000
Wow.

869
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:26,980
It's all right.

870
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,700
He'll be okay.

871
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,760
He'll come back.

872
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,940
He sounds like a Jesuit.

873
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,980
or something. You've got an answer

874
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,740
for everything.

875
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
I think deep

876
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,280
thoughts about these things, yes.

877
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,440
Maybe you should

878
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,840
start a new money-making show

879
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,720
called Ask Dr. Sinister.

880
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,020
Well, you

881
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,380
know what? Ask Dr. Sinister.

882
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:48,960
216-

883
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,780
5 is the number to call if you want to ask

884
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,880
Dr. Sinister any question that

885
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,960
comes to your mind. I will do my best to get you

886
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,320
an answer.

887
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,780
First, we have a new caller.

888
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,760
Hello?

889
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,160
It was one of those guys.

890
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,560
It was one of those callers.

891
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,940
One of those callers who just calls up

892
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,420
to tell me I suck and then hangs up.

893
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,980
But he keeps listening week after week

894
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,280
anyway.

895
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,640
It's kind of repetitive, though.

896
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,800
I mean, you're always saying you suck.

897
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,180
Yeah.

898
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,020
What if not everybody jumps to agree with you?

899
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,260
Just maybe

900
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,760
a small majority, but

901
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,640
I don't.

902
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,960
Just enough for Liebensraum,

903
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,380
comrade.

904
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,380
Don't you think?

905
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,300
You're welcome. Liebensraum.

906
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,160
So,

907
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,940
nobody, Mark, had a question. Go ahead, Mark.

908
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,900
Okay, how many

909
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,720
ways has Bob been killed?

910
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,080
Nobody

911
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,860
can count that. Nobody can

912
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,480
count that high.

913
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,380
The ones that we have on videotape

914
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,820
were involved

915
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:56,920
handguns.

916
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,960
But we know that that

917
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,080
is not...

918
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,960
not a complete documentation of the record

919
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,540
of the times that Bob has been killed.

920
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,760
Well, Obama probably

921
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,060
set up those handgun shootings of Bob

922
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,220
just to have an excuse to take everyone's

923
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,900
handguns away, starting in

924
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,660
1984.

925
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,880
Look how long. He still hasn't taken

926
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,200
the handguns away, which proves how incompetent

927
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,940
he must be.

928
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,540
Yeah.

929
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,020
Right.

930
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:26,020
But the handguns are just...

931
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,280
That's just one way that Bob has been killed.

932
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,080
We know that Bob...

933
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:30,860
Bob has been killed.

934
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,040
...that he's immune to.

935
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,000
What?

936
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,820
He's walked off cliffs.

937
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,680
He's stumbled into

938
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,240
volcanoes.

939
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,160
He's been thrown in front of the bus

940
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,100
out of coffee shops. You name it.

941
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,320
He's been dosed with Zyklon B.

942
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,720
I mean, like, you can...

943
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,460
You can kill Bob

944
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,120
any way that you can kill a normal human being.

945
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,920
But he'll keep

946
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,520
coming back.

947
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,420
He keeps

948
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,340
coming back for more.

949
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,380
Look at that damn tie.

950
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,920
That's my favorite right there.

951
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,800
You know, I have your

952
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,380
assassinations with cheating and so forth.

953
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,560
I mean, you just grab that old Bob tie

954
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,920
and just pull his...

955
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,920
His face turns all purple.

956
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,820
He's gasping for air, you know,

957
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,700
because he's got the pipe in his mouth, so...

958
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,200
Never mind.

959
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,900
The funniest ways

960
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,360
are when he kills himself

961
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,880
with doing things like tying his tie

962
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,280
but strangling.

963
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,080
You know, cleaning his gun,

964
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,920
shooting himself in the foot,

965
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,480
getting an infection behind, that kind of thing.

966
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,900
Yeah, I mean, it always

967
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,420
works out for him.

968
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,260
This is one of the fundamental characteristics.

969
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,040
Lighting his pipe

970
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,400
using a thermonuclear weapon.

971
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,020
Oh, I remember those days.

972
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,100
Yes, exactly.

973
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,260
These are...

974
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,560
This is one of the fundamental characteristics of Bob Dobbs

975
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,280
is that whatever

976
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,420
kind of harm you try to inflict on him,

977
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
he will survive.

978
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,460
And not only will he survive,

979
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,880
all right, he might die.

980
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,220
You might see his body be destroyed,

981
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,220
but you'll see him again another day.

982
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,860
And he'll come back stronger.

983
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,280
This is just how he is.

984
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,760
You know, that whole saying about

985
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,380
whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger?

986
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,760
With Bob, the opposite is true.

987
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,040
Whatever kills him makes him stronger.

988
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,120
What do you think Bob Dobbs

989
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,800
would have thought of the Democratic debate

990
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,260
when...

991
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,840
I think he would have...

992
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,340
He's trying to censor Bernie.

993
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,200
I think he would have found it

994
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,600
to be a great big yawn fest.

995
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,320
Because it's just a conspiracy acting

996
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,780
as it does.

997
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,460
I have another question.

998
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,140
Could he die if he wanted to?

999
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,600
Does die.

1000
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,680
It's just coming back.

1001
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,380
That's what he can't put a plug on.

1002
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,020
Okay.

1003
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,060
Could he die and stay dead

1004
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:50,880
if he wanted to?

1005
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,140
There have been cases where he died once

1006
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,480
but came back twice.

1007
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,600
Resulting in more than one Bob

1008
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,900
in one time continuum

1009
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,440
which is a problem.

1010
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,920
And usually one of them...

1011
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,920
Well, one of them has to live

1012
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,900
and one has to die again.

1013
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,700
But when you try to kill that other Bob,

1014
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,420
when you try to kill that other Bob,

1015
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,740
he keeps surviving too.

1016
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,640
This is the problem.

1017
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,700
All right?

1018
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,940
There's a huge...

1019
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,740
There's a huge...

1020
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,280
There was a situation where it got out of control

1021
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,480
and there were literally

1022
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,620
so many Bobs

1023
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,460
that they overran.

1024
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,300
They overran the whole planet

1025
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,260
and they had to reboot the entire system.

1026
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,180
Right. I mean, we have this problem

1027
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,020
of Bob continuity errors.

1028
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,460
Pretty serious ones.

1029
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,140
Yeah.

1030
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,560
You talk about a glitch in the matrix.

1031
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,460
This is like the whole matrix

1032
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,420
had been erased and replaced

1033
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,500
with a shoddy substitute.

1034
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,880
Random chaos.

1035
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,700
That's what it decides to be called.

1036
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:55,880
You mean like...

1037
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,980
It's looking more and more like that.

1038
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,760
It's like a Minecraft game every day.

1039
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,160
It just gets a little blockier

1040
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,780
and a little bit more pixely.

1041
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,060
Hmm.

1042
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,420
I don't understand the retrograde thing there,

1043
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,620
but I'm telling you for sure

1044
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,720
it's a new action.

1045
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,620
Like, think of it this way, all right?

1046
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,720
Once upon a time,

1047
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,040
there were the Cleveland Browns

1048
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,660
and then they moved to Baltimore

1049
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,680
and started wearing purple

1050
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,880
and then they won the Super Bowl.

1051
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,100
All right?

1052
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,340
And then the new Browns came back.

1053
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,800
Like, they tried to kill the Browns,

1054
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,580
but they came back.

1055
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,300
They came back from the dead,

1056
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,020
but it was just an inferior imitation.

1057
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,020
Does that really happen?

1058
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,080
I don't know enough about football games

1059
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,580
to know whether you're just exaggerating

1060
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,460
or telling the truth.

1061
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,480
I'm probably exaggerating,

1062
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,280
but I didn't say anything factually incorrect.

1063
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,040
Well, I think every now and then

1064
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,040
humor and exaggeration

1065
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,280
should be allowed on our radio shows.

1066
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,680
You know, not all the time.

1067
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,140
Yeah.

1068
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,620
This statement is a lie.

1069
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,880
This statement is a lie.

1070
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,060
This statement is a lie.

1071
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:18,820
I saw him shoot Bob.

1072
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,820
It shows what you get with a liberal agenda.

1073
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,240
You pump people full of drugs

1074
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,640
and pipe dreams of what happens.

1075
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,200
They come gunning for people like Bob.

1076
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,900
But those folks don't realize something.

1077
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,460
You can't kill the truth.

1078
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,100
Bob is not gonna be stopped by any bullet.

1079
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:31,840
He'll be back,

1080
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,760
and man, you better watch out

1081
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,160
because he's headed straight for Washington.

1082
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,900
And that's all I've got to say.

1083
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,200
Excuse me.

1084
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,600
I have to go pray.

1085
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,520
Yeah, right.

1086
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,860
His new album entitled Bob on Bob is released

1087
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,400
and debuts with a bullet

1088
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,840
at number two on the charts.

1089
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,320
Was never heard, no seen again

1090
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,220
Officially presumed is dead

1091
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,560
But the words he left behind

1092
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:02,840
Still echo through my mind

1093
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:07,280
I'm the only man who'll ever get to

1094
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,500
And come back alive

1095
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:14,420
He's the only man who'll ever get to

1096
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,700
And come back alive

1097
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,020
So...

1098
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,400
This is no joke now.

1099
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,680
Not building up to a joke.

1100
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,020
It was hot.

1101
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,320
And I knew it was going to stay hot.

1102
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,420
Terribly hot.

1103
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,480
Exactly hot.

1104
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:28,560
Exactly hot.

1105
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,660
Exactly as I had predicted.

1106
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,320
This is beautiful, ain't it?

1107
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,260
Yeah, but it's hot.

1108
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,300
Oh, we'll have a swell time here.

1109
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,260
Yeah, hot time.

1110
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,720
Just like the movies.

1111
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,260
Yeah, just like the movies.

1112
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,820
Soon me and Natasha will be right under them palm trees.

1113
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,860
Soon you and Natasha will be knocking down them palm trees.

1114
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:51,900
He's gone!

1115
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,040
He's gone!

1116
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,200
Find him!

1117
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,020
Find him!

1118
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,680
Find him!

1119
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,060
Find him!

1120
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:56,400
He's gone!

1121
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,020
He's gone!

1122
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:57,880
He's gone!

1123
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:58,620
He's gone!

1124
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:58,820
He's gone!

1125
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,220
He's gone!

1126
00:46:59,220 --> 00:46:59,240
He's gone!

1127
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,540
Come back.

1128
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,340
Where's he gone?

1129
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:07,560


1130
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:07,560


1131
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:07,560


1132
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:07,560


1133
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:07,560


1134
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,060
Oh, my God.

1135
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,940
Well, Mr. Clark.

1136
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,380
Well, I've got to run.

1137
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,560
If you don't want to be stood up if he doesn't get up,

1138
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:16,760
you're not going to do it.

1139
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,960
Well, no.

1140
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:18,960
I'm going to do it.

1141
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:18,960


1142
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:18,960


1143
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,260
You're going to be all right.

1144
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:23,760
Stubborn.

1145
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:23,780
Stubborn.

1146
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:23,780


1147
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:23,820
Stubborn.

1148
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:24,000
Don't go.

1149
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,280
or something

1150
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:24,920
and um

1151
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,260
the scene is

1152
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:28,780
an American

1153
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,200
and a Britisher

1154
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,500
and they've been

1155
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,460
discussing all afternoon

1156
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:33,120
a little juice

1157
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,680
and all the vodka

1158
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,440
and um

1159
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,260
the Britisher says

1160
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,100
I know you've hunted

1161
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:39,840
in many many

1162
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,500
sections of the world

1163
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,220
and I know

1164
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,300
that you've killed

1165
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,060
any numerous

1166
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,040
amount of animals

1167
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,920
of all types

1168
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,020
birds

1169
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:49,280
reptiles

1170
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,460
things of that nature

1171
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,680
but you have

1172
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,420
never hunted

1173
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:52,820
Bob

1174
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:53,760
in that he's

1175
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,640
the great white hunter

1176
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,180
and I think

1177
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,220
as far as I'm concerned

1178
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,700
greatest white hunter

1179
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,460
of all times

1180
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,220
yeah I'm looking

1181
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,420
forward to meeting him

1182
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,600
he better be

1183
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,560
pretty damn good

1184
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,320
I'll clue you

1185
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,760
cause I've spent

1186
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,740
a hundred thousand dollars

1187
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:10,380
coming over this

1188
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,480
god forsaken territory

1189
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,280
true I've made

1190
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,560
some foolish investments

1191
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,060
I've married

1192
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,080
three or four times

1193
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,480
one was a teenager

1194
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,260
I was really drunk

1195
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:23,740
down in the beach

1196
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:24,340
I was a big D one night

1197
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,060
married a child

1198
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,260
married a child

1199
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,480
god she was heaven

1200
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,180
oh heaven to heaven

1201
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,800
I'm looking forward

1202
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,600
to this guy

1203
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,600
I hope to god

1204
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,640
you say he's as good as he is

1205
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,240
believe me he is

1206
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,640
in fact he's coming up right now

1207
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,660
striking blue eyes

1208
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,120
and carrying a 22 short rod

1209
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,420
what the hell's he expect

1210
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:41,840
to kill with that

1211
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,160
I've only known him

1212
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,480
to be always a crack shot

1213
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,620
strange I must say

1214
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,660
going out after elephant today

1215
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,840
he'll have to be good

1216
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,300
all right won't he

1217
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,420
yeah yeah yeah

1218
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:53,720
I'm not sure

1219
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:53,720


1220
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:53,720


1221
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:53,720


1222
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:53,720


1223
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:53,720


1224
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,800
we have a friend

1225
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,160
that we don't talk about

1226
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,740
wears a black leather jacket

1227
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,460
sorta I'm the brando type

1228
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,040
oh what a friend

1229
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,300
that we don't like to talk about

1230
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,180
has black hair

1231
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,720
and a set of teeth to make him look like a pig

1232
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,380
we're just having cocktails

1233
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,540
right out here in this sun

1234
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:29,680
jungle

1235
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,240
listening to a little hi-fi

1236
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,720
pictures of home

1237
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,360
waiting for you

1238
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:36,740
Texan

1239
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,620
this is my friend and colleague

1240
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,660
out of there

1241
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,160
god almighty

1242
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,060
ah

1243
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,900
oh what a friend

1244
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,240
that we don't like to talk about

1245
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,820
I guess this doesn't seem strange to you

1246
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,020
but you should see what our friend can do

1247
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,160
he lets Satan tempt you

1248
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,140
he just lets Satan wet up his knives

1249
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,420
he lets him get the filthiest rottenest

1250
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,260
degradating rot of hell

1251
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,620
and hit you right smack with it

1252
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,700
and then he says

1253
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,380
use my word

1254
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,780
use my name

1255
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,240
use my power

1256
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:26,580

1257
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,880

1258
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,420
and a chicken tikka masala take away

1259
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,160

00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,420
and f*** is a rude word

1261
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,620
I haven't heard it from your mouth

1262
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,900
yours and Bob's

1263
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,860
yeah you heard it from him

1264
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,940
I did not hear it

1265
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:38,900
he slept with you

1266
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,300
I'm July 4th this weekend

1267
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,340

1268
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,120

1283
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,540
but I don't regret it

1284
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,300
because I love Bob and I'm happy

1285
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,800
I think it was just a matter of time before Bob came up with a song

1286
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,980
I wanna be Bob

1287
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,280
sit and smile all the time

1288
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,220
I wanna be Bob

1289
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,560

00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,840

yahoo

1326
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:31,360
I wanted you to know what radio announcers are up against

1327
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,580
feel sorry for them

1328
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,480
send in a little something

1329
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,320
whatever you can afford

1330
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,540
and now friends we have a time check

1331
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,880
and would you just fill in your own time please

1332
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,480
well my freedom was so precious

1333
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,660
I took my noxious alarm clock

1334
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:47,540
I took my sludge hammer and I painted it red white and blue

1335
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,660
because in America if you can afford it you can do it

1336
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,120
and I smashed it

1337
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,020
and it was so fun

1338
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,360

1339
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,920

and great sex

1366
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,020
a new age will dawn

1367
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,480

1368
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,940

at the church of the subgenius

1409
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,730
we're fickle and free

1410
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:04,730
and we don't make no fuss

1411
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:16,110
at the church of the subgenius

1412
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:21,550
even though you've been back two or three weeks now. Isn't that nice? Here's one. Says,

1413
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:27,510
Dear Bob, please don't pick any more winners. I'm going broke. And you bull thrower, how are

1414
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:31,350
you going to crawl out of this? That's a nice one. I like the short one. At least you get them over

1415
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:36,830
with in a hurry. Dear Bob, I had heard so much about you I was prepared to like you immediately.

1416
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:42,190
I tuned in your show and you talked me out of it. Here's another one from Springfield. Could you

1417
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:46,610
please give me the exact address in Washington, D.C. of the Bureau of Indian Affairs? I've always

1418
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:52,330
wanted to have an affair with an Indian. This from Springfield also. Dear Bob, this morning you

1419
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:56,410
advertised boys' suits for youngsters aged three to seven. You said they were trimmed with piping.

1420
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:01,190
Piping in a boy's suit? Wouldn't you think they'd be housebroken at that age? Hang in there, Robert.

1421
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:05,070
Yours truly. This letter from New Britain says, Dear Bob, I was standing in the kitchen in front

1422
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:09,150
of my radio this morning pulling my two-way stretch over my hips when you said, Are you a

1423
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:11,950
little on the fat side? What I want to know is,

1424
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:16,550
can you see out here? If so, I must dress somewhere else. Well, how's the thing? I'm

1425
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:20,510
going to say, Praise Bob. That's what I'm going to say. Praise Bob. That's all you need to say.

1426
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:26,430
If you have faith. Praise Bob. Or a face. No, kill Bob. If you have that face with the pipe.

1427
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:31,350
No, that too. Kill Bob. But that doesn't sound as good until after you've said,

1428
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:36,370
Praise Bob, so much that you've gotten sick of it. Then saying, Kill Bob, is very satisfying.

1429
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:40,450
And actually killing him, I've heard, is fine. That's what I thought was the luxurious part of

1430
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:41,630
the whole mantra right there.

1431
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:45,350
Was the fact that you start praising and you end up killing.

1432
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:50,130
And always the way it happens. Yep.

1433
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:53,030
It's basically like one of the sacraments of the church.

1434
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:57,190
Yep. It's the Frankenstein story over and over and over again.

1435
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:03,350
Did we create the monster or did the monster create us?

1436
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:11,570
That's the question of the ages. And it goes back much further than we actually think of the industrial revolution.

1437
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:12,170
And it goes back much further than we actually think of the industrial revolution.

1438
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,810
Or did we create monsters out of ourselves?

1439
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:15,270
Or did we create monsters out of ourselves?

1440
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:18,350
Yes. You have to ask the God monster about that, son.

1441
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:21,070
And he's going to lie, by definition.

1442
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:27,670
It's like asking your twin sisters on the N-Day in the passageways there.

1443
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:29,050
What would your sisters say?

1444
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:32,970
Right, exactly. Like asking your twin sisters out on a date. It's redundant.

1445
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:33,310
Yeah.

1446
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:35,370
And illegal.

1447
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:39,070
Well, some of them think it's twice as nice.

1448
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:42,170
Well, I'm sure it is. But that's why it's illegal.

1449
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:42,170


1450
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:42,170


1451
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:45,190
Because if it wasn't, everybody would be doing it.

1452
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:48,810
And then, well, you know, it'd be a trumped-up world.

1453
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:54,150
Well, it already is. So why even try?

1454
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:58,610
Why even try, indeed. You know, I ask myself the same question week after week.

1455
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:02,430
Well, mercifully, this hour of...

1456
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:08,510
Now, let's have the forest ranger dance right here in the old barn right now.

1457
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:12,090
Let's have the show right here. Get out those scripts. Let's...

1458
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,150
Just have the show right here right now.

1459
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:15,370
Well, mercifully, this...

1460
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:18,230
I've got a mustache. I've got a fake mustache. I can play the old man.

1461
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:23,650
Yeah, and you can wear a colic and stuff and be like Donald Trumpler or something like that.

1462
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:27,070
You know, do all kinds of things with historical facts and make them...

1463
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:30,790
All right, well, anyway, mercifully, this program is coming to an end here.

1464
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:33,710
Oh, thank God. Oh, Jesus Lord, praise the Lord.

1465
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:35,910
All righty.

1466
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:40,410
I knew that... I had faith that there was something good in the future, and this is it.

1467
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:41,210
Yep.

1468
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:42,430
The end of the show.

1469
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:43,910
The end of the show.

1470
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:43,910


1471
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:44,710
I knew I saw something.

1472
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:45,370
The end is near.

1473
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:46,090
I saw something in the window.

1474
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:47,630
So thanks for calling in, folks.

1475
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:50,090
Hope we'll hear from you again next time.

1476
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:50,230
Thank you, Peter.

1477
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,630
This has been Synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland. Stay tuned.

1478
00:59:55,910 --> 01:00:01,310
Thank you, Dr. Synesther, for use of show and for babysitting hours.

1479
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:09,550
And thanks, Uber Ales, to Reverend Susie the Flusie of WREK Atlanta and Bob's Slacktime Funhouse.

1480
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:11,190
Susie did the amazing job.

1481
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:14,250
The amazing Kill Bob collage we heard up in there.

1482
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:25,490
The song I Wanna Be Bob was by Little Theodore, and the song Give Thanks to Bob was by Reverend Tony Bauer.

1483
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:28,990
This has been Hour of Slack number 1552.

1484
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,810

1485
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:34,750
And praise Bob.

1486
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:41,170
When I told you to go away from that door, you knew it wasn't Bob's voice, but you checked up on him just to make sure.

1487
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,150
If Huh's Baby I diamond comforts you,

1488
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:42,130
