Hello my friend, so happy to see you again.
What do you mean by that?
I'm trying to tell you, sir, that it is very possible
that a very elite, very illegal,
and very powerful person,

and well-funded command of special agents
are operating as deep covers in this country
and around the world.
And they are operating with full termination powers.
There's a pack of wolves in the lion's den.
They're licking their chops and making their plans.
There's a flock of sheep on a nearby hill.
Ain't a knife they're going to make, they kill.
They're going to learn their lion's talk real smooth,
play the part of the rams and ewes,
dress like sheep so the flock receives them,
make those sweet little lambs believe them.
Because when the sun goes down and they'll
feed the hungry wolves with a scheme to keep,
they'll deceive the flock while the sheep doesn't sleep.
They'll pull the wool over the eyes of the sheep.
They'll pull the wool over the eyes of the sheep.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery
which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius power of the light.
Well, what does it mean?
Seems almost a message coming from space.
But behind this strange signal, there's an alien intelligence that knows all.
My efforts to expose them have been discovered,
so I, the hunter, become the hunted.
All my adult life through four presidents has been spent
in a twilight world of covert intelligence for my country.
We are the moles who cannot come in from the cold.
We call ourselves the 39 Steps, a fanciful code name.

See you next time.
Good night, goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, last June 11th, five times this year,
God has shown me we're fixing to have a racial war.
The Ku Klux, the Skid Heads, the Black Panthers, the Malcolm X,
all of these gang leaders and gang kings in these cities
is fixing to start a war in this nation.
And it's going to be quick.
He showed me they'd be in 61 in this same revival.
He showed me three heads would rise up in this country,
and this country would be split three times.
This country is fixing to be divided.
This country is fixing to go down in war.
If you can't walk it.
Nothing through this racial war and violence,
then our nation was weakened.
Duh.
We was told pot.
And our enemy took advantage of our weakness.
Came in.
Then the wolves will eat them one by one
until the evil deed is done.
These grateful, cunning, wicked hearts
can't wait until it's time.
When the sun goes down
and the
sun goes down
they'll reap
on the wolves
with a scheme to keep.
They'll receive the prize
while the shepherds will see.
They'll pull the wool over the eye with a sheath.
They'll pull the wool over the eye with a sheath.
Everybody says sex is obscene.
The only true obsession is war.
I believe only in a god
when it's stood on a dance.
Isn't that something?
Ha!
Gosh...
Bobobopop Bob!
Bop.
Bob.
Bobobop Bob pop up.
Bob.

Bobop.
They'll woo the wool over the eye of a sheath.
They'll woo the wool over the eye of a sheath.

In 1 Corinthians 6, verse 9 and 10, it says,
Surely you know that the people who do wrong will not inherit God's kingdom.
Do not be fooled.
Those who sin sexually, worship idols, take part in adultery,
those who are male prostitutes or men who have sexual relations with other men,
those who steal or greedy, get drunk, lie about others, or rob,
these people will not inherit God's kingdom.
Some people just don't understand.
Well, look, find yourself first, and I'll take you too.
Find yourself first, don't you leave your food.
We're given this gift, don't you know, the ability to understand.
Yet no one wants to understand.
We're given the ability to read.
I mean, read Nietzsche, read Thomas Mann, read Spengler, Joyce, Rimbaud.
Everything's out of whack.
People just worry about money now and deny their inner self.
Money, money, they walk through the night crowd,
protected by money, lulled by money, dulled by money.
No least single object anywhere that is not money.
Money, money everywhere, and still not enough.
And then no money, or little money, or less money, or more money.
But money, always money.
And if you have money or you don't have money, it's the money that counts.
And money makes money.
But what makes money make money?
I say, what the hell?
I gotta die into the world like the clowns.
Right, clowns?
Right.
Push!
I'm gonna die into the world like the clowns.
I'm gonna die into the world like the clowns.
I'm gonna die into the world like the clowns.
I looked and I saw a nuclear missile in New York City, in Manhattan.
Oh, at least it was only one.
This time I seen the eyeball melted in the hole.
The flesh fell off the face.
I saw, it looked like five, ten million people in Manhattan killed by this bomb.
I mean, New York City was destroyed.
I saw Washington, D.C., a missile hit it.
It was destroyed.
Cincinnati, Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis.
I saw Atlanta, Georgia, the missile hit right at the...
I saw Atlanta, Georgia, the missile hit right at the...

It's a lot of missiles.
It's a lot of missiles.
And I saw the Lord just let me have an open view of Atlanta.
I seen Atlanta didn't have all the expressways then, but I saw Atlanta had all had expressways
leading out of the cities.
Every direction Atlanta had huge expressways, interstate, leading out of the city.
And I saw folks was trying to get out of Atlanta and ever toward Birmingham.
It was a lot of missiles.
I saw the
South, toward the North, toward the West, every expressway was jammed in the traffic.
But bumper to bumper and the radiation was catching up with them.
People got out of the cars and they started running.
And their legs had fallen off.
Whoa.
They had no legs.
Their heads and their tongues would consume away, and their bodies would just burn.
While he was running, I'd see him running with half the meat,
the face just running down.
The face would be as flame, running, running.
They was caught.
They was destroyed.
I saw it hit down the railroads in Birmingham, scrap metal and steel.
I seen heads.
I seen heads.
I seen New Orleans, Louisiana hit the railroads there,
and I seen human heads, arms and legs going through the air.
She ain't got no legs.
I saw it hit Houston.
Launch that head.
San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth, Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Yeah, I'm crazy.
As a busy bug about Jesus Christ my Lord.
He's the very best thing that's ever happened to this old country.
He's the very best thing that's ever happened to this old country.

You may not want to hear what God's got to say.
You may think I'm something else, but this thing's at hand.
This thing's at the door.
We're fixing to have that racial war that's going to weaken us.
This thing's at hand.
Give him your life and you'll be crazy about Jesus like me.
I'm crazy about Jesus like me.
Because the professional pornographers and smut dealers,
I'm crazy about Jesus like me.
They're always going to lie down and just give up.
They're going to test every law of the land.
They're going to find loopholes and ways and means to push the products that they want to push.
They're going to find loopholes and ways and means to push the products that they want to push.
You've heard it said that the pendulum swings from one extreme to the other.
Many people have been saying optimistically
that we've had all the nudity, filth and smut the nation can stand
and that the pendulum is about to swing the other way.
David Wilkerson says in his book, The Scientists Of��Squad,

that he wishes that were true but he fully believes from his vision that the flood of filth
that he's seen coming is the same kind of flood spoken of by the prophet Nahum.
And in Nahum 3, chapter 3, verses 5 and 6 it says, Nahum 3, verses 5 and 6 it says,
Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will discover thy skirts upon thy
face, and I will show the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame. And I will cast
abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and I will set thee as a gazing-stock.
That doesn't sound very good.
I feel so pure, so strong, so new, Henley. You and I together, not any man or woman together.
Henley, I'm going to demand everything of you, even the impossible.
Because you encourage it. Maybe I should get down on my knees and worship you.
I'm going to undress you, vulgarize you a bit, lift up your dress.
No, Henley, not here.
I'll teach you things, humiliate you a little,
wrap your leg around me.
Ah, hmm, remarkable.
Reagan's Pollock.
I like to talk the way to say all janitors about pleasure.
Any woman in a brown uniform vacuuming a supply closet deserves to hear of how I take my pleasure.
I use products exclusively designed at the Colorado-Little-Town Institute of Technology for clean-activity.
Manufacturing personal devices of unspeakable filth since 1951.
My favorite product is this.
The corn annulator.
It gives clean-activity.
It has a literal meaning to the phrase, tear yourself anew.
I have already installed four new orifices in my body so that I may intervene so that the six creatures at once,
transfixing my body with old men of delicious sensations emanating from the depths of my brain,
is a source of pride.
Pleasure is so important.
Pleasure is so important.
And as if any human would come up to ground or arrest a crying pilot,
its chase avoid Comedy Carrot Lag will never beanten before.

sources Ul versus a pronounced general jury.
This is what the Lord has showed David,
was there to be a temporary setback for smut.
But again, the Bible seems to indicate in the last days
that the hearts and intentions of men are towards evil,
and they love pleasure more than they love God.
So things are going to continue to deteriorate.
So in page 50 in the book On the Vision by David Wilkerson,
he talks about the sin of Solomon is coming.
It's coming, it's coming, it's coming.
Oh, I feel so much better having done that.
Well, we will dip back into some slack in a moment here
after we've all kind of rearranged our clothing and that kind of stuff
and kind of popped over the waves in the background.
I'm kind of inundated with slack myself.
I feel it.
Oozing and flowing through my body.
I feel like a sponge, and I haven't really absorbed enough yet
to have a real good night.
And I'm kind of wondering if folks out there are soaking it up or what.
Are they saturated?
Well, I know that water in your ear isn't usually really good,
but if you lie down and let it run out, it's kind of a pleasurable sensation.
Yeah, almost like the trickle-down theory, but it really, really works.
Right.
So trickle-out theory, perhaps.
But one of the things that the Lord showed David Wilkerson is that
the sins of Sodom will be repeated again in our generation.
And, of course, the homosexual attacks by the Sodomite mobs
trying to molest innocent people.
If you go back into the book of Genesis and remember Abraham and Lot,
their relationship and how Lot lived in the city.
And one day the angels came to visit Lot,
and the men of the city pounded him, tried to knock down the door of his home,
trying to get in there and have relations with the angels.
And, of course, that's one of the major reasons.

The reason that God destroyed those two cities was because of their sins.
But the Lord has shown him that during our day and time
that there will be wild, roving mobs of homosexual men
that will publicly assault innocent people in parks and on the streets.
And, again, you know, when this was written back in the early 1970s,
that sounded pretty far-fetched.
Who would ever believe that things could degenerate to that point in America?
Right.
Right.




















And, again, as we look at what's going on in the national scene and the news
and radio and newspapers, this is not as far-fetched as it once seemed.
And, again, I believe that this is something the Lord showed David Wilkerson
that's going to happen, and we can see how it can be.
The groundwork is being laid for that.
Laid for that.
Laid for that.
Laid for that.
Laid for that.
Laid for that.
Now we're going to do a song for you, and it's called
Split Level Love Crime in Space.
Let's go.

And there they were
They were all about me
Large, surely moving salesmen
And mammoth middle managers
Corn-fed, beef-fed, farm-bred monuments to metabolism
Flying from dairy states to beef capitals to commodity centers
From Fond du Lac to Dubuque
Their huge briefcases stuffed with meat
Clinching beefy deals with muscular handshakes
Their faces were florid mountain rushmars
With aviators
Spectacles and sidebirds uniformly metallic
Their eyes, bovine, the size of Dutch plates
Reflected their low country ancestries
Their hands were steam shovels
Their shoes, big as our tiny neurotic New York family car
I'm not talking fat, although flesh is essential in Chicago
I'm talking big-boned, as the apologists say
I, a tiny under-Northic
New York warrior, had been injected into the enlarged heart of America
Airports like abattoirs are white
All this moving meat
These great bodies laughing, phoning, making valuable contacts
Astonished me
I was overwhelmed by the size of everything and everybody
Their huge bigness
I had to sit down
But where?
Everything I said engulfed, engulfed, engulfed!

I had to sit down, but where? Everything I said engulfed, engulfed, engulfed!
I was a baby opossum
Writhing in a tablespoon in a golden nature guide
I felt fear, tininess, and hunger
I decided the only way to become as big as the big people was to begin eating
In the Infinite Coffee Shop
My eyes struggled to take in the polyptych menu with its thousand offerings
Eggs with legs
Friendly forks and spoons marched across it
Good morning!
Barnyard suggestions!
What? I thought
Wanna meet this chicken in the hayloft in half an hour, fella?
But these were not that kind of barnyard suggestions
Here in big people land
Land to lots of wholesomeness
They were suggesting I eat the following
One
Three strips of bacon
Two pancakes
Two eggs, any style
Two sausages
Juice, toast, and coffee
Two
Six strips of bacon
Five pancakes
Four eggs, any style
Three sausages, juice, toast, and coffee
Or three
Twelve strips of bacon
Nine pancakes
Seven eggs, any style
One and a half gallons of juice
Three pounds of toast
And a bottomless pit
Which I took to be a typographical error for pot
Of coffee
Thus emptying any barnyard I could imagine of all life
Again, I was lost
I was lost















I felt I was visiting Karnak
I pleaded for half an order of toast
Eight pieces
Outside the window
Far away
Chicago was dawning
Obsidian towers
An art deco pipe organ
Sprouting from the gold prairie
Lake Michigan still dark beyond
A brachycephalic woman was seated opposite me
Biting big things
Her teeth were the size of horse teeth
She said we could see into the next state
She was eating such big things
And so quickly a wind was blowing at our table
I turned from this and peered out through the clean air
Into the next state
In the far distance I saw great shapes
Which I knew weren't mountains
But my giant Midwestern relatives
I am too small ever to visit
Now I was filled with huge toast
I crawled minuscule back through the tubes to the gate
I bought a newspaper
And my money looked puny and foreign
In the vendor's big paw
In the chairs of big people land
My feet never touched the floor
I began to open the Sun Times
But it was big
Here it wasn't even Sunday
And I was suddenly engaged in a desperate battle
With what seemed to be a colossal duvet
A mural made of incredibly stiff paper
It unfolded and unfolded
It was a whale passing by
It covered me and all my possessions
It surged over the pillar ashtray
And began to creep like fog over the gentleman next to me
Help, I said
Excuse me, what's your paper there?
He said
His tongue was the size of my dog
I was exhausted
I could do nothing but wait for my plane to be announced
I watched the big people
What is it like to move about the world
To travel free of the fears of the tiny
The fear of being crushed by all the big things
Big people make and use
Not just newspapers and barnyard suggestions and airplanes
But their big companies and their eternal truths
And the endless statistics of baseball
The airport was hugely hot with big people warmth
Warmth from the roaring heaters of their big roaring cars
From the blazing campfires of their substantial vacations
And I thought
Perhaps a few of these big people were glistening
And glowing not only from tremendous breakfasts
And the excitement and reward of business
But from their still warm, still tousled beds of large love
Now if you read the ancient Sumerian mythology on the same topic
You'll find that not to be the case at all
That the story ends up in a totally different way
I know, it's by the time it got to the Babylonians
From the Sumerians
It's totally bastardized
Like a black dog with a white streak on its forehead
And all of a sudden there's like, yeah I know
The dog with the eyeball and everything
All of a sudden, you know
Yeah, and then everybody's all of a sudden
They're worshipping three dollar bills
And George Wallace and Peanut Man
We need to get back to worshipping the bulls
That's right, the bulls
The bull of Mithras is what we need to worship
Bull cult
We need to fall down on our hands and feet
And gather around in a warm little circle
So our buttocks all touch
Very just lightly enough
We need to start putting our doors on our roofs again too
Yeah, what the hell
Because not only does that
Because that keeps the wild animals out
And it keeps the sunlight in
And just think of it
At any grand moment
You could have a grand mal seizure
And just open your roof door
And take a flying leap
And end up you know where
That's right
Yep
Out of this place in the denotations
Your little garden out there and everything
Yep
Your little, your little
Your old peyote garden
Defeat garden
Peyote garden
Yep
That's all I want is a peyote garden
That's all I want is a couple rocks with my little peyote garden
And a little, a little blue statuette
A little rock garden
Yep
A little rock got to go with it
Remember Taz
Always remove the fuzzy stuff
Off of your little peyote gardens
Yeah
Because if not
You may be saying
Yeah it's like you know
Natural cyanide or something
Yeah
FCCIA-nide
Yeah
So make sure you
Make sure you pull the fuzzy stuff
Yeah
Because you could be in for some bad transmissions
Yeah
Phew
We know about them don't we
Yeah
I remember that one time
We've been having bad transmissions for five or six years
Yep
Yep
It's going on big
Well 12 years now
It's going on 12 years
We've been transmitting
We've been ejaculating poorly
Yeah
And I always knew
And I always knew somehow
Into the Cleveland
It could lead to this
Yep
You leaving
And me too
Leave to this
Yep
We put our nothing into this town
And what did it get us
A large rawhide belt around both of his shiny testicles
So that what might happen
What
Well in a few years he might be evacuated of all his emotional problems by simply not
caring
Because you know the vets used to say out there in the wilderness you just tie a rubber
band around your forehead and your brain just it kind of dries up and goes away

Yes, Chaz, the Chasm Smith.
Before that, Reverend Gobi
talking about big people land.
She's the girl who said,
His tongue was the size of my dog.
And the music, the hate-filled,
the hateful music that we've heard on and off
is by Reagan's Polyp.
That's a band that Pope Sternodox is involved with
up in Little Rock, Arkansas.
There'll be some more Reagan's Polyp
coming up in more ways than one, no doubt.
Oh!
And you heard a little bit of
Reverend Velveteen Sly
and her psychoacoustic show,
but most of it has been a subgenius edit
by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang of
just some things we happen to catch on tape
here and there.
The great Reverend David Terrell
preaching and some anti-sex league material
from one of those rival cults.
I don't know which one.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm too full of hate this show, friends,
to talk very much.
You really, even you don't want to hear.
You really don't want to hear it.
That part of it is that I'm sick and tired
of hearing about rumors that Bobbies say
about the church, you know, on internet
and, I don't know, their little gossips to each other.
I don't care if they talk about doctrine
and their personal foolishness.
I don't care if they talk about the foolish
interpretation of doctrine.
That's no problem.
It's when they start telling stories about us personally.
God, somebody said, my friend told me that the new book
of the subgenius is going to be gender free.
I think that's, it was a letter from a woman.
She said, I think that's terrible.
I have the right to be a sexist if I want to.
We're going, yeah, yeah, you're right.
Gender free.
Yeah, now wait a minute.
Which church did you think this was?
There are sections that are perhaps, you know,

perhaps what you might call gender free for a good reason.
But then wait until you get to the Connie chapter
or the chapter on the sex.
Sounds just like this.
Epidemic, a homosexual epidemic.
It talks about a homosexual epidemic.
David says that there's only two forces that hold back
the homosexuals from completely giving themselves over
to their sin.
One is rejection by society, and two is the opposition
by the church.
So again, these two areas are coming together.
One under major attacks by the pro-homosexual forces,
trying to have laws passed, recognizing them as a minority,
acceptance into the military, so forth and so on,
trying to force acceptance by society.
Then the other area that they're attacking is in the church.
And of course, many liberal church people are coming down
the side of the homosexuals saying there's nothing wrong with it.
So as these two forces are being attacked and worn away,
then the homosexuals are coming more and more to the forefront.
And of course, David goes on to say on page 51,
he says, when society no longer rejects their sin as abnormal
and fully accepts them and encourages them in their abnormality,
when the church no longer preaches against it as sin,
then there is no longer any hindrance to the homosexual forces.
The floodgates are open.
And David says in the middle of page 51, he says,
I have seen in this vision that these two roadblocks are being swept away.
And he says,
so again, we see that, you know, 20 years ago, that was unthinkable.
But today in 1993, we can see that the floodgates are being opened
and this sin is becoming rampant upon our society.
And again, we have to understand that as Sodom and Gomorrah were judged
and destroyed, that unless America repents, unless the church wakes up,
unless we become salt to our society,
a dangerous period of time is coming upon this generation in America
and for our families.
And in the entry of these readings and the
mal conferring of Shalom on the deception of God,
welcome to the New Testimony of the New Testament.
Let us rise with a sound of prayer and Hoy!

I saw this nation during this time was disarmed.
¶¶
How many of you have heard my vision of a nation disarmed?
That disarming us now, all this is a propaganda.
This nation is making a mistake.
This nation is making a big mistake.
Our past president and this president,
I saw them cutting our defense, they disarmed us.
I saw all these army bases closed.
Then, not now, but then, I prophesied.
At that time, we were building arms.
We were building our army.
We were building defense.
But because our president breathed in a strong defense,
I was prophesied.
We were disarming this nation.
It's happening now.
Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday,
I heard, I saw a vision yesterday morning.
You get my tape last night.
You get this vision.
I saw a vision yesterday morning.
I heard a voice said the voice of the prophet
will be heard no more at all in her tongue about America.
The voice of the handmaid and the voice of the servant
will be heard no more at all in her.
Said the day of her desolation is at the door.
Said America is fallen.
America's fallen.
That's all the time we have today for Evangelist David Terrell.
We destroyed and we created the universe
and you didn't even know it was happening.
We did it while you slept.
You thought you were safe.
You thought you were in the 21st century.
Or maybe 20th.
But you were wrong.
We brought you all the way back to the Paleolithic times.
To cavemen.
To fire.
And water.
And dinosaurs.
And lots and lots of...
...paleo.
...paleo.













Blood.
Volcanoes.
And destruction.
Not on some other planet.
No.
Not in outer space.
No.
We rocketed far away and came right back.
But landed a long, long time ago.
It was so long ago before anything was ever here.
Before anything existed.
We destroyed everything.
In 20 minutes we destroyed everything that had ever been placed on this planet.
And in a couple of hours we brought it back.
It was hard.
Oh, it was very hard.
We had to learn the alphabet over again.
We had to learn colors, numbers.
We had to learn what were the basic needs of humans.
We didn't even know what the hell a human was.
All we knew is that we were alive.
Thank God.
Or thank the goddess.
We weren't even sure what existed anymore.
Now, like I said, I didn't do this all by myself.
I had some help.
I had some help from my friend.
And here's a little message that he left for you.
Gobi, this is Commander Bleepo.
What?

We just changed big time.

As we return from our mission together I think it's important that we point out a few facts.
Having defeated the forces that we defeated, it's important that we bear in mind
and go back to what the Colossal Stone made a Only option.

Fire a signal rocket.
There's Moses 1 being launched from the pod bay.
Now, Moses 1, Moses 1, this is Jesus.
All out of formation.
The light hand of Jesus on the bow.
Jesus, you've turned off your targeting computer.
And Moses from the ground inspires.
There we go.
We have commie dogs on the scope.
Commie dogs?
Yeah.
Fire commie dogs.
Carson, you will die the death of a flaming underwater torch.
You will die the death of a thousand screams.
Get that fly away from me.
A perking target.
Stay on target.
I said the fly let us fly.
I said the fly let us flee.
So they flew to the front.
My God.
They must have been carrying pamphlets.
Heaven, a picture of fulfilled desire.
And heaven.
The headline scream.
A picture of a soul unfound.
Death of 3,000 innocent men, women, children, and pets.
Oh, who cares about them?
The strange hypnotic power of the submittal's mind over matter.
Who cares about those little cults?
You're speaking of the Boston white fly epidemic, which is now a so far ancient history that no one cares.
The targeting computer is now buzzing.
That's all we need.
All I saw was heavens drop.
3-9-6.
Targeting from the side.
Using the side looking radar.
Sir, I'm afraid if we can't stop the targeting computer from malfunctioning, the automatic self-destruct may activate itself.
Boy, I hear that.
I'm ready to implode myself.
I'm coming down and coming down hard.
Don't you have any rocket fuel to help me out?
Over.
Your attention, please.
The auto self-destruct mechanism has been activated.
Looks like a direct hit right on the message center.
We now have 30 seconds till auto self-destruct.
Oh, Papa Joe Mono.
Papa Joe Mono alert.
Unfortunately, this message is 30 seconds late.
27.
25.
That was a good year.
23.
21.
We hide from the light.
You now have 18 seconds till auto self-destruct.
Now all I need is one second in my duel with you, sir.

He's determined to count down to the ultimate doom.

Yes, the birth of the universe.
Maybe it was just our solar system.
We didn't know.
All we knew is that everything was gone
and that we had just...
The place was demolished.
There was no house left.
There were smoldering ashes,
bits of twisted, disintegrated metal,
dead bodies, bones, piles of flesh everywhere.
We didn't know whose flesh it was.
We didn't know who we had killed.
We just knew we had killed them.
And we couldn't put the magic together.
We didn't have the tools.
We didn't even know what the alphabet was then.
We had to create and give rebirth to the universe.
Just the two of us.
It was the hardest thing.
Because we were dealing with such evil forces.
Oh, such evil things.
They were coming.
Or they had already arrived.
Or maybe they were there before we even got there.
And they just slowly drew off of our energy
and...
pulled themselves
up,
out of the atoms of the floor,
out of the atoms, molecules in the air,
from the dog,
drawing energy
off of every carbon-based thing.
Because that's what it was based on.
It was based on carbon.
They wanted our carbon.
That's what life is.
We had to keep on reminding ourselves.
That's what life was.
Life is based on carbon.
Carbon.
Ashes.
Volcanoes.
Oh, and those volcanoes were fierce.
But we battled them.
We did.
We had a little help from these little devil people.
Little devil dogs, actually.
They had these little dogs.

They had pointy ears and these eyes.
They glowed red.
It was the strangest thing.
But they helped us.
They saved us from the volcanoes.
Yes.
They're our friends.
We sure like those devil dogs.
Don't we?
Bleepo.
But we were confused.
Because we didn't know who we were anymore.
We were always
just like these.
Just sounds.
And we always felt for them just like us.
We're always thinking how they
stuff them with Nur Parasol or my dad,
who doesn't believe.
com Ross.
Jen Green.
Michelle Edison.
Did the devil donks take our bodies, or did they just infest our minds?
Well, we didn't know.
I looked like Gobi to Bleepo, and Bleepo looked like Gobi to me, but we weren't sure.
We didn't know whose vision was being affected.
We didn't know whose vision it was.
Was it ours?
Was it the devil donks?
Was it Bob's?
Where was Bob?
Why wasn't he helping us?
We never wanted it.
We never wanted the world to end.
We never wanted to destroy it.
We never wanted the devil donks to come, but they did.
And we couldn't find Stang.
To help us.
We thought we had destroyed even any memory of the Church of the Subgenius, and we have.
But we brought it back.
Because we are good.
We are.
And so we recreated the universe.
It was quite a simple process.
It wasn't that hard.
It just took some time.
It took some paper.
And fire.
And water.
It took...
Just a little bit of sex.
Just...
Just a little bit of sex.
Not a lot.
You don't need a lot of sex to recreate the universe.
Just the tiniest bit of sex.

As long as it's good.
That creates planets.
That creates stars and suns and hot, burning creatures.
Drifting and floating.
Free from gravity.
Coming out of us.
Coming from us.
What we created.
Out of our pores.
Out of our eyes.
Fire burning from the palms of our hands.
Fire burning from the palms of our hands.
Fighting off evil yet.
Shooting out like rays of light.

Thank you.
I Titanic you have the freedom of the universe of fear.
So, what did you do this weekend?
I bet you had a really good time.
I bet you watched some television.
Huh?
I bet you watched some sports on television.
Well, we realized the complete nonsense, nonsense of television.
We didn't even know how to operate electric lamps anymore.
What good is television if you don't know how to operate an electric lamp, you know?
You might think that I lost my voice because I, you know, destroyed the universe,
but no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
There's nothing nearly as exciting as that.
But I can tell you one thing that is exciting.
This is very, very exciting.

That's optimum lethality.
And this is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, dear friends.
And we'd like to give you a post office box number you can write to for further information on the other materials of the Church of the Subgenius.
But you don't even have to write out Church of the Subgenius or Hour of Slack or even Subgenius Foundation on that self-addressed stomped envelope.
But just stomped envelope, that's right.
Just write that to Bob at post office box 140306 in lovely Dallas, Texas.
405-214.
I'll give you that number again in a minute.
Our special guests this evening have been Little Reverend Gobi talking about the end and rebirth of the universe.
Reagan's Polyp, our special musical and medical guest.
And various real idiots.
And that's box 140306.
Dallas, Texas.

Praise Bob.
Not so fast, slow and easy.
Not so fast, slow and easy.
Not so fast, slow and easy.
Not so fast, slow and easy.
Not so fast, slow and easy.
Because it's pretty clear about what God says is going to happen to people who pervert themselves in this way.
But the main thing that we need to remember is that...
You can have freedom through this.
That God is an all-powerful God.
And he can deal with that.
And he can forgive you for that if you ask for forgiveness.
And it's a powerful addiction.
Somewhat like drugs, I would guess.
But there's a demonic influence there.
And again, Jesus said that he came to set the captives free.
And so people that walk in that lifestyle...
Despite the claims that it may be...
Hereditary or caused by genes or something of that effect...
That's simply not true.
And Jesus can set you free.
Right now we're going to take a call from one of our listeners.
Mary from Irving.
Go ahead, Mary.
Yes.
It just sickens me that they are talking about the expense of health care so badly.
But they don't do anything to change it.
You know, they're condoning this homosexuality.
And all this stuff going around.
And all this bugger on TVs and stuff that our kids are exposed to.
And that men wind up molesting children and everything.
Why don't they change some laws and stop all this filth?
So that we can have a better life for our children.
Okay.
That's true, Mary.
Thank you for your call.
And then we'll talk to you.
Address that issue, okay?
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That's true.
One of the major problems with the Clinton health care plan coming up is how to deal with these epidemics.
And, of course, with AIDS breaking out and spreading to not just the homosexual community but the drug users.
But it's also becoming one of the fastest spreading forms of venereal disease like syphilis or gonorrhea.
And they're saying that within the next few years that the major spread of AIDS will be through health.
But being a society is going to have to lay down some fundamental while people are stuck in this level of pandemics and the efforts of the government are.
And as we get back to the talk on white-white setups and how to get people out to work, I just want to point out that there is a little bit of�만
in the White House that's kind of the forewarned that let's not
but that's what our laws are going to be working for is to allow a lot of people to be, values, all fighters,
ビъьтіcьынëєло.
the word we've got to no longer be lukewarm or play it safe we've got to go
into the to the society and take up the cross of Jesus Christ and preach it and
teach it and stand for it and confront people with their sins and pray for God
to pour our revival short of that there's really no hope for America
so let me tell you now
I am
