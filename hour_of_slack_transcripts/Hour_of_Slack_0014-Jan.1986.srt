1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Well, that about wraps it up for the American Music Party this week.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,120
I'm Robert Wisdom, and you've been listening to the American Music Party,

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,360
blues from the 80s.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,060
I'd like to leave you with these words from the immortal,

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,800
mad lad, Reuben T. Washington.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,080
Good blues to you where I'll doggone you.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:20,600
Yeah.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,640
Oh, praise Bob, dear friends.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:34,200
Yes, well, folks, I'm afraid you'll have to say goodnight to the good music

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,780
for a little while, for the next hour anyway.

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,700
Probably for a while, because Norm comes in after us,

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,580
and he hadn't been playing a whole lot of music.

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,120
This is the subgenius family hour tonight, folks.

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:56,460
Yes, tonight, as not promised, is the subgenius hour of slack sounding.

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,720
It's the sound effects special, The Kids Show,

16
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,320
starring Negative Land and that great adventure team,

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,540
Captain Sun, Sunson, and Daddy.

18
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,920
So, go wake up your kids.

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,580
Or you can tape this thing, but if you do, get it in stereo.

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,760
And use headphones.

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,580
This is the headphones show, the headphones show.

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,020
Before I go on, I hope these machines work.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,400
Before I go on,

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,400
I must publicly thank the Smith Zombies.

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,820
There were a number of Smith Zombies in the industrial laboratory

26
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,480
all night tonight,

27
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,560
putting stamps on little pamphlets that are going to China this time.

28
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,200
Subgenius pamphlets.

29
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,060
We'll give our address at the end of the broadcast

30
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,560
where you can write for one of these

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,720
heartbreaking and blessing new pamphlets.

32
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,980
But, by the way, for those who've asked,

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,620
we've been getting letters from as far away as Nebraska,

34
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,240
seriously.

35
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,040
I don't know how they get this show up there,

36
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,660
but they do, somehow.

37
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,120
They've been wondering, where's Buck?

38
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,820
And Buck is not off the show, but he was off of this city,

39
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,000
if not this planet.

40
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,920
I don't think he wants to be a host, though.

41
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,820
He said he just mainly wanted to be a guest.

42
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,140
He has to go to work in the morning.

43
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,740
I'm sure he's tired of me and all my tape decks doing all the talking.

44
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,380
But, I've got seniority.

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,440
Hehehe.

46
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,180
And more tape decks.

47
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,760
And he does.

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,520
And, well, everybody in the Subgenius church is mad at me now,

49
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,360
so I had to get a new co-host for the show.

50
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,640
He's only six years old, so we had to change the format just a little.

51
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,260
Let's see if we can get cassette number two going here.

52
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,920
What's up, Sandy?

53
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,060
Tell them this is KNON 90.9 FM.

54
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,040
This is the new co-host.

55
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,420
This is KNON 90.9 FM.

56
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,060
FM.

57
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,720
FM.

58
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,240
In Dallas, Texas.

59
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,060
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

62
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,300
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

63
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,160
I am Buck Nuggets!

64
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,880
No troubles.

65
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,820
Hey, man.

66
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,460
The corny.

67
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,220
Everything is perfect.

68
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:24,220


69
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:24,220

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:24,220

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:24,220


88
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:34,160
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the moon.

89
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,680
Stop right there.

90
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,140
Intensifying our prospects' desires, that's when the wheels of action begin to move.

91
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,900
Sorry for jumping in, doctors. Go on.

92
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,680
Dr. Dobbs is known worldwide as a foremost spokesman for Christian and family values.

93
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,160
He's a plan to attend this rare personal appearance of Dr. Dobbs to second in the past four years.

94
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,980
Even if you never intend to write your name again, one sure way to impress folks is to stay a little bit over their heads.

95
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,160
Because it was better than looking stupid.

96
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,840
It's natural that we followed the circle around and around and around.

97
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,160
Helping to create a nice round world of confusion and misunderstanding.

98
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,380
Resist the temptation to feed your ego.

99
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:34,140
Well, we take our initiates and we string a little tendon between their heels and drag them three times around the radio station before beginning.

100
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,000
Then we dip them in the sacred waters of the sludge.

101
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,240
And what exactly does this do for them?

102
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:47,940
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned and prepares their mind for the slate-like impression, the imprinting of the true subgenius.

103
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,660
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour.

104
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,740
Hour of Slut.

105
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,380
Slut.

106
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,120
Slut.

107
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,960
Slut.

108
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,040
Slut.

109
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,460
Slut.

110
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,580
Slut.

111
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:00,680
Slut.

112
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:01,980
Slut.

113
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,220
Slut.

114
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:03,640
Slut.

115
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,080
Slut.

116
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:04,740
Slut.

117
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,040
Slut.

118
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,140
Slut.

119
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:05,720


120
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,260
Slut.

121
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,920
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

122
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,540
Every time you say, see, hear, or think...

123
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,400
That's your key phrase.

124
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,120
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

125
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Repent. Quit your job. Slack off.

126
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,500
Ah, yes, dear friends.

127
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,660
Well, for once, I took my own advice, which is rare for a subgenius preacher, especially me.

128
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,140
I did repent, quit my job, and slack off.

129
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,100
I actually did that this weekend.

130
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,400
As for not taking my own advice, usually, as Bob Dobbs himself said,

131
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,900
I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

132
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,480
This line from Prescriptures is, in fact, one of the foundation stones of the Church of the Subgenius.

133
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,380
Hypocrisy is the sandy beach upon which our church is built.

134
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,240
And other churches may be built upon a rock, steadfast and true,

135
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:34,320
but ours changes with the tides, scurrying in and out of holes like a crab,

136
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:41,580
occasionally pinching innocent bathers, and finally, in the end, getting skewered by kids with sticks.

137
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,080
But, uh, it's true.

138
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,760
Oh, sire, there is no more money?

139
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,320
Yeah, that's right.

140
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,560
Get some money!

141
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,440
I did repent, quit my job, and slack off.

142
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,300
I didn't really have a job to begin with before I quit it.

143
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,520
I quit before it started, and you can't beat that.

144
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,720
So I've been slacking off, and pretty soon I'm going to have to get a job.

145
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,360
One that doesn't last long, I hope.

146
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,240
I only last about as long as it takes to get a ten-minute film to the lab,

147
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,000
and then I just run out of gas until you put another quarter in.

148
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,900
So, uh, if you need, friends, uh,

149
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,280
a freelance film or videotape cutter,

150
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,320
a clay animator, weird comedy show producer, magazine editor, business writer, babysitter, baby sacrificer,

151
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,580
or a true, ordained mad prophet of the airwaves,

152
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,220
or, or just an all-around cool guy, friends,

153
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,840
just write me at the Church of the Subgenius or this affiliate station, which we own.

154
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,400
And, uh, no jobs on spec.

155
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,240
Um, my, my.

156
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,820
If, friends, if I don't get a job pretty soon,

157
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:55,900
uh, I'm going to have to start cashing in all those souls that are stacking up around the church headquarters.

158
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,780
We, we store the souls of those who send a dollar to the church in handsome blue cylinders in the tabernacle basement.

159
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:10,560
We keep these souls on ice until such time as they can be liberated from this earthly plane.

160
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,900
But if the church goes broke, friends, why, we have to cash in some of those souls, and one of them might be yours.

161
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,320
So,

162
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,680
neither will, you or us can get them back after that.

163
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,140
I don't know where they go after Bob sells them, and I don't ask.

164
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,960
So, you can tell by the way I'm talking that I'd be a dedicated worker in whatever job you want, might want to give me.

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,120
It's,

166
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,820
I love having a show.

167
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,340
It's great.

168
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,680
You can use your own religious broadcast for job hunting.

169
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,800
Oh, yes, but it's better than using the telephone, because I get to do all the talking.

170
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,440
Praise Bob.

171
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,980
Oh, yes, help me somebody.

172
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,640
Ain't got no leg, my legs are on fire.

173
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,360
Pull the lever down.

174
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,600
You go.

176
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,260
Well, friends, on with the show.

177
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:04,200
It's a good thing that this entire show is composed of one tape and one negative land record, because one of these tape decks does not work tonight.

178
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:04,860
Thank you.

179
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:15,920
Driven to the brink of false sanity by the conspiracy's false reality and the pressure of a crumbling world?

180
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,340
Then this may be for you.

181
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
Eternal Salvation.

182
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,320
Eternal Salvation.

183
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,380
Or triple your money back.

184
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,720
Triple your money back.

185
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,200
The Church of the Subgenius.

186
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,500
Bring you another 33 minutes of condensed,

187
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:44,800
uraglic functions over the quality audio visual techniques.

188
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,900
Wow.

189
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,560
Exacerbated and complicated by The Church of the Subgenius.

00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,920
Copyright 1985, 86.

191
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,080
Oh, Dr. Svoboda.

192
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,100
Let's do this.

193
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,580
My name is Reverend Ivan Stang.

194
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:24,840
I am the last sole survivor of the Battle of Dobstown, popularly called Bob's Last Stand.

195
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:36,200
I knowed J.R. Bob Dobbs for what he was, and I knowed the subgeniuses for what they was.

196
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,100
Turn that thing on.

197
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
Put on them headphones.

198
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:52,780
One hundred and eleven years ago, when I was 33 years old, right after the atomic wars,

199
00:10:53,180 --> 00:11:00,300
my church was rubbed out by a band of wild pink boys.

200
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,960
Only ones left were my son and me.

201
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,420
My son, Captain Bob.

202
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,320
Captain, son, son, son.

203
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:24,860
Well, they say the monsters have come back to this, to the lost land of Palenka, dear.

204
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,280
Is the spaceship locked?

205
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,060
Oh, there it is.

206
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,360
Drop your life support system in there.

207
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,400
We won't be needing it.

208
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,820
It's too dangerous.

209
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,420
The show won't be in danger.

210
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,880
Unless the monsters get the tape.

211
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,120
Maybe we could stop the monsters.

212
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,540
You think we could use the show to stop the monsters?

213
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,100
Yeah.

214
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,260
If it sounded bad enough, even the monsters would flee.

215
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,480
And the land would again be safe.

216
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,020
For the free.

217
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,440
Friends, we're walking out of the laboratories.

218
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,040
Out of...

219
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,940
I don't want to go in any direction that ink will be coming from.

220
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,460
Uh-uh.

221
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,980
We've got to avoid ink.

222
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,900
And the Yaka Teasman.

223
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,000
We're going to have to fight a lot of monsters on this show tonight.

224
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,760
Right now, we're not live.

225
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,860
This is in the daytime.

226
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:38,240
And now that we're away from the encampment and the laboratories,

227
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:46,980
there are bones of creatures, Martian goats and things that have been killed by the Cyclops

228
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,900
and by other nefarious monsters around here.

229
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,300
What?

230
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,080
What could have done that?

231
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,960
Nothing could have been living in there.

232
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,000
Something could be living in there now.

233
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,080
It's a telephone.

234
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,660
Stick a torch.

235
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,960
Okay.

236
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,220
We're going to have to get out of here.

237
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:08,220


238
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,600
Come on.

239
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:10,960
Look!

240
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,580
Look!

241
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,700
Look at what's running out!

242
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,400
Crab creatures!

243
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,780
Grab a weapon!

244
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,220
Crab creatures are coming!

245
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:17,660
Hey!

246
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,540
Don't forget the show!

247
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:18,940
Come on!

248
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,580
Grab it!

249
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,620
You stopped them for a second.

250
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,440
They're still coming though.

251
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,700
We've got to do something else.

252
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,220
Turn on the radio!

253
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:28,940
Huh?

254
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,760
Turn on the radio!

255
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,620
Okay, that'll do it.

256
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,400
We'll turn on the radio.

257
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,480
I can't get it to come on.

258
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,720
You do it.

259
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:36,620
Okay.

260
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,780
Now, what's the button?

261
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,200
It's a button.

262
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,200


263
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,200


264
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,200


265
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,200


266
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,200


267
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,200


268
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,660
It's that one.

269
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,120
Which one?

270
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,760
Um, that one.

271
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,000
This one?

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,060
Yeah.

273
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,620
You got it!

274
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:45,780
Okay.

275
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,680
Got him?

276
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,400
Oh no, it only wounded him!

277
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,280
Here he comes!

278
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:55,960
Quick!

279
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,880
Quick, Grim!

280
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,220
Here!

281
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,540
I think I got him.

282
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,760
He's down.

283
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,940
He's still breathing though.

284
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,200
I hope this isn't an endangered species.

285
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,200


286
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,200


287
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,200


288
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,200


289
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,200


290
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,200


291
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,200


292
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,200


293
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,200


294
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,200


295
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,200


296
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,200


297
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,200


298
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,240
Let's keep throwing rocks at it!

299
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,960
Got him right in the hole.

300
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
Let's throw the show at it!

301
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,660
Ooh!

302
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,140
Ooh!

303
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,760
The show got something gross all over my hand!

304
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,640
Ooh!

305
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,700
Get away from it!

306
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,200
Get away from it!

307
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,060
It's gonna explode!

308
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,500
Okay, now.

309
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,640
Did you fix the show?

310
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,200
Let's go.

311
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


312
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


313
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


314
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


315
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


316
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


317
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


318
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


319
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


320
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


321
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


322
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


323
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


324
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


325
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


326
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


327
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


328
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,380
Alright.

329
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,420
Listen, I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to do something.

330
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,140
Here's me array gun!

331
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,360
Oh, do I know what to...

332
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,880
The show needs new batteries!

333
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,580
Yeah.

334
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,440
Okay, look.

335
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,440
I brought some with me.

336
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,180
Let's kill it and try to get some new batteries.

337
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,900
Won't be any air for a while folks, so just hang on.

338
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,580
I see a gas mask.

339
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:03,860
Where?

340
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,860
A gas mask?

341
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,200
Maybe you should have a gas mask.

342
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,200


343
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,280
Maybe that was the rescue colony that came out here.

344
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,560
It might be a pink...

345
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,060
This pink sky here just...

346
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,220
I can't believe it.

347
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,700
It's like...

348
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,660
Remember Mars?

349
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,340
Ooh!

350
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,040
It's got a face, eyes, another eye, and a nose.

351
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,860
Yeah, that's not a gas mask.

352
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,800
That's a skull!

353
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,240
But of what?

354
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,120
Look under it.

355
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,840
Okay, stand back.

356
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,320
Because one of those ramphorhynchuses might be under me.

357
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,720
Oh, it's okay.

358
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,180
It's okay.

359
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,200


360
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,120
Okay, you guys ready?

361
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,120


362
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,120


363
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,120


364
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,120


365
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,120


366
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,120


367
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,120


368
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,780
I'm going to find the Gaius Gudus.

369
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,840
This is probably A.

370
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,160
I don't...

371
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,980
I don't want to find the Gaius Gudus.

372
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,980
Captain Zandy here has...

373
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:55,500
His face is scarred from an attack by a Gaius Gudus on the way into the laboratory earlier

374
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:55,940
today.

375
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,100
We're gonna need...

376
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,480
That's a good weapon right there.

377
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,040
The ground is littered with weapons and...

378
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,120
and bones from the many, many battles that have been...

379
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,180
What are they used for?

380
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:14,180
fought between the subgenius colonies and the creatures that live on this planet.

381
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:24,380
You know the amazing thing about this thing is... I heard something answer you.

382
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,280
God, your face looks cool with that scar. You look like the old G.I. Joes.

383
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,860
The old G.I. Joes, the tall ones, you know, about a foot long, they all had a scar in the same place.

384
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:49,420
Like every one of those guys had to go through this initiation rite where they were scarred so they'd all look alike.

385
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,340
Even the ones with beards.

386
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,760
Go down in there.

387
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,820
Yeah, you bet I still got this hook. This thing could save our lives.

388
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,840
Hey, this is a tree, isn't it?

389
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:08,220
Oh, it's got me! It's got me! What is it? What is it? Hook him! Hook him!

390
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,960
Oh, it's got me!

391
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,160
Oh, you got me!

392
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,660
You're gonna have to do the rest of the show yourself.

393
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,540
Here. Here.

394
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,180
Quick.

395
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,120
Quick, the show.

396
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,800
This is K-N-O-N 90.90.N.

397
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,720
FM.

398
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,480
And that's Texas.

399
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,420
Raise Bob!

400
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,460
This has been the Subgenius News Hour.

401
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:50,860
Brought to you in part by the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer Launcher Society, Dobbs Co.

402
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,360
Insects are around.

403
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
And Yucca Teesmovision.

404
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:04,820
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

405
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,400
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

406
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,640
More.

407
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,440
More.

408
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:16,900
More.

409
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,240
More.

410
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:18,520


411
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,940
I'm going to get you a drink.

412
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,480
Oh, yes, dear friends.

413
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,620
Let your body be sucked out of your ears by the sound effects of Bob.

414
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,780
We're going to take you deeper and deeper inside yourself to find Bob.

415
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,240
Come with me.

416
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,040
That's right, inside.

417
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,500
Into your brain.

418
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:48,500


419
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:48,500


420
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:48,500


421
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,420
Into your consciousness.

422
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,560
It's slippery.

423
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,620
It's wet.

424
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:59,340
But we shall go deeper and deeper and deeper into the consciousness.

425
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,980
And let's bore down into the cranium.

426
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,480
Drill out and drill through the irrelevant thoughts of job and reality.

427
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,360
Rolling along the hollowed out inside of the skull.

428
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,700
Piercing the squamous epithelium.

429
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,860
Tickling past the supernumerary nipple.

430
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,280
Scraping along the edges of the birth canal.

431
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,260
Stretching the imagination gland until it pops.

432
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:39,420
And finally, bursting through the perineum.

433
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:45,760
Until finally getting into the bottom of the brain pan.

434
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,360
And tumbling down through the sinuses.

435
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,520
Down the esophagus.

436
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,320
And finally landing at the very soul.

437
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,900
Located in the foot gland.

438
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,680
At the very, the very lowest organ of your physical being.

439
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:13,220
Until finally an idea, an ultimate plan is born at the very bottom of your mind.

440
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,840
And soon you will be ready for...

441
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,600
Negative Land.

442
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,260
Yes folks, tonight, through the magic of Negative Land, we're going to try to make them famous for a change.

443
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,200
They're not a bunch of subgeniuses.

444
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:41,480
This band, quote band, unquote, was doing this long before they discovered Bob.

445
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,200
Negative Land from Concord, California.

446
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:56,260
And if you were ever into Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart, or Wildman Fisher, or John Cage, or Johann Sebastian Bach, or any of those zany pop groups, you might enjoy this.

447
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:03,660
And if you can possibly wear headphones for it, or tape it for headphones later, you will be in for the shocks of your life.

448
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,140
I consider these guys...

449
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,220
There is no more money.

450
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,280
Time to quit the job.

451
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,420
Slack off.

452
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,080
Anyway, these guys I consider the most advanced.

453
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,940
Classical symphonic group of this century so far, aside from Doctors for Bob.

454
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,640
And, uh...

455
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,300
Well, they're my heroes.

456
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,260
And yet, and yet, they did sound for a enhanced our sound system.

457
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,060
That's sort of like...

458
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:36,600
Having Negative Land do sound for subgeniuses like having Federico Fellini set up lights for your Uncle Fred's home movies.

459
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,220
Or like having Michelangelo do Elvis Presley black velvet paintings.

460
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,740
It's like seeing Jesus.

461
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,120
Jesus posed for pie pads in the Yellow Pages.

462
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,160
You know, it just ain't right.

463
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,560
So, this is the subgenius sound effect show dedicated to Negative Land.

464
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,960
You've got to see this guy for what he is.

465
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,640
He's a maniac out to rule the world.

466
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,100
I guess I'm gonna have to start jamming mobile.

467
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,700
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

468
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,960
Do you think I should start jamming, you guys?

469
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,160
All right, people.

470
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,640
It's almost time for us to be 10-8.

471
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,240
In just a few moments, we're gonna be 10-8.

472
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,120
And I'm going to tell you the story of 180 and the letter G.

473
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,920
All right, people.

474
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,980
It's almost time for us to be...

475
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,020
We're almost to that moment right now, people.

476
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,480
All right, people.

477
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:48,840
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

478
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,260
I am a man

479
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,740
A man with four fingers

480
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,780
A man with four fingers on my hand

481
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,600
I am a man

482
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,060
A man with four fingers

483
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,980
But that doesn't count my thumb

484
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,320
I am a man

485
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,760
A man with three fingers

486
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,740
A man with three fingers on my hand

487
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,580
I am a man

488
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,040
A man with three fingers

489
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,300
A man with three fingers

490
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,380
But that doesn't count my index finger

491
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,180
Or my thumb

492
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,180
Or my thumb

493
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,340
I am a man

494
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,740
A man with two fingers

495
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,080
A man with two fingers

496
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,460
A man with two fingers on my hand

497
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:11,460


498
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,440
I am a man

499
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,860
A man with two fingers

500
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:26,420
But that doesn't count my middle finger

501
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,080
My index finger

502
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,740
Or my thumb

503
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:36,920
But that doesn't count my middle finger

504
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:36,920


505
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:36,920


506
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,620
A man with two fingers

507
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:37,620


508
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:37,620


509
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,740
I am a man

510
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:47,080
A man with one finger, a man with one finger on my hand.

511
00:24:49,180 --> 00:25:06,420
I am a man, a man with one finger, but that doesn't count my ring finger, my middle finger, my index finger, or my thumb.

512
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,760
. . .

513
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:47,660
I am a man, a man with no fingers, a man with no fingers on my hand.

514
00:25:49,700 --> 00:26:06,400
I am a man, a man with no fingers, but that doesn't count my pinky or my ring finger, my middle finger, my index finger, or my thumb.

515
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,300
. . .

516
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,380
Or my thumb.

517
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,420
. . .

518
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:21,740
Okay, we're ten-eight, and the number is 180, and the letter is G.

519
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,420
There's no other possibility.

520
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:35,580
And all you slimy fruitcakes in San Francisco are going to find out how to get to 180,

521
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,240
. . .

522
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,220
and the letter G.

523
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,140
. . .

524
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,680
I repeat, there is no other possibility.

525
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,380
There is no other possi- . . .

526
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,740
The number is 180, and the letter is G.

527
00:26:52,680 --> 00:27:05,240
The first thing you have to do to get over to 180 and the letter G is to get into your vehicle and head east.

528
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:11,340
I repeat, you have to head east over the bridge.

529
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:23,460
But before you get onto the bridge, around one big turn, you'll come up to the place where the sex chemicals burned up.

530
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,140
I repeat, where the sex chemicals burned up.

531
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,040
. . .

532
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,220
And of course, you all must have heard about that on NewsHour.

533
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:35,220


534
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,360
News Center 4.

535
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,380
. . .

536
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,840
No, no, no, no.

537
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,300
. . .

538
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,860
On your way to 180 and the letter G.

539
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,420
. . .

540
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,660
And now, and now, and now we're on the bridge.

541
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,040
. . .

542
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,660
That's nothing very much.

543
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,260
. . .

544
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:14,080
But when you get on the other side of the bridge, on your way to 180 and the letter G, you'll notice two things.

545
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,880
. . .

546
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,300
First of all, it's very important that you turn on your AM radio.

547
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,660
. . .

548
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,640
Set it to 1010 on your dial.

549
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,880
. . .

550
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,380
. . .

551
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,480
. . .

552
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:40,760
And let the radio frequency energy from K101 overload your little tuner until it distorts very highly.

553
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,340
. . .

554
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:48,560
Now, right at the point of that extreme distortion is the big chair.

555
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,760
. . .

556
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,080
. . .

557
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,640
. . .

558
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,020
. . .

559
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,120
. . .

560
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,280
. . .

561
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,800
. . .

562
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,060
. . .

563
00:28:54,060 --> 00:29:07,100
. . .

564
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,260
And then, by then, you'll be out of all that distortion.

565
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,220
. .

566
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,680
And you'll be looking east, toward the hills.

567
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,780
. . .

568
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:15,780


569
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:15,780


570
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:15,780


571
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:15,780


572
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:15,780


573
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:23,820
And if it's at night, you'll see the little red lights flashing on my favorite ham radio repeater's

574
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,040
. . .

575
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,040


576
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,040


577
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,040


578
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,040


579
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,040


580
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,040


581
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,040


582
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,040


583
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,040


584
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,040


585
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,040


586
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,040


587
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,040


588
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,320
station. That's WR6 automatic bowel movement.

589
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:44,220
And any of you who are into jamming, keep talking, keep jamming, because I'll be listening

590
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:52,040
on my scanner radio, and just maybe, you'll be on the new bowel movement.

591
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:01,120
You come up to the tunnel now. And now we're coming up to the tunnel. Up to the tunnel.

592
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:16,320
And then as you get into the tunnel, you'll start to sense something. And then about half

593
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,560
way through the tunnel, something will suddenly hit you. You won't sense it a lot until you

594
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:30,460
get almost through to the other side. You'll realize right then and there that you're entering

595
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:38,160
Contra Costa County. It's hard to explain. It's hard to explain. It's hard to explain.

596
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:47,100
It's hard to explain. But you feel a certain way when you get into Contra Costa County.

597
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,540
On your right, you'll see a little bit of a tunnel. And then you'll see a little bit of

598
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,880
aχre way to 180 and the letter G.

599
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,980
There is absolutely no other possibility.

600
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:12,300
Jbelt.

601
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:12,980
wagen address.

602
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:18,980
Spiritual problem.

603
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,700
Drink is warmer.

604
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,180
G cellular.

605
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,520
The nuclear mg is above 50.

606
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:23,520


607
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:31,180
You'll just hear a lot of free water all the way down to Martinez.

608
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:43,440
When you're up to Martinez, you'll see a sign, a sign that says Gene.

609
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,000
And you're just going to go right on up there in your little vehicle.

610
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,980
And you're going to turn left onto Gene.

611
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,380
On the left-hand side of the street is the A&W Root Beer Place.

612
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:05,760
And on the right side is another place where you're going to go to your own restaurant.

613
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,980
It's safe muffins.

614
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,880
Now that you're on Gene, you're just going to keep right on going up Gene,

615
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,600
heading west on Gene.

616
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,840
All the way to the top of the hill.

617
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,940
Now that's where 180 is.

618
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,840
Right up there at the top.

619
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,360
And just before you get to the top of the hill,

620
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:40,020
you'll notice the green slime closing out from under the house.

621
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,540
Now 180 and the letter Gene.

622
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,520
And of course,

623
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,720
it had to be true.

624
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:57,560
You just got to go right back down to Safe Muffins

625
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,160
and shoplift.

626
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,160
I repeat, you're going to have to shoplift

627
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,520
the HR steam cleaning system

628
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,860
from Safe Muffins.

629
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,120
The only way you're going to be able to do it successfully

630
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,600
is to become invisible.

631
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,920
And then,

632
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,340
when you're totally invisible,

633
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,340
you'll just creep right on in to Safe Muffins.

634
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,640
And there you'll see it.

635
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,800
The HR steam cleaning system.

636
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,440
This is K-N-O-N 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

637
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,160
...180 very quickly.

638
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:46,180
So you whisk your steam cleaning machine right back up Gene

639
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,520
all the way to 180.

640
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,860
You don't...

641
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,280
...right up to the front door.

642
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,160
And you push the button.

643
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:56,260


644
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,260
...

645
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,640
...

646
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,320
...

647
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,340
The door opens automatically.

648
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:19,840
...

649
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:19,840


650
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:19,840


651
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:27,120
...and the first thing you see is the orange carpet inside 180.

652
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,040
...

653
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,900
...and you'll see the dog juice.

654
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,020
...

655
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,660
...a horrible dog juice all over the orange carpet.

656
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,400
...and 180 in the letter G.

657
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,800
...

658
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,160
...you're just going to march right on into G there

659
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,680
...and with your HR steam cleaning system.

660
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,140
...go right all the way back to the kitchen.

661
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,780
...where the Mr. Coffee coffee maker has your hot water...

662
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:05,940
...your hot water ready to pour in your HR steam cleaning system.

663
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:14,640
...so you go in there and get your HR steam cleaner all fired up.

664
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,100
...and you bring it on out into the living room.

665
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,660
...and you take the steam cleaner out.

666
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:19,660


667
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:19,660


668
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:19,660


669
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,720
Take care of all the dog chews on the orange carpet.

670
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,700
Now 180 and the letter G.

671
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,320
I think I'd like to have a cigarette.

672
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,180
Where are my cigarettes, David?

673
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,360
They're on top of the refrigerator.

674
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,600
David, I'd like to know what you did with my cigarettes.

675
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,040
They're under the house.

676
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,760
My cigarettes are missing, David.

677
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,300
I'd like to smoke. What did you do with them?

678
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,860
They're in the toad cage.

679
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,040
David, I'd like to give you a cigarette.

680
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,700
I'd like to make a match.

681
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,180
I'd like to take one.

682
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,040
They're not there. Did you take one?

683
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,420
I'd like to take one.

684
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,660
I'd like to take one.

685
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:13,780
I'd like to take one.

686
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,960
I'd like to take one.

687
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,960
What did you do with my cigarettes?

688
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,760
I told you they're on top of the refrigerator.

689
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,240
I thought I'd put them in the refrigerator.

690
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,220
They're not there.

691
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,460
Will you please tell me if you need my cigarettes?

692
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,400
Maybe you left them in the car.

693
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,040
I didn't come home today.

694
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,120
You were the one who saw me taking my cigarettes.

695
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,840
You better tell me now or you're breathing in a man.

696
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,460
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I think I know where they are.

697
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:59,460
They're in back of the TV set where all the parakeet feathers are.

698
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:08,060
And as you're cleaning the orange carpet, there'll be a voice that says,

699
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,920
Fetch my cigarettes.

700
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,060
Another voice will say,

701
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,960
They're on top of the refrigerator.

702
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,640
They're on top of the refrigerator.

703
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,060
And then of course you've forgotten completely about the green slime.

704
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:34,000
And you'll realize it's the only way to get rid of the green slime is to go back down,

705
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,420
down the stairs, down to the basement of 180 and the letter G,

706
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,640
where you'll find a bottle of Formula 409.

707
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,480
You'll forget that 409.

708
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:49,620
You'll forget that 409.

709
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,880
And I'm gonna be real quick.

710
00:37:51,860 --> 00:38:00,100
And go outside into the mailbox of 180 where the green slime and all the ants are

711
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,940
oozing out onto the sidewalk.

712
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,820
And you'll spray it with all your might as hard as you can on that goddamn green slime.

713
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,740
And then you'll have gotten all that horrible stuff.

714
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,280
We'll be a few toes.

715
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,600
We'll be a few toes.

716
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,580
And then you'll be saying,

717
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,720
Herbis.

718
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,820
Herbis.

719
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,960
Under the house.

720
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,840
Spray me with the 409.

721
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,020
Herbis.

722
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,120
That's what the toes are gonna say to you.

723
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,800
They won't crawl if they don't actually say that.

724
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,380
What you're a G.

725
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,280
Hawaii.

726
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,620
Ha ha ha ha.

727
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,140
Ha ha ha.

728
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:54,680
By then you'll realize that you're gonna have to take your HR steam cleaning system

729
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,240
back down to safe muffins.

730
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:03,060
And before you can do it, you'll of course have to become invisible.

731
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,240
And before you can do it, you'll of course have to become invisible.

732
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,420
Once again.

733
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,820
You'll take your HR steam cleaning system.

734
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,800
Which you should have lifted from safe muffins.

735
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,540
You'll look at the back end.

736
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,320
And it's the same old stew.

737
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,000
At some other numbers.

738
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,600
At some other letters.

739
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,300
At some other dimension.

740
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,440
We never scream.

741
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,380
We never return.

742
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:41,160
And it'll be time for you to head back to San Francisco.

743
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:41,820
Don't.

744
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,340
Don't.

745
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:42,780
Don't.

746
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,760
Because if you don't.

747
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,520
Don't do that.

748
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,500
You'll never leave Contra Costa County.

749
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:46,600
Stop that.

750
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:46,940
Put it away.

751
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,520
Don't get it on the tape recorder.

752
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,120
I can't hear.

753
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,480
Are you doing something?

754
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,200
Get it out of here.

755
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,920
Get back in your vehicle.

756
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,860
And you'll go in reverse.

757
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,420
In reverse gear.

758
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:03,720
Using your rear view mirror all the way back down the freeway past Pleasant Hill, Lafayette,

759
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,640
and Orinda.

760
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,140
Get it off.

761
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,240
Get, get, get.

762
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,080
You'll go back through the tunnel.

763
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,660
And you're gonna get back on the other side of the hill.

764
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:12,760


765
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:12,760


766
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:12,760


767
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:12,760


768
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:12,760


769
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:12,760


770
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:12,760


771
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:12,760


772
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,820
Through the tunnels.

773
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,680
All right.

774
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,840
You already said it.

775
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,000
I don't wanna hear about the tunnel anymore.

776
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,600
Right past the ham radio repeat.

777
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,200
And you'll whisk down that hill at 90 miles an hour.

778
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,600
I don't know.

779
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:34,780
You'll get into the appropriate lanes on your way from 180 in the letter G. Back to San

780
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,500
Francisco.

781
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,740
Back past K101 and the big chairs.

782
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,740
To Trinidad and Tobago.

783
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,680
Luckily it was St. for those of you since then that Gravecum River, so thank you

784
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:45,680


785
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,620
Mull W müttern почему du schle UI gewade And in teamed up with T laughed Ballasb信

786
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:54,140
Not really sure if Oakland's sewer gas can do it as well as Martin's sewer gate, wo

787
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,400
そう Pollera엔 did is going Gol g zone and threatening как

788
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,880
Are you or are you?

789
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,480
And you're on the bridge now heading west.

790
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,220
Into the fog, the high fog I repeat.

791
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,920
Fog never touches the ground in California.

792
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,680
It's always so damn high.

793
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,560
Stop.

794
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,720
And you get across51啊

795
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:12,720


796
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,360
and you look back to where the sex chemicals were made.

797
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,040
And finally you get back into your sewer pipe

798
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,960
and disappear down into the sewers of San Francisco.

799
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:42,040
And you know that you'll never ever want to come out to 180 in the letter G ever again.

800
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,540
We never ever could have been this bad, sweetheart.

801
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:54,500
And in that sorry situation, I think it's just about time we went 10-7.

802
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,180
I'm getting that feeling now.

803
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,700
Deep within those sewer pipes by now.

804
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,860
And never find your way out.

805
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,220
You'll never want to find your way out.

806
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,440
We're 10-7.

807
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,500
Oh, shut it up.

808
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:33,720
Out.

809
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,460
Shut it up. Stop everything.

810
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,620
Well, we stopped everything.

811
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,600
There is absolutely no other possibility.

812
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,980
That's all there is to it, folks.

813
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,600
That's what I've been playing there.

814
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,020
I can shut off now.

815
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,040
That was Negative Land, their third album.

816
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,580
A big 10-8 place.

817
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,520
And I'm going to read their address here in just a second

818
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,140
so you can send them $7.50 and buy that thing.

819
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,700
I know that probably some of my listeners are absolutely disgusted that they'd have to buy that thing.

820
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,340
I know that some of my listeners are absolutely disgusted that they'd have to listen to something as probably strange as all of this may sound.

821
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,860
But that's too bad, ain't it?

822
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,680
I quit my job.

823
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,880
What do I have to worry about?

824
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,300
Nothing.

825
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,120
Nothing.

826
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,000
It's freedom, baby.

827
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,340
Can you dig it?

828
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,220
So anyway, yes, that's Negative Land.

829
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,200
See, they distribute their own record.

830
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,500
You might be able to find it somewhere.

831
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,800
It's at Box 54.

832
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,280
Concord, California.

833
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,040
94522.

834
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,320
Box 54, Concord, California.

835
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,200
Concord.

836
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,640
94522.

837
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,220
Send $7.50.

838
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:01,960
And I hope y'all are getting that in stereo because it's really a pretty amazing piece.

839
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,680
So if I can just cut myself loose from these other shows, it would be fun.

840
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,320
I'm not a rocker, I'm a rocker.

841
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,940
I can slaughter that cotta back, rock and logger.

842
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,720
Hey, doc, what's that song you're playing?

843
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,020
I like it.

844
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,680
Out, out, out.

845
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,460
Out!

846
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:31,300
I can shred and tear a cotta slaughter in a very cotta-cracker.

847
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:40,240
I can drag a cotta and a cracker into a cotta-cracker.

848
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:40,660
I can drag a cotta and a cracker into a cotta-cracker.

849
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:40,780
I can drag a cotta and a cracker into a cotta-cracker.

850
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:59,560
I can drag a cotta and a cracker into a cotta-cracker.

851
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,040
I mean, this is like it'd be fantastic.

852
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,200
Wow, define a cotta knockdown reggae mutton Department.

853
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:03,380


854
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:03,720
The Animal Crossing movie.

855
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:05,960
Parasite.

856
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:05,960


857
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:05,980
The dog got apart.

858
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,120
The dog chewed a Pearson's.

859
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,160
How's that?

860
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,380
What happened?

861
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,780
What the hell?

862
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:53,440
What happened?

863
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,100
Where are we?

864
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,100
A minute ago I was walking around in Glen Rose, Texas,

865
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,200
and now I'm on this planet.

866
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,600
Sandy, what happened?

867
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:09,440
You got captured by a monster and I accidentally hit you.

868
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,360
A monster?

869
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,800
Yeah, right up here.

870
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,420
It's dead, though.

871
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,400
What's the show doing here?

872
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,280
I don't remember anything.

873
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:28,160
You brought the show with you from the laboratory.

874
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,860
I'm going to have to think about this.

875
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,920
I don't understand.

876
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:38,980
Okay.

877
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,380
We're safe now.

878
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,700
Man, that was tough.

879
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,580
Too many monsters around here.

880
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,520
At least this old road is still here

881
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,240
that the space bulldozers built.

882
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,120
I wish the Transformers were around to help us.

883
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,500
Yeah, really.

884
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,000
Yeah.

885
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,080
I know.

886
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,940
Well, which way do you think we should go, Captain Sandy?

887
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:06,840
This.

888
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,640
Where'd the lost subgenius colony...

889
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,920
Where do you think they could have crashed?

890
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,320
I don't know.

891
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,920
Did you hear that?

892
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:21,540
What?

893
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,760
Weird sound.

894
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,640
Whatever it is, I'll stop it.

895
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,220
Oh, yeah?

896
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,780
I'll hear that in a minute.

897
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,940
Listen, I heard something.

898
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,240
I'm going.

899
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,520
God, look at those things.

900
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,800
God, they're unbelievable.

901
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,940
I can't even describe these monsters, folks.

902
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:42,560
Is he asleep?

903
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:44,780
Asleep?

904
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,140
I saw something run off the bushes.

905
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,580
I'm sorry.

906
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,400
I'm sorry.

907
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:56,580


908
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:56,600


909
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:56,600


910
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:56,600


911
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:56,600


912
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:56,760
I'm sorry.

913
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,300
I'm sorry.

914
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:57,400
I'm sorry.

915
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,120
I'm sorry.

916
00:47:59,280 --> 00:47:59,400
I'm sorry.

917
00:47:59,400 --> 00:47:59,460
I'm sorry.

918
00:47:59,580 --> 00:47:59,580


919
00:47:59,720 --> 00:47:59,880
I'm sorry.

920
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:03,640
I'm sorry.

921
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,060
Yeah, there could be something lurking in those boulders over there.

922
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,880
Yeah, so don't go peeking.

923
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,680
Oh, what is that?

924
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,380
Looks like the end of one of the space bulldozers.

925
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,220
Yeah.

926
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,040
The yellow and red thing.

927
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:19,980
Uh-huh.

928
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,140
The end of them.

929
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,540
But what did this to it?

930
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,080
What could have done this to a space bulldozer?

931
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:27,660
Look.

932
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,780
This looks like the Cyclops' head.

933
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,600
And a nose horn.

934
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:32,980
I think that's what it does.

935
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:32,980


936
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:32,980


937
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,480
The two ears.

938
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:39,620
Maybe the bulldozer had a crash into the cyclops and knocked his horn off.

939
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,500
If that's the case, he's going to be really mad.

940
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,720
And this is just his whole horn?

941
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,080
That's probably just the tip of it.

942
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,360
It's only about eight feet long.

943
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,780
The whole horn is twenty feet.

944
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,900
Then he must be giant-er than the sky.

945
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:05,000
No, well, his head touches those low clouds over there.

946
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,900
So I hope the show is ready to take that on.

947
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,220
That's the only thing.

948
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:19,280
If we can make the show sound bad enough, then even the king's cyclops will be driven

949
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,160
away and the land will be left in peace and harmony forever.

950
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,640
And Eternia will be ruled.

951
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,640
Eternia?

952
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,280
Yes.

953
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,560
Without He-Man.

954
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,520
Yeah.

955
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,920
Only soon the Transformers will rule Eternia.

956
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,800
No, the Transformers will.

957
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:42,380
I hope that the Autobots get back to Cybertron, their home.

958
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,540
Why?

959
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,820
And leave the Decepticons here on Earth to destroy us?

960
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:47,400
Yeah.

961
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:48,660
Why?

962
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,440
Do you want Earth destroyed?

963
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,400
You've got to see this guy for what he is.

964
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,060
He's a maniac out to rule the world.

965
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,820
What can I do to make you understand?

966
00:49:59,880 --> 00:49:59,880


967
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,340
I love you.

968
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:13,880
Tune in for mind-melting extremist noise with the best in industrial experimental music

969
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:18,300
featuring such top-name group sales.

970
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,920
What planet are we on?

971
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,120
Oh, me too.

972
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,260
We aren't planning this.

973
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,220
This is, uh...

974
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,300
Oh, it's all planned.

975
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:29,780
Bob, look.

976
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,940
Go ahead and admit it.

977
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,480
See, look, look.

978
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,200
Page...

979
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,920
A plan and a conspiracy.

980
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,140
Look, I'm on page 16.

981
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:35,840
Open your dark mirror and conspiracy.

982
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,120
It says, Lady Calls Talks About Chili.

983
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,500
I mean, all this stuff is...

984
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,520
You can't fool these people.

985
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,240
Yeah, I'm tired of this script.

986
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,920
Let's go to this script here.

987
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,300
No, you can't just do my script.

988
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,920
My stuff's really funny.

989
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:50,160
Hey, look.

990
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,740
Prepare for the chrono-cataclysm of my hoarding food.

991
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,020
Gold guns, ammo, and gas.

992
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,080
Go on survival techniques and learn how to kill.

993
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,760
Of course, you don't want to kill with something you don't have.

994
00:50:59,760 --> 00:50:59,760


995
00:50:59,760 --> 00:50:59,760


996
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,360
I'm a genius believer, but...

997
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:10,180
God's judgment is going to come and fall again upon a godless, Christ-rejecting, blasphemous

998
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:10,700
society.

999
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,660
Well, if this sounds paranoid, you're right.

1000
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,420
But I think I have good reason to be paranoid.

1001
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:24,040
It's a strange world out there.

1002
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,860
This is what life is like.

1003
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,660
It's a strange world that's at a bottom line level.

1004
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:35,920
And I'm not going to make you cut through a lot of other stuff to get through it.

1005
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:36,780
Here's what it is.

1006
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,740
There's no gimmick about that.

1007
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:39,640
It's straight forward.

1008
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,180
It's strong, and it's elemental.

1009
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,160
We are heavy stuff.

1010
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,560
Witchcraft.

1011
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:47,760
Rude.

1012
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,880
Devil worship.

1013
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:56,860
A wild, gnawing, animal hunger will grow in you.

1014
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:57,840
I love you.

1015
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:02,380
His number is 600-3-score.

1016
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,720
Everybody welcome.

1017
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,640
One too stupid.

1018
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,500
Three too stupid.

1019
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:16,500


1020
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:16,580
Four dumb.

1021
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,680
Five, six idiotic.

1022
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,780
Seven, eight seat me safe.

1023
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,600
Eight, very stupid.

1024
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,240
Very stupid.

1025
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,080
Very stupid.

1026
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,520
Very stupid.

1027
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,420
I like Concord and 180G.

1028
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,280
I like Pleasant Hill.

1029
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,500
No other possibility.

1030
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,280
Very stupid.

1031
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,960
Very stupid.

1032
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,700
Very stupid.

1033
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,340
Very stupid.

1034
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,440
Very stupid.

1035
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,580
Very stupid.

1036
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:53,760
Very stupid.

1037
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,340
Very stupid.

1038
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:55,960
Very stupid.

1039
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,200
Very stupid.

1040
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:57,500
Very stupid.

1041
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,840
That is no more money.

1042
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,680
We gotta get some money.

1043
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,400
That dirty purgish harkaback flackin' wharton fill a bunk of marten.

1044
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,820
Harkaloma, harkaloma.

1045
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:12,920
You don't want the, the, the, ooh, that sounded pretty good.

1046
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,920
Our ancestors used to do this, making stupid noises with rocks.

1047
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,760
And one day they found out that certain types of rock, they were not really good at making

1048
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:23,760


1049
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:23,760


1050
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:23,780

00:53:53,180 --> 00:54:00,040
Zandy as subgeniuses, our ancestors were giant eight-foot tall yetis, abominable

1057
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:06,260
snowmen and Bigfoot creatures created by the aliens who came to Earth after the

1058
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,320
dot after they destroyed the dinosaurs.

1059
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:17,380
Unfortunately these godlike super intelligent ancestors of ours were

1060
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:26,120
smited by evil gods and turned into pathetic monkeys and humans and the

1061
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:32,100
humans and the subgeniuses have always been a little different and always waged

1062
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:38,840
this endless war over what's funny and what's not funny. What do you think about

1063
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:43,700
that? What? What I just told you, the history of mankind. Yeah, I hear you a

1064
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,140
club. What am I supposed to do with it?

1065
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:47,360
What? What am I supposed to do with it?

1066
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,740
Yeah, call...

1067
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,100
Oh, me subgenius, me goon, go find human.

1068
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,480
Ah, human!

1069
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,900
That's just a rock.

1070
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,640
Find human.

1071
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,520
Subgenius.

1072
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,260
The evolution.

1073
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,480
Kill bug.

1074
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:05,980
Kill human.

1075
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,620
Where we find human, master?

1076
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,480
I am a human.

1077
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,260
What?

1078
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:17,500
What?

1079
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,260
My own son?

1080
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,880
A human?

1081
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:22,720
Yeah.

1082
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,560
Shelby didn't tell me.

1083
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:26,880
Oh.

1084
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,700
This was a plant.

1085
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:36,080
Or, it was a live plant. See here's the two eyes, the mouth, and here's the long nose.

1086
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,480
The two horns.

1087
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,860
And that was a plant?

1088
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,660
Yeah, actually these are like leaves.

1089
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,460
It looks like a mutated goat head skull.

1090
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,280
And it had eyes.

1091
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:47,560
It has eyes?

1092
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,480
A plant with eyes?

1093
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,000
Yeah.

1094
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:53,620
Never heard of such thing, but that's real.

1095
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,020
It's real, folks.

1096
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,880
This is a real show, and we're really in a dangerous environment.

1097
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,300
A hostile planet.

1098
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,520
In another time.

1099
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,400
Look it, this was a leg bone.

1100
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:10,060
We're 225 years in the future from when you're hearing this.

1101
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:10,680
This was a leg bone.

1102
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,880
I wish She-Ra was here.

1103
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:13,620
Yeah.

1104
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,560
So I could kiss her.

1105
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:18,420
Zandy?

1106
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,080
Uh huh.

1107
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:22,240
God, that's what I'm supposed to be thinking.

1108
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,760
You're only six years old.

1109
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,640
Look at this.

1110
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,380
Hey, what is that thing?

1111
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,520
Ooh, ooh, get it off.

1112
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,800
Ooh, get it off me.

1113
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,180
Ooh.

1114
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,360
Gross.

1115
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,840
That was, must be one of those them-a-pods.

1116
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,160
We gotta find some us-a-pods.

1117
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,440
As an antidote in case one of those them-a-pods bites us.

1118
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,640
Yeah, because those antidotes can really help.

1119
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,060
Did you hear that?

1120
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,100
Did you hear that sound?

1121
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,780
I heard gunshot.

1122
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,000
An earth weapon.

1123
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:04,740
Poof.

1124
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,160
Look out, an egg.

1125
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,360
Let's see.

1126
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:09,980
An egg.

1127
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,700
Do you think that's a Gaius Gudis egg?

1128
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:14,380
Well, I'm sure a regular would think that.

1129
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,040
So, so it'll die.

1130
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:17,340
So it won't have any.

1131
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,480
Well, if it doesn't explode, I'm gonna stand back.

1132
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:21,360
Whoop.

1133
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,380
Way to go.

1134
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,360
Are you okay?

1135
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,440
Dude, I didn't brush you off.

1136
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,260
You got egg goop all over you.

1137
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,680
I wonder what that thing was.

1138
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,020
Look out, here comes its mother.

1139
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:37,700
Grab a stick.

1140
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:38,600
Grab anything.

1141
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,260
It's got me.

1142
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,800
Quick, quick, turn up the show.

1143
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:45,860
Ah, ah, ah.

1144
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:46,020
It's got me.

1145
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:46,020


1146
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:46,020


1147
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:46,020


1148
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:46,020


1149
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:46,020


1150
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:46,020


1151
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:46,780
Oh, it's in here.

1152
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,900
We made it.

1153
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,620
Zandy, am I teaching you too much violence?

1154
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:02,300
No.

1155
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,760
Why would you teach me stuff like that?

1156
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:07,820
Huh?

1157
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,520
Why would you teach me stuff?

1158
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,500
I don't know.

1159
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,200
Like that.

1160
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,400
Because, because that's what I got taught.

1161
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,880
She's in the water.

1162
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,000
Oh, she's in the water.

1163
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,820
But it's so much fun.

1164
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,620
Look, I'm going to grab the other one.

1165
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,760
Oh, listen to that beautiful noise, friends.

1166
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:59,140
That's some more negative land capping off the Captain Sun Sun Sun and Daddy show.

1167
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,940
Boy, there's going to be a real crowd in here.

1168
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:11,980
Norm's got a whole bunch of guardians of the airwaves here ready to destroy any of the evil callers that call in.

1169
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:15,980
And my time is slowly beginning to run out.

1170
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,720
I've got another five minutes here.

1171
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,280
I guess you've got another five minutes of slack, friends.

1172
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,440
But at least you get that much.

1173
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,080
At least listen to that slack skipping by, going just right out of your reach.

1174
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:29,640
I see a new house.

1175
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,420
I smell gasoline.

1176
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,480
Where's the lighter?

1177
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,900
Yes, friends.

1178
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,300
So send for that negative land record.

1179
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:45,600
And, of course, as we come down upon the beautiful closing music of the Hour of Slack show,

1180
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,560
this is Reverend Ivan Stang starting to sign off.

1181
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:54,080
Friends, I want you to send your love offerings our way.

1182
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,460
Bob loves you.

1183
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:02,740
And send those, well, every kind of thing you can scrape out of your drawers.

1184
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:08,140
Because we need those donations to keep the home for slackless children afloat.

1185
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,400
Keep the church open.

1186
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:11,160
Keep the new pamphlets going out.

1187
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,400
You members out there, probably in about a week and a half,

1188
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,680
you'll be getting the new...

1189
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,600
Subgenius pamphlet number two.

1190
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:23,520
I'll be interested to see whether people like it better or worse than the old original first pamphlet.

1191
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:29,000
Nothing could beat that original slack of that first subgenius pamphlet.

1192
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,280
You can get that pamphlet, friends.

1193
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,020
We can't tell you how much money to send because you're supposed to send that money to the station.

1194
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:42,280
But we'll be reading that address of the subgenius church where you can write for information on just what the heck is going on here.

1195
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,400
And that is the church.

1196
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,440
Of the subgenius.

1197
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,460
P.O. Box 140306.

1198
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:56,100
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1199
01:00:56,180 --> 01:01:00,760
Once again, that's Bob at P.O. Box 1403...

1200
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,380
No, not...

1201
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,140
140306.

1202
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,540
Box 140306.

1203
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,620
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1204
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,940
And dear friends, our show is slowly starting to run out.

1205
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:15,040
But, Norm, before you take over the airwaves...

1206
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,220
Take it over!

1207
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:20,920
I want to let Pastor Naked's song, Drinking Bud Watching Bob, play.

1208
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,720
Because we keep getting requests for that.

1209
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,480
Drinking Bud Wiser!

1210
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:27,720
Is that how it goes?

1211
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,580
Yes, that's right.

1212
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,500
Drinking Bud Watching Bob.

1213
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,660
By Pastor Buck Naked.

1214
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,280
Coming up...

1215
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,400
This is stirring music.

1216
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,440
I thought it was sting music.

1217
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,140
Stirring sting.

1218
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,720
Sting sting music.

1219
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,760
I like the lyrics.

1220
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,480
Here we go, friends.

1221
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,440
Pastor Buck Naked.

1222
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:49,680
Buck Naked and the Jaybirds.

1223
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:51,580
Drinking Bud Wiser

1224
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,480
Watching Bob on TV

1225
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,660
Swallowing red man

1226
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,060
The day my coon dog died

1227
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,420
Reading the pamphlet

1228
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,120
Over and over again

1229
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:19,760
I was drinking Bud Wiser

1230
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,540
And Bob was on TV

1231
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,300
The day that Uncle

1232
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,000
Got kicked by a mule

1233
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:37,740
I was with Cousin Junior

1234
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:42,340
The DNA backfired

1235
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:45,660
I was drinking Bud Wiser

1236
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:45,660


1237
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:46,680
I was drunk

1238
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,080
I was lonely

1239
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,660
I was plastered

1240
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:56,700
I was drinking Bud Wiser

1241
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:00,460
And Bob was on TV

1242
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,340
Drinking Bud Wiser

1243
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:10,060
Watching Bob on TV

1244
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,360
Swallowing red man

1245
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:15,640
Watching Bob on TV

1246
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,740
The day my coon dog died

1247
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:23,300
The day my coon dog died

1248
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,660
Reading the pamphlet

1249
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,740
Over and over again

1250
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:34,100
I was drinking Bud Wiser

1251
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,740
And Bob was on TV

1252
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:43,360
I was drinking Bud Wiser

1253
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:46,960
And Bob was on TV

1254
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,800
Drinking Bud Wiser

1255
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:13,200
A few days this last week has brought the passing of another, I don't know if he's a minister or not, an evangelist of sorts, Mr. Herbert W. Armstrong.

1256
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,220
Drinking Bud Wiser

1257
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:40,520
A few days last week has brought the passing of another, I don't know if he's a minister or not, an evangelist of sorts, Mr. Herbert W. Armstrong.

1258
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,140
Drinking Bud Wiser

1259
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:41,140


1260
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:41,600
Yeah.

1261
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:41,620


1262
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:42,020
I feel that I should look at Bob's you

1263
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:42,300
Drinking Bud Wiser

1264
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:42,300


1265
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,020
Garner Ted has his own church in Tyler.

1266
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,040
Yeah, right.

1267
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,280
But Garner Ted was thrown out of...

1268
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:52,100
I mean, that's pretty bad when you've got to throw your own son out of your church twice.

1269
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:57,160
What I'm worried about is my own son throwing me out of my church.

1270
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:57,720
Twice.

1271
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,000
So what is going to happen?

1272
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,420
I don't know. I need a job.

1273
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:02,820
Why don't you...

1274
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,260
I do. I really do.
