10
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,350
Let's take it again.

11
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,730
Oh, Pete and Dave.

12
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,310
Okay, there we go.

13
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,590
All right, you over here?

14
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,590
Just shut up.

15
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,930
This is Phil.

16
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,230
Phil.

17
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:41,590
Pete.

18
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,010
And Dave of the Firesign Theater.

19
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,170
And we're listening to The Hour of Slack.

20
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,110
This is Timothy Larry reminding you that just as you need slack,

21
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,570
Bob needs your help.

22
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,950
Send in those pledges and praise Bob.

23
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,830
It's an unfashionable belief in the atheist community,

24
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,450
but truth just needs to be stated.

25
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,090
It doesn't have to be hyped.

26
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,110
I know.

27
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,310
I do a lot of hyping of atheism,

28
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,670
but remember what Bob Dobbs said.

29
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,050
I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to.

30
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,110
There is no God, and that's a simple truth.

31
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,510
If every trace of any single religion were wiped out and nothing were passed on,

32
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,410
it would never be created exactly that way again.

33
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,410
There might be some other nonsense in its place, but not that exact nonsense.

34
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,050
If all of science were wiped out, it would still be true,

35
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,850
and someone would find a way to figure it all out again.

36
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,150
Oh, superstitious, eh?

37
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,730
It was like the end of the world.

38
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,110
There was destruction everywhere.

39
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,470
People scrambled around in hysterical panic.

40
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,790
Cars and buses and taxis were slamming into each other by the second.

41
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,230
Mass confusion reigned like never before.

42
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,230
And the cause of all this?

43
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,090
Mom?

44
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,470
You're not Jesus.

45
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,390
You're Bob.

46
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,810
Yes, Bob!

47
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,810
So, you think you better run, run, run!

48
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,570
I'm on my high horse and I'm gonna ride, ride, ride.

49
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,130
I hear the power soar, make the sparks fly, fly, fly.

50
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,410
I pay my dues to the man with the pipe, so we own all the guns.

51
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,390
We're gonna watch this planet blow up tonight.

52
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,290
So cry, baby, cry. Tears won't change the story.

53
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,610
Scream, baby, scream, cause it won't change a thing.

54
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,750
Pray, baby, pray to the gods who will not answer, cause today is its day.

55
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,150
It's time for you to hit the bed!

56
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,410
I'm Bob Dobbs. We're with Bob Dobbs.

57
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,410
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

58
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,850
Master of Slack.

59
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,410
For one last chance to save your life.

60
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,630
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

61
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,290
Open your world and save your soul.

62
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,790
Put it under Bob's control.

63
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,850
All that expires while you wait.

64
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,850
Operators are standing by.

65
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,350
From then on, there's no stopping the Bob as it spreads from town to town.

66
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,910
I'm a Jedi through and through.

67
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,890
Ain't nothing that you can't do.

68
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,450
Make all the pigs start shaking in their boots.

69
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,650
Make the conspiracy wanna puke.

70
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,170
You can't hold me or control me.

71
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,790
All the Bobbies wanna be me.

72
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,550
Till the sausage come down and burn your town to the ground.

73
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,430
There's no passing go.

74
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,890
Collect 200 billion souls.

75
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,110
Survive until like 5th in the moon.

76
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,590
So G.D. shall be reborn.

77
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,330
And then it's time to settle the score.

78
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,650
It ain't about the battle.

79
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,710
It's about the war.

80
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,930
So go read Revelation next, cause that's what it's for.

81
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,150
I got more verses than a damn bible.

82
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,430
Play them like a recital.

83
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,730
It's just too damn much.

84
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,990
We're all the men to the idol.

85
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,190
So cry baby cry.

86
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,790
Tears won't change the story.

87
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,070
Scream baby scream, cause it won't change a thing.

88
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,490
Just a fire of sin.

89
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,850
With a pipe and a grin.

90
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,110
There ain't no asking why.

91
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,710
It's time to slack off or die.

92
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,930
Who's our master of the fight?

93
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,230
J.R. Bob Dog's Master of Slack.

94
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,870
Who's my last chance to save your life?

95
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,250
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

96
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,770
Open your world and save your soul.

97
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,350
Put it under Bob's control.

98
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,870
This offer only good through X-Day, July 5th, 1998.

99
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,730
For Christ's sake isn't it what you fuckin' maniacs are doing what I'm talking about?

100
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,230
I'm not too far off right now.

101
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,870
July 5th is coming.

102
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,370
There's no time to wait.

103
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,210
July 4th, year one.

104
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,230


105
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,230


106
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,270
We're all your friends.

107
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,070
Serve a World Cup golfer's head on a plate.

108
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,970
Finally they can't take a chance.

109
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,310
Know the bliss from the rings of Bob's pipe smoke.

110
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,330
And if you call within the next 30 minutes, we'll throw in a free helping of prairie squid.

111
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,530
Damn, in some parts of the universe this thing would be considered goody.

112
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:15,910
Repent.

113
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,950
Quit your job.

114
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,030
Slack off.

115
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,870
And bring Bob!

116
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:33,610
And friends, that was in Bob We Trust by the band called Monkey Hive.

117
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,170
Praise Suds and the late Pfister Gag Hole.

118
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:50,730
Before that we heard some tips of the cranium to Bob from Penn Jillette, Timothy Leary, the Firesign Theatre, and Reverend D.U. Eight.

119
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,030
With the...

120
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,770
...steaming sack of slack.

121
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:13,450
Soon we'll also hear songs called for future Bob song albums from Andrew the Impaled, Six-Fisted Tales of Bob with Priestess Pisces, The Mutant Mountain Boys, Reverend Gord, Don, Truby, and if we have time, Slack Tea.

122
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:19,930
But we won't hear Dave or we or me live much after this.

123
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,130
Dave and we would have loved to do some shows.

124
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:22,210
We'll all be there.

125
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,210


126
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,210


127
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,210


128
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,210


129
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,210


130
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,210


131
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,210


132
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,210


133
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,210


134
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,210


135
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:32,450
but frankly, I'm taking a break from trying to be funny or smart or whatever live on the air tonight

136
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:39,030
because I'm, well, let's just say it, I'm butthurt at the behavior of various people in the Internet backstage,

137
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,270
and I don't trust myself not to say something I'll really regret.

138
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:50,530
My slack has been dented for now, so I'm reading from a script.

139
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:55,750
Princess, we and I went to Detroit yesterday to attend services for one of our fallen members,

140
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,690
Reverend Kay Wren, the bride of Reverend Eggplant.

141
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:07,270
Reverend Kay Wren went to meet the saucers very prematurely a couple of weeks ago,

142
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,790
and all those real-life subgeniuses we saw were wonderful.

143
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,810
That has nothing at all to do with my crappy mood.

144
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,510
But before and after that trip, every time I logged into the subgeniuses,

145
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:28,110
internet land this week, it seemed like I just kept seeing the same evidence of more and more behind-the-scenes

146
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:35,330
gossiping and sniping and whining and backstabbing and obsessive lying.

147
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,530
It just makes me feel not very subgeniously tonight.

148
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:49,790
Luckily, though, I've been unearthing ancient tapes from the early 1980s,

149
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:57,930
tapes of me ranting to myself, or actually to some distant friend or other while driving to work in my car,

150
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,890
listening to Dallas preachers on the Dallas radio,

151
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:07,950
back when I was more disgustipated at the pinks than I was at some of my fellow subgeniuses,

152
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:13,270
and nobody would censor me if I said something that wasn't PC to Republicans.

153
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:19,050
So let's go back, back, back in time to the olden days,

154
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,170
before...

155
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,150
the internet.

156
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,290
Long before Google groups, when our hate was pure,

157
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:30,630
and there were only nine dues-paying subgeniuses on the entire planet Earth,

158
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:37,190
besides Bob, and they all lived in Dallas, Little Rock, San Francisco, or a ranch in Bolivia.

159
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:44,230
These car rants are from a 1981 cassette tape titled, appropriately enough,

160
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,430
The Hate of the Stang Brain.

161
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,330
And they really are all recorded in my car.

162
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:56,890
While I was driving around Dallas doing menial, low-paying, crap jobs and sweltering heat with no air conditioning.

163
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,370
But it was more fun than I've had on the internet in the last few days, anyway.

164
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,810
And it'll be broken up with some really, really wonderful music that you may or may not have heard, I don't know.

165
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,490
Praise Bob.

166
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,210
It's a shitty day.

167
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,470
I hate reality.

168
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,890
Having to wake up.

169
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,930
Start the whole planet all over again every day.

170
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,010
Oh, god dammit.

171
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,550
I've gotta start my ass up.

172
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,230
Let's have some precious...

173
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,890
precious words.

174
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,810
Dammit, I don't hear no words.

175
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,770
Seed of faith.

176
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,370
There we go.

177
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,570
And let that seed grow up into a bountiful harvest.

178
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,470
Oh, yeah.

179
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,350
That's nice.

180
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:52,350


181
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:59,630
Then God is going to let that harvest bountifully be blessed for you of health, of healing, of happiness, and so in prosperity.

182
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:05,930
Oh, the heart seed of the growing, heartening harvest.

183
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,250
And God blesses us and we give to others.

184
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,450
And pills.

185
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,790
And God keeps the blessings flowing right back to us again and again.

186
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,710
Squirting.

187
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,350
And shittingly.

188
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,070
The centrifuge.

189
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,370
The selective flavor.

190
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,970
The

191
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,210
Oh, my...

192
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:35,330
Oh, my...

193
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:35,590
Usually.

194
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,310
Oh, yes.

195
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,170
Oh, yeah.

196
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,690
Oh, my...

197
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,250
Oh, my...

198
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,170
Oh, my...

199
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,650
Oh, my...

200
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,290
Oh, my...

201
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:51,310
Oh, yes.

202
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,690
Those fine young girls...

203
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,770
and boys.

204
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:01,350
But we need mattresses and contraceptives for these young girls.

205
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:03,970
Yes.

206
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,450
Oh, my...

207
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:08,450


208
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,150
Those we hate are starving to death.

209
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,970
Oh, my...

210
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:19,630
I command ye to spill thy seed word gift of a hundred pounds of life and give me praise.

211
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:19,630


212
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:19,630


213
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:19,630


214
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:19,630


215
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:19,630


216
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:19,630


217
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:19,630


218
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:19,630


219
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:19,630


220
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:19,630


221
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,650
And I will be sending you a hundred-dollar bill on my lap, little boy.

222
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,310
I will be sending ye a hundred-dollar bill on my lap, little boy.

223
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,290
200 pounds of life-giving food.

224
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,370
Neighbor, come around the radio right now.

225
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:41,590
I just feel impressed by the Spirit of God to pray with you and let God bless you as you plant that seed faith on the Isle of Hades.

226
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,990
You don't have time to chat with me.

227
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:45,970
Ah...

228
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:47,690
Ah...

229
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:47,850
Ah...

230
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,010
Ah...

231
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,870
Ah...

232
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,330
Oh, yes.

233
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:59,610
I come in the name of Jesus against sin, sickness, disease, and poverty, and premature death.

234
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:05,970
I command the blessing upon every believer as they give their tithes, their offerings, and love gifts.

235
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,810
Thirty-nine hundred-fold blessing to come upon them as they remember the children.

236
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,970
Now as they feed the hungry, let the power of the Holy Spirit come upon them.

237
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:27,490
Ah, come ye, the children that received this life-giving seed of my rising faith, as yet ye prematurely not come unto me.

238
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,250
Amen.

239
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,190
Amen.

240
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,530
And now the announcer will give you our mailing address.

241
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:38,830
That's P.O. Box, Gasoliers, Florida, Olsen, Nome, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

242
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,570
That's right.

243
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,950
Send $100 to P.O. Box, Gasoliers, Florida, Olsen, Nome, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

244
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:43,950


245
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,390
That's P.O. Box, Gasoliers, Florida, Olsen, Nome, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

246
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,190
Order today.

247
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:51,330
There will be a day when all the pink boys pay.

248
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,010
They'll scream and burn with nowhere left to run.

249
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,430
But I won't be around, cause I'm headed out of town to outer space.

250
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,830
And a saucer built for one.

251
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,850
Yeah, my saucer built for one.

252
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,510
Aim that sucker towards the sun.

253
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,350
Light the fuse and then I'm on my way.

254
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,950
And I'll realize my dream's a dream, and I'll be on my way.

255
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:13,950


256
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:13,950


257
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:13,950


258
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,410
And I'll see the stars in the sky.

259
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,530
And I'll hear the pink boys scream.

260
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,390
And agony and terror come next day.

261
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,090
Now a saucer built for one sure sounds like lots of fun.

262
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,170
Till you realize that there's no one there to screw.

263
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,310
And I get bored with my hand.

264
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,510
So I ripped up all my plans, cause I'm working on a saucer built for two.

265
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,970
And my saucer built for two.

266
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,370
You know just what we'll do.

267
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,750
Each other as we make our way through space.

268
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,190
And in our rearview mirror.

269
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,610
We'll see nothing but fear.

270
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,370
As the X's ravage earth come X day.

271
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,910
Now a saucer built for two.

272
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,710
Got a cozy seat for you.

273
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,310
And another one on this side just for me.

274
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,990
But when I'm between your thighs.

275
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,810
I need someone else to drive.

276
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,430
So now I'm working on a saucer built for three.

277
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,790
Yeah, in my saucer built for three.

278
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,070
Yeah, you and her and me.

279
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,490
We'll all take turns and we'll all get to play.

280
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,990
And they'll know it's no joke.

281
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,090
When the pinks go up.

282
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:13,470
And smoke.

283
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,090
And agony and terror come X day.

284
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,270
Now a saucer built for three.

285
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,610
Might seem quite enough for me.

286
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,510
But I for one need just a little more.

287
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,470
So I went back to the shop.

288
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,090
I put that fucker up on blocks.

289
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,470
And now I'm working on a saucer built for four.

290
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,770
Yeah, in my saucer built for four.

291
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,030
Oh no one's getting bored.

292
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,530
There's always someone else for getting laid.

293
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,870
And I thank my lucky stars.

294
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,770
As we cruise right past Mars.

295
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,490
That we escaped the carnage of X day.

296
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,110
Now a saucer built for four.

297
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,990
I shouldn't ask for more.

298
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,010
What the hell, why else am I alive?

299
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,150
Besides I need a break.

300
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,050
Every six hours give or take.

301
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,730
So now I'm working on a saucer built for five.

302
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,890
Yeah, in my saucer built for five.

303
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,210
From now till we arrive.

304
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,650
We'll fucking suck with luck in every way.

305
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,830
And each time we get laid.

306
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,430
The memories will fade.

307
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,930
Of what the earth was like before X day.

308
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,110
Now a saucer built for five.

309
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,990
Three to shag and one to drive.

310
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,710
But it turns out that the ladies want more dicks.

311
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,290
So I'm getting out of bed.

312
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,010
And I'm getting right back to my shit.

313
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,410
Now I'm working on a saucer built for six.

314
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,610
Yeah, in my saucer built for six.

315
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,150
Might learn me some new tricks.

316
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,190
As we go taking a break.

317
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,390
And cross the Milky Way.

318
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,690
Laughing as we drink.

319
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,170
About every single bink.

320
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,770
That fried right where they stood.

321
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:49,930
Come X day.

322
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,870
Now a saucer built for six.

323
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,530
So much cock and ass and tits.

324
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,310
No one ever got so close to heaven.

325
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,490
But at the risk of sounding rude.

326
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,450
We might need one for food.

327
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,170
So now I'm working on a saucer built for seven.

328
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,310
In my saucer built for seven.

329
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,850
We got room for Cat and Kevin.

330
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,850
And five more.

331
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,150
Yeti freaks who knew to pay.

332
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,410
30 some odd bucks to Bob.

333
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,030
And they finally quit that job.

334
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,310
And that wave of corporate layoffs.

335
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,270
Come X day.

336
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,130
Now a saucer built for seven.

337
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,490
It only takes a second to turn around and find yourself

338
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,010
a date.

339
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,390
But the place is going to be a mess.

340
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,930
Need some cleaning help, I guess.

341
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,410
So now I'm working on a saucer built for eight.

342
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,490
In my saucer built for eight.

343
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,950
No one has to masturbate.

344
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,110
A little help here is all you got to say.

345
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,050
That some pretty Yeti mouth is happy to go south.

346
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,770
After all, that's what we practiced.

347
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,850
4X day.

348
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,370
Now a saucer built for eight.

349
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,830
I'm sure that just sounds great.

350
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,770
But I'm starting now to recognize a trend.

351
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,830
I'd build it out for nine.

352
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,450
And then I'd change my mind.

353
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,010
So fuck it.

354
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,350
I'm skipping right on ahead to 10.

355
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,930
In my saucer built for 10.

356
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,530
A mobile pleasure den.

357
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,850
A hedonistic hoedown on its way.

358
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,410
To that sexy slack filled place.

359
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,750
A way up there in space that they promised

360
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,410
would be ready come X day.

361
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,910
Now a saucer built for 10.

362
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,130
You might think that that's the end.

363
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,970
But I hate to let down my subgenius brethren.

364
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:37,570
Hm.

365
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,130
Hm.

366
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,070
Hm.

367
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,930
Hm.

368
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,510
Hm.

369
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:40,790
Hm.

370
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:40,910


371
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:40,910


372
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,330
Lemme put an extra door as I put some bean bags on the floor.

373
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:47,790
Now I'm proud to say my saucer seats 11 in my saucer for 11.

374
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,850
In my saucer for 11.

375
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,430
My libido won't be even.

376
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,690
In fact, I might become a better lay.

377
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,710
Because I'll learn from the best, and I'll practice on the rest.

378
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,510
As we all make each other come X day.

379
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,710
Now a saucer for 11.

380
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:06,890
Oh my.

381
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,490
This place is getting to be one where

382
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,690
it's hard to hear yourself.

383
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:10,890
A wrap up.

384
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:10,890


385
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,630
Over all the grunts and moans

386
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,150
So I install new headphones

387
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,790
That'll be perfect on my saucer built for 12

388
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,070
And my saucer built for 12

389
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,490
We'll all escape that hell

390
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,830
The earth will become, or so they say

391
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,090
Half the hands will grab an ass

392
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,530
The other half will raise a glass

393
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,310
To those liberating exes of X-Day

394
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,510
Now a saucer built for 12

395
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,730
Oh dear, above the smell

396
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,890
And the furniture all has a sticky sheen

397
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,650
But if that ain't quite enough

398
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,230
Well I hate to say it but tough

399
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,710
I ain't working on a saucer for 13

400
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,110
Yes, my saucer built for 12

401
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,410
Will suit us all real well

402
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:55,970
As...

403
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,030
Saucer built for 12

404
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,010
Will suit us all real well

405
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,950
With whips and chains and liquor and poker

406
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:05,550
Yay!

407
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,810
And no one's getting off

408
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,450
Well, everyone's getting off

409
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,290
And no, we'll never stop

410
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,750
Unless we come across that comet, hell bop

411
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,790
I'd like to have a word with those Heaven's Gate people

412
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,510
Maybe get myself some sneakers

413
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:35,330
Until we reach our new home come X-Day

414
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:46,050
In a few-a-day

415
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:50,010
Tell me where my gut was

416
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,050
Am I alone on the seus?"

417
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,270
A fuck 기다�ness

418
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,270


419
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,270


420
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,270


421
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,270


422
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,410
You searchin bleep

423
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,730
So fine

424
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,730
What we're till now

425
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:07,370
They have more

426
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,570
stupid things.

427
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,450
My tape recorder,

428
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,650
which was highly useful

429
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,890
in the spiritual life of everybody.

430
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,850
On some occasions,

431
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,370
we have broadcasted

432
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,570
the tape through the loud

433
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,150
speaker to the villages.

434
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,390
My village is a

435
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,870
very backward one,

436
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,430
which is really appreciated

437
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,550
by everyone,

438
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,230
and we as a village are grateful

439
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,390
and thankful for your services

440
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,350
rendered to us.

441
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,050
The young man from West Malaysia

442
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,370
indicates that he listens daily

443
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,610
through the Bible.

444
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,210
The badness,

445
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,010
the incredible badness.

446
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,890
It was, it was,

447
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,950
it's just, God, Doug,

448
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,410
walking upon the bones

449
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,110
of those who before them

450
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,230
tried to escape the squirting universe,

451
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,030
friends, squirting.

452
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,690
You see,

453
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,530
God's the one that makes the pre-tourney,

454
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,430
and he gives them the message.

455
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,390
It's a damn trick.

456
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,030
Or if not God,

457
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,570
then the devil, you know,

458
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,750
one or the other, somebody,

459
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,990
or Nicky, or Bob,

460
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,070
or your old friend,

461
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,130
or, well, I don't know about your old friend.

462
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,150
I mean, that's just a,

463
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:26,050
a purely uneducated guest.

464
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:26,770
Or the

465
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,870
50-foot woman

466
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,410
gives a preacher

467
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,330
the call to preach.

468
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,010
And

469
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,790
there is no preacher.

470
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,710
There is no preacher.

471
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,310
If he is called of one of these things,

472
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,290
or else the thing between his legs may call him to preach,

473
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,370
and he cannot fail.

474
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,310
He cannot fail.

475
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,930
If he,

476
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,490
if he heeds the calling of the thing between his legs,

477
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,590
or her legs,

478
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,730
depending on what kind of thing it is,

479
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,990
and that preacher shan't fail,

480
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,350
and shall achieve intercourse,

481
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,270
a fine and noble,

482
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:16,270
coercion of that opposite or self same-sex partner whichever it may be in whichever camp

483
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:27,430
you happen to be stuck in on out a true preacher of course can can jump back between male and

484
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:36,130
female if he or she pleases now many like myself choose not to do so but to work only upon and

485
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:50,030
enlarging that one element of the preachers toolbox that longest most muscular and sometimes

486
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:58,350
flaccid tool of the preacher it not his mouth name that which is sometimes soft and becomes

487
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:05,510
hard and begins to flap and look for something to itch you rub against yes I'm talking about

488
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,110
the preacher's tool of the preacher and I'm talking about the preacher's tool of the preacher

489
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:18,430
is Tom the tongue of the preacher the preacher as his trigger and so you know even the banks

490
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:26,430
will topple when these preachers come with their tongues and and it shall wash away the

491
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:35,490
filth and the the unclean seed with the new seed well upon which the mobile homes of the subgeni

492
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,090
will fill with their tongues and the filth and the unclean seed will fill with their tongues and

493
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:46,570
float and be carried on high with their fropp and things, pills and all that party equipment

494
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,090
they use, chainsaws, scalpels.

495
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:58,390
Yes, as it says in prophecy, those called preachers, doctors of darkness of Bob, shall

496
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:05,870
float or mount Ararat and achieve slapdom.

497
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:15,250
It's a squirting universe, friends, and that's why we have to call for your help tonight.

498
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,930
We're about to lose our lease on the great new squirting tabernacle.

499
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:26,990
Yes, we've only been in there a month, and the squirting tabernacle is going back into

500
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,290
the hands of the conspiracies.

501
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:28,370
We're going to have to get rid of it.

502
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:35,650
They're going to turn it into some sort of war games, participation video game outfit,

503
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,710
I don't know what, instead of the great scrub.

504
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:49,950
Because the law says, the law says subgenius can't be fucked by whatever it wants.

505
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,870
That's what the law says.

506
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,450
It says no subgenius can do anything he wants.

507
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,370
And they call this a free game.

508
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:58,470
It's a free land.

509
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:07,390
Well, my friends, I've heard people call the subgenius church a joke, but I sometimes

510
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:13,370
have to think, is the church a joke or is this world a joke?

511
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,970
Bob Dobbs owns deed and title to the church.

512
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,030
But who owns deed and title to the world?

513
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,430
Not Bob yet, no, I'm afraid not.

514
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:26,870
No, sir.

515
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,350
Those people.

516
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:33,030
They're just policemen on motorcycles, driving by me right now.

517
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:37,430
Hey, look at me, and I have to pause in my preaching because they may think that I'm

518
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:44,750
a crazy man or a drunk man, just because I'm free, free, free enough to talk to myself

519
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,530
in the car.

520
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:51,090
Even if there wasn't a tape recorder in here, why, there's no reason for them to be arresting

521
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,230
me just for looking like a crazy person.

522
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,710
And yet they do, they would.

523
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,330
You're mind has to be free.

524
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:58,330


525
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:09,290
certified okay by them. They, they, and oh we hate they, as they and their tools of

526
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:14,970
iniquity. Tools of iniquity. Not the tools of the preacher. Not the dick, not the

527
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:23,930
tongue, nay. But their iniquious and ever-present

528
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:34,830
disgust, and so we find... I got my headphones off everything's okay now

529
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:40,450
back to reality back to normal. Well not exactly. Yeah normal for me.

530
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:49,670
Take your son up on a mountain, offer him unto me as a sacrifice. That would have been you or me.

531
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,770
We'd have said, now that's that devil trying to cheat me out of my blessing. See what I'm getting at?

532
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,790
That's right. See what I'm getting at?

533
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:58,610
Yeah. Uh-uh, he moved God's voice. He said, yes Lord. Uh-uh, no, yes.

534
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:02,270
Hey son, Isaac, let's go boy. We're going up and have church on a mountain.

535
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:08,090
Gonna kill you. Went on up to that mountaintop. You know the story. I wish I had time to go into that, but I don't.

536
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:15,370
And we'll be back. We'll be back. Because he knew that God will provide. He knew him as Jehovah Jireh.

537
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:23,070
I don't care what kind of trouble you're in. He's still Jehovah Jireh. The Lord will provide, and he will make a way.

538
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:31,110
Well, there is no way. It may look like you're the victim right now. You've been victimized by the devil, but the battle ain't over.

539
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:38,250
God never intended for you to be the victim. You're the victor. You are the conquered one. You are the conqueror.

540
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:45,370
It seems like you're overcome. You may be overcome now, but when it's over, you're going to be the overcomer.

541
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:51,270
The devil's gonna be under your foot. You're going to be on top, and he'll be under me. Why?

542
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,970
Because you're a child of God.

543
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,770
Hallelujah!

544
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:01,930
I am the conqueror.

545
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:09,450
I've played every note I know. I've played every one of them at least twice tonight.

546
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,630
It wasn't enough.

547
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,050
I've played a couple of those notes 30 or 40 times.

548
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:38,330
I have a good kind of everyones since last year in the old town.

549
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:38,330


550
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:39,810


551
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:39,810


552
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,830
Yeah, A belongs to Yes.

553
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:42,810


554
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:42,830
No?

555
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,030
And you are familiar with the stuff I play.

556
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,030


557
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,550
Silence, please.

558
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,630
No, I mean, why are you saying like this?

559
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:47,630


560
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:47,630


561
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,770
Well, some days' of good 사람들 are very nice.

562
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,650
Me neither.

563
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:52,950
I hope of course you will объ tr menor bien!

564
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:57,050
You don't want it, but you say you need it.

565
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:03,290
The truth of the matter is, you won't receive it.

566
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,270
Not the way you're thinking.

567
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,710
Not the way you want it.

568
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:16,150
You see, sometimes slack is involuntary.

569
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,790
Jobs aren't reactions quite contrarian.

570
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:28,990
But even if you think all is lost,

571
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:35,590
slack will come to you, but you must pay the cost.

572
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:41,690
Involuntary slack has a nature of its own.

573
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:47,990
Sometimes it'll leave you stranded and far from home.

574
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:22,510
And sometimes it'll leave you stranded and far from home.

575
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,990
And Bob will present you with a golden opportunity.

576
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,330
So don't be stupid and give it back.

577
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,450
It's involuntary slack.

578
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,270
Why is this happening to me, Bob?

579
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,410
I don't understand.

580
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:59,170
Things are going so well and now, here I am.

581
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:06,250
My life is coming apart in the seams and I don't understand.

582
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:13,790
Tell me, Bob, why would you forsake me?

583
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,510
I've done everything I could for you.

584
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,990
Tell me, Bob.

585
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,390
Why would you forsake me?

586
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:22,390


587
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,590
I've done everything I could for you.

588
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:25,590


589
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,570
And he said,

590
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,030
Yes, he said.

591
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,270
Here's what he said.

592
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:40,450
Pisces, don't let it get in your head because

593
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:45,890
For every frog stick that burns out

594
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:52,370
I'll put another one in your mouth.

595
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:52,370


596
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:52,370


597
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:52,370


598
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,110
You just must be patient.

599
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,830
Your time will come.

600
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,130
You paid your thirty dollars.

601
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:12,970
But Bob, but Bob, I just don't think I can handle this anymore.

602
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:19,350
I'm so rundown and broke and goddamn I hate being poor.

603
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,370
I don't know how I'm going to make it.

604
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:22,370


605
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,870
I don't want to sell my ass on the street.

606
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,950
But what is your suggestion, Bob?

607
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,230
Why do you just sit there smiling at me?

608
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,150
You're my savior and I'm asking for help, Bob.

609
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,190
And here's what he said to me.

610
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,730
Involuntary slack.

611
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,050
Involuntary slack.

612
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,450
Involuntary slack.

613
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,830
Get your groove back.

614
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,190
Involuntary slack.

615
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,570
Involuntary slack.

616
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:20,910
Involuntary slack.

617
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:23,630
Involuntary slack.

618
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:25,870
Involuntary slack.

619
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,190
Involuntary slack.

620
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:31,070
So Stang went up to Bob and asked,

621
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:33,710
Why, Bob, why?

622
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,650
I've been busting my ass for you, he said.

623
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,370
And you're just making me cry.

624
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,910
Bob looked at Stang and he said,

625
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,270
I'll tell you why, Stang.

626
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:49,710
Involuntary slack.

627
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,490
Involuntary slack.

628
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,870
Involuntary slack.

629
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,330
Involuntary slack.

630
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,830
Involuntary slack.

631
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,150
Involuntary slack.

632
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,150
And then you'll get your groove back.

633
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,830
Involuntary, slack,

634
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:32,870
Ona,

635
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,450
involuntary, slack.

636
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,850
Involuntary, slack.

637
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,330
Involuntary, slack.

638
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,690
Involuntary, slack.

639
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:49,030
Slack! Involuntary Slack!

640
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,490
So, brothers and sisters,

641
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,650
children in the eyes of adults,

642
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,170
don't be so downhearted!

643
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:26,250
Praise Bob, you will get your Slack,

644
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,450
but it might not be that

645
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,810
involuntary Slack!

646
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,310
Involuntary Slack!

647
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,690
Involuntary Slack!

648
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,770
Involuntary Slack!

649
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,170
Involuntary Slack!

650
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:07,110
Why, one must make oneself stupid in order to stay sane,

651
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:12,690
because it is more important to be sane if stupid,

652
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,630
than to be...

653
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,310
smart... a smarty-pants that's crazy.

654
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,810
You know what I mean?

655
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,030
And I mean crazy in that negative sense.

656
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:27,130
Because a man who is sane and properly stupid

657
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:30,210
will appear to be crazy

658
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:35,270
to those who have retained some modicum of intelligence,

659
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,290
but who are yet fucked,

660
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,390
if you grasp my meaning, and I'm sure that you do, Doctor.

661
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,450
I will count you as crazy if you don't talk!

662
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,610
What do you think of that?

663
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:03,650
This is the end.

664
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:09,690
TransVEL kaik $ impact

665
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:18,070
evangelical Christian subgeniuses, whose numbers are as well so every day.

666
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:32,810
These dear, dear Christians, they, like us, see the family falling apart in America today.

667
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:40,370
The family falling apart, the attack on the American family they call it.

668
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:46,010
And they're right, it is going on, even as we speak.

669
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:54,870
Father against son, sister against brother, father fucking sister.

670
00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:01,810
And uh, yes, yes, yes, and it dissolves.

671
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:02,790
It's falling apart.

672
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:13,390
It's like one in every two marriages dissolves in divorce.

673
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:19,870
Holy shit, I can't rant with this retarded guy walking by in front of the car looking at me.

674
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,570
He's a pleasant looking chap.

675
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:28,010
Truly, you know, sometimes the retarded are miserable wretches.

676
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:32,550
I guess depending on what their physical deal is.

677
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:32,790
And, uh, you know, I don't know.

678
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:33,590
I don't know what else to say about it.

679
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:40,410
But, sometimes they are the most cheerful people, the truest subgeniuses.

680
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,710
The most sub, one might say.

681
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,770
But, cheerful.

682
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,050
It says something.

683
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:53,730
They smile like, not a fanatical death's head grin like Bob's.

684
00:39:54,670 --> 00:40:01,270
But just the pleasantest, the pleasantest happy smirk.

685
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,290
Kind of a smirk.

686
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,410
Like, you know something I don't know.

687
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,950
That's what they're thinking.

688
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,830
And they don't envy us for it.

689
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:09,730
No siree.

690
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,550
Anyway, back to the family.

691
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:18,330
Yes, and the Christian, the dear Christian, would say, or the right wing evangelical Christian,

692
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:27,490
would say that the attack on the American family comes from pornography, from sex gags on TV,

693
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,010
from, uh,

694
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:31,070
uh,

695
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,470
premarital sex and permissiveness.

696
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,950
Well, that's a lie, my friend.

697
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,810
That's the devil's lie.

698
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,570
I know what you're thinking.

699
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,850
But I'll say it again.

700
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,250
It's the devil's lie.

701
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,930
The devil is in that Texaco station over there.

702
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,830
The devil is pulled up behind me in a car.

703
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:58,950
The devil is in Lakewood Landing Restaurant and Bar.

704
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,090
The devil is in Reed Hardware.

705
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,910
The devil is everywhere.

706
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,430
And he's pulling the family apart.

707
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,470
Pulling it apart, my friend.

708
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:14,850
But I'll tell you, I'll tell you what's tearing the family down.

709
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:20,010
And it's what those beloved Christians love most.

710
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,470
Oh, it's what they say we're trying to destroy, and we are.

711
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,930
What's tearing the family apart is not the devil.

712
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:38,990
It's what are we, again, not running into?

713
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,830
It's the devil shorts down on anything?

714
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:43,890
Has prospects for problems, reactions, blocks?

715
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:44,050
Thoughts on the manipulation of a crazy私.

716
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:44,730
Literally Rem vertically, wandering in circles and ultimately to hell,

717
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:50,770
gone

718
00:41:50,770 --> 00:42:00,750
about 7 o'clock, pissed off after a long drive back out to the suburbs from his insurance company or whatever,

719
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:07,470
and he comes home and he kisses his kids goodnight, hello and goodnight, and they go to bed.

720
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:17,570
And the Christian dares to say that it's because the kids see a little tittering as stupid, sexy gags on television.

721
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:24,890
Or they say it's because the new permissiveness and men are allowed to stick their things into other men and such like.

722
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:28,130
I say that's a bunch of holy bullshit, my friends.

723
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:32,190
Why not legalize pornography? Hell, and ban work.

724
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,730
Work is what takes the parents away from the kids.

725
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:40,090
Most of the kids these days grow up, they don't have parents at all.

726
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:43,770
They got scarecrows looking over them in some daycare center.

727
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,850
That's about all there is.

728
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,490
They get them to age.

729
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:54,430
If that mother can bear with them, can stand to change diapers until they're one and a half,

730
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:59,110
she'll send them off to that daycare just as quick as she can.

731
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:07,750
Sure, they're still led by human teachers, but that kid ain't got no parents.

732
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:15,870
Because Mr. and Mrs. Christian, Mommy and Daddy say it's so important to have job security.

733
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,550
It's so important.

734
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:25,490
It's so important to be a regular American, a normal American, a normal American who doesn't know his kids any better than he...

735
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:29,450
No, he doesn't know his kids as well as he knows his boss.

736
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:34,210
Or his employees, I suppose would be a better metaphor.

737
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:39,010
And we find, then, the family falling apart.

738
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,990
Oh, they wail and gnash their teeth, our friends do, about how...

739
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,550
How the children...

740
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,830
How the children are exposed to too much...

741
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,330
Too much this and too much that.

742
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:57,410
What they ain't being exposed to is a little bit of Mom and Dad.

743
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,210
That's what they ain't being exposed...

744
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,230
Fuck that pornography!

745
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,090
I don't care if a kid's...

746
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:06,030
You know, well, they're...

747
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,350
They know what to do with their little...

748
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:11,150
The God's gift between their legs...

749
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:12,750
Themselves...

750
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,670
They're gonna grow up to be...

751
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,310
Ah...

752
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:17,550
Friends at Pets!

753
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:17,550


754
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,290
It pisses me off!

755
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,410
It pisses me off!

756
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:20,470
No end!

757
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:21,590
No end!

758
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:24,010
The hypocrisy!

759
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,010
Now, I have nothing against hypocrisy.

760
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:30,650
Every religion must have its fair measure of hypocrisy.

761
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:31,190
But...

762
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:32,370
But...

763
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:36,490
That preacher can get up there on television and...

764
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:39,810
And, oh, he's so glad to keep you normal.

765
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:44,610
Keep you working so hard you don't even know your own wife anymore.

766
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,230
Keep young wifey...

767
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,230
Oh, she's...

768
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,410
Oh, they say, well, the mother's...

769
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:50,990
The woman's place is in the home.

770
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,230
Being a mother.

771
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:53,290
Sure, sure.

772
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:53,870
The woman...

773
00:44:53,870 --> 00:45:00,530
That's the way you stick the mother into the house with the kid 24 hours a day.

774
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:11,330
Turn her into a raving maniac from boredom and pinkness and the insufferable stress of having to raise the kids by herself while old Daddy...

775
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:12,450
Well, he's out doing the job.

776
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,150
He's making his sales calls.

777
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,210
He's drinking a martini or two at lunch.

778
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:16,950
And after work.

779
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:17,910
And on the way to work.

780
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:19,010
And on the way home from work.

781
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:20,370
Oh, yeah, yeah.

782
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,610
And he don't give a...

783
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:23,090
That way...

784
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,050
That way, mama don't get no slack.

785
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:27,270
Mama turns into a nut.

786
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:31,270
Mama turns into a dingy, cooped-up housewife.

787
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:34,330
And you wonder why her kids turn to drugs.

788
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:38,190
They see her just as fucked up as she...

789
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:40,150
As out of it as she can be.

790
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,710
And they think, I don't want to be like her.

791
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:43,850
I'm gonna get fucked up.

792
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:44,990
I don't want to be like her.

793
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:47,230
That's worse than being fucked up.

794
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:50,170
And it's the God's truth, my friend.

795
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:55,130
So, next time them Christians start telling you about how you're...

796
00:45:55,130 --> 00:46:00,190
Just cause your stark fist got some pictures of nakedness and dirty words in it,

797
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,950
Why, you just come back to them and say,

798
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:03,010
Sir?

799
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:08,290
You work so hard that you don't remember your kids' names?

800
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:12,410
Trying to preserve this lovely land?

801
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:14,890
You trying to keep pornography...

802
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:17,830
You work so hard keeping pornography out of the stores...

803
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,430
That your kids hate you.

804
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,970
Makes them want to fuck each other.

805
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:28,030
That's what I say.

806
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:30,190
Let there be slack.

807
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,510
Greetings, beautiful mutants.

808
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:55,630
Look away from the pig and stew, the billowing pie.

809
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,070
From your life of work and time.

810
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,070
Look away.

811
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:04,930
There's a hole in your soul that's burning you alive.

812
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:08,290
Where slack down will never decay.

813
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:10,870
Look away.

814
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,130
Sing a little song.

815
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:12,370
Sing a little song.

816
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:12,370


817
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:12,370


818
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:12,370


819
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:12,370


820
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:12,370


821
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:17,990
Look away from the pig and stew, the billowing pie.

822
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:20,130
Look away.

823
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,810
Triple bow, boy, away.

824
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:27,670
From the pig and stew, the billowing pie.

825
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:54,630
Right,untee!

826
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:54,630


827
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:54,630


828
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:57,270
Where you can hear who you are.

829
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:57,270


830
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:57,270


831
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:01,090
A hi-anya folk show hosts yea-ta,

832
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:01,630
Hail.

833
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:01,630


834
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:01,630


835
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:01,630


836
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:01,630


837
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,570
My 생각을 always be.

838
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:14,150
to the billowing pipe.

839
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:18,410
Go away, go away,

840
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:23,410
back from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

841
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:47,410
If your conflict with normals brings circles and strides,

842
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:51,350
then onward your endings ensue.

843
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:57,310
Bail away from the pigs to the billowing pipe,

844
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:00,850
that's a waiting in the town for you.

845
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:05,370
Look away, look away,

846
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:10,130
from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

847
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,330
Look away,

848
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:15,990
triple-bubble your money back

849
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:19,510
from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

850
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,690
Look away,

851
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:25,270
thank God's head for eternal slack

852
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:28,810
from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

853
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:30,970
Look away,

854
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:34,630
triple-bubble your money back

855
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:38,490
from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

856
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:52,690
Look away,

857
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:53,490
triple-bubble your money back

858
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:53,490


859
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,030
Look away,

860
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:58,090
triple-bubble your money back from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

861
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:58,410
Look away,

862
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:03,050
believed I had to work my way to heaven, and I was afraid the Lord might come on one of my bad days

863
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:06,930
instead of one of my good days, or he might come when I had an unconfessed sin on my conscience,

864
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:12,130
and it took me a long time, 30 years, before I finally got into the word and realized that no

865
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:15,430
one will ever be saved by their works. The coming of Jesus.

866
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:22,070
To pour out the wrath of God upon those who have rejected the grace and the mercy and the love of

867
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:27,070
God. Jesus is not coming back as a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes. He is not coming back to

868
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:32,470
die for the sins of mankind. He is not coming back to shed tears of compassion. He's coming

869
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:37,830
back as a warrior. He's coming back to judge and make war. He is coming back to pour out the wrath

870
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:44,010
of God upon those who have rejected God's gift of love and grace and mercy, and what I was told

871
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:47,910
about the coming of Jesus scared me to death. I was told that when he appeared, there would be the

872
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:53,470
big bang, and the whole universe would cease to exist, and I would go off to live in a spirit

873
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:56,830
world as a disembodied spirit floating around the cloud playing a harp.

874
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:02,530
Well, I couldn't get excited about being a disembodied spirit, about being something kind of a blob that had no

875
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:07,370
personality and no individuality. Sure couldn't get excited about floating around the cloud playing a

876
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:11,190
harp because I grew up in a church that didn't even believe in instrumental music. So how could I get

877
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:16,310
excited about playing a harp for all eternity? So, you know, the whole concept of Jesus coming back

878
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:22,010
just turned me off. And then when I began to realize, number one, that I could know that I was

879
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:26,310
saved. Well, that would probably be real interesting, but, uh...

880
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:29,850
Meanwhile, everybody gripes and complains,

881
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:36,050
Oh, Stang don't give us any money. Oh, Stang ain't taking good care of us.

882
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:41,390
Oh, Stang doesn't do nothing for the church anymore. God.

883
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:46,510
It's disgusting. It's horrible. It's for everything.

884
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:56,850
I've been a hateful guy. So I'm full of hate. But it comes by me hating fair and

885
00:51:57,070 --> 00:52:00,290
square. As Popeye's Pappy once said,

886
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:08,030
I hate the bobbies. God, I hate them. They're everywhere and they are false prophets. If they'll

887
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:10,210
say they're going to do something, then they don't do it.

888
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:19,550
Bobbies. Gimme bobs. Such like scum. Scum lower than pink boys. Yes, because they claim to be

889
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:27,050
subgeniuses. And I have to say only one thing to the bobbies. Thanks for the money.

890
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,190
But I wish you'd send more.

891
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:40,170
So, life offered a bitter pill up for me to swallow. A pill of just, just who the

892
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:49,790
Sogdini's were. Well, half of them aren't Sogdini's at all. They're some virulent form of malaligned normal.

893
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:56,350
Pathetic. Okay, they do. They literally pay.

894
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:01,070
They not only pay the role, all of them came out of mal intentionally

895
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:04,810
to slay the public.

896
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:10,570
Here we go, next.

897
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:17,870
On average.

898
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:25,570
I'm the specification.

899
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:34,150
round things, big heavy round things. The doctors bill the patients. The patients pay

900
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:40,590
the doctors a lot more money than they should because they're patients. I'd rather be a

901
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:48,010
hammer than a nail, my friend. I'd rather be a scalpel than a wound, sir. I'd rather

902
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:55,550
be the surgeon's threat than the wound that gets sewed. Although one, you know, one of

903
00:53:55,570 --> 00:54:01,010
you admit the surgeon's threat gets ripped out from the trash can whereas the wound lives

904
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:08,190
on. The blueness of a wound, though, my friend, will never cleanse away the evil. And there

905
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:17,030
is evil lurking in the church. Evil traders to the subgenius church, yes? And I know and

906
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:22,610
the man in the car next to me knows and all the people around me know that even though

907
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:25,550
Ivan Stang will be brand new then the earlier he gets to be visited, he's never going to

908
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:27,490
This is in pre-scriptures.

909
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,830
That Stang will be branded a traitor.

910
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:31,870
Exiled.

911
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:33,390
Sent away.

912
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:34,910
Actually, disappeared.

913
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:39,370
Stang will disappear from the view of the Subdenys.

914
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:42,370
And he'll be glad to do it, too.

915
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:43,690
He'll say, let them have it.

916
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,250
Not yet.

917
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:47,410
Oh, no siree.

918
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:49,670
I need to make my money back first.

919
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:54,270
But, uh, yeah, they'll pin something on me.

920
00:54:56,310 --> 00:55:01,870
I'll be damn near as bad off as the true Bob for a long time.

921
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:03,750
And so will you, Doug.

922
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:07,690
But we won't be as bad off as the...

923
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:16,850
As those who dare usurp the place of the true Overmen and of J.R. Bob Dobbs on X-Day.

924
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:18,430
No, no, they'll...

925
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,170
Nay, nay.

926
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:24,250
That Tribulation fire will be in the form of a fire.

927
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:24,250


928
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:25,010
Of a vacuum.

929
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:29,370
And ye shall know not the hour it come upon thee.

930
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:31,770
Like a thief in the night.

931
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:35,790
Like a doctor in the operating room.

932
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,070
Doctors of darkness.

933
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:39,150
Yea, they may be.

934
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:45,810
And yet, and yet, these doctors of darkness, sinners, though they were,

935
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:51,830
were the first to bring light back to the planet that had turned gray.

936
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,090
Yes, it's true.

937
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,310
Degenerate scumbags saved the world.

938
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:59,330
It'll say on the...

939
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:02,890
In the imaginary headlines of America...

940
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:05,090
And the planet.

941
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:10,550
And, uh, of course, it'll be America's planet.

942
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:14,790
But on X-Day, the planet will belong to America.

943
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,670
Hell's angels of the world.

944
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,850
Yeah, it's about what it'll...

945
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,810
It'll be like for a long time.

946
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:23,450
Dr. Wellman.

947
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:28,390
And whatever else things listen with ye,

948
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:31,050
in the seclusion of your headphones,

949
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:34,390
trapped within your skull,

950
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:36,250
between those selfsame headphones,

951
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,130
a code,

952
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:39,730
a word,

953
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:42,110
and finally it becomes a deed.

954
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:46,390
And from thence, it becomes history and lies.

955
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:49,350
Yes, all the way through.

956
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:51,470
And nothing, nothing is true.

957
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:54,810
Except for those lies.

958
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,070
Before they became...

959
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:00,090
puzzling evidence.

960
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,230
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

961
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:03,790
They'll never know.

962
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,130
Because the prescriptors will trick you.

963
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:07,970
Yes, they will, Dougie.

964
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:10,270
They'll say one thing,

965
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:12,110
and you'll think they mean another.

966
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:15,410
And what they say will come to pass.

967
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:18,110
But, yea, like the monkey's paw,

968
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:20,730
you don't know what you're gonna get.

969
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:24,510
You cannot judge that book by its cover.

970
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:25,750
No, sir.

971
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:27,290
And it's a deliberate...

972
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:29,330
That's why we put that cover on there.

973
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:30,630
So they'd judge it wrong.

974
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:32,910
They'd think they could judge it.

975
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:36,950
Oh, they'd be judges standing in their pools of...

976
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:39,210
of unpeed urine.

977
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:44,470
Yes, for if they were standing in the urine that had been peed,

978
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:46,890
why, their minds would be free.

979
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:50,550
And their souls would be part of the great beyond.

980
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,070
Forever.

981
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:54,410
But instead they hold it in.

982
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:55,890
They're afraid to pee.

983
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,030
Yes, they are the pee-shy.

984
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,870
And they are also the bobbies.

985
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:02,750
And I hate them.

986
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:04,270
I hate the bobbies.

987
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,110
I hate the bobbies.

988
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,670
And I love myself.

989
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:10,970
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.

990
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:13,070
Let there be slack.

991
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,130
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

992
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,090
Ugh.

993
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:18,530
Ugh.

994
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:20,490
Well, okay, we're off the air.

995
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:22,010
Aren't we?

996
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:32,810
When the sky won't always be blue

997
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:38,910
And there's people outside trying to fool you

998
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:45,050
But there's three things I know to be true

999
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:51,630
And it's death in Texas and Bob.

1000
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:05,390
That's good, I suppose.

1001
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:12,010
Good, good in any way that we can bear the word of slack.

1002
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:14,110
Bob's word of slack.

1003
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:15,690
To the slackless.

1004
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:17,510
Well, let us do it.

1005
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:20,590
No matter how much money must be lost

1006
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:24,830
Or blood spilled in our noble quest

1007
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:28,090
For the greatness, not of ourselves, nay,

1008
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:29,890
But of that man Bob.

1009
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:33,830
That great fingerhead of knowledge

1010
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:38,510
Who leads us beckoning, tempting, ever onwards.

1011
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:39,650
Ugh.

1012
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:39,710
Ugh.

1013
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:40,410
Ugh.

1014
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,310
Smell that church air.

1015
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:46,710
This is a wonderful, wonderful life.

1016
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:51,310
We've been born into an action-backed century, yes?

1017
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:53,850
We'll live to see the end of the world.

1018
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:55,430
And then some.

1019
00:59:55,790 --> 01:00:00,830
So I hope that if you are excited about the series of broadcasts on the cults

1020
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,870
That you'll be sure and pass the word around

1021
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:06,710
And have you and your friends and neighbors tune in next Monday

1022
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:09,630
When we will pick up with our consideration of the cults.

1023
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:10,790
But in the meantime...

1024
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:17,550
You've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1025
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:21,830
For free information, write to

1027
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:39,610
Or see www.subgeniusradio.com

1028
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:42,550
Praise Bob!

1029
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:46,190
For sire, there is no more money.

1030
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:48,610
We gotta get some money!

1031
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:51,810
That dirty, purgish, hark-a-backed, flackin' whartin'

1032
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:54,070
Philip Bunker Burton, Perkaluma Burton

1033
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:55,250
Thurton Buster and I

1034
01:00:55,250 --> 01:01:00,430
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show

1035
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:03,870
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1036
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:06,690
To help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1037
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,610
And not just this show, but Subgenius Radio.

1038
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:09,610


1039
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:09,610


1040
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:09,610


1041
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:11,710
Subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1042
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:15,190
But if you truly love Bob

1043
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:18,810
And want some of that slack back to rebound to you

1044
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:22,710
You should go to subgenius.com front page

1045
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:24,210
Or especially the radio page

1046
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:26,230
Or the catalog store pages

1047
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:29,630
And help out financially as best you can.

1048
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:33,970
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty

1049
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:37,650
And we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1050
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:40,550
But some of you still have jobs.

1051
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:43,930
Even five bucks makes a big difference

1052
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:47,470
Even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1053
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,850
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1054
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:53,190
All we're saying is that

1055
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:56,570
Glow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs

1056
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:58,670
If you don't pay Dobbs.

1057
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:02,250
We also take checks and money orders to

1058
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:04,150
Subgenius Foundation
