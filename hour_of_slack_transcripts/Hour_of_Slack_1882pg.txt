Ordnance aerial bombardment meaning to blow up the whole country of Iraq with a shockwave.
One of America's brand new weapons of destruction.
I was wondering about the brand new ones, you know, because there's supposed to be some fancy new noisemakers and big earth rattlers.
From the Centurion, you will all die under the power of the fist of the fossil.
See Kyle, baby.
Now, the propaganda that goes back and forth is marvelous because I was reading just a little while ago that the evil Saddam Husseins were,
had ordered a whole bunch of fake American and British army uniforms so he could dress up the Fayadin in these uniforms
who would then go out and commit atrocities on their fellow Iraqis as a propaganda routine,
you know, to make it look like how evil and terrible.
The.
Demonic British people are, you know, how they are.
I heard they really were demonic.
Have you ever heard of Mad Bomber Harris?
He started the whole idea of blowing the living hell out of Iraq in the 1920s when they were close to independence.
He thought, why not use the new bombers, you know, the brand new bombers in the air we've got and just keep dropping them on those peasant villages,
you know, kind of toughen them up and soften them at the same time a little bit.
During these last few months, I've been trained by Al Qaeda and I'm weak.
But because they know all these Otomec Muslims,
this had made a huge difference to whether your crimes would benefit Iraq but the one thing that really brothelers cannot do is bastardize people and make heroin violators and break the überệnings of the armed forces.
I even met with them in Mehmetableh's room.
I met with them in 비핐� Xuan in Manama every night.

When I got arrested he 투기에 to use aatives close to Iraq and I got caught five minutes in a car.


He was the prevР.
We can be summed up in one word, evil.
I am committed to defeating not only the good work of charities, but the values that will
bring lasting peace.
And we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world towards suicide
and murder.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Let's roll.
Kill, kill, kill for peace.
Kill, kill, kill for peace.
You know, he actually used the phrase, now I may have, kill for peace, I could
swear I heard the Emperor say, the gold is mine.

All of this war is peace.
He may have said some other things, but at one point he actually said the phrase, war
is peace.
Friends, it's 1984.
1984 is 19 years late.
That means X day will be the year 2017.
Waste bomb.
Waste bomb.
19 years, you've been in a vast, deep, deep, colorless sleep.
Stuck to the ground, needs one of the baby incubators in Kuwait city.
Waste bomb.















You've got nothing to awake, and yet you cannot.
Until 1984.
When your dreams come true.
When your brother's bigger than anything.
Oh lord, I'm tired and sad.
And I want you all to die.
Beware of the toothless jaws of 1984.
I've been a waste of time.
I just keep on picking up pieces of corn which have fallen out of that mouth there and we
might stay alive one more day in American decade.
Or am I a waste of time.
I've been a waste of time.
I'm sorry.
That'd be weird.
But hang on everybody.
Right now.
Bob Lent.
Bob Lent.
Bob Lent.
Bob Lent.
Have any favorite Bob songs?
God.
You're going to cut off a lot of vital tissue.
Right, right.
What?
So you think they're playing this song in Baghdad right now?
Or on the way to Baghdad?
I think on the way to Baghdad, there's a lot of guys finishing in their foxholes,
dreaming about their foxholes and crying in their boots.
Where's my...
Dreaming about those boot jobs they're going to get when they get back home.
Yep.
Get their boots enlarged.
Shave medulla oblongatus.
They're going to look like all the rest of the kids,
only nobody knows they're going to be different.
Way different.
Changed.
A different kind of tattoo.
Well, they get the free smallpox inoculations and the free tracking devices.
Well, that tattoo's your inner.
It's pretty good, but that's not the whole of it.
That's only part.
Yeah, they get the holes, too.
Yeah, well, that's only part of it, too.
And then to the tattoo.
Yes, it makes them lift their leg when the bus comes up to the bus stop.
If they're well-trained.
Well, some of them have to wear the collars, the special...
Well, let's just call them...
I know I do.
Digital angels, you know what I mean?
If I didn't have this collar on, Dave, I'd be wetting myself.
Well, that's...
We can thank the digital angel for setting you straight.
That's right.
If it weren't for this modern age, I'd just be a vegetable.
Well, where do they put your chip?
Where do they put your chip?
All over me.
I mean, there's tons of them.
Oh, like your pores.
For every organ that still works.
Did Papa Joe ever get that collar removed from his...
Nah.
His was embedded into his vertebrae.
Did we ever get those collars removed from this show?
Those barnacles?
Those grafted-on tics?
If people remember the early days, we asked each and every one of you
if you'd like to become a closer member of the show's team out there.
If you feel you are not properly sedated,
please call...

Failure to do so may result in criminal prosecution for drug evasion.
Welcome back to our program.
Please continue.
I believe most Pacific Islander parents like using products like hairspray or glue as an inhalant to get high.
I'm here to let other Pacific Islander parents know we need to care about using more serious drugs.
If you need drugs or ideas on how to keep your drugs,
please call Bob.
Welcome back to our program.
That was a lemur cut.
Tonight's collages are almost, but not all, by Mr. F. Lemur.
The second of the two Bush cut-ups heard earlier was by someone named Edo at f***itall.com.
The Star Spangled Banner was by Mark Mothersbaugh.
For your dating info, this show was actually assembled on March 9th, 2003,
the year of duct tape and plastic sheeting.
Isn't duct tape and plastic sheeting just another version of duck and cover?
Duck and cover.
What did duck and cover tell you?
Duck and cover told you that if you just ducked when the bomb went off...
And put a newspaper over your butt.
Yeah, if you just ducked.
Just duck.
Duck!
Oh, there's a nuclear bomb.
Duck!
Then everything will be okay.
You will win.
Well, they were talking about amphibian birds at the time.
When they asked you to duck and cover, they wanted you to run out to the nearest pond
and grab little turkey boy or a little quacky and stick him under your shirt and carry him home.
And when they ask you now, that's what the duct tape is all about.
These are all reasons to duck and take subconscious.
They're playing with your mind.
Duck and cover.
Duck and cover.
There, no more duck and cover, nothing in this whipping.
Do you know why you are ducking?

It was magnitude when theUCKER was down.
The Captain got up, the absolutamente!
Side Tom till you're a seven and a half.
Five to nine.

Die!
Die!
Die!
Die!
is dropped from planes either as a spray or in gas bombs.
But should enemy raiders use gas against your community,
there is no reason for fear or panic.
Because if you know what to do,
you can protect yourself and safeguard your family
against the menace of gas from the air.
Of course, that's Arcana.
You know what Arcana is?
Do you know what wisdom is?
Do you know the meaning of the eye in the soft?
Of the eye within the eye within the eye within the eye?
Are your balls ready to rumble?
Are they ready to roll?
Do you know the meaning of love?
Pour me another mug of that there iron soft, would you, there barkeep?
You had enough, buddy boy. I'm going to catch you off.
You're babbling to everybody in the damn barn.
Everyone's tired of listening.
That's not for him, it's for me.
I had enough.
Gold Akashic record, damn it.
Back in the day, everybody was doing my song.
Yeah, you got a gold.
We got your astral card right here, buddy.
And it says that you haven't passed your limit
and you've been around more times than anybody else in this bar.
So could you please shut up?
Shut up, man.
Stop drinking that wisdom shit.
Don't be sucking on the wisdom eyeball.
Too much is always better.
Not enough.
I'm a regular.
It's almost as bad.
I'm a regular.
Oh, you're quite a regular now, be that.
Just let me check further here.
What is the elliptical meaning of that?
There's only one eyeball.
I'm going to chase you with an elliptical eyeball
and then fork all around and round and round and round.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's like...
Well, there's no train of thought.


We're sketching.
This time we're taking the express.
We're guilty of not doing enough about the war.
That just keeps coming.
I keep feeling so bad about not doing enough.
Well, you could suck the cycloptic wisdom teeth
and then you would understand what to do
as Laguerre pronounces itself a bonus.
Which magazine should I subscribe to
that would, you know, be the right thing to do?
Martial arts, survival, mercenary, merc.
Magazines like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.









I'm going to have to pull off some pretty big feet
to live through this, I think.
I mean, size 12.
I was just going to learn to give really good oral sex
to great big tough guys.
That was how I was going to live through the end of civilization.
As a sniveling pansy
awaiting for the trains of military
to come through town
and to wait for one of those...
I want them to say,
that's the best barrel.
That barrel over there, that's the best one.
Yeah.
You better hope no fish jump out of it.
The prisoner in that barrel,
I don't know who she is, but she's good.
You know it's not a woman, man.
Shut up.
Those are orgasmic.
That's how you get through the end times.
Unless you have the biggest gun.
You take your duct tape,
you take your duct tape,
you take a big Hershey bar
because that's the survival candy bar.
You want to be able to take small, small pieces of it.
You duct tape this candy bar right up into your crotch there.
I didn't know...
You duct tape and just strap it right in there.
Is that the way you're really supposed to do it?
You're supposed to strap duct tape into your crotch?
I mean...
No, the food.
Hershey bar.
You're trading materials.
Oh, the loin packs.
Those are actual things that are trademarked.
Yeah, because that's what you're going to use to trade.
You're not pouring chocolate into your crotch.
The natives or the surviving wretches
in whatever country far away from America
that you flee to.
My dehydrated loin pack is leaking
and I've noticed sauce.
Oh, here's another one.
The reason you have to flee America
is because the Americans are taking over.
Yeah.
Yes.
I'm a political prisoner, man.
We better bring back the pillory and stocks
and stuff in there.
Today,
a U.S. nuclear fishing boat torn apart.
How one man's search for truth
almost cost him his hate.
Thank you.
Well, welcome, ladies.
And gentlemen, to this edition of Up the French.
It's not going to be pleasant.
I hate the French.
They'll always be ridiculous.
Yeah, the French are Nazis, as a matter of fact.
Lee?
Pat, a concern of several European terrorists.
Pat?
Lee, it's shocking.
The French Nazis build terrorism.
They are an instrument, an agent of terror.
Lee?
That's right, Pat.
Israel is carefully assessing
CBN News Middle East correspondent, Chris Schull.
Right, Pat?
Well, it could be bloody blood all over the place.
And just that simple.
Lee?
Want good cranberries and cancer and heart disease.
That's too bad, Pat, because I was thinking about
having a big old piece of bloodstream pie with disease on top.
How about the phrase, axis of Putin's soul?
It's in Texas.
No, not really.
Oh.
In Bosnia, they built a Mall of America in Bosnia now.
Well, they're working on Disneyland East,
which is what this guy on all sides was saying.
Disneyland Far East.
That's what this is all about.
Disneyland East.
The largest Kmart in the world.
Have you heard the new chain, Bag Daddy?
The pants and the suit at the same time?
That is a disgusting prescription for anyone without brain cells.
What's your entire word yet, Jar?
So the bookie's taking bets on when this thing is going to start,
exactly when they're going to, like, boom, you know, go let the gates down.
They're laying the odds down.
Yeah.


When the first shot will be fired.
And it won't be shot.
Sit down.
From a shotgun.
We'll have nowhere to run.
And here comes Big Bad George.
Now, that was a true honor.
That's what Stein said.
In the military industrial complex.
Speaking of strange showbiz,
after the king of the universe spoke tonight,
suddenly they cut over to saying,
it looks like we're in hot pursuit of Osama bin Laden.
He's been spotted in the border.
I've got a standing back.
They're going to do it just like cops.
You know, you're going to have the music in the background and stuff.
And he's going to be running through like with the dachshund,
I think, chasing and biting his ass.
And then when he gets up on the top of one of those,
you know, old industrial warehouse buildings,
and they pull him down screaming and swearing in Arabic.
This is earlier today down in public square.
What's that spell?
Come on, all of you big strong men.
Uncle Sam, need your help?
Again, got himself in a terrible jam.
We down yonder in Baghdad.
Where are you?
We're going to have a whole lot of fun.
And it's one, two, three.
What are we fighting for?
Don't ask me.
I don't give a damn.
My next stop is Baghdad.
And it's five, six, seven.
Open up the pearly gates.
Because I just inhaled some anthrax.
I'm all going to die.
Now come on, Wall Street.
Don't be.
Why are you saying you have such a perplexed look on your face
as if you'd actually inhaled anthrax yourself?
Well, actually, I was thinking about some of my buddy's kids
who were on their way over there.
I sometimes think about the soldiers.
Usually you're preoccupied with buds and squids,
and now you're thinking about your buddy's kids.
How open-hearted are you?
You're not singing along.
I don't think you want to stop this war.
Oh.
You.
Do you really take yourself seriously?
I have big teeth and big glasses.
We think you're stupid.
You must forgive me.
You show your stupidity by assuming that we're like you.
You've got three or four D.I.A. and C.I.E.
evidence at your fucking door.
Oh, my God.
All right.
He almost passed out.
It's time to play Name That War.
You're five miles south of Bogota City.
You're in the rain forest.
Oh, my God.
What do the initials F-A-R-C stand for?
It's protest.
I think that's another reason they're having the war now
so that the protesters can't protest
because it's all zero degrees.
There'd be a lot more people out there.
Well, that's what the weather control people say.
It's ruining it.
Rubber bands and aluminum sulfide do a dandy treat make.
She's suspended from arrogance.
And left to wait.
Children who flop and children who flip
will freeze in the rain like a big old drip.
Wow.
It's about weather control.
It's about the Lusitania, too,
but you've got to be a real conspiracy buff.
Cowboy poetry is so romantic.
I was going to play my mouth for it,
but I've been shamed.
It gets my heart all fluttered.
Yes, you have been shamed.
By the grace of God.



By the grace of God.
And by the grace of God.
You will know me in a moment.
This song is depressing you, Chad.
They start with Bob.
War is depressing, Dave.
Stop thinking about all them body bags.
War is depressing.
That's all I can think of is body bag after bag
coming out of Arlington.
Yeah.
Back of those old planes.
Everybody's real gung-ho right now.
Everybody's real like, yeah,
this is going to be like the Super Bowl coming up.
Oh, yeah.
Wait till Zadon drops.
Drop on them chemical bombs.
On TV.
The right-wing jocks are going so crazy.
Wait till our boys are coming home
with their skin peeled off their faces.
Yeah, and it's communicable, too,
up to six generations.
We'll see how gung-ho they all are.
I think it's a pretty small everybody
that's real excited.
They wish they would have gone.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What?
What did you say?
I think it's a pretty small everybody
that's all excited.
I do, too.
I think it's more bunch of people going,
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
A good friend of mine was telling me about,
but a good friend of mine,
he's a blue-collar kind of guy,
works, you know, doing blue-collar work,
and telling me how all those guys,
they all listen to Rush Limbaugh,
and they're all so, you know.
Oh, those guys are crazy.
They gung-ho about everything, about it.
I was just going to tell you guys something
I heard on the Savage show.
That guy is so nuts.
He claimed that a demonstrator
waded through a police line
and a line of horses,
grabbed a horsey by its bridle,
punched it, and knocked it down on the ground.
A demonstrator did that?
Like, blazing.
We need those guys in back here.
Let's get back to promoting the war.

It's reality.
Face the flag, you son of a bitch.
Take a good long look.
What you're seeing now can't be found in a history book.
It's the present.
The future, son, is being written now.
You're the one to write it.
The flag can show you how.
You know what?
You know what?
What it stands for.
What its makers meant.
Think.
Speak.
Privilege of dissent.
To think our leaders might be wrong
to stand and tell them so.
I've got to touch a hangover, bureaucrat.
Don't push me.
These are the things that other men
under other flags will never know.
But responsibility,
that's the cost that free men must bear.
You know, if we had any moral character,
we wouldn't be standing here covered
with mud drinking.
If you don't accept that,
somebody ought to belt you in the mouth.
Face the flag of stars and bars,
of red and white and blue.
A flag that guarantees the rise
for men like me and you.
Face the flag, son, and face reality.
My mind is a globe with whirling,
transient nodes of thought,
careening through a cosmic vapor of invention.
Our strength and our freedoms are based in unity.
The flag is but a symbol, son.
The world's greatest nation.
As long as it keeps flying,
there's cause for celebration.
So do what you gotta do, but don't give up.
But always keep in mind,
God has a heart on for Marines,
because we kill everything we see.
Face the flag, son,
and thank God it's still there.

Lots of ESO Swamp Radio tonight
from WCSB Cleveland at wcsb.org
if you want to hear it streaming live on Thursday nights.
And that features Princess Wee Chess Smith,
yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave
in Extreme Union with himself.
Extreme Union with himself?
A form of Tourette's Syndrome that affects people
only when they call radio.
You're not gonna stop the patin'.
You're not gonna stop the patin'.
It's the Watson-Hyde Syndrome, eh?
I found a note on my desk that said,
a witch with Tourette's.
A witch with Tourette's?
Yeah, and I can't figure out what the heck
that note was supposed to refer to.
I wanna see him go to war.
Was that a warning to myself?
I wanna see him go to war just so that
there's a lot of dead people all over the place.
You mean the awards in Baghdad?
Yeah.
Hosted by Jewel, Tommy Franks.
Yeah, he's gonna be the new Sheik of Baghdad.
Of Arabi.
Sheik Franks.
Can you see him with a kaftan on his forehead?
A kaftan?
That's a pair of underpants.
Slice his throat.
Spice his head.
Get the barbecue ready.
General Tommy, your meat is my meat,
Frankfurter himself.
He views the world as his hot dog,
ready to be eaten.
Barbecued and served with a choice toxic mustard.
I wanna be the mustard.
You are the mustard.
You're the glint in Tommy Franks's eye.
While friends and lovers mourn your silly grave.
Look, it's the barrel of a tank.
I have a business for you, darling.
I forgot news for you, darling.
Here's a tactical nuke.
Up your ass.
Jesus.
Get back, Baghdaddy.
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
to the Arabian Nights.
Don't those guys have, like, genies
and flying carpets and stuff?
Yeah.
And what about the...
Can't they, like, rub this lamp
and have hordes of scimitar-wielding
balloon pantaloons?
Turbans.
Yeah, Alibaba, 40 thieves type guys.
What open sesame guys.
Right, open sesame guys.
People who make it happen.
Businessmen in boxer shorts.
Turban young fez drivers
in Pocono Oriental cabs.
Small, medium, and large-sized shakes.
All your bones included.
He tried to kill my daddy.
I killed everybody's daddy, man.
They killed Daddy Junior.
Well, things aren't going to kill my daddy.
What would Jesus do now?
War, war, war, war, war, healing.
Demons.
Racism.
Sexism.
Anti-Semitism.
Arab-bashing.
Anti-Islamism.
Gay-bashing.
War.
Britain.
Britain.
War.
War.
War.
War.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Yeah, I used that on the X-rated hour of Slack
just last week.
The one that's not played on radio stations,
but only on the intranet.
And the inter-net.
I can't see.
He can see.
I can't see.
I can't see.
I can't see.
I can't see.
I can't see.






Maybe I can see.
I can't see.
Oh.
Every time you guys cuss,
that ends up on a secret show.
There's a song going out for George.
The Magu link.
The Emperor.
The king of the universe.
King of the universe.
King.
Ray.
Ray.
Oh, baby.
Ray del Cosimo.
El Imperador de Total Cosimo.
Ray wants me to go up there all day.
How ready am I?
Hear me.
What the hell?
The sound of my voice.
We might.
You must get that, Sadam.
And I've made my choice.
When y'all voted me sheriff, I said I was gonna rid this town of these barb-
I'm gonna do it anyway.
I will conquer the Assyrians with my funny fake goatee and pharaoh hat.
You may think that I'm a fool.
You may think that I'm a fool.
But you are a fool.
If you believe we can quack out of this, Maya-
Who gets the harems?
The harems?
Yeah, the harems.
I've heard a lot about harems in those palaces in Baghdad.
No, I just thought that was an esophical grunt when someone said-
No, man, you know, the sultans would get harems, and-
There must be harems.
They don't have sultans anymore in Iraq.
Well, there's always-
Yeah, right.
Just like they don't have kings here, right?
Right.
It's an undemocratic people's republic.
Yeah, I suppose they do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sultans.
Yeah.
Sultans of Swig.
Sultans of the ornament.
Chairman Mao had a harem.
Pharaohs.
Jack Kennedy had a harem.
And you, sir-
Where do they keep the pharaohs?
Or no Jack Kennedy?
I know Mao Zedong, my friend, and you, I know Mao Zedong.
Actually, that's a pretty old turf there.
That's, you know, the Tigris and Euphrates.
Oh, yeah, that's the oldest.
It's the birthplace of civilization.
Mesopotamia.
Yeah.
They're afraid of the-
The Fertile Crescent.
Yeah, speaking of Fertile Crescent, that's-
The amount of archaeological cool-sign.
Stuff that's going to get buried a little deeper is just horrifying.
Well, that's the hex theory.
That he's trying to get rid of that.
But that's up to Saddam.
That's up to Saddam Hussein.
It's his choice.
This land is cursed by a Sumerian god, and you must get rid of it and destroy it.
No?
Something like that?
If only it was just going to get buried, but you know it's going to get smashed to smithereens.
Just like that little ibex.
Which was the ancient civilization in which the ladies did not wear shirts?
Oh, Manoa.
Yeah, right.
The Manoans.
Yes, my favorite civilization, yes.
They had the cool labyrinths and the bull-headed monster guys.
They would ride bulls and all the men would applaud.
And they'd quit, yeah, and they'd make fun of the Cretans.
We need just one victory.
Just like we do.
God's mitans.
And we're on to North Korea.
The church of the sub-Cretans.
That's what we should tell everybody over there in the war zones tonight.
God's mitans!
That's what the Fuhrer used to say.
Dons.
And we're saying it again.
God's mitans!
What does that mean, Dave?
It means God is with us.
He's talking about the mitans.
I'm putting on the mitans.
I'm putting on the mitans.
God's mitans.
God's mitans.










God is with us.
Oh, yeah, sure.
They believed it in those days, and they believe it now.
In the bowling alleys and parking lots around America.
In stubby Sam City.
In Carl's Magic Theater.
Every place you might go and have your hair tortured.
Or maybe have your feet upturned.
They believe this myth.
This mythological creature called war takes care of everything.
A shalool ha la la la Bob.
La la.
A shalool la la ha la Bob.
Bob Akbar?
Bob Akbar!
He is great.
Greater than my shoe size and twice as small as my cranium.
Bob Akbar!
To begin with, it may be surprising to know that radiation is invisible rays that we call radiation.
They are about the size of table salt or fine sand.
We don't worry about radiation.
Radiation would not affect us much, for instance, because any material will keep the penetrating rays from hurting us.
Within an hour after a massive enemy attack, fallout in the vicinity of any nuclear groundburst will be destroyed beyond repair.
Suppose a nuclear explosion takes place at 12 noon.
By 1 o'clock, all the fallout is down.
If fallout settles on your food, the food itself isn't harmed or made radioactive.
Fallout swallowed accidentally with food or in drinking water would do you no harm.
So we would not have to take precautions using everyday methods of food preparation.
And hungry people should not be denied animals because of possible contamination.
If we remember these facts,
if we act intelligent,
we can increase our chances of nuclear attack.
Many people have difficulty understanding how blood and tissues are pulled up into the mushroom cloud.
That's why the federal government has a nationwide program.
The goal is a raging nuclear furnace that shoots out showers of fallout.
Adequate fallout for every man, woman and child.
This goal can be reached.
For with radiation,
we can face the facts about the nuclear age.

There are new security measures here because of the terrorist activity going on.
The homeland is locked down.
Yeah, and there was a Patriot Act stamp to the door for your reading edifice.
Dave, have you looked in a mirror?
There's one stamped on your forehead.
Lick the postage stamp, man.
So I can look through my...
Yeah, so you don't forget for one second what the rules are, buddy.
One second.
You can't forget the rules.
Are you going to be a teen player?
I'm watching the phone.
Are you with us or are you against us?
Private?
Are you privates private or are they mine?
I belong to you, sir.
You're privates are my privates and you're privates are my privates.
Just keep your privates private, okay?

It was another normal night and I got done fighting with my wife
So I went down to the bar and just made all day, can't roll
Since I was a little kid, they've been the two best friends
That a man could ever hope for in this world
Now I'm a normal guy and I work all day for my money
And I fear the good Lord like I know I should
I ain't no new age coot, but I gotta get this off my chest
And put this tragedy behind me now for good
I remember getting drunk and I remember falling down
When someone laid me on a pool table and not a bit too soon
Then through the blinding lights two creatures stared into my eyes
As had the jukebox or a flying saucer spinning round the room
And I tell myself this couldn't have been a member of the human race
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men from outer space
Well it hit me like trouble in the back of my head
Knocked me clean out of my shoes
And when I woke up, Lord, I wished that I was dead
I had got off the case of those abduction blues
This must have been an abduction, Lord
Cause I don't know what happened
But I'm not sure what happened

Hit me like a bolt out of the blue
Now I say, can they look crazy?
But I know that it weren't them
Say the things that they can do and never do
Well, when at last I woke
Both my legs, they had been broke
Both my eyes were black
And my ears were stringing bad
I'd seen enough of nasty things
But this was the worst case
Of intergalactic relations I've ever had
And I tell myself this couldn't have been a member of the human race
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men from outer space
Well it hit me like trouble in the back of my head
Knocked me clean out of my shoes
And when I woke up, Lord, I wished that I was dead
I had got off the case of those abduction blues
This must have been an abduction, Lord
Cause I don't know what happened
Hit me like a bolt out of the blue
Now I say, can they look crazy?
But I know that it weren't them
Say the things that they can do and never do
Never do
The Ballad of Zeke and Earl
Hank Floyd and the Swerving Headlights
From Interstellar Cattle Drive
Friends, that's www.swervingheadlights.com
Before that, Lemur collages
War is hell, my friends
But Bob brings hope and confusion
1993, copyrighted, yeah
Oh, yeah, after the brain
2003, I mean
What column am I saying?
Which century?
1993, copyrighted, yeah

1903
This might be 1903, Chaz
The conspiracy is so powerful
But we don't know what year this really is
And Bob could show up any second
For all we know, it's July
Sure, there's snow on the ground
But it might be July, for all we know
They might have turned everything
We don't even know if this is Earth, man
No, we don't even know if the polar caps are the same ones we're wearing
In fact, this might, for all we know, be a hideously polluted Mars
And what we know is that this is not the Earth
We call Mars the Earth left behind
No
After we polluted it the first time
Or they polluted it, see
I had the same
I had a parallel thought
I won't say that the parallel lines met
But I had a parallel thought
That they had gone into our brains
Deep into our corpus callosum
And the other pithy parts
And they had reprogrammed everything
To such a point
That I was looking out my window
And I was on another planet
And we'd all been moved in our sleep
Well, it wasn't us
It was the powers that be
The big guys, you know
The ones that were there for us
That weigh over 500, 600 pounds
Not to mention the ones inside your own head, dude
Well, they don't live in Telemetry City
And they don't give me commands
The ones in my head, dude
Do you remember how to get to Shell Beach?
Yeah, it was very distinctly a Shell Beaches experience
Right, like that movie
Cool City or Dark City
Or Dark Coolness or whatever it was
Night Town
Night Town, yeah
Going down to Night Town
Hey, but I think the big news of the week
Is really the, uh
That Pioneer 10 winked off
He knows how to cue
He knows, pioneer
Pioneer 10, 20, 28 years out there
And it's out there now
Right this very moment
There's a piece of us
Booking ass
Out of the solar system
And it's manned by two kiboshes
And a piece of pie
And that is science, man
That is the expansion
Of our ever-lessened
Ever-pubescent
Lusty waves
20,000 years ago
20,000 years from now
A robot will find it
And sell it on eBay for billions
Because it will be the oldest
Known thing built by the
Extinct human race
That is well said
Because I thought you were going to say
He's going to smell it and sell it to an ape
And start it all over again
You know, that's how it usually starts
Well, that may be how it started at one point
But I personally don't think so
I think that we
I think that the Yetis force evolved
The humans so that they would
Send that pioneer thing out into space
It smells like rotting garbage, though
To the country western singers
Yeah, and Johnny Paycheck died
Well, we talked about that last week
Well, he actually fell asleep
And nobody's been able to wake him up yet
So they threw a big old wake
And they tossed him in the earth
Is this this week's show or last week's show?
I don't know anymore
Johnny Cash's birthday was this today
Or a week ago today?
Is it January or is it Julyuary?
It's one of those days
One of those 70-year-old days
How old was Johnny?
Your babies grow up to be couples
Mamas don't let your babies
Don't let them smoke froth
And dress up like girls
Grow little titties
And go on girls
Don't make them grow little titties
We'll try not, moms
Don't tell them not to
That's just what they'll want to do
Mamas don't let your babies go to X-Day
Don't let them have
A baby
Operations that change their sexes
It's a twisted, sick, demented bunch of people
Mamas, please
If you hear me
If your babies do survive the war
If they do come home from the war
Don't let them go to X-Day
Because they never really come home
From X-Day
They won't be babies no more
You think a war might spank their booty?
X-Day is going to spank their brains out
This will be the sixth X-Day
Or what we call Sixth Sex Day
Sixth
Sick
There will be some six sex
There will be six hundred and sixty-six
Sick
Sex monkeys
Spelled sick, sick, sick
With S-I-C-S-I-C
As is, as is, as is
Spelling out Bob with their butts
Mooning the sky
For the satellites to read
And you'll be the quote marks on the end
I'll be the queen of procreation
Your two cheeks
I'll be the lizard woman
Pointing up at the satellites
Of Ashcroft
Ah
We'll
Be the quotes on Bob's butt name
Attention!
Attention!
This is your beloved leader
Og the Exalted
There will be a special giant joy rally today
At Og Memorial Stadium
First let me say that this trip was made possible
Only by our dauntless chief
Og the Magnificent
Introducing
The new producer of Og Power
Which runs most of our industry
Naturally I protected government property
By making the saucer invisible
Yes, I brought the secrets back with me
And here they are
The big secret is of course oil
Which has brought a better life
To all the people in the USA
But the key to making oil work for everybody
Is competition
Fellow Martians
I thank you
Hmm
You know what this means Cosmic
You bet I do Og
It means that you're through
So why don't you get lost
Yes, the real secret is not only a great source of energy
But also the freedom to make it work for everybody
And if you have both of these things
Any goal is possible
It's destination unlimited
Man continually strives to replace the old with the new
A quarter of a mile high skyscraper's tower
With convenient rest and recreational facilities for all
On many of the buildings are landing decks
For helicopters and autogyros
Rich in sunshine is the city of 1960
On all express city thoroughfares
The rights of way have been so rooted
As to displace outmoded business sections
And undesirable slum areas whenever possible
Somebody who had ch-go-nary
It's a long way from here
A man meetsuke
On a stone Duluth
And a man who siles
For green rice
Off to a beaver
Beansprouts
For all that 익
Ways
that affix to your testicles
now have to be color-coded
and there's like a warning
that you have to sign off on
or some sort of procreative gesture
you have to make towards the wind.
I don't know.
When will the superhero alien
come and take us away?
Stang, we've been waiting and waiting.
Me too.
When will the rugby trade
come and take us away?
If now wasn't a better time than any,
I don't know what is.
Yeah, really, man.
Don't look at me.
Well, we're trying not to.
I've got a Bob's phone number.
But you're right there.
No, no, I'm just a PR pack, man.
I'm supposed to go.
Why?
We don't know.
Well, we don't.
We don't know what year it is
and we don't know.
I know this.
Bob said that the X's
would come July 5th, 1998.
Obviously, it is not yet July 5th, 1998.
Perhaps we'll be lucky
and tomorrow will be.
You're off by 14 years
by the Mayan calendar,
which is given affixed as July 5th.
The Mayan calendar is covered
with some sort of
year-end calendar.

Yellowish juice.
Mayan, as opposed to urine.
Yours and mine.
Urine and mine.
Oh!
Yeah, oh, oh.
You were talking about
the Andean calendar
of the...
The prepubescent one.
Husky people of the Andes.
Yes, the Husky.
And what exactly happens
at 7 a.m.?
On 2012,
a bunch of the Mayan elder gods
come down from the clouds.
That's what happens.
Of the year 1998,
Bob's good buddies
from Planet X
who happen to be
sex goddesses
will come down
or up or in
from another dimension.
They'll arrive at some way.
Yeah, yeah.
Or rather,
we shall be vacated.
We will vacate
this evacuation chamber,
this great latrine
called Earth Farm 1,
where the aliens have raised us
in order to feed off
of our anguish and pain.
And they'll have a great dessert
of those left behind
in their anguish
and pain.
They especially do love
the ones we're raised
in their own filth, don't they?
are punished, and the
deuce-paying, squeaky ministers
are squeaky clean.
Ah.
Rubbed.
Rubbed down.
Pure of impurities.
It's Peter the Parrot.
Oh!
Wait, the biggest thing.
Hello?
Can you have Oren call home?
No.
Oren, please call home.
Hey.
His honey is irked.
How could we...
I mean, yeah.
I mean, but wait a minute.
Hey.
Hey.
Now, come on.
Like, dudes, like, hold on.
Now, hey.
Wait, everybody.
Like, put the pipe down, man.
Yeah.
Hold on.
Just open those eardrums.
Wait.
Mr. Rogers died.
Once again.
We have another casualty.
Now, you know the real
end times are near
when Mr. Rogers makes his escape.
He tried to get in that
little train.
He got off, man.
He got off.
He tried to shrink his mind
and get in the little train
and take off to Smallville.
When I heard Mr. Rogers died,
I got real scared.
Well, but he's with his grandpa now.
That's because he's...
He's the implant.
I got real scared, man,
because I just know
if there's no Mr. Rogers here anymore,
there's nothing to keep the aliens
from toasting this place.
What about the Teletubbies?
It's the implant.
That's why he got scared
when Mr. Rogers died.
Yeah, they'll be leading the charge.
It's because of the microangel.
Once again, you guys,
you don't get scared
when Mr. Rogers dies.
You feel sad.
See?
Look at how screwed up he is
because of that implant.
I'm scared as hell.
Your implant is not even put
in the right place
behind your neck.
What's going to keep George Bush
from just, you know,
nuking the whole Earth now?
Mr. Rogers is gone.
Well, they used to meet
regularly to discuss, you know,
policy and so forth.
No more beautiful days
in neighborhood Earth,
boys and girls.
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've heard the reports
that enemy planes are approaching.
In less than three hours,
an H-bomb might fall over Portland.
Like myself,
I think you're going to be
very interested
in this story
that we're going to tell you.
And in this age of missiles
and man-made moons,
it takes on added significance.
There are no actors in this story,
but there are a lot of people.
The people of the city
of Portland, Oregon.
And what happened to them
or could happen to them
on a day that we'll call X.
Holding hands,
waiting for that foghorn to blow.
It's been three years
and three hours now
and he said he was
never going to come again.
But I knew I'd just stay here and wait.
I could hear the footsteps
from two blocks away.
Those big chubby feet
slapping against the pavement.
Yeah, it was W for War Bush
and his buddy
Sodom and Smackham Hobie.
Yeah, they thought they had
the streets sealed up.
They thought they were
clean to the bean.
Yeah, they thought they were
the ones to run the whole show.
But I was taking pictures, see,
and I was writing everything down.
I'm losing patience now.
Oh, baby, no.
Okay, stop the car here.
This is Sbarro's restaurant.
We're going to have to go in
for a little while
and pretend like we're
talking to each other.
We both know
there's no need for talk anymore.
No need for talk.
Everything's going on
behind the scenes.
Behind the scenes.
Everyone knows
that everyone blows.
There's nothing going on
in front.
And there's nothing going on
behind your eyes.
But behind your back
we're doing plenty
for the United States
governments of America.
Behind the curtain.
Beyond the curtain.
You, the representations
of people we representative,
we would like to know
that we are not sham.
We are not focused and smoky.
We are real.
And we represent
your representations.
We're behind each and every one
of you Americans.
Whispering funny things
in the back of your neck.
I don't know if I'm going to be
able to pay my bills.
No, I can't pay anything.
Sometimes I just wish
I could take a car
and go out and shoot a
goddamn partner.
I'm behind you.
Too many visions, man.
Too many dreams.
I saw the mushroom cloud again
last night.
And it wasn't in my suit, man.
It was in my ears
and my eyes.
I'm looking out of the door.
Everybody is watching.
I'm in the dark, man.
Like the walls of Jermichael.
Let me in love.
Let me in love.
Just let me in love.
I'm in the dark.
I'm in the center.
I'm in the corner of your hands.
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
Alien love, friends.
