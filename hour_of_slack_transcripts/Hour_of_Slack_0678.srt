1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:21,640
that we are in a decade of change we may be in a decade of convulsion and upheaval

2
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:30,820
and therefore the biggest thing you can do to prepare for the 90s is to build your own ship

3
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:38,100
marvelous things can happen to you despite what's going on around you

4
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:48,400
i would recommend very strongly that everyone read the book of the subgenius

5
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,460
disease and pestilence

6
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:59,280
stalking the land the arrow and the terror taking place by day or by night a warfare

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:07,540
confusion and the bible says that the one who dwells in the secret place of the most

8
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:15,480
most high bob and gets and will be he or she who actually does finally

9
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,400
get some yes yes bob's promise rings true

10
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,240
please tell them that i am god

11
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,000
welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes

12
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,080
welcome to the subgenius radio ministry

13
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,980
hour of

14
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,060
sponsored by the church

15
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,660
you are a god

16
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,500
to them

17
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:11,340
to obey me like they did the father

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,780
who is god number one

19
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,440
bob bob bob is god number one

20
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,580
is the father

21
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,640
or should they obey

22
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,980
praise bob

23
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,800

00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,660
no no not papa joe

25
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:33,820

no not dr legume no

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,600
you see there must be a god number one

28
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,400
bob is god number one

29
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:48,520
one

30
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,860
as Gideon says

31
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,500
i am called

32
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,840
as r treated as felix

33
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,980
Cao po

34
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:05,980


35
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:05,980


36
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:05,980


37
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:05,980


38
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,680
as you know

39
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:07,820
june

40
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,720
armed

41
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,620
arms not covered with her

42
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,680
main lead like among teenagers faced like

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,820
our their

44
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,440
chorus are much accent youth who's setting me up withrets it's like a mars essentially

45
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:21,440


46
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:21,440


47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:21,440


48
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,220
monkey. And his bald-headed

49
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,040
pate. His bald-headed pate. Now Bob has all of a sudden gone bald.

50
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,040
I never knew he was despilado. Well, he was wearing a wig all that time.

51
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,360
His bald-headed fate. So is that true about his pipe actually

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,260
being part of one of his teeth, the proboscis teeth on the front canine

53
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,220
that actually has a radio transmitter? Oh, it goes way much deeper.

54
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,300
The shank of the pipe has

55
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,320
some sort of tissue that actually grows all the way into

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,380
Bob's brain. Up through his sinuses

57
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,180
and directly into the brain of Bob. If you yank that pipe out,

58
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,540
it would probably kill him.

59
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:09,340
If you yank the pipe out, doesn't the pipe have a direct link right on back to the Big Bang as well?

60
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,580
Right. The pipe is the excess connection.

61
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,580
A lot of people think that it's not really Bob who's running the show.

62
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,820
You would unwrap.

63
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,200
You would unravel the fabric of the universe itself.

64
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,520
The switchboard would blow.

65
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,900
Right. It would be like pulling out that one thread that holds everything together.

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,200
If you blew Bob's sinuses, everything would go like Y2K is not going to go.

67
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,860
That would be the end of it. But who'd want to suck out Bob's nostrils to end the world anyway?

68
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,400
Are these the shadowy figures here?

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,820
I hear a Bob song coming out.

70
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,560
Bob.

71
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,560
Bob.

72
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,540
It can be the heroine.

73
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,360
Bob.

74
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,560
Bob.

75
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,800
He's no slob.

76
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:56,820
Bob.

77
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,620
Bob.

78
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,080
He's no fool.

79
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,160
A fool.

80
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:01,660
Yeah.

81
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,140
What a stool.

82
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,520
He is the head of the subgenius church.

83
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,100
And he is super cool.

84
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:16,980
Bob.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,500
Bob.

86
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,120
Bob.

87
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,820
Bob.

88
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,280
Bob.

89
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,160
Bob.

90
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,860
Bob.

91
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,400
Bob.

92
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:24,680
Bob.

93
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:24,680


94
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:24,680


95
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:24,680


96
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,440
He's no fool.

97
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,020
He is the head of the subgenius church.

98
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,000
And he is super cool.

99
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,100
Hi, Sandy.

100
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,260
I'll take it easy.

101
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,260
Thank you.

102
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,580
Good night.

103
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:47,840
Good night.

104
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,100
Good night.

105
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,280
Good night.

106
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,400
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad

107
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,020
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad

108
00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:03,160
Yeah, I just want you to know about the evils of drug use

109
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,880
Good, we need to hear that, we'll love you

110
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,100
Fortunately, we haven't taken any tonight, but this morning

111
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,560
Fortunately

112
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,160
That's right

113
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,660
We've cleansed our system with Bob

114
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,060
Do you need any of these evils, or do you have...

115
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,160
No, I'm glad saved, not evil

116
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,880
Ah, does thou taketh or does thou giveth away?

117
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,660
I know that you wonder why so many nice subgenius songs

118
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,920
Well, that's Glass Madness

119
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,740
He's the one responsible for all the nice sub-dinis

120
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,000
The ones that sit around the campfires and swap stories and...

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,680
And hollow Bob pills

122
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,300
That's right, and hollow planets

123
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:37,860
And senior Bob songs

124
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,400
Some of them even come from Planet X, but not a whole lot of them

125
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,580
Not enough to worry about, and certainly not enough to be vaccinated this year

126
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,400
So don't worry about it, but if you see them

127
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:46,900
You're seven

128
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,380
Subgenius

129
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,760
A bladed windbreaker will suffice

130
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,520
Another idea

131
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,440
Know that you've seen a very rare bird, because a nice subgenie is a rare subgenie

132
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,420
Um, do you have something to share with us?

133
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,680
I'm afraid that he's lost his name

134
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,500
No, he's gonna talk any second now

135
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,320
Here it comes

136
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,900
He has a message

137
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,060
Bob has touched this moment

138
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,080
It's me, rare subgenie

139
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,080


140
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,280
Yeah, what is it?

141
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:09,480
Huh?

142
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,120
Okay, Bob

143
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,800
Yeah?

144
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,140
What happened to your church?

145
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,120
What happened to it?

146
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,580
Got old

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,160
You mean the special...

148
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,060
It's growing, it's growing even now as you speak

149
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,800
The special introductory version or the...

150
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,740
Doug, can you show them the church on camera three, please?

151
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,200
Here we go

152
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,080
Bring it up, yeah

153
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,120
Now there is the church building as we saw it in the blueprints as the architect designed it

154
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,700
Is that what you call a close-up?

155
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,260
That's right

156
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,680
No, no, the close-up's camera four

157
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,620
Doug, switch over there

158
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,360
Okay, here we go

159
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,960
Yeah, there

160
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,700
Now that's the inside of the church

161
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,800
There's the stained glass windows of the Bob face

162
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,120
There's the mighty pipe

163
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,740
You have to be careful about, you know, something to watch out for

164
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,880
Well, it is, it's important

165
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,900
It's a classic neo-mythos

166
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,100
Yeah

167
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,220
Any of the rules for play

168
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,060
Like, neo-religion

169
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,080
Okay, don't forget the mutant player takes the first turn

170
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,860
Of, uh, you know, yeah

171
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,740
Yeah, the mutant player has to set up by placing at least one mutant counter in each of the

172
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,960
boxes surrounding the building area

173
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,680
That's this building

174
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,060
It doesn't matter if some of the boxes have more than one mutant counter as long as each

175
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,040
box has at least one

176
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,140
That's, uh, that's the human player on the other hand, uh

177
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,060
There's a musician

178
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,460
Oh, there is no musician player in this game

179
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,580
Ah, yes, dear friends

180
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,840
An amazing old recording

181
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:25,080
Uh, from, uh, gosh, when, uh, KPFA subgenius show 92782

182
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,720
Wow

183
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,480
Yeah, that's one of the very early, that's before Hour of Slack

184
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,960
There was the KPFA show, uh, there in, in Berkeley

185
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,520
And, uh, oh, where was my background music from last week?

186
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,820
Friends, everything is done

187
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,680
It's different now

188
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,200
Everything has changed a little

189
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,840
Well, not all that much

190
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,320
You'll see

191
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,840
I think Dave has to do this commercial first

192
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,220
Tonight is being brought to you by the forces of evil

193
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,860
We'll bring you the world government's religions and corporations

194
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,340
And by Moonpants Emporium

195
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,360
When you've gotta go, you've gotta go

196
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,780
And the best part is, you can't do it without me

197
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,180
And the best part is, you can't do it without me

198
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,300
And the best part is, you can't do it without me

199
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,060
And the best part is, you can't do it without me

200
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,980
And I love a lot of them

201
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,420
Oh, I love you

202
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,980
We're gonna do a fun show

203
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:36,000
Can you get down and tell me A detour of Earth

204
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,880
I've never seen you during, like, your days

205
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,960
Or for a couple d explore it

206
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,280
Well, I just want to see your organ

207
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,880
I'm not ready yet

208
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:40,880


209
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:40,920
All I ever think about

210
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,480
Is coming here

211
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:41,700
And I really like your candy

212
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:41,800
So, I'm gonna do a bit of yup

213
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,240
Ok, my hot dog

214
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,240


215
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,240


216
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,800
It's down and about

217
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,100
Get off before it owls

218
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,300
Into this

219
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:04,040
Yes dear friends, lonesome cowboy Dave sings and hollers away in the holler of the new

220
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:11,460
times and the old puzzling evidence and glass madness show hollered away there in the old

221
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,560
times and friends things are...

222
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,120
Well I can't believe what I did with Jesus.

223
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,900
Let me put it that way.

224
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:30,880
We moved the subgenius foundation headquarters to another part of the complex.

225
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,660
Moved the whole dang thing and I have built my own ship all over again.

226
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,880
A brand new ship here in Dallas, Texas.

227
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,580
But everything's wonderful.

228
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,760
It's wonderful here.

229
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,000
I've got a new commander.

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,600
I've got a new command module you see with the attitude controls.

231
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:58,540
You can hear those as things jitter when I click the attitude, not altitude controls,

232
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,600
attitude controls.

233
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:05,240
And my computer and keyboard and everything are right behind me so that whenever I add

234
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,900
something new to the show I can type it in.
