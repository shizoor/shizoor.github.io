It's chaotic.
Yowl Slack.
But let's leave things of this world behind
and walk now down the path of Bob
and his crew.
For this brief minute of Slack
from the Church of the Subgenius.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.
And I know some of my listeners
are going to think I'm crazy
for what I'm about to say.
But you know what?
I don't care.
Because I have Slack.
And you don't even know what that is.
I've got Bob Dobbs in my life.
Bob Dobbs, the living avatar of Slack.
So I know I'll be safe
on the pleasure vessels
of the sex goddesses from Planet X
when that day of judgment comes.
Ah, yes.
And you unbelievers
will fry in a hell of your own making.
And how do I know this?
Why am I so sure?
Because I have faith, my friend.
Faith in Bob.
You don't use your mind
to think about your religion.
Nay, nay.
You let that Bob signal from space beam
straight into your skull.
Unfeatered by your stupid notions
of good or evil or job or free will.
For the word of Bob is a direct word.
It is not written in some roundabout symbolic manner.
You don't try to figure out what it means, my friend.
You just do what it says.
Because Bob said it.
I believed it.
And that settles it.
Let there be Slack.
Today.
We ain't got enough Slack.
We ain't got enough Slack.
Slack is what gives us breaks.
Breaks on the car.
Breaks on the train.
Breaks to make you go insane.
And Slack is what brings you life.
Life.
Life takes away your Slack.
Life takes away your Slack.
Push the waitresses.
Pushy.
Take away your Slack.
Take away your Slack.
Arrogant cashiers.
Arrogant cashiers.
Take away your Slack.
Insensitive employers.
Take away your Slack.
Insensitive employers.
Take away your Slack.
Withholding tax takes away your Slack.
Withholding tax takes away your Slack.
What gives you back your Slack.
What gives you back your Slack.
Can I get a ball.
смерuard to��라
That's what gives you back your Slack.
That's what now.
Gives you back your Slack.
After I found Bob,
I knew that everything was gonna be alright from now on.
You see, the aliens had been tampering with my brain and been making me think that Negi was the only way back.
Oh, but dear friends, you know, once the slack was given to me, the ropes of life should no longer rip my brain asunder and twist the very air from my throat.
Yes, dear friends, you found nothing like it till you find Bob, because the peace that Bob has told me one day that unless I free myself from Negi, they said, doctor, they said, physician, heal yourself!
Perhaps this is as good a time as any to take a few minutes to repeat a message that seems frequently lost in the hustle and bustle of our daily activity.
Sunday morning, do you feel it, boo? You're hurt all over and you're moving so well.
People, here's something that you should know.
Tune us in on the radio dial. We got charisma, we got style.
Well, people, we'll make you feel.
We've been through for a while.
Put your hand, put your hand on the radio.
Put your hand, put your hand on the radio.
All right, we're hoping to make a lot of money real fast.
And if we can wake up ten more people out there in the listening audience tonight, we will have achieved our goal for the evening.
What is the church's priorities? What's important to you guys?
Mainly the quest for...
The quest for slack.
The casting out of false prophets.
And controlling time. Those are our three main goals, I guess.
Slack.
Slack is something we all need.
And I know that lots of people out there listening right now are feeling a terrible shortage of slack.
Slack is something you can't get enough of.
That's right, that's right. And we can help them to get slack, George.
Man, the world is filled with a bunch of kooky ideas and concepts about the Bible.
I predict...
I predict that flying saucers will officially land on the lawn of the White House.
That's what I like about the Word of God. There's nothing fakey about this thing, man.
You talk about telling it like it is.
It hangs the dirty wash right out the front bay window.
For everybody to see.
That's right. And we want, when 1998 comes, we want subgeniuses to be in positions of power so that this alien technology is not abused.
And Bob tells us what we need to know to get into that position.
I hope you realize your demographics were aged 35 to 54.
The average consumer makes about $45,000 to $145,000 a year.
A tax bracket neatly fit in between the twine and the westerner.
And lives somewhere in some willful heights.
He smiles when he's not supposed to.
He drinks when he's supposed to.
He drips. He drips. He drips.
There he goes.
Don't touch that dial.
He was about to touch that dial.
Don't touch that proboscis.
He was going to stroke it suggestively.
And then stroke the proboscis.
Please, gentlemen, do not stroke the proboscis erotically.
Do not fondle the tubes.
The proboscis should not be touched.
It's the end times.
Even the jungle wanted him dead.
And that's who he really took his orders from anyway.
Yeah, Kurtz.
No.
He was a madman.
I'm not talking about Kurtz.
I'm talking about Legume.
A snail crawling along the edge of a straight razor.
Even the jungle wants Legume dead.
I'm a little man. He's a big man.
He's a big man.
The only cameras allowed in Tranquility Base is...
The only person allowed in Tranquility Base with a camera this year
is if it's Dennis Hopper.
What about girls with no shirt on?
Oh, they can come in, yeah.
Yeah, because they're...
Yeah.
How about the only guy...
And they take pictures of each other.
Yeah, yeah, that's all right.
How about...
But the only guy allowed in with any camera device
is if Dennis Hopper happens to show up
with all kinds of cameras all over.
How about Meow Tribesmen?
Those dressed as Meow Tribesmen.
Otherwise, Legume's going to take care of business.
Shrunken heads on their laps.
Enjoying the carnage
with some Velveeta cheese,
just like Mom does here.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!













To Velveeta!
We're dad's head comedy again!
I know how the addition is.
The end's coming soon.
We're less than 80 days from next day now.
That's right.
We're like 70 days now or something.
That's right.
We're going to party like it's the end of time.
They're coming up on like two months or so.
You know, May, June, July.
Aren't you excited?
I can feel the drizzle.
I'm way behind.
I'm way, way, way, way, way behind.
I've sold all my earthly possessions.
You know, and why do we hurry for X Day?
Why do we care about our earthly possessions?
Yeah, that's right.
X day is coming.
Just get in the car and go to Brushwood and don't worry about anything.
Yeah, all this rumble roil is a bunch of filthy fall.
It's all going to end anyway, and you're going to be transported into a different dimension.
Well, leave your door open, though, so your cats and your dogs can go find new homes.
I'm sorry.
While you're gone.
I stopped the chin-chuttering.
Yeah, don't lock your animals in your house.
Let them loose before you come the next day.
Okay.
Put little bands on their heads, little red ribbons, and let them go.
Set your chickens free.
Let the red and blue loons flush your fish down the toilet.
Goodbye, Napoleon.
I'll see you on X day.
He waits for me when I go to school.
Let the cat finally get at that damn parakeet.
Hey, hey, but what about the parakeet, man?
Ah, finally enjoy that parakeet with some nice brown-rendered gravy.
I would.
And do it.
Didn't you ever really wonder what a ferret and a snake would do if they were in the same cage together?
Now's your chance to try.
No one cares.
Just do it.
What would the animals do if no people were left?
What if the X's took everyone?
And the whole planet was just piles of clothes everywhere.
One minute there were people standing there, the next minute piles of clothes.
Empty.
Size M's laying on the freeway in the M1s.
Naked bodies floating up towards the heavenly spacecraft.
Pounds of pubic hair floating skyward like little drips of water.
Gracefully floating away.
Such tumbleweed.
Blissfully floating away.
And so geniuses on the ground shooting them before they get to the escape vessel.
I was at Brushwood last weekend already preparing my rocket ship, my escape vessel.
Oh, how is Brushwood out there?
I hear the...
The meteor crater pond is completely full and glowing at night.
Have there been more sightings of the monster of crater light?
Yeah, when I was there late at night after everybody had gone to sleep, I walked over to crater lake and there was a strange dim greenish glow in the woods.
I was...
I set the garbage.
It turned out that there was some Armenian hunters in the area.
Putting the pimentos in the ground.
Is it Armenian hunters?
Are they Armenian seas?
It's open seas, not Armenians?
Yeah, apparently.
It's open seas, not Armenians, man.

Sounds to me like the Lakeview Man.
The Lakeview Man is a wild man.
Lives in the woods outside of town.
Howls at the moon, listen if you can.
You might hear the Lakeview Man.
Some say he was a soldier who came home from war.
All in one piece but with emotional scars.
We own the story, argue about the days.
Vietnam or the war between the states.
And the Lakeview Man is a wild man.
Lives in the woods outside of town.
Howls at the moon, listen if you can.
You might hear the Lakeview Man.
I took the shortcut to the river last night.
A beard and a blur in the long, deep lights.
We drank a few beers, skipped a few stones.
And I drove a little faster on the way back home.
Music
A dog is a deer, a cow is found dead.
A chicken is missing, found missing its head.
Shotgun gone, print in the sand.
Two toes shy, the Lakeview Man.
The Lakeview Man is a wild man.
Lives in the woods outside of town.
Howls at the moon, listen if you can.
You might hear the Lakeview Man.
The Lakeview Man is a wild man.
Lives in the woods outside of town.
Howls at the moon, listen if you can.
You might hear the Lakeview Man.
You might hear the Lakeview Man.
You might hear the Lakeview Man.
You might hear the Lakeview Man.
Things are strange out there at Brushwood.
There's...
It was.
It was a strange weekend.
Energy emanating from the ground itself.
I told you I've seen flying beings there.
And you laughed and scoffed on me staying.
You said, ha ha.
I look down at my shoes when you say this, Dave, to make you mad.
No, everybody sees UFOs out there except me.
Well, the strange thing is, some people believe that if you hallucinate someone there,
that this is a result of the crater meteor lake.
It will appear.
That if you hallucinate somebody there, a few hours later,
it doesn't happen immediately, but a few hours later, they'll appear.
Those are called tulpas in Tibetan tradition.
Really?
A tulpa is a...
A thought form that is brought to life by a person's belief or obsession with that.
But you must perform necrophilia with them to get them going.
It's like the lung gong pa.
You can make them run for miles just by making love to their corpse.
Only you have to do that, Dave.
That's what the llama told you, right?
Right?
Llama ding ding.
Yeah, he always...
Llama ding ding has been defrocked.
And did he have a little chant that was like, oh, wah, tay goo, sayam.
Yeah, right.
Yes.
He had his...
Did he take you on a hunt for these creatures called snipe birds?
He made me choose between two vessels.
One, if I were to touch, I was the ancient master himself at a new incarnation.
If I touched the other one, I would get rigor mortis of my toe.
And he had you rub his snake with snake oil, right?
Of course.
Strain snake.
And by the power of Wee Watami.
So he took them from me and tore his dick off.

Damn.
Let me slog around your neck.
Let me draw.
down your chest off. I'm not prejudiced I don't care if he's a Jew, a black, Italian,
Chinese. If he messes with me I'll shoot him. He's got complete equality as he drops to the ground.
The helicopter which plucked the re-entry capsule out of the water had a big 6-6.
After a while it moved up, took off at a fantastic speed at the at least 45 degrees angle and they
just disappeared between the stars. During the debriefing which we always get after each
combat mission, the officer who was receiving this made a joke of it how many beer I had.
I don't believe you J.R.
Well I did benefit from it of course but so did a whole bunch of old Dallas boys.
In other words you want to know you want the government to know that you're in there
to make money and to pay taxes. Well we're already treading a pretty thin line Bill and
I'm sure there's plenty of other things they'd love to get us for just be you know well I don't
know whether we want to talk about the conspiracy on the air but uh oh yeah go right ahead.
The one
that's really interesting is the conspiracy behind the conspiracy.
Ah the the conspiracy to end all conspiracies maybe.
Well part of part of the church's goal is to wake people up to the fact that our lives are
being controlled by forces uh that that most people are completely ignorant of.
It gets really complex when you get into conspiracies and we believe um
I'm a student there.
He's a student there.


I'm a student here.
I'm a student here.
So where's the next voyage when is the next voyage?
Uh, that's the one the voyage that we're going on to uh the finally the little crinkly trees?
The ancient trees.
They look like little trees, the aluminum foil, where everything sounds like
only the city people that make you hear conversations and pieces of music
while you're trying to sleep out there because your mind starts
trying to filter out all this crazy sound out there in the middle of the night. Yeah.
Because I've been lying there on the ground, and I'll hear people talking and think, and then think, there's nobody out here.
You'll hear them talking, and they'll be going,
Doug.
Philo.
You don't hear anything distinctive except once in a while they say your name in a loud enough way for you to know that there's somebody talking out there.
It's not a suspicion anymore.
It's an absolute fact.
The question now becomes is how long will it take for them to get to you, and how fast will they kill you?
Will they kill you slowly, or will they roast you over some kind of a spit, or will they just take a bludgeon and just hammer your head into a bloody pulp?
So all they find is this stumpy thing laying on a cot in the morning by the camp.
You know, the park ranger will come around and say, oh, my God.
The park ranger.

The park creature struck again.
Okay, the truth.
It wasn't biohazard.
It's a warning sign.
You have granted yourself three slimy wishes.
You know, speaking of weird superstitions and strange events, I'm supposed to speak to the skeptics group of Northern Ohio tomorrow night.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah, they.
Are you sure?
Yes, I am.
Well, as sure as a true skeptic can be.
You know.
Now, what is supposed to happen?
Actually, I decided to call this lecture.
It's not really a lecture.
It's just a, you know, a trance channeling.
But I decided to call it Unbelievable Gullibility.
And that's tomorrow at the Earth Science Building at, what is that, the university?
She doesn't even know where it's at.
Did you read your copy?
Did you reread your copy of Demon Haunted World to bone up on?
No.
No.
Some good shtick?
Oh, all I have to do is tell them what I have seen believed.
You know, I've seen some things believed that I can't believe people believe.
I can't believe it myself, Fielder.
In 1922, I saw one of them coming from behind that shark there.
And it was just a little boy.
I guess you could call me a little boy.
And I swear to God, it was the hairiest thing I ever saw.
I was wearing a big old pair of bottles.
I was wearing black glasses.
And I had a big sandwich.
And he looked like he was crying.
Sometimes.
I never liked it.
I just thought it was funny.
Drop it or I'll break your arm.
And there are the plantages that grow on this horrible planet.
And there.
Oh, look.
There is one of the alien creatures.
That lives on the planet.
He's tugging at his head like it's in pain.
Ridiculous.
She was terrified and now she doesn't answer the door.
But her car is sitting in the garage.
She was out.
Or in bed with the flu.
Or maybe she was abducted by aliens for all we know.
You're going.
The alien pees.
In the bushes.
He reaches in and signages all.
His world is empty of negative.
What does he want to say to us?




Ridiculous.

sinners and white walt содержes one or more in the Lord.
It uses bride Maria.

Focus.
Yes, he is.
Negative art man.
And that is the mountain from hell.
And the sky of orange in the place of the doomed people.
And there are the plantages that grow on this horrible planet.
And there...
Oh, look!
There is one of the alien creatures that lives on the planet.
He's tugging at his head like it's in pain.
We're lucky to have the benefit of this long-range zoom.
We can zoom in on the hideous, hideous, foul demon that he is.
Like some movie, horrible, horrible movie creature.
There he is, just sort of walking.
Yeah, I think they walk.
And then they creep.
Creepily creeping away.
This is a winner.
Take a look at this now.
What we're looking at here...
Let's see.
Now, I want to make sure I have the right...
Do I have the right one?
Here we go.
Here we go.
This is it right here.
Here we go.
It is really one of the most beautiful places on Earth.
And if you don't know that much about Andalusia or Lusha, I think it's Lusha, in Brazil.
And that's...
So very rare and so very special.
Chameleon.
It stands up a good quarter of an inch.
And it tapers to one-sixteenths.
And when you talk about color, you're talking about, you know, again, you know, that has just a little bit of pink in there.
It's actually in Sri Lanka and Brazil, Spain, Canada, Russia, Australia, and here in the United Chameleon.
If we can...
Just gonna pop.
Look at this.
Hello.
Chameleon.
Hello, dog.
You unlock this door with the key.
Beyond it is another sound mind.
You're moving into a land of sub-mind.
Sub-mind.
Sub-mind.
Sub-mind.
You've just crossed over into...
And the Lusha's...
Lu-si-a?
Ah, get yourself a filter.
Miki-na.
L-U-S-E.
Miki-na.
Miki-na.
Miki-na.
Miki-na.
Miki-na.
Miki-na.
Miki-na.
Miki-na.
Miki-na.
Miki-na.
Miki-na.
Miki-na.
Cats ask for it by name.
Paint, grease, tar, carbon, ink, plain dirt.
And so will you.
Without water.
Miki.
Miki.
Miki.
Miki.
Miki.
It's all vegetable.
It's digestible.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
A little bit of Limur there.
Fernanda Nende Limur.
The song we heard was, of course, The Rainmakers.
And we've heard some ESO Swamp Radio on WCSB Cleveland.
And I've been slowly working my way through Media Barrage No. 5,
the old subgenius tape, which I've been remastering for you.
We heard some KPFA Berkeley sub-show puzzling evidence.
And Dr. Philo Drummond.
I should mention that the Media Barrage sequences in this show
were largely edited by old Reverend Stevie Hambone.
Ah, yes, friends.
And that new title, Hour of Slack title that we heard at the beginning,
was, in fact, by the El Queso All-Stars, or Interbulator.
And this is, in fact, an X-Day show.
We're building up to that marvelous subgenius holiday.
Perhaps it will be the end of the world this time.
We'll find out on July 5th at 7 a.m.
But in the meantime, now,
back to WCSB Cleveland for ESO Swamp Radio.
I just want to know that if you're an American
and you believe that the rapture is a good thing,
doesn't that mean that you end up driving a better car
rather than that you're removed from your car?
A red, white, and blue rapture, my friend.
If that's your...
I will suddenly be in a really good car.
If that's your thought form, man.
If that's your pleasure vessel, if that's how you envision your...
Yeah.
That's your pleasure wave, dude.
I mean, you're on it.
You've got a weird planet, baby.
Well, you get your own planet.
I mean, you can populate it with whatever kind of cars you want.
If you want to depopulate the planet,
first you can use cholera blankets like we used to do back in the old days,
or you could just, like, drop a neutron bomb there, for Christ's sake.
What if you want someone else's planet?
What if I want Korob?
Well, I'm saying you fight for it.
You depopulate it with your own stuff,
and then you move on down there and settle in for an easy life on a hammock.
Or a hummock.
Depending on your taste, butch.
Do you understand what you're saying now?
Or not?
Um, yeah, butch, butch.
He said taste, butch.
I want Korob, and Jehovah's got that one right.
Taste, butch.
You sit on that hamburger to taste it?
Jehovah, he said taste, butch.
Is that how you use your taste, butch, Dave?
Do you think maybe Jehovah has no planets?
He's just a slate of hand and ham artists, right?
Wouldn't you say, Sting?
I mean, Stingian?
You old Armenian hunter, you.
Wouldn't you say Jehovah's just kind of like a...
Tricky wiki slate of hand artists?
How would you explain the Armenian hunter in the freezing night in the middle?
By this pond that's created by a crater that everybody's saying is now glowing at night.
Our lord and master blaster, of course.
Weird green lights in the woods, and all of a sudden some guy approaches, you know, and comes out of the woods.
Why couldn't it have been a supine woman's?
I don't, actually, I don't see anything at all weird about any of that myself.
Just between you and me.
Did you look at these shoes, my friend?
No, are you sure?
You weren't in, like, the B-hole or the K-hole or the A-hole or something when this was going on?
No, the thing is to say, you could say it like that, but...
You see, there's one thing you're missing out on here.
There's one thing you're just not, you're not catching the obvious.
The Turks beat him, Jack.
Because you're not one of them.
Do you know any true outdoorsmen?
Me?
Yeah.
Of course.
Okay.
I'm sure those guys have all those signs that say, we'll drink for food or whatever.
No, no, no.
I mean, real hunter-fishermen.
Oh.
Men that hunt and fish.
Not just, just hunt.
Full-time, those leathery-looking characters.
Yeah.
Those guys with the baseball hats that...
Well, my brother's a cattle rancher.
...have a $20,000 product on them.
And looks like he's made of clay.
Okay.
Weathered leather, so...
My brother worked for the railroad, and they're all, like, real outdoorsman type.
The hunter-fisher type.
I do know those types, yeah.
And the thing that, the obvious thing that the story is, people miss on that story...
They are a degenerated race.
Their minds have become pieces of cabbage.
I'm sorry.
...is that those kind of people are out there in January...
February.
...in February, in March, in April.
No weather that winter in Ohio can whip up will keep those men in their four-wheel drive vehicles
and their weapons or their fishing lures from...
...what they need to do to make their lives full.
No, but it's not the wild men.
Those wild men things, that's whole crap.
...a bone-legged man with a crossbow and a 55-48.
People should be taken out and just shot in the woods, actually.
I think so, a la Deliverance.
They ought to just, like, let loose a bunch of these psychopathic...
A bunch of pigs.
...shoot guys.
Yeah, with the big curly dicks and go rape them.
Curly dicks.
Is that true that pigs actually...
...the raping of the wild men from Cleveland.
You know, um...
...the raping of the wild men from Cleveland.

...the raping of the wild men from Cleveland.
I have had direct contact with people from other planets
and have spoken with them on many occasions.
...to the moon in an Apollo spacecraft.
The Apollo has six letters.
Each of the astronauts' names has six letters.
Lovell, Anders, Borman.
Six, six, six.
From space, six televisions.
And transmissions were made.
The moon trip was a six-day journey.
The spacecraft was in six sections.
The astronaut section plus the escape system was 66 feet tall.
On occasion, an unidentified flying object has been reported by witnesses
to be the source of the sound.
Oh, no.
Oh, Bob, what's that?
What?
What?
What?
What is it?
Hello?
Carol, you fucking whore!
Hello?
Hello?

Oh, you really got the action.
Oh, you really got the action.

No!
No!
That was really a good reaction.
I'm not happy with that either.



But I was really excited not to be in it.
So I didn't want to answer any questions.
That was what I wanted to be.
Oh!
That's really funny.
That's why this got me very excited.


Out of my way, hey
Out of my way
Hot rocket on record today
And I feel like picking a fight
With anybody who claims they're right
All the preachers, men, the politicians
All the critics and the things they write
Out of my way
Out of my way
Out of my way
Hot rocket on record today
And this is the call of arms
This is the call of hands
This is the call of the muscles and the minds
Of the people in every land
Out of my way
Out of my way
Out of my way
Out of my way
Out of my way
Hot rocket on record today
And we're taking the history test
Of who's baddest and who is best
Lenin the brother
Lenin the sisters
Lenin the communist
Out of my way
Out of my way
Out of my way
Out of my way
Out of my way
Hot rocket on record today
With the money in the mattress
Put your pennies where they count
Nothing left to believe in
Nothing left to wait for
And getting them to tell the truth
Was like pulling the wisdom tooth
And knowing never would have needed
Everybody knew we did it
When it burned down before it could move
Out of my way
Out of my way
And we are the immigrant flock
The sheep of the sheep
Rest on splintered rock
From the monitor
And the mirror mat
From the pressure and the quibble
And the Titanic
Wrecking in day
With the money in the mattress
Wrecking in day
Put your pennies where they count
Wrecking in day
Nothing left to believe in
Nothing left to wait for
Out of my way
Get out of my way
Get out of my way
Out of my way
Out of my way
Get out of my way
Out of my way
Out of my way
Get out of my way
Out of my way
You know when a flag like that touches the ground
the only way to make it healthy again
is to have naked women
And kiss the ground
on the flag hill
For a pawn.
Yes.
Kissed it with your tiny little mouth.
That's right.
Get down and kiss.
French kiss the ground.
While the flag have touched the ground.
Get that money home.

This flag has been so bloody from so many war and fighting.
Look, it's red already and white and blue like you.
Oh, this flag.
I would like to wrap my body in here and stay warm the rest of...
How long is this going to last?
It hasn't even begun.
It's gone.
Yeah, well, everybody's been taken off the grid now.
You're not even at the birth stage yet, Dave.
You're not even on the grid yet.
You're not even conceived.
You're not even a naval man.
You've got nothing down there but a smooth thing.
None of you.
If you can hear my voice, you haven't even been conceived yet.
They don't even have any ear canals to listen with, pal.
Just think of it that way.
You're in that limbo.
It's meta hearing.
You know what I mean?
Meta, meta, meta, meta, meta.
But it's okay.
Well, time will come.
Luckily, Dave is the only one who...
really can hear your voice.
Until then,
then all will awaken.
He is the only one.
And truly see for the first time
where they have actually been
since they were quote
unquote born.
See the canker sores on their mind, the festerings
they have created in this past evil life
which must be eliminated.
It's coming
soon.
I've got everything backwards. You're in hell now.
You're about to die and be reborn
into real life.
Then the before life, that's like heaven.
This is hell, man.
This is hell, man.
Welcome to hell.
Oh, save my life.
Yes, sir,
dear friend.
I'm living in Arnold Palmer.
He's the one for me.
I'm happier than the morning sun.
That's the way it'll always be.
Ever since the day you came inside of me.
Me.
Oh my.
Yeah.
Johnny could only sing one note
and the note he sang was this.
Die!
If you want to,
you misguided
Martha!
Not me.
Not me.
I won't grow up.
I won't grow up.
I don't want to wear a tie.
I don't want to wear a tie.
And a serious expression.
And a serious expression.
In the middle of July.
In the middle of July.
I'm going to be a little bit more

Come, come, baby.
So you come out
and you draw
and you say,
bam, bam.
Stop.
And a guy doesn't stop.
Then you move up to the head
and you put one right there
and that's usually final.
Get that spear away from me.
Get it away.
It exploded.
It hit people
that had not been hit in months.
Some began to dance in the spirit.
Others threw up their hands.
And exclamations of praise.
Others began to dance up and down the aisles.
Others fell like they'd been hit
by a proverbial chainsaw.
I was entranced.
I walked in and there sitting at the piano
and playing was a man who later introduced himself
as someone from the planet Saturn.
Ridiculous.
Absurd.
Ludicrous.
Yes.
But they couldn't help it.
And I've got a...
An idea when we step across
that portal of glory
and our feet are upon solid gold
and we see the King of Kings
and the Lord of Lords
and the troubles and trials are past
and we are home at last.
Thank God I'm going to have
an old-fashioned heartfelt Holy Ghost
heaven sent devil chasing jubilee
in my heart and soul
and give vent to the God of glory
that saved my soul.
Well, I'll bet the next two years
brings a total collapse.
A collapse of world civilization
and the next three years after that
will be more or less the pot boiling
and it'll be total absolute chaos
except in places like this.
Here it'll be just like a Shangri-La,
barely touched from the outside.
No, wait a minute.
No, wait a minute.
I love that area and...
Get off the air!
I just can't face it.
The King of Kings
wanted to kill...
So why should...
If I was listening to this broadcast,
why would I want to go to
Sherman, New York
on July 5th weekend?
It's a funny name, Sherman.
There's no particular reason
for...
to go there.
I mean, we tell people, you know,
come to Brushwood.
It's, it's, uh...
Well, you'll find out why...
I staple your mouth.
When it happens,
when it starts...
When it starts happening,
you'll be...
Then you'll be going,
God, I wish I was at that place
those guys were talking about.
I guess this wouldn't be happening there.
And actually,
it's not that this wouldn't be happening there.
It's that there won't be there.
There will be in another place
where we will go away to.
Next day is the day that those who know
get to get away.
Can't we watch it drift into the...
Now it's possible.
We'll admit this could be
just another accident.
Next day drill,
because perhaps the great lesson
Bob taught us is
that 1998 has not yet come.
Well, issue a call-out for a big...
We don't even know what year it is, really.
Issue a call-out for a big Wotan jam.
...high out from our coins.
Tell, tell...
You're the man connected.
Tell the musicians coming
to bring instruments.
Until Wotan.
That's always understood.
Yeah.
There's usually the Wednesday
or Thursday night,
there's a big Wotan jam.
Yeah.
But anything can go by election day.











at attention time


että jest det's okay
to say that,
let that go,

I was thinking it would be fun to have the Celebrity Square thing,
the subject be esoteric subgenius concepts.
Yeah, yeah.
So like the story of Bob being shot could be part of that.
Well, so many things could be.
I mean, that's a great idea because it's reminding the ancient depths of subgenius,
some of the origination myths rather than these newer church things.
But they would be brought out in a playful, fundamental way.
And we could really dig, as I do sometimes when I find these old tapes
and listen to some of the old jokes of the old church,
and I think they're just fun to dig up again.
That was P. Bicker Flemel.
Find new jokes in that church.
And I just want to throw in some of the old jokes
so people know there was.
A little bit.
A little old church.
And these little guys limped around the little campfire at night.
By cracky, it was better back then.
Did their religious thing.
And said, as people always do universally,
it was better back then because, you know, folks, it was better back then.
Sure it was.
No matter who you were or where you were in history,
it was always better back then.
Because there was more youth and less withering from time,
being blasted by grief and ill usage.
That's right.
So now let the myrmidons of,
of chicken, infuse energy into the show
while we, the elder archons,
simply lap up the cream provided on the occasion
by the creamettes and the other performing groups.
They are also referred to as naked fire goddesses by chicken.
I don't know what the deal is there.
I mean, he's claiming that that...
They'll just fit in just fine to the subgenius mythology
of sauce and...
They're just like, you know,
pleasure guides and...
All that, uh...
All that stuff that they paid 10 bucks to come see.
That's right.
Dinosaurs of slack.
All your favorites doing all the same things over and over again.
That's 13 bucks.
I don't want one.
What about furniture on next day?
Will we be needing lots of furniture?
Will we be needing lots of household accruements
where we're going in Sherman, New York?
Bring lamps.
Yeah.
Where you're going in Sherman, New York,
is where you're going...
You got a pit group, Dave?
...beyond the...
A pit group.
A real nice, comfy pit group.
A pit group.
Yeah.
What's a pit group?
Like a living room pit group.
Oh, yes, an assemblage.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I see what you're talking about.
Bring that.
Yeah, bring it.
It's got giraffes on it and stuff and like...
Wait, yours has probably been eaten by the dog.
No, it's been urinated and defecated on by the old man himself.
He comes back again now.
I don't know what to do about it.
Oh, the dog humps it.
Sure, he does.
Oh.
He puts his...
But, uh...
Well, yeah, you can bring lamps or...
Ceiling fan would be nice.
Do you have a ceiling fan?
Yeah.
I'm sure I'm wearing one right now.
Can't you tell?
It's not a real ceiling fan.
Not everyone can wear that, Dave.
Just bring that, then.
Ceiling fan.
Oh, my God.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

Oh.

Come on Bob!
Come on Dad!
We gotta win this face now, Bob!
We gotta get in a tune again!
We gotta win this face, Bob!
Bye Bob!
Bye Dad!
And I'm never coming home!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
It might be a little scary at Brushwood, I have to admit.
I'm not at X-Day!
Look at their breasts!
Especially at X-Day!
Giant witch titty!
Oh my God!
That's not a titty!
It's a titty!
I don't want to see anymore!
It's a useless vessel of pain and hatred!
Dr. Shemton!
Sit down!
Please!
I don't want to see anymore!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Well, you know there's not going to be any kind of wriggling around in paint on the ground.
Yes there will!
Oh yes.
There was last time.
We had to leave first, but there was an oobleck bathing orgy sort of.
What the hell was an oobleck?
That's the wriggling.
The wriggling actually can happen.
Porn starch.
Oh, porn starch.
Food colored porn starch dribbled like a big tub, a vat of it.
Was this after the Elvis Prozac performance?
Right.
The guy that fell asleep in the throne?
Right, and I had to take him to the hospital.
That's why I missed it.
But there's pictures from it.
What was the animal bag about?
I was kind of confused about it.
Was that part of the animal?
The elbow bag?
Yeah, I guess they call it that now.
That goes with the side vagina.
The elbow bag.
The side vagina.
The elbow bag holds the elbow.
Like the electronic bed.
The penis.
Watch it.
It's like when you get the elbow penis up against the side vagina.
This sort of.
I'm Bill Burrows and I'd like to shoot an apple.
Princess, we are dozed head.
I think I'm going to have to doze.
Ah, yes friends.
Past ex days were so weird and exciting.
As heard in the background here, this is the ex day Wotan jam.
God.
What a surprising guitar player.
Somebody named Reverend Illuminatrix showed up and did that.
Anyway friends, ex day, ex day.
Whether the world ends or not, well actually I guess that does impact quite a few things.
But it's still a great party.
And you can figure out how to get there and why more on the internet from www.subgenius.com.
Or you can call the toll free number 1, got that pencil ready?
1-888-669-2323.
That's a real phone number.
888-669-2323.
You can also write to the post office box that will be presented in the new Modemac post office box recording coming up.
And meanwhile friends, here are some sounds from 4 ex day drill 2001.
We'll be hearing Andrew the Impaled walk on broken glass.
But first friends, the voice of Jesus himself.
I want to thank you for watching the video.
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you next time.

Subgenius, don't forget to register at noon today.
Why is there still time?
There's a new rule for the pagans this year.
We like to call them pay and pay again.
All pagans must pay twice to get into the Subgenius Festival.
Please don't feed the pagans.
I like when you're walking by the pagans
and they're like peeing or like jacking off,
just in their cage.
Just meee.
Throwing their shit.
Eating their own shit.
Throwing their own.
But I wanted to ask you a question.
What do we all come to X-Day for?
What are we here for?
The naked chicks!
Precisely.
We are here to seek out and to have sex
with as many other yetis as possible.
I have to ask a question.
What are you up to?
What are you all doing here?
Why aren't you people out there banging your hips together?
Now come on.
Why aren't you?
Anybody?
Can anyone tell me why they're standing here
instead of out in the field somewhere copulating?
You first!
Are you inviting me?
No, no. You tell us why you're not.
Oh, what are you?
Oh, that's a good question.
Yeah, sternoposis.
Yeah.
I was just going to ask you the same question.
Somebody in the audience said,
well, how come you're not fornicating as if you're very life dependent on it?
So now you can tell us.
The reason I'm not is because I'm standing here videotaping you.
Well, the fact of the matter is,
as I'm standing here, I'm fornicating.
You'll notice my hand is in my...
Praise fucking Pastor Pressure!
Praise Pastor Pressure!
I am in a constant state of stimulation.
Okay?
And I want to know why you all...
I mean, I see various genders out there.
I see male, female, and everything else in between.
We got hands in pockets. I mean, come on.
I want to know why you guys talk all the time
about coming out to X Day and having sex,
and you're standing here listening to me.
Amen!
Woo!
I want you to think about that for a while.
It looks like Reverend Stang is getting ready to take my hand.
I don't know if you can hear my advice.
I suggest that you all pair up and do the same.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
My glass is all steamed up.
Easy for you to say.
Can we turn to something better?
I see last weekend, Ed Strange made the first step in building his own escape vessel.
He started the first...
He started gathering rocks.
That's what Ed did.
He starts with rocks?
Yeah, he started with going and gathering rocks.
Big stones.
A man who gathers stones together is my kind of strange man.
So that was the first step.
Actually, I should be documenting this with photography while he does build this thing,
because he's starting from nothing.
Now, right now, he just has the rocks gathered for whatever reason.
I have no idea how he's going to build his spaceship.
Everything starts with a cross.
Is he going to allow himself to use, like, stones?
Or does he have to barter with the Amish?
He'll do whatever it takes.
Andrew the Impaled, walk on broken glass.
Uh...
Dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba...
First of all, you!
Give me a number between one and four, now!
Three.
Three!
You bastard.
You people, watch your eyes.
Move back.
Cover up your eyes.
Cover up your eyes.
Watch out there.
The magic number from the cruel bastard in the second row is three.
Shut up and count with me.
One.
That's before me, not with me.
Thank you, product of the American Education Society.
Shut up!
Four.
Two.
Three.
Hold your applause. Hold your applause. Hold your applause.
For we are not done yet. We are not done yet by far.
Because, first of all, we have to see that we're successful.
Success is, of course, determined by whether or not I'm losing most of my blood out of the bottom of my feet.
I mean, any asshole can jump up and down a bunch of broken glass, if you think about it, really.
It's a matter of surviving it.
Anyway, brave guy, how are we doing?
Am I bleeding on that foot?
I'm bleeding on that foot, sir.
That's right.
There's no pain in the world.
Shut up. We're not done yet.
I've been doing this for a long time now.
It doesn't quite get me up.
I need to step it up a little bit so I get the same appreciation that you people do.
And I know who you people are.
You're the people that go to the football game to see the guy's knee get bent way back the wrong way over some other guy's face.
You're the people that go to hockey fight after hockey fight and boxing game after boxing game just to see a little bit of blood.
You're the people that go to the racetrack to see the car slam.
You're the people that go to the wall and its transmission fly up into the waiting arms of the hot dog vendor.
You people are sick bastards and I appreciate it greatly because you are my bread and butter.
Oh, yes!
Once again, no explanation is really necessary.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Andrew the Impaled.
Walk on.
On broken glass.
What else is going on?
Life and Earth Science.
The Death Fest 2002 is happening.
Look at these great band logos.
Putrid.
Disgusting.
Corpse mutilated.
With Mark.
Ardvush.
Lignant.
Skanky Arabica hole.
Penis carnage.
I love that band.
Hemmed.
Skinless scrotum.
Skinless scrotum?
Yeah.
They're my favorite.
Misery.
Morticians disembowelment's gonna be there, dude.
I got it set for you.
Fleshbrite.
Sinister flesh hole.
Get your next thing cued up there.
We're all ready to roll here.
We're all ready to rock and roll out of here, boys and girls.
Rotting Bob will be there, dude.
Rotting Bob.
It's time now, my friend.
The Misery Man.
Till next week.
Put your hands up in the air.
That's right.
Keep your hat on tight.
Keep your hat on tight.
You're back to the wind.
And you're sack in the saddle.
Yeah.
The number you have reached.
P.O. Box.
1-4-0-3-0-6.
Has been changed.
The new number is.
P.O. Box.
2-0-4-2-0-6.
Austin, Texas.
7-8-7-2-0.
Please make a note of it.
They need to munch us together, hunch us together.
Yeah.
Bring the big bags of money up to the main pavilion.
You're gonna have to send someone to carry them.
We're gonna need about three people.
Look at these space people trying to tell them where to go.
They're gonna run right into that stage.
Man, I'm just glad that I moved to Jesus and staying in Drummond.
I feel like Elvis.
You feel like Elvis?
Yeah.
Makes me feel like Elvis.
You feel like Elvis, you chauffeur.
I always feel, whenever I hang around with staying in Drummond, I feel like Elvis, too.
You should feel like Elvis every night.
You should feel like Elvis every night.
You should feel like Elvis every night.
You should feel like he isn't right.


You said in a nice way.



So I did this journey so that I could achieve a higher level of success.
What Galbraith..


Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, this is your room.
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
You think that's air you're breathing?
So you're here to save the world.
I know you're out there.
I can feel you now.
I know that you're afraid.
You're afraid of us.
You're afraid of change.
I don't know the future.
I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end.
I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.
I'm going to hang up this phone.
And then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.
I'm going to show them a world without you.
A world without rules and controls.
Without borders or boundaries.
A world where anything is possible.
Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.
A world where everything is possible.
A world where everything is possible.
A world where everything is possible.
