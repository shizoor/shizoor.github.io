1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Radiation, nuclear radiation, nuclear radiation, nuclear Bob.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,680
This is Hour of Sluck.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,460
For more information see...

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,040
The Self Genius.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,660
Hour of Sluck.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,800
Sluck Hour of Sluck.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,620
One mission more informative.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,500
What?

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,480
Then roll for fail.

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:20,900
Shit.

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,960
What?

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,440
Cat pussy.

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,460
From PR News in Washington, I'm twisted on the street below.

14
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,300
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said...

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:36,800
Uh...

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,680
Um...

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,400
Uh...

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,760
Uh...

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,620
Bloomberg was speaking this morning.

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,760
In early trading on Wall Street 6, 12, 6, 9, 8, 15.

21
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,240
This is PR News.

22
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,400
PR's bad.

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,380
PR's bad.

24
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,740
Americans are still changing at an unchanged pace.

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,480
Two-tenths of one percent last month.

26
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,800
0.08% this week.

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,940
0.98%.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,920
Last week.

29
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,660
To 0.66%.

30
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,740
Far below where it needs to be.

31
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,640
A U.S. Marine has been suspended from his duties after being accused of PR News in Washington.

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:13,780
Bob.

33
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:14,820
Bob.

34
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:16,900
Bob.

35
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,500
Bob.

36
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,220
It takes more than intellect to be a musician.

37
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,660
The machine gave me my penny back.

38
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,280
Okay.

39
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,220
Whoa.

40
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,100
I'm a five.

41
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,100
And I want to welcome you to the loneliest time in thousands of years of human history.

42
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,280
Let me repeat that.

43
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:36,580
That.

44
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,140
The reason I'm here, I'm a schizophrenic.

45
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,120
Probably having a hard time in San Francisco.

46
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,500
Well, ladies and gentlemen, you are living social theory.

47
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,820
I know it's weird.

48
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,620
I know it's weird.

49
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,900
That's what we're all about on this program.

50
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,700
I want to live a life prostitution.

51
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,120
Uh, can you help me here?

52
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,800
Crossing boundaries and loving strangers.

53
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,200
You go out to the same restaurant or the same bar together.

54
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:54,860
Whatever.

55
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,680
And that's kind of a necessary element.

56
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,980
Even in the corporate world, I understand that...

57
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,220
If you're going to have a meeting and you want some sort of bonding, even at the corporate level,

58
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,840
you're going to have to bring in prostitutes.

59
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,720
You're just going to have to bring in prostitutes.

60
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,420
You're vulnerable.

61
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,140
That's right.

62
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,880
You open up yourself.

63
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,840
It's five, six times per week.

64
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,620
In and out.

65
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,500
All the time.

66
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,400
Constantly.

67
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,560
And you know what that's like.

68
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,220
I mean, you did some of that in the corporate world.

69
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,260
I did it in the corporate world.

70
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:16,960
Pornography.

71
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,380
Man, you know what we ought to do?

72
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,580
Provide love.

73
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,060
Provide X-rated movie in the hotel room.

74
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,220
The opportunity to develop new relationships in new cities.

75
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,660
We don't want to be lonely anymore.

76
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,040
This is going to be the beginning of something I think very, very significant here.

77
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,260
My daddy snores.

78
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,180
Totally focused on sleep for the public, for the consumer.

79
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,600
Nothing much happened.

80
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,020
Products.

81
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,140
Sleep experience.

82
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,300
My daddy snores.

83
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,360
Why?

84
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,640
Sleep in America.

85
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,240
And we're certainly not getting it.

86
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,200
Take a nap.

87
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,380
My daddy snores.

88
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,400
My daddy snores.

89
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,260
No city or county tries to economize on the gasoline.

90
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,460
Crack.

91
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,220
Fire.

92
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,440
Gasoline.

93
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,520
The outstanding speed and power of crack.

94
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:03,980
Crack.

95
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,740
Ask for a tank full of Rio Grande crack.

96
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,800
Good evening.

97
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,460
Cox.

98
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,120
The narcotic Cox.

99
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,200
Cox.

100
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,280
Agitating narcotics.

101
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,080
It is a great pleasure for me.

102
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:15,820
Cox.

103
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,580
You have the marijuana for me?

104
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,340
You have the morning?

105
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:18,780
Si.

106
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,940
That's pretty weak.

107
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,400
Cox.

108
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,700
Marijuana cigarettes.

109
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,660
I do not know.

110
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,640
I do not know.

111
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,540
I do not know.

112
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,380
I do not know.

113
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,360
I cannot say.

114
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,280
I do not know.

115
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,760
What do you mean you don't know?

116
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,820
I do not know.

117
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,940
I do not know.

118
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,780
I do not know.

119
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,900
Por favor, señor.

120
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,540
I do not know.

121
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,920
I do not know anymore.

122
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Excitedly reports to Cox.

123
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,000
Gag.

124
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,520
Watch for warts on the hands.

125
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,960
Not to know.

126
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,440
Too high.

127
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,420
Might have gone out and killed somebody.

128
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,360
I don't look at things like that.

129
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,460
You can get a freak.

130
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,200
You can get a freak.

131
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,660
That's all.

132
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,120
Might as well go out peddling them reefers.

133
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,120
Good morning.

134
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,260
My name is Scott.

135
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,480
I'm Larry.

136
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,540
I'm a child and adolescent.

137
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,600
I'm president-elect of the American Academy of Marijuana.

138
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,900
First, I'm going to talk.

139
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,900
I'm president-elect of the American Marijuana Academy that services California,

140
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,640
which is the first reality series on television.

141
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,880
Drugs.

142
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,860
Really, drugs.

143
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,480
Drug.

144
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,420
I'm going to talk about the scope.

145
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,340
But I'd like to start off with drugs, marijuana, as well as other.

146
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,320
Getting off tenfold in potency.

147
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,960
Marijuana.

148
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,720
Using marijuana.

149
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,920
Slack better off.

150
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,140
Now, that's a clue.

151
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,860
So marijuana, even if it's chronic or a use of the marijuana.

152
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,200
But start early and keep going.

153
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,920
And so it's important to increase that.

154
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,300
And we need more marijuana.

155
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,560
Well, I want to thank you for your attention.

156
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,080
Hello.

157
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,580
Yep.

158
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,680
How many people has George Bush murdered?

159
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,060
Murderer a bigger criminal than Al Capone.

160
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,760
Sir.

161
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,340
What is happening to human beings?

162
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,800
My God, that sucker's a murderer.

163
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,740
Of course he is.

164
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,660
Of course he is.

165
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,040
George Bush is the killing master.

166
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,840
We're going to have some fun.

167
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,220
Torturing is all right.

168
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,800
Kill a few people.

169
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:20,420
We want you to wipe out blocks and blocks and blocks and blocks and blocks of homes,

170
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,880
of residences, and wipe out at least eight people per household.

171
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,140
George Bush and Dick Cheney.

172
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,340
Talk about one of the biggest criminal duos.

173
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,700
A lot of people have asthma, allergies or trouble breathing at night.

174
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,800
And it gets worse.

175
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,000
Blood is being spilled.

176
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,060
Boom.

177
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,980
Boom.

178
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,520
The murderers who phony up elections to get into offices.

179
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,100
Bob.

180
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,080
Bob.

181
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,140
Bob.

182
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:51,860
Bob.

183
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:52,600
Bob.

184
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:53,940
Bob.

185
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:53,940


186
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,120
It takes more than intellect to be intelligent.

187
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,120


188
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,500
Be a musician.

189
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,920
The machine gave me my penny back.

190
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,500
OK.

191
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,500
Yeah.

192
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,800
Sure.

193
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,820
Understanding today's complex world of the future is

194
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,860
always like having bees live in your head.

195
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,480
But there they are.

196
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:10,900
They are.

197
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,300
They are.

198
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,680
They are.

199
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:11,700
They are.

200
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:11,700


201
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,220
They are.

202
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,660
They are.

203
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,660
They are.

204
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:13,960
They are.

205
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,340
They are.

206
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:14,380
They are.

207
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,240
They are.

208
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:16,860
They are.

209
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,040
They are.

210
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,400
They are.

211
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,780
They are.

212
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,340
They are.

213
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,660
They are.

214
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,540
They are.

215
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,200
They are.

216
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,080
They are.

217
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,220
They are.

218
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,220


219
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,220


220
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,220


221
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,220


222
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,220


223
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,220


224
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,220


225
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,220


226
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,220


227
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,220


228
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,220


229
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,220


230
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,220


231
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,220


232
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,220


233
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,460
You're a trip on.

234
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,380
차� verklische mole, was auf der bahn, hustle am Gan

235
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Your brain may no longer be the boss.

236
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,940
Beware.

237
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,060
Your brain may no longer be the boss.

238
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,760
Did you get that chick?

239
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,540
She's creepy.

240
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,220
Yeah, she's creepy.

241
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,060
Your brain may no longer be the boss.

242
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,460
What goes down, much better.

243
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,180
What goes down, much better.

244
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,000
Your brain may no longer be the boss.

245
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,200
How does this work?

246
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,880
How does this work?

247
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:46,860
How does this work?

248
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,120
How does this work?

249
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,580
How does this work?

250
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,680
How does this work?

251
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,720
How does this work?

252
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,320
How does this work?

253
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,300
So actually you are both aliens right now.

254
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,540
Holy virgin, what is happening out there?

255
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,240
Holy virgin, what is happening out there?

256
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,560
Oh, you're so mean.

257
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,180
Thanks, Harold.

258
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,880
And that's great.

259
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,480
Oh, you're so mean.

260
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,920
Thanks, Harold.

261
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,020
If you are beginning to doubt what I am saying,

262
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,360
you are sorry.

263
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,240
You are sorry.

264
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,120
You are sorry.

265
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,960
You are sorry.

266
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,460
Hello.

267
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,980
Listen carefully.

268
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,800
It's not good.

269
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,800
It's not good.

270
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,820
What does this mean?

271
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,340
It's not good.

272
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,700
It's not good.

273
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,660
It's not good.

274
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,240
It's not good.

275
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,540
Listen to the kept for the good service of humans.

276
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,000
Listen to the kept for the salvation of humanity.

277
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,380
Listen, the neck is not good.

278
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,500
It's not good.

279
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,840
Delusion.

280
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,740
Power of human consciousness.

281
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,640
You gone inside, now you get into browser.

282
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:57,680
It's not good

283
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,040
You gone inside, now you get into browser.

284
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,000
You've disempowerd fear for our faith and compassion.

285
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,980
And the terrible newsspout continues.

286
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,840
Yes, that's right way.

287
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,700
Do you like to give it a squeeze?

288
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,320
Do you want that kind of ride?

289
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Do you think that has the power of being good?

290
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,320


291
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,200
Many of us got assured that the game wasn't looking good.

292
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,360
So, I've shave, Linda, is a beautiful car.

293
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,080
Any comment?

294
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,620
Give it a squeeze.

295
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,980
Many people like to...

296
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,700
If you push something hard enough...

297
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,480
Give it a squeeze.

298
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,340
This is Sci-Fi.

299
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,000
If you push something hard enough...

300
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,980
Many people like to...

301
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,260
This is Sci-Fi.

302
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,940
It's time to bring out the curious and the kooky, don't you think, Jay?

303
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,820
Can we get a close-up of that?

304
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,280
Can we get a close-up of that?

305
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,680
Can we get a close-up of that?

306
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,280
Your brain may no longer be the boss.

307
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,720
Using a lot of Firesign Theater mix in that mix.

308
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,700
Dear friends, that was by...

309
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,160
The Opponent.

310
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,060
Proudly.

311
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,700
Process.

312
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,940
And before that...

313
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,220
The...

314
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,820
Neanderbob song there.

315
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,940
And the very opening stuff.

316
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,980
Collages were by...

317
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,340
Fernandin and Elie Mer.

318
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,820
And we have some really special cuts by him coming up later.

319
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,160
What makes them so very special?

320
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,720
They're differentiated especially from those of...

321
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,800
Norell...

322
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,560
Preff.

323
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,820
Oh, no.

324
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,060
Who did...

325
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,600
Did the other collages in there, which is quite a bit of...

326
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,200
Peddling them, reefers, even if it's chronic.

327
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,980
Those various anti-drug message cut-ups there.

328
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:56,840
And...

329
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,300
And they certainly are classic.

330
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,080
And we have some interesting material that we could play...

331
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,980
Style, nuance, and MXB.

332
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,420
As background music.

333
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,460
Y squared equals...

334
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,920
We could just use Dave...

335
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,060
Y squared equals...

336
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,040
This background music.

337
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,260
Dave's muttering.

338
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,100
This random mechanical robot muttering in the background.

339
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,920
In the mornings, the sounds of the birds outside are going with small animals in the neighborhood.

340
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,560
Now, that's some muttering.

341
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,240
Are we...

342
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,880
He's using a robot.

343
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,160
He's using a robot.

344
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,040
He is using a robot.

345
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,480
It was time to draw down the moon.

346
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,040
It was time...

347
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,300
It was time to draw a baboon.

348
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,660
And it was time to croon.

349
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,640
I love...

350
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,380
I love...

351
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,880
I love...

352
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:52,920
I love...

353
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,600
I love...

354
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,000
I love a pistol in the past.

355
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,660
And I do the dirty dance just fine.

356
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,780
Was that the same guy?

357
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,020
Is that the guy you quoted earlier that you said was trying to attack you and wean on the parking lot?

358
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,600
With like a samurai sword or something?

359
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:19,760
Dave, that was what we recorded from inside of your head earlier tonight, isn't it?

360
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,520
I thought...

361
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,340
I thought you said some guy was threatening you.

362
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,720
Like you were in the parking lot.

363
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,060
You were at Dave's supermarket or someplace that I'm not supposed to mention because it sounds like a commercial name.

364
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:34,940
And a guy with a machete or saying something in Cuban or Hispaniol or something like that.

365
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,100
Man, I don't know what happened.

366
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,380
It was like one of those little dagger swords with a...

367
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,820
I don't know.

368
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,720
What happened?

369
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,020
I don't know.

370
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,620
I don't know.

371
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,040
I don't know.

372
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:52,620
I don't know.

373
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,020
I don't know.

374
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:00,560
I'd like to remind you that your names and numbers are being forgotten.

375
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:06,460
And ritually entered into the following database bank bases.

376
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,280
Erupture Corp presents everything you've always hated.

377
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,020
Erupture Corp presents everything you've always hated.

378
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,060
Torturing you nightly under a new plan.

379
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,760
Torturing you nightly under a new plan.

380
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,060
Torturing you nightly under a new plan.

381
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:27,580
Also, foodstuffs brought to you from the great Beyond by nonexistent food peut training animals.

382
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:27,580


383
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,560
Foodstuffs brought to you from the great Beyond by nonexistent foodstatting animals.

384
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,660
Constituent child and the magnet head.

385
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,240
Ial be back in just three years!

386
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,500
I'm a boo-chah, boo-chah

387
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,520
I really love things, but I'm not a boo-chah

388
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,260
I'm a boo-chah, boo-chah

389
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,400
I'm a boo-chah, boo-chah

390
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,520
I'm a boo-chah, boo-chah

391
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,460
You know what I'm saying?

392
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,940
You know what I mean?

393
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,700
Not your sign

394
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,780
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I have all kinds of like powers and so forth

395
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,220
I've been studying them all for a long time

396
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,860
I know, I know

397
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,600
Um, really mystical works and so forth

398
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,720
And how to like, you know, develop your spiritual warrior power

399
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,580
And so forth

400
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,080
You're right, yeah

401
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,220
That's when I caught the churches and stuff

402
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,440
What do they call them, guys?

403
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,020
I gave them the money and everything, but I, you know

404
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,720
I noticed my wines were like

405
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,620
Not growing, they were actually foreshortening

406
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,620
Did you, do you think maybe we could get some of them foreshortened wines and return?

407
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,640
Uh, the entire package?

408
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,800
That's kind of a foreshortened view, if you ask me

409
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,560
Oh, unending vistas for people like this

410
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,580
They have no idea

411
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:42,680
They have no idea

412
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,780
What awaits them in the years to come

413
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,720
They'll be obliterated

414
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,500
Like, like a piece of cheese on a Canadian

415
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:51,740
Cheese?

416
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,120
Wait a minute, what are you doing here?

417
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,700
What kind of cheese?

418
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,680
You're not supposed to be here right now

419
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,860
I want the cheese

420
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,560
Okay, just, oh, good, so stop, we'll roll back and start again

421
00:14:59,560 --> 00:14:59,800
Cheese

422
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,100
Cheese

423
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:03,800
Cheese

424
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,700
Cheese

425
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,020
Cheese

426
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,180
.

427
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,480
Cheese is a little too say überzeugable

428
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,520
Mmm, cheese is a little too be just like me

429
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,900
The våra Üstye Friends

430
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,440
It was my first time to see it

431
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,100
It took perspective and trope

432
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,600
It was my first time to see cheese

433
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:25,980
Tomato pane

434
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,980
Ley off

435
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,980
So good

436
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,760
Is that where we just want to cut darlings?

437
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:30,760


438
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:30,760


439
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,600
Shout out to Kいや

440
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,400
Earth, Wind & Fire

441
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,660
from some...

442
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,020
You know, it's unusual for us to play

443
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,360
what we call conspiracy music.

444
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,480
Anything that was owned

445
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,380
by a record company at any point.

446
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,180
But I just...

447
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,420
You know, I love covers.

448
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,060
Especially inappropriate covers.

449
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,080
That one was actually strangely

450
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,600
appropriate.

451
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,520
I would say that it was

452
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,840
appropriate in context.

453
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,460
And appropriated

454
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,060
in the case of...

455
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,320
In the context of Hour of Slack, where we've

456
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,620
completely ruined that great mix

457
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,880
by letting, by allowing

458
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,420
civilians...

459
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,160
To abject mortals.

460
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
To repurified

461
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,540
ex-marks. It proves there's a plot.

462
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,240
The Tommy Sandwiches and

463
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,460
the Vino Lady.

464
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,160
She wasn't there either.

465
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,180
And you know who really

466
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,200
controls the media, don't you?

467
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:28,920
Yeah.

468
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,560
Yeah. Media employees.

469
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,520
Yeah.

470
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,480
Rich guys.

471
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,900
Actually, we've had so many

472
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,260
kooks and crackpots and

473
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,220
what we call normal people.

474
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,400
Media ditch guys.

475
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,340
Yeah, media ditch guys on the

476
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,920
Alt of Slack.

477
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,680
That's the text version of this show

478
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,620
that happens on Usenet.

479
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,140
And

480
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,620
we've had so many kooks and crackpots

481
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,400
there that I've realized that everything

482
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,600
in the world proves

483
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,060
that everything

484
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,020
in the world is a

485
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,880
satanic, pagan,

486
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Masonic Jew.

487
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,680
Well, you once said yourself...

488
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,580
In fact, I've got a list. A guy

489
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,760
posted a bunch of material

490
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,580
comparing me to Hitler.

491
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,640
Really? As a psychotic...

492
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,840
In the football there, that silver case.

493
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,720
There's a letter by a...

494
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,060
Oh, wait. Maybe it's over here.

495
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,620
Oh, here it is. Look at this.

496
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,100
This guy posted...

497
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,740
Hello.

498
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,380
Hello.

499
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,360
I'm gonna pause this background music,

500
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,640
which is good, and we'll put on some

501
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,860
which is the worst.

502
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,780
It's great.

503
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,060
The worst background music.

504
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,580
We need to put on the worst background music there is.

505
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,780
Well, it is, actually. Let me explain

506
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,380
what this is coming up.

507
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,540
Mr. Sister found this

508
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,840
for us. It's called The Most Unwanted

509
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,800
Song by a fellow

510
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,700
soldier named Dave Soldier.

511
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,780
And he conducted

512
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,200
a poll in 1999.

513
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,140
in which he asked

514
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,080
500 people or so

515
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,160
what was their most

516
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,240
disliked kind of music.

517
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,840
We're hearing it in the background.

518
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,880
The things that people...

519
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,600
This is 1960s. Not sitcom,

520
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,960
but, you know...

521
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,120
No, this isn't... Let me explain

522
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,780
what this is, okay?

523
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,220
It was found

524
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,140
that the things that people

525
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,480
really dislike in music

526
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,640
are accordions,

527
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:27,900
tubas,

528
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,320
kids singing,

529
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,520
cowboys. Dave, I thought that would

530
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,280
be interesting to you. Cowboys.

531
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,980
And things about cowboys

532
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,740
are disliked.

533
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:39,580
Rap,

534
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,460
opera, high-pitched

535
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,100
voices, bagpipes,

536
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,360
ad jingles, elevator music,

537
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,620
and Christmas and holiday

538
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,440
music. Those were things

539
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,520
that people tend

540
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,400
to hate. In fact, when this

541
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,640
fellow put together this piece of music

542
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,300
using only the most

543
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,160
disliked elements of music,

544
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,100
he calculated that

545
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,000
fewer than 200

546
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,420
individuals of the world's

547
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,520
total population will enjoy

548
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,300
this show.

549
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,580
Now I'd like to ask you

550
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,680
the following question,

551
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,380
Reverend Ivan Stang.

552
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,180
What is the vernacular meaning

553
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,280
or the phrase commonly used

554
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,320
to mean real is feeling really?

555
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,160
Isn't there a word now,

556
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,040
Stang, that describes where

557
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,120
the deconstruction,

558
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,640
the expression of the elements is more

559
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,240
understandable

560
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,760
to the masses than the...

561
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,580
Oh man, you know what I'm trying to say?

562
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,400
I'm trying to say

563
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,780
like some of the music that's like,

564
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,840
you know, sounds like bad, you know,

565
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,960
how the stuff used to be real bad, like when they

566
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,780
did the strings and so forth, or the

567
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,820
horns, it sounded real like computer-like

568
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,680
and it was real crappy. And now people

569
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,880
lust for that sound because it's

570
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,100
gone. It's like history. Bad,

571
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,920
uh...

572
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,480
It's become bull-daughter.

573
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,720
In organic music.

574
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,640
It always was bull-daughter.

575
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,540
It always was.

576
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,520
Well, but bull-daughter itself has

577
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,840
18 different gradations or stages.

578
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,120
If we had a copy of Book of the

579
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,180
Subgenius here, I could recite them

580
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,260
from the memory in that book.

581
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,620
But some of them cause follicular damage,

582
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,760
and that's what I'm worried about.

583
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,080
Listen.

584
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,420
I love this.

585
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,060
It is so...

586
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,320
There's the tuba.

587
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,660
It's so dislikable.

588
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,320
And the opera.

589
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,100
And there's all these other things.

590
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,580
And also, you know, from a musical...

591
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,040
And corny cowboy stuff.

592
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,300
From a musical standpoint, the little embellishments

593
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,820
are really redundant as freaking hell, you know?

594
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,040
It sounds...

595
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,820
Well, this piece of music is 22 minutes long,

596
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,820
and it goes all over the...

597
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,320
Globe.

598
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,820
Yeah, it goes everywhere.

599
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:51,120
So we should probably, what, put the globe hats on and get up the psychic swami dance,

600
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:56,260
go in here and turn the lights off and on, and just create something.

601
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,180
Something bad, something foul, something evil.

602
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,460
No, that's been done for us with the most unwanted song.

603
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,760
Most...

604
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,340
But we wanted it.

605
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,660
We certainly did.

606
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
In fact, this...

607
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,060
I now know that I've lusted for this song before I was born.

608
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,680
I think genetically...

609
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,840
Oh, the bagpipes.

610
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,980
Oh, man.

611
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,540
I feel like...

612
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,060
There's a hard rock section in this coming up with bagpipes.

613
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,140
Oh, man.

614
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,420
Oh, man.

615
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,220
Oh, man.

616
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,220


617
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,240
Oh, man.

618
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,240


619
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,240


620
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,240


621
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,680
It was a hell of a day for me in Kilcuddleville.

622
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,060
Three days enough of them stood against the brush,

623
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,560
and only four of them remained afterwards.

624
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,900
I'll change focus here, Captain.

625
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,020
Here's the new scenery.

626
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,400
It's a matte vision brought to you by Earl Pudney

627
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,140
and the rest of the guys and gals down at the...

628
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,200
And down at the ancient Fulke's home.

629
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,700
And...

630
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,520
Oh, look.

631
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,220
It's a multicultural group of children, all of them four foot three and chopped at the

632
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,580
spreads.

633
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,460
And look.

634
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,480
They're all wearing funny fright wigs.

635
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:12,880
This is what we expect from you.

636
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,280
I said this is what we expect from you.

637
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,420
We want you to dance like this, look like this, culturally envision yourself as a member of

638
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,600
the new Newpy Cadets.

639
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,420
Oh, that's no problem.

640
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,500
I can do that with both hands.

641
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,060
I can do that with both hands and feet tied behind my back.

642
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,580
Can you do the quick tuba dance?

643
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,560
Step right up here.

644
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,620
But of course, but of course.

645
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,100
Watch this.

646
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,600
Oh, that's...

647
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
See what I can do.

648
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,000
Look what I can do.

649
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,540
Look at how Steve flies.

650
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,700
She's our girl.

651
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,060
There she is.

652
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:51,280
And so we began the long unstructured journey to Dobstown in hopes of becoming a fundamentalist

653
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,040
reactive star.

654
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,400
She could dance all right.

655
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:55,500
She could dance all right.

656
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,800
To quick time tuba and bag types.

657
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:05,640
But could she actually forewarn those with the foreskin on their forehead?

658
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:12,400
Here's an interesting news item from the plane dealer April 25th, 2008.

659
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:20,340
David Alan Chapin, who ate the brain of his roommate after he shot him 30 years ago in

660
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:25,400
an argument over whose religion was best, is up for parole in June.

661
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,640
He is like Clermont County's version of Hannibal Lecter, assistant prosecutor Daniel Woody

662
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,740
Breyer said of Chapin, who was sentenced to life in prison for aggravated murder.

663
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,960
Chapin shot his longtime friend Donald E. Liming in the right eye with a rifle in their

664
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,340
apartment.

665
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:51,980
Uh, Chapin was a Baptist while Liming had claimed he was a Catholic, a Buddhist, and

666
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,040
a pagan.

667
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,100
Oh, no.

668
00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:00,120
After stuffing Liming's body into the truck of his Buick Skylark, Chapin drove to Raymond

669
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,740
Walters College in Ohio where he was a student.

670
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:08,300
A biology professor testified that Chapin asked if he wanted a corpse to dissect.

671
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,940
They oppose Chapin's release because he's very dangerous.

672
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,480
It's not safe to have him in society, Liming's brother said.

673
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:20,860
No, it's not safe.

674
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,280
Not safe at all.

675
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,780
He would go after my mother and my sister.

676
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,940
I do believe him.

677
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,860
That's more than a mother and sister.

678
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,620
He is a convicted, cold-blooded, subgenius murderer and I don't think that people who

679
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,700
do brutal acts such as that can be re-habifrapazipilopsitabitated.

680
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:43,340
And he says a psychiatrist testified that Chapin told him he and Liming had agreed to

681
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:49,400
eat the brain of whoever died first so that the spirit of the dead person would live on

682
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,800
inside the survivor.

683
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:51,720
Yeah.

684
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:58,300
Here ye, here ye, this court's marshal is now in session, Judge Honorable Rudson P.

685
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,560
Feudy, sitting upon a bench.

686
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,160
Before the docket's first message, it is really brief.

687
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:12,420
There's a on the docket, a raping Chapin as he's known.

688
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:19,020
Mr. Chapin, what do you have to say for yourself if you have anything to say for yourself?

689
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,480
Now here, Dave, here's what-

690
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:21,760
I'm so sorry.

691
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,260
I'm so sorry.

692
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,040
I'm so sorry.

693
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,040


694
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,040


695
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,040


696
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,380
You know, our favorite subgenius kook on Alt-Slack-

697
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,580
Please don't.

698
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,720
He, and this guy's dead serious.

699
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,080
This is his list of things that Hitler and Stang-

700
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,780
Have in common?

701
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,340
Have in common.

702
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,880
I'm Stang, and Hitler wasn't here tonight.

703
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,000
Well, at least you have one penis like the rest of us.

704
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,200
Not like Adolf Hitler.

705
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,700
Well, now, we're getting to that.

706
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,400
He's getting to that.

707
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,380
We're getting to that.

708
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,280
Well, Hitler had four.

709
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,500
Number one, both were cartoonists.

710
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,020
Number two-

711
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,620
seen all my published cartoons.

712
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,620
Both espoused

713
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,620
the virtues of

714
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,800
vegetarianism.

715
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,520
Both were politically

716
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,640
socialist.

717
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,860
Both were avid students

718
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,740
of the occult and Satanism.

719
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,060
Apparently Stang is dead.

720
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,420
Both supported and mingled with homosexuals

721
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,320
and other sexual perverts.

722
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,560
Deviants and pevels.

723
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,760
I want to hear more about this mingling.

724
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,640
And best of all,

725
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,180
both were Jewish.

726
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,820
This guy,

727
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,720
by the way, also said that

728
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,780
the Chinese

729
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,260
deserved that earthquake.

730
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,240
That was punishment from God

731
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,060
who's punishing them for being

732
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,640
slavish followers

733
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,620
of a Jewish-inspired

734
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,100
government.

735
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,980
Freemasonic.

736
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,800
Because Chairman Mao and the

737
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,760
Chinese communists were

738
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,520
Freemasonic Jews.

739
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,740
Because communism,

740
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,140
of course, is a Jewish plot.

741
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,780
And Judaism is a Masonic plot.

742
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,700
Judaism is.

743
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,500
Or something.

744
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,840
They're somehow related.

745
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,880
According to the new crop

746
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,060
of all-purpose kooks that we're getting,

747
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,100
or let's call them

748
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,440
differently-samed people.

749
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,960
I don't want to be a bigot.

750
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,800
I'm a bit confused here now.

751
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,680
I am too.

752
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,200
I always thought a pie mason was just like

753
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,000
one of those guys who loved sweets

754
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,600
and fantasy pastries.

755
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,920
And here I, you know,

756
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,120
now a Jew mason,

757
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,400
that would be someone who likes to

758
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,920
eat Jewish people?

759
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,460
That would be the...

760
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,780
Well, actually,

761
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,900
don't we have one next door?

762
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,780
In fact, we do have a gay, satanic

763
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,960
Jewish mason lives next door to us.

764
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,340
I read this routine to him

765
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
and he said he added

766
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,680
some more sins he had

767
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,260
that he was enjoying.

768
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,480
When you said that, you know, thing about Chapin

769
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,700
eating the brain of a guy for being a Buddhist

770
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,140
Catholic,

771
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,660
whatever else he was,

772
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,260
doesn't it seem likely he'd also want to eat

773
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,840
our brains just for a different flavor?

774
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,520
Oh, yeah, right.

775
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,540
Subgenius brains.

776
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
That's a great idea.

777
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,820
They're a little overcooked.

778
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,200
You really want to get in trouble for eating

779
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,400
a subgenius brain.

780
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,900
They've been in the sun for a little too long.

781
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,500
To inherit his great intelligence,

782
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,360
his spectacular courage.

783
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,660
Yeah, right.

784
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,640
No, there are instant, automatic reactions.

785
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,000
When you eat a subgenius brain,

786
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,000
there's immediate vomiting,

787
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,600
there's a whistling in the ear,

788
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,320
there's a whiz-banging of the knees,

789
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,640
and sometimes there's actual

790
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,700
artifacture from space falls down.

791
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,080
Another researcher here

792
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,620
on .slack,

793
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,700
Reverend Richard Skull,

794
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,140
discovered that there were

795
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,140
other similarities between

796
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,660
me and Hitler,

797
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,080
in that we both love cute kittens.

798
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,780
And you both have facial hair.

799
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,100
A little bit of facial hair, too.

800
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,760
And he said that there was some difference.

801
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,620
Hitler preferred sheep,

802
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,320
while Stang is a goat man.

803
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:45,720
A goat!

804
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,360
Hitler loved a big Mercedes,

805
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,700
but did not drive.

806
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,680
Stang can...

807
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:50,980
He can drive,

808
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,460
but can't afford to buy gas.

809
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,120
But that's only because

810
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,500
dwarf male prostitutes are so expensive.

811
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,960
You have to pay for their gas.

812
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,300
They're bound to go down again.

813
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,200
Hitler had only one testicle,

814
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,580
while Stang has at least 30.

815
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,360
And they all post to alt.slack.

816
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,880
Hitler's dog loved him.

817
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,200
Stang's dog used to pee on his leg all the time.

818
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,260
And I want you to know, friends,

819
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,320
it is not easy to train a dog

820
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,180
to pee on Hitler's leg.

821
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,760
Sumner Redstone,

822
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,820
chairman of Viacom,

823
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,440
rejected Hitler's art,

824
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,780
while Stang's was published all over the world

825
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,680
under the pseudonym of Charles Schultz.

826
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,560
No, it was under the Charles Mason,

827
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,900
spelled with a silent N.

828
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,540
No, I'm a Manson.

829
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,720
I'm part of the...

830
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,220
I'm not a Freemason.

831
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,020
I'm a Freemanson.

832
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,060
I've always been behind the concept

833
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,840
that if we could free Charlie,

834
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,000
he could lead the world into a new eon

835
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,660
a new millennium.

836
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,460
That would all be like this perfect world

837
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,640
where it's like free love.

838
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,840
You could do your own thing, man.

839
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,000
When will we attain such a world?

840
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,900
You're just a robot.

841
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,620
We all can end being a...

842
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,420
Stop being a robot.

843
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,540
You can be real, man.

844
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,120
You can have a real life.

845
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,800
I need all the free love I can have.

846
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,040
Sweet reality.

847
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,700
Sweet reality.

848
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,240
Sweet reality.

849
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,760
A chicka chicka bang bang.

850
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,140
Yeah.

851
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,600
Gotta shoot her down.

852
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,780
Down, down, down.

853
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,140
With the power of a soul

854
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,280
anything is possible.

855
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,340
With the power of a soul

856
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,460
anything is possible.

857
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,740
With the power of a soul

858
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,980
anything is possible.

859
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,800
Anything that you wanna get.

860
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,700
With the power of a soul

861
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,760
anything is possible.

862
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,480
Anything is possible.

863
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,340
Boy, I'm coming down, you ain't gonna know it.

864
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,480
Look, bitch.

865
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,700
I'm in front now.

866
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,500
Too late.

867
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,520
So far ahead of myself, I'm coming up behind.

868
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,880
Coming up behind.

869
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,520
Here's the taste.

870
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,380
Yeah.

871
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,800
I'm so far ahead of myself.

872
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,100
I'm coming up inside.

873
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,020
I'm coming up behind.

874
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,740
Inside, inside.

875
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,460
Flying in so much with one tar, baby.

876
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,640
Yeah, it's an escape to a faraway land.

877
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,900
Yeah, check it out.

878
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:14,880
Yeah.

879
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,200
Little jellyfish been floating

880
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,600
so long and so slight.

881
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,360
Lord, ain't got a bone in his jelly pack.

882
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,980
Ordinary days, every night.

883
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,500
Right now, rotation is easy.

884
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,500
Even if there's a risk.

885
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,280
I'm floating like a big, big bug.

886
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,820
Sometimes the wind ain't right.

887
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,840
I can see the light.

888
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,180
God knows I tried.

889
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,280
But I'll have to excuse me while I kiss the sky.

890
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,520
We'll make you whole.

891
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,140
We will make you whole.

892
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,980
Lord, it bring you home.

893
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,700
Whoo!

894
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,300
He'll let you fly over your enemies.

895
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,200
Lord, it bring you home.

896
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,520
Lord, it bring you home.

897
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,500
I wish I had my women's hand.

898
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,660
With the power of soul.

899
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,300
Make a noise, huh?

900
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,840
With the power of soul.

901
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,000
Do what?

902
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,000
With the power of soul.

903
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,080
With the power

904
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,180
Lord, oh yeah

905
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,820
Ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh

906
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:26,820


907
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:26,820


908
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,400
With the power of soul.

909
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,860
He who receives, receives me,

910
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,320
and he who receives me, receives me

911
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,300
And he who receives me, receives me

912
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,100
Ro持

913
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,300
massive bosoms for the feast.

914
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,080
So after receiving bosom, etc.,

915
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,780
we shall see so massive,

916
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,140
so enormous,

917
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,620
but absolutely wretched in love.

918
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,860
As, of course, all of us are

919
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,520
completely sold out,

920
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,260
deeply, deeply feeling,

921
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,980
well, you, day and night,

922
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,380
are growing, growing too.

923
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,000
Leaning on the bosom tones,

924
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,760
sticking out you,

925
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,460
sold out the butt.

926
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:35,700
I want to call your attention back to

927
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,360
whatever bosom.

928
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,500
Lively, immoral behavior.

929
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,560
Pound, pound.

930
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,060
You can do this.

931
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:48,740
I'm completely

932
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,600
U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

933
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,240
Gas, gas, gas.

934
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,380
Stop, stop.

935
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,240
Growth, growth.

936
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,180
Oh my God.

937
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,160
Oh my God.

938
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,240
Give up sex.

939
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,520
Give up sex.

940
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,060
Why?

941
00:33:59,220 --> 00:33:59,660
Why?

942
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,300
Why?

943
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,640
Well, here's the thing.

944
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,120
Why, why cut it off?

945
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,060
So, and I'm, I'm two years old.

946
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,180
Right, right.

947
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,820
Go to the bathroom and

948
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,840
they do do, they do do.

949
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,360
Priests do indeed go somewhere

950
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:10,820
and they masturbate.

951
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,740
But, but, but, but, but, but,

952
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,140
why?

953
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,600
And, uh, you know, you've got

954
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,420
this lovely penis.

955
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,300
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

956
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,180
Wait, wait, wait.

957
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,280
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

958
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,680
I'm tired of hearing you.

959
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,700
Wait, wait a minute.

960
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,280
Wait a minute.

961
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,860
Wait a minute.

962
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,560
Wait a minute.

963
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,020
Wait a minute.

964
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,680
Let me, wait a minute.

965
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,000
Let me.

966
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,780
Brass are up there.

967
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,820
Brass are up there.

968
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,060
Money, money, money, money, money.

969
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:30,920
Money.

970
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,240
Woo!

971
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,820
Learn how to fleece people

972
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,040
by starting religions.

973
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:35,680
Discombobulated.

974
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,900
The organ is playing.

975
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,900
The choir is singing.

976
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,100
Ah, here you have the pope out here.

977
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,820
Um, very happy to have dinner

978
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,700
in the White House.

979
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,920
With a murderer.

980
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,820
A murderer.

981
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,040
George Bush is a murderer.

982
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,040
Truly immoral behavior.

983
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,500
Ah, yes, different.

984
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,300
Ah, yes.

985
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,620
Ah, yes.

986
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,840
Thanks to Norrell Preff

987
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,280
for cutting those things up.

988
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,520
And that, uh, amazing version

989
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,200
of Power of Soul there

990
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,420
was by Bootsy Collins

991
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,840
with George Clinton

992
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,440
and the P-Funk All-Stars.

993
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,160
How about that?

994
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,940
Now, that was more of a stir-fry

995
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,580
than a collage.

996
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,680
By the way, it is pronounced

997
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,620
P-Funk.

998
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,320
Yeah, because they, uh,

999
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,660
sometimes,

1000
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,160
you feel in front of it.

1001
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,300
The poo-poo

1002
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,060
It makes a sound like this.

1003
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,520
It goes

1004
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,380
P-Funk.

1005
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,280
Like that.

1006
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:20,860
Do you understand?

1007
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:21,700
P-Funk.

1008
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,100
Now, we have something

1009
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,940
really important

1010
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,480
coming up musically, Doug.

1011
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,100
Is that it?

1012
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,360
What the hell?

1013
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,600
Yeah.

1014
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,120
Huh.

1015
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,640
Detective Dave

1016
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
is on his way

1017
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,400
to pick up his new assignment.

1018
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,700
And will she be a blonde?

1019
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,660
Will she be a brunette?

1020
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,840
Will she be a Russian spy?

1021
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,460
Yes, Detective Dave

1022
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,520
is on his way

1023
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,040
to meet his

1024
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,120
maku.

1025
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,800
Uh, Ginger,

1026
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,840
did I have any messages?

1027
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,540
The Neanderthal

1028
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,060
detective.

1029
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,980
Yes, there's three messages

1030
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,820
for you, sir.

1031
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,580
Uh, what's this first one

1032
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:05,940
on the top?

1033
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,720
It looks like, uh,

1034
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,280
from the Reverend Ivory Stinks

1035
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,680
or something.

1036
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,380
I can't read the...

1037
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,360
Ivory Stinks, uh,

1038
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,420
wanted to make sure

1039
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,440
that you made the meeting

1040
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:12,880
at three.

1041
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,020
Three?

1042
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,420
A meeting about what?

1043
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,460
I don't recall any meeting.

1044
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,280
Oh, well, you will have

1045
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,460
to deal with that

1046
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,540
personally, sir.

1047
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,100
It also says here

1048
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,080
on the return address,

1049
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,680
it says,

1050
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,220
Church of the Subgenius.

1051
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,240
Is this some sort of

1052
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,620
spiritual-religious organization

1053
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,240
and what is it?

1054
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,860
Uh, well, um...

1055
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,860
Is it, uh,

1056
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,880
like Scientology

1057
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,060
or something?

1058
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,300
What's the sound

1059
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:35,620
of that voice?

1060
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,340
Somebody just asked

1061
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,600
if it was like Scientology

1062
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,060
or something.

1063
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,940
If anything,

1064
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,140
the Scientology Crime Syndicate

1065
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,800
mocks the subgenius.

1066
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,340
This is not the other way around.

1067
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,780
I disagree.

1068
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,220
Scientology and the Church

1069
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,080
of the Subgenius

1070
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,260
are two different branches

1071
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,240
of what is ultimately

1072
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,140
the same profiteering UFO cult.

1073
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,560
And both are part

1074
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,280
of an experiment

1075
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,200
in the running

1076
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,380
of religions and cults.

1077
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,660
The variable being tested

1078
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,320
was slack

1079
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,740
and what it does

1080
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,480
when infused

1081
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,760
into a fledgling saucer cult

1082
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,980
and Scientology

1083
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,980
is the control.

1084
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,480
Without slack,

1085
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,500
a for-profit cult

1086
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,760
will focus exclusively

1087
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,560
on making money

1088
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,240
to the point where

1089
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,920
it cripples itself

1090
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,440
in social dimensions

1091
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,560
and is vilified

1092
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,400
by outsiders

1093
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,820
for being too secretive

1094
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,660
and costing too much to join.

1095
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,500
The slack-in version,

1096
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,860
the Church of the Subgenius,

1097
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,640
is more accepted

1098
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,760
because it is more flexible.

1099
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,700
It can be a joke religion

1100
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,640
and a purveyor of funny books

1101
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,480
if that is all

1102
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,940
the audience wants it to be.

1103
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,860
And the beliefs are published

1104
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,540
in big, easy-to-read books

1105
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,820
with lots of pictures

1106
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,540
for potential customer members

1107
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,080
to buy and enjoy

1108
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,860
before deciding

1109
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,060
whether or not to join.

1110
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,060
And even if they don't,

1111
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,420
the Subgenius Foundation

1112
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,820
has already sold them a book.

1113
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,260
The experiment is still running,

1114
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,460
but the results so far

1115
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,860
show that valuing slack

1116
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,620
and money

1117
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,020
produces a more functional

1118
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,080
real cult

1119
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,780
slash joke church hybrid

1120
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,840
in comparison

1121
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,260
to the real cult

1122
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,420
slash crime syndicate hybrid

1123
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,660
produced by valuing money alone.

1124
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,300
In the future,

1125
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,480
all new religions

1126
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,560
will have a joke religion aspect

1127
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,400
and use the entertainment value

1128
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,800
of absurdity

1129
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,560
to facilitate actual belief

1130
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,200
in ridiculous concepts

1131
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,360
like hope, joy, and love.

1132
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,580
After all,

1133
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,500
if you can believe

1134
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,780
that extra-dimensional horrors

1135
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,020
are manipulating the planet

1136
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,240
to feed on human misery

1137
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,260
and that a lone salesman

1138
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,380
and his gaggle

1139
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,060
of misfit fair-weather followers

1140
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,520
can effectively fight them off

1141
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,480
by goofing off,

1142
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,200
then less fantastical notions

1143
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,360
than, like, for instance,

1144
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,900
life actually being pretty good

1145
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,240
and the world being a great place

1146
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,800
are far easier to accept.

1147
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,460
As possible.

1148
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,820
What are you guys

1149
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,260
jabbering about over there?

1150
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,320
My ears were bleeding.

1151
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,420
I hope you were listening.

1152
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,140
My ears were bleeding.

1153
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,300
That was really important.

1154
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,220
That was an important part

1155
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,920
of your lessons, kids.

1156
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,340
Written by Moros,

1157
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,380
also known as Dr. Holocaust.

1158
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,940
Well, when we got to the second part

1159
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,020
where you adjudicate or, um,

1160
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,520
not substantiate.

1161
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,240
There's that word again.

1162
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,140
Adjudicate.

1163
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:11,600
Adjudicate.

1164
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,320
Adjudicate.

1165
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:12,820
When, when,

1166
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,760
when you create legislation

1167
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,160
for your own benefit,

1168
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,020
what is that called?

1169
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,860
It sounded to me like

1170
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,740
you were creating laws

1171
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,800
and just coming up with stuff

1172
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,780
and it was all it was going to do

1173
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,540
was make you rich

1174
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,960
and fatten your pockets.

1175
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,920
That's called being human, Dave.

1176
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,400
Fattening your pockets?

1177
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,060
Yeah.

1178
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,900
Can you use any sort of article

1179
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,040
to fatten your pockets with

1180
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,020
or does it have to be

1181
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,940
U.S. currency or euros?

1182
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,240
Can't you just put in

1183
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,160
a little bit of extra cheese

1184
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,920
every morning?

1185
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,040
It can be gold teeth.

1186
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,280
Ah, gold teeth.

1187
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,480
A little bit of your soul.

1188
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:42,840
So funny.

1189
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,280
And I stole from my grandmother.

1190
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,300
Anything works in this world.

1191
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,020
I, I,

1192
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,900
I can hear her singing now.

1193
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,040
She, she was a socialist.

1194
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,520
In fact, she was

1195
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,860
an anarcho-syndicalist.

1196
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,180
Well, I forget what it was,

1197
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,380
but they had big, big meetings

1198
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,300
and everyone would shout

1199
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,140
and sometimes they'd play

1200
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,660
the international

1201
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,300
and she, she wore a cowgirl hat.

1202
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,220
She'd play the bagpipes

1203
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,380
and then she'd sing sometimes

1204
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,420
and, oh, those were the days.

1205
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,300
Poppy, I remember.

1206
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,460
Her popular bullgirl, Davina.

1207
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,080
Oh, yes.

1208
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,980
She was a tuba player, too, wasn't she?

1209
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,640
Yes, she performed the nightlife

1210
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,040
every night.

1211
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,340
She did rap opera?

1212
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,740
Ten, two, rap opera.

1213
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:22,620
Absolutely.

1214
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,300
She was, she,

1215
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,700
she had a Christmas album,

1216
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,260
I believe.

1217
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,180
Do we have that thing,

1218
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,280
that little interview with her?

1219
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,160
Do we?

1220
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,540
That's just, that's what's

1221
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,300
playing in the background.

1222
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,620
Well, no, that's the

1223
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,220
background music.

1224
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:34,920
There was actually,

1225
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,740
there were some bits,

1226
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,260
some cut-ups.

1227
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:36,400
No, this is the interview.

1228
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,440
This is how she answered

1229
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:38,960
the question,

1230
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,920
where were you born?

1231
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,200
Well, she's not singing

1232
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,040
right this minute.

1233
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,580
Oh, this is the part

1234
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,360
where she starts talking.

1235
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,660
Oh, no, you said

1236
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,540
you were born in

1237
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,500
Yalu Province

1238
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,320
in northern China,

1239
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,900
but your family

1240
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,880
was not Chinese.

1241
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,680
They were named

1242
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,840
the Diplomatic Corps.

1243
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,180
Is that correct?

1244
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,420
Yes, that is correct.

1245
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,020
And you said

1246
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,160
when you start performing

1247
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,080
in these local

1248
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,440
Lake Erie resorts

1249
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,480
and bowling halls

1250
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,240
that sometimes

1251
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,700
maybe elderly men

1252
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,300
would actually

1253
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,460
try to find you.

1254
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:12,460


1255
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:12,460


1256
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:12,460


1257
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:12,460


1258
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:12,460


1259
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:12,460


1260
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:12,460


1261
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,520
Oh, no, don't be

1262
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,540
talking about that

1263
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,360
over radio waves.

1264
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,380
Well, your wisdom teeth

1265
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,400
actually have

1266
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,260
transmitters and receivers

1267
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,520
and isn't that

1268
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,280
a genetic twist?

1269
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:24,820
That's why they're

1270
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,000
called wisdom teeth.

1271
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,380
But so?

1272
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,480
Is there any relation

1273
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,640
to the wisdom teat?

1274
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,660
The wisdom teat

1275
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,400
is like the wisdom,

1276
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,740
we all want to suckle

1277
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,800
at the wisdom teat,

1278
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,500
but we don't want to

1279
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,080
suck our own wisdom teeth

1280
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,740
because they could be

1281
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,560
gone at any minute.

1282
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,540
We're in a miasma

1283
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,460
storm of wisdom teeth.

1284
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,920
Of mortality right now.

1285
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,100
We're getting more ancient

1286
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,600
every 14 seconds.

1287
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,860
I was just thinking

1288
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,620
I wish this show

1289
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,220
had subtitles

1290
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,080
so I could tell

1291
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,600
what the hell

1292
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,160
you're saying

1293
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,000
half the time.

1294
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:54,600
Yeah.

1295
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,300
Stan, you told me

1296
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,980
this show does have subtitles.

1297
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,500
Yeah, but they're running

1298
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,480
backwards from my point of view.

1299
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,340
You, okay,

1300
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,460
then you told me

1301
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,680
that you were dyslexic enough

1302
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,500
that you could read

1303
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,100
them backwards

1304
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,560
and now you're saying

1305
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,920
they're rolling too fast.

1306
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:09,980
While I'm engineering

1307
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,260
at the same time.

1308
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,460
It makes sense.

1309
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,080
It makes me dizzy.

1310
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,160
Now, Princess,

1311
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:14,880
we remember

1312
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,140
the Neanderthal song?

1313
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,620
Yeah, the Neanderthal song.

1314
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,800
Okay, now listen, friends,

1315
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,900
you may recall

1316
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,880
our last live show,

1317
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,740
we played this

1318
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,980
odd little tiny bit of sound

1319
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,860
that some scientist

1320
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,060
had reconstructed

1321
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:28,580
what he thought

1322
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,300
the Neanderthal voice

1323
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,280
sounded like.

1324
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,920
It was kind of a

1325
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,420
eeeh.

1326
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,560
That was all it was.

1327
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,860
Brr, eeeh, brr.

1328
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,400
And I cut it into

1329
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,080
a little series

1330
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,800
where he almost

1331
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,660
was singing going

1332
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,060
eeeh, eeeh, eeeh, eeeh, eeeh.

1333
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,140
Well, Fernanda Nende

1334
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,660
Leemur unearthed

1335
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,440
some tracks

1336
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,940
of the actual

1337
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,540
Neanderthal

1338
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,380
tribal singing

1339
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,400
that's coming up.

1340
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:52,760
Oh, choral singing?

1341
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,160
There's a little

1342
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,840
17-second cut here.

1343
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,020
But stand by

1344
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,560
and pay attention

1345
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,400
because this is

1346
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,200
the last time

1347
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,060
the Neanderthal

1348
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,220
will sing for you.

1349
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:03,520
Yeah, man, it's worth

1350
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,060
your while.

1351
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:04,960
Believe me.

1352
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,680
Check it out, man.

1353
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,640
This is all the Bob.

1354
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:07,760
Bob.

1355
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:09,700
Bob.

1356
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,000
Bob.

1357
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,880
Bob.

1358
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,260
Bob.

1359
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:14,960
Bob.

1360
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1361
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1362
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1363
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1364
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1365
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1366
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1367
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1368
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1369
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1370
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1371
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1372
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1373
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1374
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1375
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1376
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1377
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1378
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,960


1379
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,900
It takes more than

1380
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,820
intellect to be a

1381
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,220
musician.

1382
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,820
The machine gave me

1383
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,580
my penny back.

1384
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,200
Okay.

1385
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,160
Whoa.

1386
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:39,400
What's that all about?

1387
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,620
Whoa.

1388
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:43,660


1389
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,180
Whoa.

1390
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,560
Miah.

1391
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,240
Ho, we got him.

1392
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,560
Ho, here he comes,

1393
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:02,800
full of it.

1394
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,040
Oh, god.

1395
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,980
One kick to do.

1396
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,860
This is some

1397
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:08,820
This is some T insecure

1398
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,740
over the horse.

1399
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,460
From PR News in Washington, I'm currently under investigation.

1400
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,640
Officials did not say parts of the Midwest have been hit hard by another round of bad PR.

1401
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,520
Bad PR.

1402
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,880
Bad PR.

1403
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,240
Repeat after me in Mandarin Chinese.

1404
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,680
Ni hao ma?

1405
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:40,760
Ni hao ma?

1406
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,680
Ni hao ma?

1407
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,100
Ni hao ma?

1408
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:45,300


1409
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,780
Now repeat in English.

1410
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,120
How are you?

1411
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,800
How are you?

1412
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,220
Ni hao ma?

1413
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,440
Ni hao ma?

1414
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,540
Wo hen hao?

1415
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,460
Wo ho hao neng ya?

00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,480

1417
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,220
Wo ho hao?

1418
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,060
Ni men cho zhong wen cho de.

1419
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,360

1420
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,240
Oh!

1421
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,060
Listen to those guys go at it.

1422
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,260
Dr.

1423
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,620
Sinister, they're...

1424
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:11,880
Wo hao ya?

1425
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,840
Wo men gao...

1426
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,340
Wo men gao hua.

1427
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,660
Wo men...

1428
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,140
What are we doing now?

1429
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,000
Wo men na...

1430
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:22,640
Wo men za cho shou?

1431
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,760
Wo men...

1432
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,660
Say that again.

1433
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,560
Jin za shou yi jian.

1434
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,780
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1435
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,720
Ho la ho la ho la.

1436
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,380
La la la la.

1437
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,820
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1438
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,220
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1439
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,300
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1440
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:35,680
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1441
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,160
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1442
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,320
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1443
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:37,400
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1444
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,160
Come back, baby.

1445
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,420
I'm sorry.

1446
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,040
I'm sorry.

1447
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:40,920
I'm sorry.

1448
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,620
You know what you did to Grandpa in saying he was an opium smoker?

1449
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:47,860
I didn't mean to take off his sandals and his fine founded feet.

1450
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,240
I know he was a true and false subgenius, but when I...

1451
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,140
Honey, stay away from the river!

1452
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:54,420
I...

1453
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,460
I'm on my way.

1454
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,340
I'm go...

1455
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:56,960
Ha-aaah!

1456
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,560
Exposed to the vast nature of an impregnable life, you have the power to change the world

1457
00:45:59,560 --> 00:45:59,560


1458
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,420
Oh...

1459
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:08,440
Thank goodness, there's only about two minutes left of the most unwanted song, which we've

1460
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,560
been running in the background.

1461
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,180
This is still some of it.

1462
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,700
I'm so happy now.

1463
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,340
I wanted some.

1464
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:19,180
It has a home here on the most unwanted show.

1465
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,460
You know, some of us have been getting tickets lately.

1466
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,140
Genetic deviance.

1467
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:29,620
Okay, sure, but what can they really do about it?

1468
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:35,080
They can learn the secrets of X-Day.

1469
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:43,340
X-Day is celebrated by the subgeniuses every year at their annual mating migration,

1470
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:48,060
at their mating grounds in far western rural New York.

1471
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,460
Lovely Brushwood Folklore Center,

1472
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:56,700
which is the natural habitat of these creatures for their mating rituals.

1473
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,540
Facing the morning sun in a long, ever-ending,

1474
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,700
reap of a balance of the most amazing.

1475
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:05,540
Sir?

1476
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:05,640


1477
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,280
Sir, what are you doing with that?

1478
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,000
Yai?

1479
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,300
Sir, please.

1480
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,940
Put that back in your pants, sir.

1481
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,320
I'm going to be forced to call the dent-

1482
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,560
I can't watch.

1483
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,100
Put that back in your pants or I'll be called-

1484
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:18,600
You're not supposed to watch.

1485
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,800
Forced to call the dentist.

1486
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,860
And so they called...

1487
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,840
Private Dentist.

1488
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,060
Denny the Dentist.

1489
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,380
No, they didn't call.

1490
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,140
Yeah, Denny.

1491
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,400
Denny the Private Dentist.

1492
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,060
They called out to him.

1493
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,420
They called out to their aboriginal god.

1494
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,460
The same god they'd been calling for thousands of generations.

1495
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,420
And each and every one of them had a different interpretation.

1496
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,160
And that's how the world was begat and begone.

1497
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,360
Just so simple as that.

1498
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,520
Did you want to learn more, honey?

1499
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,700
Just sit up here on Grandpa's knee.

1500
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,840
Or better yet, uh, wait a minute, I...

1501
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:57,860
Afraid.

1502
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:58,400
I'm call-

1503
00:47:59,120 --> 00:47:59,560
Afraid.

1504
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,020
Afraid.

1505
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,100
Be like Britney Spears.

1506
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:02,840
You're insane, it's-

1507
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,440
You're insane, it's a-

1508
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:03,580
Go!

1509
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,540
I don't care what men think.

1510
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,140
I want you to be honored.

1511
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,520
Tongue.

1512
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,980
My dear tongue.

1513
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,560
You are awesome.

1514
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,280
I believe that God still has a name and his name is...

1515
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,120
Sleelity.

1516
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,320
Nam-me-a-fow-ro-vo-ho-

1517
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,140
We want you to come.

1518
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,960
And as those whales are coming for two years.

1519
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,120
Two years.

1520
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,300
Total head on the rock.

1521
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:29,920
Now why?

1522
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,780
Why?

1523
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,220
Why?

1524
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:32,480
Why?

1525
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,480
All of those hypocrites in the church.

1526
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,980
Church is boring.

1527
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:39,860
Why?

1528
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:40,940
Why?

1529
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,340
You get filthy.

1530
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:46,540
All of the profanity and the muck and the grime.

1531
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,780
All of the vulgarity.

1532
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,920
You hear the beat, beat, beat, beat.

1533
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:52,840
Yow!

1534
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,520
It's go, go, go, go, go.

1535
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,840
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1536
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,960
The Bible is just filled with antiquated myths.

1537
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,480
You're a monkey's uncle.

1538
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,480
You're a monkey's uncle.

1539
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,460
Ellen DeGeneres.

1540
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,860
Cause we love homosexuals.

1541
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,320
You may be seated.

1542
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,040
Thank you.

1543
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,240
Let's give God a clap.

1544
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,120
Let's give God a clap.

1545
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,040
Friends, thanks Nor-El Prep.

1546
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,220
We're learning more about many of the mothers in U.S. history.

1547
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,220
Sunday afternoon.

1548
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,880
I pref Nor-El.

1549
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,220
I piffed and pref both of them in my day, sonny girl.

1550
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,320
That's perfity.

1551
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,460
You know, I once was a person who was a woman.

1552
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,460


1553
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,460


1554
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,460


1555
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,460


1556
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,460


1557
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,460


1558
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,460


1559
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,460


1560
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,460


1561
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,460


1562
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,460


1563
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,460


1564
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:35,220
I was a personal friend of the guy you call God, goddess.

1565
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,400
Oh yeah.

1566
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:36,920
Oh yeah.

1567
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,440
We used to chum buddy back when I was in merchant service.

1568
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,880
You must have been like one of those who's who.

1569
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,140
Yeah, I was forcing the ring way in the pottery service for the U.X.

1570
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:47,440
Navy.

1571
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,820
I was in the North Sea.

1572
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,540
I had one good eye.

1573
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,660
I did all right for myself.

1574
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,460
But God, oh jeez, oh man.

1575
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,280
He was an intense cat.

1576
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:57,900
You know what I mean?

1577
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:58,520
Yeah, yeah.

1578
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,440
He wouldn't sit down.

1579
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,020
He wouldn't let it up.

1580
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:00,620
He wouldn't.

1581
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,440
He just kept going.

1582
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:01,440


1583
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:01,440


1584
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:01,440


1585
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:01,440


1586
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:01,440


1587
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:01,440


1588
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:01,440


1589
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:01,440


1590
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,520
Nothing got by the guy, see?

1591
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,360
I know.

1592
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,900
Yeah, he was a gunner for a while.

1593
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:05,700
A rear gunner.

1594
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,500
He was a front gunner and a rear gunner.

1595
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,240
I think a rear gunner is what got him.

1596
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,860
But you know, he can't die, so what the hell?

1597
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:12,560
Who cares, you know?

1598
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,360
I know.

1599
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,620
Yeah, you know.

1600
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,100
You know what he told me one dark Tuesday afternoon, huh?

1601
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:18,720
No.

1602
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,240
You know what he told me?

1603
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,420
He told me that none of us are going to die.

1604
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,520
We're just going to be tortured for a long time after we die.

1605
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,540
Oh man.

1606
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,400
Yeah, yeah.

1607
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:30,780
He said he's going to be personally in charge of the whole deal unless this, what's his

1608
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:31,020
name?

1609
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:31,360
Harry.

1610
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:31,420


1611
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:31,420


1612
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:31,420


1613
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:31,420


1614
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:31,420


1615
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:31,420


1616
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:31,540
Harry.

1617
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:31,660
Da.

1618
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,060
Bob.

1619
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:32,880
What's his name?

1620
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,560
Unless, uh, some...

1621
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,000
I don't know.

1622
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:35,640
Bob Dobbs.

1623
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,420
He was hard to understand.

1624
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,720
This was his manic phase.

1625
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,940
He was starting to sweat.

1626
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:40,980
Pimples were starting to show.

1627
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,180
Yeah, he thought he was in charge, but he was losing it, see?

1628
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,160
And then he did lost it.

1629
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,560
And I guess that was the end of me and God.

1630
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,220
You know, I tried, but I couldn't.

1631
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,380
You did the best you could.

1632
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,440
Yeah, maybe I should have waited for him to stop breathing before I threw him overboard.

1633
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,020
Yeah.

1634
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,180
I don't know.

1635
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,060
I guess it's bad knowing that you could have saved God if you had the chance.

1636
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,380
It's all going to be all right.

1637
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,500
You do have that chance, friends.

1638
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:27,660
You might want to look up more information about the Church of the Subgenius.

1639
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,120
Yes.

1640
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,420
Subgenius.com.

1641
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:31,420


1642
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:39,500
We really do have a big office party coming up July 5th at that time.

1643
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:44,820
It's actually exactly 7 a.m. July 5th of this year.

1644
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:53,020
We will be awaiting the arrival of the sex goddesses from Planet X, as prophesied by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1645
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:56,040
End of the world company picnics of genius style.

1646
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,500
Assuming this is 1998.

1647
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,440
Which it might not be.

1648
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,580
We don't know what year this is.

1649
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,940
We don't know what planet this is.

1650
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,140
I don't know hardly nothing at all.

1651
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,480
But we know that.

1652
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,460
We know that much.

1653
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,360
We know that we don't know.

1654
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,480
And that is good to know.

1655
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:16,800
Yes.

1656
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,700
It's possibly the last thing we'll ever know.

1657
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:31,400
It's here in this small Mayan village where these three archaeologists from Knightsbridge, Uxbridge, and Cambridge have made their way to find the truth.

1658
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:42,660
The temple, the entryway to the Palenque Mount and temple complex here some 50,000 kilometers away in a different space.

1659
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:57,540
And if their mission is achieved and is proven, it means that Bob Dobbs actually was here some 2,000 years ago wearing funny red headbands and feathers and all the like.

1660
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,060
As we see on this wall drawing here.

1661
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:08,100
Someone is about ready to decapitate the Bob figure and hopefully pull his heart out and eat it.

1662
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:14,880
But that's for another time where we join ourselves at the knees and I...

1663
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,740
Friends, are you ready to walk in the path of Batman J.R. Bob Dobbs?

1664
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:25,760
The salesman, the space salesman of planet Earth.

1665
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:29,060
The snake oil salesman.

1666
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,940
Oleum Serpentum.

1667
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,600
That's the fountain of youth, my friend.

1668
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:39,420
It can make you be what you won't be.

1669
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:44,220
It can make you your own hero.

1670
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,660
And hers too, as David Osman said.

1671
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:58,400
You, the superior mutant, can rise up over those others around you.

1672
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,560
It's a bright future for all of us.

1673
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:05,240
You're better than them in the office, or at the assembly line, or there in the classroom.

1674
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:08,560
You know you're better than them.

1675
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,620
Not for any other reason than that you are different.

1676
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,320
Not that you're smarter.

1677
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,380
Not that you're wiser.

1678
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,580
You're just better.

1679
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,220
Why?

1680
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,560
Because you have that subgenius minister's card in your pocket.

1681
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,440
You.

1682
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,280
And not that bubba next door.

1683
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,880
Have the key to Bob's space ship.

1684
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,280
The key to the wisdom teat.

1685
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:40,740
You've got your little lips puckered and ready to suck.

1686
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:47,620
On that stem of that teat we call the pipe of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1687
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,960
Bob loves you and he's gonna share with you.

1688
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:54,080
He's gonna share his love, his slack,

1689
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,180
his diseases.

1690
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:56,680
Sure.

1691
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:57,920
Those two.

1692
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,760
Hey, you know we're all equal, aren't we?

1693
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,760
Yes.

1694
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,800
This isn't one of them hierarchical big corporate company calculations.

1695
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,720
I see the sun coming up for all of us today.

1696
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:14,140
I see our diseases reaching out into the cosmos.

1697
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:18,600
I see our diseases growing far beyond our own numbers.

1698
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,360
I know you want to get in on that too.

1699
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,700
Everybody does.

1700
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,980
That's our Bob.

1701
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:28,340
So why don't you just check out that subgenius.com and you know before it's too late.

1702
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,420
I mean what the heck?

1703
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,760
The world could end tomorrow.

1704
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,100
Are you ready for it?

1705
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,960
You could be different genetically from anyone and everyone else.

1706
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,460
You could be far superior to those around you.

1707
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,040
You could learn arcane secrets.

1708
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,820
How to hear dog whistles in the dark.

1709
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,220
Smiling and bumping the humpy.

1710
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,020
And also grievance committee time.

1711
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,600
These things are amazing.

1712
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,640
You can already do those things, friends.

1713
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,700
But after you join the church of the subgenius, you'll be able to prove it.

1714
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,500
Or at least you'll think you can.

1715
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:02,980
And that's all that counts.

1716
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,780
This is the new age, baby.

1717
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:08,220
All that matters is how you feel.

1718
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,880
And we love crybabies.

1719
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,800
Come on down.

1720
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,120
Sit at the feet of Bob.

1721
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,000
That's all right, honey.

1722
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,540
I'm not going to slap you too many times.

1723
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,320
I'm going to slap you ten times.

1724
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,660
Including the Congress.

1725
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,340
Including the President himself.

1726
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,720
You don't have to rub your fingers anymore.

1727
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:32,840
We're going to beat all of them.

1728
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:39,380
6969-800-6969-669-2323.

1729
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:44,300
Or have an extension put in place through just one nostril.

1730
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,800
It's easy and it's free.

1731
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,300
A symbol of being out of touch and entirely too liberal.

1732
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,980
And clinging to religion and guns.

1733
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,260
Stay in control.

1734
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,620
Maximum health in a maxed out world.

1735
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,620
One for each wind and one for each direction.

1736
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,780
The north nostril is the nostril of wisdom.

1737
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:05,920
The south nostril is the nostril of innocence.

1738
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:10,460
The east nostril is the nostril of the illumination.

1739
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,740
The west nostril is the east of the atmosphere.

1740
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,380
Shooting up heroin.

1741
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,040
I don't remember.

1742
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,460
Do heroin reparations.

1743
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,480
You're not required to remember.

1744
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,840
You're required to recall.

1745
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,540
Heroin.

1746
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,240
I still chose heroin.

1747
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,360
Restate the premise.

1748
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,880
You are here because.

1749
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:30,900
Because Bob is the heroin of your mind.

1750
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,760
It's the opium of your religion you might say.

1751
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,240
It's the mass of your religion.

1752
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:36,720
That's Bob.

1753
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:37,320
You know what?

1754
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:37,980
You've lost everything.

1755
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:38,880
I lose everything.

1756
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,140
You come from nothing.

1757
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,280
You got a match of nothing.

1758
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,800
You lost nothing.

1759
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,380
Heroin.

1760
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:44,840
Heroin smacked.

1761
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:45,840
Heroin.

1762
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,780
The heroin controls you.

1763
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,840
Friends, we're going to have to move out.

1764
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,520
And uh.

1765
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:50,520


1766
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,280
Uh.

1767
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,340
Clean up ourselves.

1768
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,860
This uh.

1769
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,040
Exiting montage is by Reverend Shane Caplan.

1770
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,440
Taking heroin.

1771
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,080
Heroin.

1772
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:01,900
Junkies.

1773
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,360
Survive each dose.

1774
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,440
Need each dose to survive.

1775
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,000
Heroin fanatics.

1776
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,020
Led to relax.

1777
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,700
Fantastically rich.

1778
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,660
Heroin.

1779
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,020
Heroin.

1780
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:11,500
Heroin.

1781
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,660
It's going to lead to the needle.

1782
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,340
The heroin.

1783
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:14,120
Heroin.

1784
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:14,600
Heroin.

1785
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,960
I have just quit shooting up heroin.

1786
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,620
And inject needles into your collapsing veins.

1787
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,500
You're weak.

1788
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:20,500


1789
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,940
Your men are going to begin to bluff needles.

1790
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,920
And your men are going to begin to bluff needles.

1791
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,420
It ain't every day that a person quits shooting up four packs of smack.

1792
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:30,920
Today.

1793
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:31,980
Oh.

1794
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:33,880
Please help.

1795
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,380
Everything hurts.

1796
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:40,000
If you hear me taking up just a few little sniffs of smack.

1797
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,120
Again.

1798
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,560
And it just proves that I'm human.

1799
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,100
And if I can quit shooting up.

1800
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,000
It'll prove that I'm beyond human.

1801
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,200
Greater.

1802
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,140
Or less than.

1803
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:50,940
Human.

1804
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,200
Hehehe.

1805
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,660
Quit laughing.

1806
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,540
It hurts.

1807
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:57,300
You're just trying to make it worse.

1808
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,660
I was an addict for 9 years.

1809
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,160
Oh for what?

1810
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:04,780
For drugs.

1811
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,980
I went 8 times to jail.

1812
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:09,440
I thought I was going to be an addict.

1813
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:10,380
A dope fiend.

1814
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:10,920
A junky.

1815
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,360
But I heard about.

1816
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:12,820
Bob?

1817
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,680
I went to him.

1818
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,540
I could probably.

1819
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:17,020
Just take a few little.

1820
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,240
Sniffs of smack.

1821
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:28,500
back. On the way home from work here. I could. Why not? Come on. I could. There's probably a needle

1822
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:39,520
in my ashtray. Yes. Yes. There is one. I'm sure of it. That very last piece there was by

1823
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:50,440
Reverend Shane Kaplan. And he did that to get over, I guess to get through heroin withdrawal,

1824
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:55,740
he said. He sent me three or four versions of it. He really worked hard on that collage.

1825
00:59:56,660 --> 01:00:03,220
And I guess it, and I know how that is. It may get your mind off your own troubles if you,

1826
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:09,480
you know, work on something, do something that's, you know, like a good for the,

1827
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,000
the world. Praise Bob and stay tuned.
