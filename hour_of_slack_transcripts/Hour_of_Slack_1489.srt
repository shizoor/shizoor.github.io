1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,520
Around Dard City and in the Territory on West,

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,300
there's just one way to handle the killers and the spoilers,

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,060
and that's with a U.S. Marshal and the smell of...

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,560
The Sogenius Power of Squash!

5
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:53,200
The Sogenius Power of Squash!

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,960
All the ranting last night was...

7
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,100
That was one of the best X-Day nights for recording,

8
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,400
for hour of slack, ever.

9
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,720
Thanks to Priestess Pisces!

10
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,360
Well, we had a lot of ranters.

11
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,220
A whole bunch of folks got up who'd never ranted before,

12
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,640
and none of them were so shameful

13
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,040
that they got mocked and bullied afterwards.

14
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,560
As far as you know.

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,500
There was a lot of variety.

16
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,720
There was crazy stuff, and there was heartfelt,

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,120
and there was some music.

18
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,160
Nobody beckons the bobbies like Pisces.

19
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,680
I'm so mean!

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,760
Why are you mean?

21
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,360
Well, I know why she's mean, and I'm mean too.

22
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,680
But I'm good.

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,820
And Pisces is good.

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,440
As opposed to somebody like, say, Princess Wee,

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,020
who's very nice, but actually bad.

26
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,780
Kind of bad.

27
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,700
So you have to have a balance there.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,100
You know, a mean, good one, and a nice, bad one.

29
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,960
Well, aren't you afraid more of the nice person

30
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,460
who never blows his top when he does

31
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,480
than the roaring, shouting person

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,440
who's always irritable and loud?

33
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,360
I feel like I'm both of those all the time.

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,540
Jimmy Stewart in Winchester 73.

35
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,800
It was just Jimmy Stewart,

36
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,760
but finally he's had more than he could take,

37
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,440
and he turns into this horrible, roaring,

38
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,880
gritting teeth guy.

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,200
That's scarier than the bad guy

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,460
who constantly blusters and bellows.

41
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,700
I try to be a nice person,

42
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,300
although, believe me, it's strictly an act.

43
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,100
But you have to...

44
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,440
It's a sensible act.

45
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,800
But apparently, when I finally blow my top,

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,840
it's scary.

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,560
What with the glowing red eyes and stuff.

48
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,880
I've been known to...

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,500
I've been known to blow my top

50
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,160
and get unreasonably butthurt

51
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,140
over niggling little things

52
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,220
and throw a huge, embarrassing hissy fit.

53
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,400
And I'm so glad to know

54
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,780
that I'm not the only person who does that.

55
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,920
In fact, I can now say just about everybody I know,

56
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,360
I've seen them at one point or another

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,320
have a complete, enraged, pointless hissy fit

58
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,040
over nothing.

59
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,340
You just sometimes have to do that

60
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,820
to prove that even you are an asshole sometimes.

61
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,580
And that's okay.

62
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,600
Except when you're a big asshole.

63
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,080
Except when it's in your head.

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,040
All you are is an asshole.

65
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,960
To the other assholes.

66
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,160
I mean, to the other people.

67
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,800
But somewhere there's a subgenius

68
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,640
who is the greatest asshole of all.

69
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,780
Maybe that would be Bob.

70
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,360
No.

71
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
You know, why not?

72
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,640
Bob's a huge dick.

73
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,060
A huge dick.

74
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:52,680
What?

75
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,960
Yeah, he's not so much...

76
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,480
He's not a pussy, he's not an asshole.

77
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,760
He's a big dick, though.

78
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,620
He's a huge dick.

79
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,980
But his clemency...

80
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,660
There's only the three kinds.

81
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
Well, anyway, we ought to...

82
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,860
Friends, get ready for your Bob-tism.

83
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,800
There is a shower down there

84
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,600
so you can wash the radioactive slime

85
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,940
and muck off

86
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,600
and the venomous insects.

87
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,940
Let's wash off any protective sweat or film

88
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,300
before it soaks in.

89
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,200
You probably want to splash when getting out

90
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,580
because the pond is ringed with walnut.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,940
And you might get out with a beard of walnut oil.

92
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,040
Well, we call it walnut oil.

93
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,700
Yes, the locals call it walnut oil.

94
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,420
It may be a euphemism, I suppose.

95
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,640
Well, at the Bob-tism, you do get Bob-chism.

96
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,700
So there's no telling what you're going to have to

97
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,100
rinse off with the sandblaster later on.

98
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,120
And with that exciting preview,

99
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,620
we now adjourn to the Bob-tism itself.

100
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,180
Yeah.

101
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,980
Walnut oil is a very potent natural browning.

102
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:02,820
It's a very potent brown stain.

103
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,020
Did everybody hear that?

104
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,820
It's a very potent brown stain, but it's natural.

105
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,620
Yeah, it's natural, so it's okay.

106
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,880
Poison ivy, that's organic, man.

107
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,860
It's cool.

108
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,260
Don't eat anything that's not organic.

109
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,960
But poison ivy, that stuff is organic.

110
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,760
Poison ivy, yeah.

111
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,040
Pull nettle.

112
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,820
Stay off the straw!

113
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,420
By the way, the venomous insects down there

114
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,480
are not poisonous.

115
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,640
They will continue, but if you eat them,

116
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,300
you'll be fine.

117
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,000
Isn't that an interesting scientific factoid?

118
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,660
Remember that colossal spider we found down there

119
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,880
three years ago?

120
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,160
Yeah, with the giant dick in its jaws.

121
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,340
It still roams the woods now?

122
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,160
There's something roaming the woods now,

123
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,860
that's for sure.

124
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,920
People keep hearing and seeing,

125
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,980
vaguely seeing these big shapes,

126
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,760
and there was that horrible death

127
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,960
of that expensive little anointing,

128
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,040
that giant shih tzu dog,

129
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,720
which by the way,

130
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,240
on Facebook I've put up photographs

131
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,620
of mystery tracks

132
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,940
that we're seeing around here.

133
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,000
So, yeah, let's,

134
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,340
we're going to drive down there

135
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,900
as far as we can.

136
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,020
Might as well take the recorder with me.

137
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,020
I just don't understand how it is

138
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,240
that I'm still alive.

139
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,120
Keith Richards must feel that way.

140
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,660
People dropping dead all around,

141
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,800
and he's like,

142
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,340
what the hell is going on?

143
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,360
God must be off work or something.

144
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,600
About it.

145
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,100
Well, what surprises me is people get surprised

146
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,260
when some old person gets sick,

147
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,520
or has something horrible,

148
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,960
or even a young person, you know,

149
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,540
keels over with an aneurysm.

150
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,020
Jesus Christ, man,

151
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,440
that shit happens all the time.

152
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,760
What's surprising is if it doesn't happen.

153
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,140
Yeah, right.

154
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,280
Well, I'll tell you the next day,

155
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,900
that's when, man,

156
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,920
I throw all caution to the wind.

157
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,360
Eat hot dogs, scrap,

158
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,640
I've had nothing but fatty,

159
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,900
what the hell?

160
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,580
What is?

161
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,360
Looks like an alter.

162
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,580
What the?

163
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,740
No, it's somebody's drink.

164
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:12,900
How?

165
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,260
The smell!

166
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,860
Murder mystery.

167
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,540
Holy crap, look at this nonsense.

168
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,620
Oh, shit.

169
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,360
Baby Bear, baby, you better stay back.

170
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,800
I don't know if you want to see this.

171
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,700
Yeah, I mean, it's so much better.

172
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,660
Oh, my God.

173
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,540
There's blood everywhere.

174
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,680
But no bones, no flesh.

175
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,860
Uh-huh.

176
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,980
Now, this has got to be a joke,

177
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,780
a prank.

178
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,740
This has got to be some kind of a stunt.

179
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,840
Look, something horrible happened here,

180
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,640
or, no, it's got to be a joke.

181
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,760
Look, it's a subgenius shirt and clothing

182
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
just laying here.

183
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,520
Look, he's even got registration tags.

184
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,520
You think this could be connected to the internet?

185
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:58,980
You think this could be connected to the text in the background?

186
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:58,980


187
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:58,980


188
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:58,980


189
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:58,980


190
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:58,980


191
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:58,980


192
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:58,980


193
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:58,980


194
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:58,980


195
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:58,980


196
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:58,980


197
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,180
No, I'm going to eat the one that has the missing dog.

198
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,240
Baby Bear.

199
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,020
What?

200
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,740
That ring.

201
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,660
You took the ring out of that pond.

202
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,160
No.

203
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,360
And look at what's happening in this campground.

204
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,160
Stop it.

205
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,180
First, that little, tiny, innocent dog, and now that, who was this?

206
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,400
Let's, maybe we have to, what number is on this?

207
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,580
Jesus Christ.

208
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,460
The socks are still in the shoes.

209
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,920
I wouldn't even touch that.

210
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,860
Those are nice shoes.

211
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,040
It's true.

212
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,440
Yeah, this is a crime scene.

213
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,120
Well, I wouldn't say crime scene, but that could be communicable.

214
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,720
You never know.

215
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,600
You might pick something up.

216
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,360
It might be some kind of strange virus that eats you out.

217
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,160
What was that number on this?

218
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,600
757.

219
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,560
That would be real early in the festival.

220
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,400
Nobody's seen Reverend Bastard since he got here.

221
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,520
Remember that asshole?

222
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,360
Oh, I remember that.

223
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,720
Everybody wishes he was dead.

224
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,920
Yeah, I remember that.

225
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
But this is a woman's.

226
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,920
I look more like a 12-year-old girl.

227
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,060
Who would do this to these toys?

228
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,940
A cute teddy bear with a heart on it.

229
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:04,760
It's had its head cut open and the stuffing pulled out of the front of the head.

230
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,740
There's this other little darling doll.

231
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,940
It's like it's been disemboweled if it had bowels.

232
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,560
It's just stuffing coming out, but it's all bloody.

233
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,160
God, smell that.

234
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,480
It's like it's been stuffed with a lot of stuff.

235
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,860
Wasn't Reverend Bastard with some poe-bucker girl?

236
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,960
Wisteria, they're not going to want word of this getting out.

237
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,980
Dead bodies.

238
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,940
Maybe we should hide it before the other people get here.

239
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,960
That frog says something.

240
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,260
This is all getting a little too real.

241
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,780
A little too real.

242
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,900
Those shoes look like they might still be good.

243
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,120
Oh, hold my recorder for a second.

244
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,340
Thank you.

245
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:49,980
I'm going to go get my fingerprints this week.

246
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,060
See if these guys mean something.

247
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,080
Whoever did this took the wallet.

248
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:57,780
Oh.

249
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,980
So an animal, no animal would take a wallet, would it?

250
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,280
There is a raccoon around here that steals Playboys.

251
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,620
But this is different.

252
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,860
Any change? No.

253
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,140
I don't want to get fingerprints all over it.

254
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,460
This could be, for all I know, this is one of those things where they're setting me up to take the fall.

255
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,580
Oh, there's no one named, but he's fingerprints on me.

256
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:19,580


257
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't want to get fingerprints on that thing, but stangs.

258
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,780
Did he check-seated his wallet?

259
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,040
Rebel Gary Larry, can you explain this?

260
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,420
Empty clothes with no body, covered with blood everywhere.

261
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:29,980
Everywhere.

262
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,640
And no wallet.

263
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,260
And these mangled children's dolls.

264
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,540
It's like there was a dad subgenius, his shirt says slacker and has wimpy on it.

265
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,460
And his girlfriend.

266
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,280
But where's the child?

267
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,780
These glasses, what the hell would do that?

268
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,060
Ah, butt.

269
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,120
The belt is undone, but the pants are still...

270
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,040
Don't touch it.

271
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,640
Now you have fingerprints on it.

272
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,180
Yeah, you're right. I can't keep my fingers off of it.

273
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,540
Now, did his mom sew his name in his underwear?

274
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,340
Underwear.

275
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,940
Well, I guess you're going to keep touching it. You've already touched it enough.

276
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,560
Here, look. Here, we'll use a stick.

277
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,700
Use a stick. This is gross. I'm afraid I'm going to see in there.

278
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,700
Oh my God.

279
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,300
Well, the penis is gone.

280
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,760
He wasn't wearing underwear. He was going commanding.

281
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,060
Okay, so it was a hippie of some kind.

282
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,960
Because the penis is gone.

283
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,480
Well, everything's gone. The ball is gone too.

284
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,980
And the body, the whole body, the head, there's nothing.

285
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,960
But this is so weird, the way the socks are still in the shoes and pants.

286
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,940
How do you get a person out of that?

287
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,260
It's like the body was sucked out of the...

288
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,600
Eggplant thinks it was the dick-eating spiders that sucked him completely out of his clothing.

289
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,180
Well, there is that spider that...

290
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,300
Starting with the dick.

291
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,760
That's been gone now for a couple years.

292
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,980
That could be it.

293
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,920
That could be it.

294
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,280
But of course, this is old Sequa's lair, but old Sequa would have just swallowed the whole thing.

295
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,040
He wouldn't spit the clothes out like that.

296
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,940
I mean, I've seen shit like that in Godzilla movies, but I laughed at that.

297
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,500
This is funny, man.

298
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,460
This is nothing to laugh at at all.

299
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,180
There's something funny about that. Listen, I was telling you, we can't call the cops.

300
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,320
Everybody's got some kind of contraband in their pocket.

301
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,240
And plus, the last time we called, they never believed us, you know?

302
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,300
Oh yeah, aliens, right? Monsters.

303
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,520
More aliens, more aliens.

304
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,320
I know they're rape bears, but they're regular bears out here.

305
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,640
Yeah, but the bears wouldn't care about the clothes.

306
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,780
Bears wouldn't care about the clothes.

307
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,060
They wouldn't even walk.

308
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,240
I mean, but they would take the meat.

309
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,480
Well, not in clothes like that.

310
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,380
That is so gross.

311
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,080
That's dick-eating spider work, if you ask me.

312
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,920
If the word about this gets out, nobody's going to want to come to Axe Day again.

313
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,040
We're going to have to keep this quiet.

314
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,860
Do we know who it was?

315
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,700
I think it may be Reverend Bastard. Remember that asshole that everybody hated?

316
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,840
We didn't want him to come back?

317
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,280
Yeah, man.

318
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,220
Needless, he was the first person here.

319
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,860
But nobody's seen him since he got here.

320
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,280
Guy owes me a shit pile of beer.

321
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,820
But, Philo is supposed to be here.

322
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,040
You know who else is supposed to be here?

323
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,300
Dr. Lagoon.

324
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,460
Well, right. And neither one of them, we haven't seen them, but I know that Doc Holl is, or Philo is here.

325
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,920
I'm afraid to get in the water now.

326
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,580
That's alright. If something happens, it'll take Norm first.

327
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,220
Ab Norm has gone in there bravely.

328
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,520
Bravely.

329
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,820
Just don't go over that other side, because there's no bottom to that pit.

330
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,060
And then there's like small gameras. I can see them in here.

331
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,960
And some kind of lamp ray.

332
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,040
Well, you don't have to worry about the candira toads in the water.

333
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:36,520
Yeah.

334
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,860
But what have you...

335
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,760
I'm glad there aren't more people here to see this.

336
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,620
Did you get pictures?

337
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,620
Whatever it was, yes.

338
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,660
Get as many pictures.

339
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,060
He was about to take his pants off, probably to get into the water.

340
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,400
Right.

341
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,680
But didn't get to the point where of taking the button off.

342
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,900
And then whatever...

343
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,540
The pants are still done. The belt is undone.

344
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,740
So he was on his way in. And whatever it was, took it right then.

345
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,440
Well, it wasn't me that took his wallet, okay?

346
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,200
Y'all saw, there were people here when I got here. I didn't get the wallet.

347
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,740
Now, she was wearing a brand new shirt that didn't even take the tag off.

348
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,800
I know. Yeah, that's weird.

349
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,560
And maybe it was...

350
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,820
That's how I knew it was a Pobucker chick.

351
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,940
Well, I suppose it could be a trick.

352
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,280
It could be a trick, but...

353
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,120
But that's real blood. Just smell it.

354
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:25,800
It could be his blood.

355
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,140
It's sticky too. And the flies.

356
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:34,740
And they thought that maybe the doll was something edible because they tried that and they tried eating the small bear's brain.

357
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,700
But there is no...

358
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,900
There's no pants. There's no underwear. There's nothing.

359
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,740
For all we know, the creature saved the ground.

360
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,620
Well, it's a girl from the creepy subgenius.

361
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:53,440
Well, all I know is that the creepy whatever took her underpants. There's no underwear.

362
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,560
No, I didn't take that. You know, you guys were here when I got here. You didn't see me take that underwear.

363
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,120
I didn't see you take any underwear.

364
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,000
Or the wallet. I didn't take any of that stuff.

365
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:06,880
But this creature being whatever you want to call it seems to have chewed that harmless stuffed animal to me.

366
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,140
I'm glad we don't have more witnesses down here because this is...

367
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,940
If this gets out, that's it for X Day.

368
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,240
Oh.

369
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,300
That's it. And they'll probably close down Wisteria.

370
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,060
What am I not seeing?

371
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:30,680
I can't believe we're just going to do this silly subgenius ritual when there's been obviously some kind of a brutal and unexplained very mysterious killing.

372
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,640
Uh-oh.

373
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,980
No one's going to talk about this, right? Who are you? New guy? Who's this new guy?

374
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,100
Maybe we should just act normal, you know?

375
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:48,500
Pretend it didn't happen. Nobody's going to miss it. I'm pretty sure that was Reverend Bastard. Nobody's going to miss him.

376
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,060
How can you pretend? No. Well, no, not because nobody's there.

377
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,100
Yeah, wasn't that guy bothering you? I think that's who that was.

378
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:54,960
Oh.

379
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:00,020
He had a wristband on. Empty clothes with nothing in them.

380
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,560
You're not going to be a suspect in it because he was bothering you.

381
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,380
Uh-oh.

382
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,040
Right, but almost everybody here wanted to kill the guy.

383
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,240
Right, and see, so we're all under suspicion.

384
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,080
Right. That's why I say we're all under suspicion.

385
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,500
We just keep a lid on this thing. I'm going to throw that stuff into a bag and burn it and pretend it never happened.

386
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,120
But meanwhile, we've got a lot of suspects now.

387
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:23,420
I told you.

388
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,580
Ripe bears, legume, phyllo.

389
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,720
I suspect phyllo more than legume.

390
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,460
Old sea quoll.

391
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,880
Legume is kind of a...

392
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,780
He's too smart for that.

393
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,780
Yeah, well, he would hide in there.

394
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,000
This is like some crazy person just suddenly got a wild hare and did it.

395
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,660
Well, legume would take the bodies out to the pit and bury them somewhere where no one could find them.

396
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,960
Right. Yeah, he wouldn't be sloppy about it.

397
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,540
No. No. Whereas phyllo is immune to persecution, so he'd just do anything.

398
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,400
Like Bob.

399
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:47,980
Yeah.

400
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,920
Ooh, now I hate the...

401
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,900
Bob's fingerprints would actually change.

402
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,240
No, let's not go there. Let's not even go there.

403
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,460
His fingerprints would never be undone.

404
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,980
That would be unthinkable.

405
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:56,780
Yeah.

406
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,220
Well, look, I guess I have to...

407
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,860
We might as well go through this rigamarole, this facade.

408
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,300
Yeah.

409
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,760
God, how can I...

410
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,200
I just...

411
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,420
Ugh.

412
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,060
Turn this off for a second.

413
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,440
The Best TV Western.

414
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,680
Hey, hey, hey. This honorable court is now in session.

415
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:23,860
Obviously.

416
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,120
Bobby?

417
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,320
Yeah?

418
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,540
And the night of August did was now a support feed in length.

419
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,220
Fandango.

420
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:38,880
Sir.

421
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:38,980
Sir.

422
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,200
Have you heard about this homicide?

423
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:41,880
Yeah.

424
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,540
Have you held any conversations upon the subject?

425
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:45,940
Yeah.

426
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,820
Have you formed an opinion about it?

427
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,600
Yes, sir.

428
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,580
I have.

429
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,800
You'd better have a good explanation for all of this.

430
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,760
Now get out.

431
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:07,760


432
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,360
But they would keep her under pants.

433
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,420
And look, it's almost like he was reaching for this life preserver.

434
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,560
Oh, life preserver, maybe it'll save me from this whatever it is.

435
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,080
Did you hear this?

436
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,960
Double Dippin'!

437
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,780
When Potter and Petal were making out in their car the night before last, something attacked

438
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:31,500
their car lustfully and raped the car while they were having sex in it.

439
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,320
Are there any sports car fucking dragons around here looking for bigger joy games?

440
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:46,580
I have to cleanse these people of their sins and I feel dirtied by this crime committed

441
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,440
on the X Day Festival.

442
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,660
Did you see that thing over there?

443
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,320
See how the subgeniuses are on so many drugs.

444
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,960
There could be dead bodies all over the place and they just kind of go, oh, whoa, far out.

445
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,040
Let's just go on up and get ourselves bomb-tized, shall we?

446
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,360
Yeah.

447
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,360
So that that doesn't happen.

448
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,280
Yeah.

449
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,020
I don't know what I'm looking at.

450
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,160
Despite the terrible crime that seems to be marring this occasion, we are proceeding with

451
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,260
our priceless religious ceremony.

452
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,060
It's hard for me to have the stomach for this.

453
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,820
I know.

454
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,100
Well...

455
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,700
After eating all that scrapple.

456
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,600
Just get on in there, Stang.

457
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,380
The little ones are shriveled down to nothing.

458
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,580
The big ones are shriveled down to normal now.

459
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,780
Ah, the little ones.

460
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,140
Okay.

461
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,600
All right.

462
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,260
Suzy, you're ready to go.

463
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:34,780
I can tell.

464
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:34,800
I'm good.

465
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,480
I'm fucking free now.

466
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,300
I'm going to go.

467
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:36,300


468
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,280
Who will volunteer to be the first?

469
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:39,840
I will.

470
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,200
I'm not going to go.

471
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,380
Here.

472
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:40,840
I'm bomb-tized for three years.

473
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,900
This will be my first baptism ever.

474
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,680
Wow, all right.

475
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,960
So I will go first.

476
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,080
Well, for one thing, we say Bob-tism.

477
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:47,420
Bob-tism.

478
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,140
Just so you know.

479
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,320
Bob-tism.

480
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:48,600
Bob-tism.

481
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:48,680
Bob-tism.

482
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:48,860
Bob-tism.

483
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,940
Sorry, it's my Cleveland accent.

484
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,900
No, it's charming.

485
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,840
Do you reject the conspiracy and all that it represents and accept Bob into your life?

486
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,180
I do.

487
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,600
Say praise Bob.

488
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,300
Praise Bob.

489
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,160
And down you go.

490
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,200
I forgot to mention the brain-eating amoebas.

491
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,180
You should hold your breath.

492
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,300
I do.

493
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:06,300


494
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:06,300


495
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,900
Hold your nose close.

496
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,200
If you swallow them, the stomach acids will kill them, but if they get in your nose, it's

497
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,700
like a candiru code.

498
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,140
Because I'm not a very good swimmer.

499
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,460
Okay.

500
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,980
Now, talk about it.

501
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,540
This guy is practically a full-blood yeti.

502
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,300
Look at that pelt.

503
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,680
Like me.

504
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,040
Smell that pelt.

505
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,440
My God, look at the fleas jumping off of that thing.

506
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,780
Reverend Richard Scull, do you reject the conspiracy and accept Bob into your heart?

507
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,380
Say I do.

508
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,080
Fuck Bob.

509
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,300
Or whatever.

510
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,420
It's a Prince's independence.

511
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,300
That's good.

512
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,300


513
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,540
Okay, who's next?

514
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,800
Reverend Lucy.

515
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,800
Yes.

516
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,720
The cruelest of all the Peanuts cartoon characters.

517
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,180
I tried.

518
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,460
Do you accept Bob and reject the conspiracy?

519
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,640
What's plan B?

520
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,960
Uh-oh.

521
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,020
I was hoping they wouldn't ask that.

522
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,880
Well, you'll have to ask that empty suit of clothes over there.

523
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,720
That's what happens to those of us.

524
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,180
I think we'll go with plan A.

525
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,040
Me too.

526
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,920
Praise Bob.

527
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,680
Praise Bob.

528
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,040
Here she is.

529
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:05,620
That's our media.

530
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,080
That's our media.

531
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,300
That's our media.

532
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:06,860
We have huge goosebumps.

533
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,480
Miss Bob Pizzo.

534
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,960
Do you have a dime for two nipples?

535
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,760
This is when pulse for the laying on of hands.

536
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:16,660
Two dimes.

537
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,980
Susie the Floozy, do you...

538
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,560
Let's see.

539
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,160
I can go on and on with this one.

540
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:30,280
Do you, in your right mind and full cognizance, accept Bob, that is J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living

541
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,560
avatar of Slack, saint of sales...

542
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,420
How did it all begin, Scott?

543
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,960
...into your life, which should...

544
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,180
No.

545
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,080
...hopefully last for not much longer than a couple more days until you're on the saucers.

546
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:46,540
And do you reject the conspiracy, including, but not limited to, the IRS, the FBI, the

547
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:53,020
CIA, the NSA, the USA, the USSR, the rest of the world, and all pinks?

548
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,420
And the LSMFT?

549
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,580
Yeah.

550
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,860
Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.

551
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,040
Okay?

552
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,640
Heave ho!

553
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,500
Well, let me accept.

554
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,280
I haven't been able to say whether or not I want to say it.

555
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,280


556
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,280


557
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,280


558
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,300
Okay, have at it.

559
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,280
Maybe you better start over.

560
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,660
Take your time.

561
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,760
Okay.

562
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,720
What was the question?

563
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,880
Do you reject the conspiracy and all its works?

564
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,900
I'm crazy!

565
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,320
I'm not stupid!

566
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,360
I'm not recording yet.

567
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,480
Oh, well, but it's live at any rate.

568
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,180
In fact, it's more live than ever.

569
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,820
If you're not recording, then it's as live as it can be.

570
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,520
That's right.

571
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,500
It's only live.

572
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:33,860
Transient.

573
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,140
So, no records exist of this...

574
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:36,240
But I am recording now.

575
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,240


576
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,240


577
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,240


578
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,240


579
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,240


580
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,240


581
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,240


582
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,240


583
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,240


584
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,860
This so-called broadcast, ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed exclusive.

585
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:47,180
And if you'll keep tuning in, so to speak, that's an acceptable metaphor, and there are

586
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:53,160
others who will be tuning in later, these future people who I'm addressing now, we are

587
00:22:53,160 --> 00:23:00,120
going to have much that may entertain you, particularly a blow-by-blow coverage of the

588
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,420
Bull Dada auction.

589
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,240
When co-auctioneer gets here, then...

590
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,220
Oh, yeah.

591
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,200
Then the fur and feathers will fly by Yemeni.

592
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,660
At least this is our guarantee.

593
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,680
Because, friends, another hour of slack has begun.

594
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:22,060
Here live from the stage of Caffeine's on Wisteria Campground in beautiful southern

595
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,220
Ohio...

596
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,320
In Wisteria.

597
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,400
...where the weather has mysteriously stayed beautiful.

598
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,220
Wisteria.

599
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,860
And we are recording.

600
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,040
Everything's going fine.

601
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,360
No trouble.

602
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:36,780
Yes.

603
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,500
Everything has been made easy for us.

604
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,700
Facilitated.

605
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:48,840
Thanks to Wisteria and all who work here at Caffeine's, who appreciate your tips, by the

606
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,040
way.

607
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,000
And we're clean, friends.

608
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,860
We are clean.

609
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,500
Clean in...

610
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,320
Clean.

611
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,840
...washed in the Pia Bob, you might say, because we're fresh from the baptism.

612
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,460
As sparsely attended as I expected.

613
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:10,880
It was almost nothing but beautiful young women and a few timid men watching from the

614
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,500
sidelines as Dr. Howell and I dunked them one after another.

615
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:21,800
Yes, we roundly baptized the entire lot of them and what beautiful glistening sights

616
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,380
they were.

617
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:27,080
But the trouble is this moderate weather, which is nice for everyone else, is not so

618
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,980
nice if you're getting into the icy pond.

619
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,440
We could have used a little blast of furnace-like heat at that point.

620
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,760
Nonetheless, the women were game and well, anyway...

621
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,400
And we don't need to talk about everything that happened down there.

622
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,140
All right.

623
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,100
I'm sure that some of that is going to be coming out and there's probably rumors about...

624
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,140
It must be added to the legend of the Church of the...

625
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,460
...silly tales about some dead guy or something.

626
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,460
Well, I can tell you this, honest to God, there's no body.

627
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,560
If you hear rumors about a body found...

628
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,620
There was no body because there was no murder.

629
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,680
It may have just been an accident.

630
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,960
If it's an animal involved, then that's all...

631
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,540
Anyway, that's...

632
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,680
That business of being...

633
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,620
It's not like there's a cover-up or anything going on.

634
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:22,080
...exploded out of your body, your socks still in your shoes, but all your fluids and

635
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,100
flesh blasted out from the inside.

636
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,600
What does that feel like?

637
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,480
On the other hand, it couldn't have happened to a more deserving...

638
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,080
Well, yeah, it happened to somebody...

639
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,580
Oh, oh, man.

640
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:30,680
...in the world.

641
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:30,680


642
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,780
There was also, though, like...

643
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,380
Wisteria is a safe place.

644
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,240
...a child's teddy bear that was all gnawed or something like that.

645
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,120
What was it?

646
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,000
It was bloody and...

647
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,920
They cut the forehead open and pulled the stuffing out through the forehead...

648
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,440
...of the teddy bear.

649
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,720
...and the blood of the...

650
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,600
Well, the smell.

651
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,620
Oh, Jesus.

652
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,240
The smell of death.

653
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,880
Anyway, it's...

654
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,380
But it didn't stop us...

655
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,560
Not many people were down there.

656
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:58,940
...having our...

657
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,440
Not many people saw it, and that's fine.

658
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:00,880
...flashadelic fun.

659
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,060
And we recorded it, too.

660
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,240
We recorded everything.

661
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,620
Everything was going fine.

662
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,400
There was an interesting distraction, too.

663
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,280
There was something in the water that makes fine hairs grow on women.

664
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,620
I didn't see it on any men.

665
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,440
In fact, it was...

666
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,640
I checked my legs.

667
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,960
I couldn't...

668
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,180
Wouldn't be able to tell on you, Dr. Howell.

669
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:25,500
The water is unbelievably nutritious, thank you, and nourishes the cells, including the

670
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,620
follicles, causing rapid hirsutism.

671
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,980
Uncontrolled hair growth.

672
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,000
It's cool, man.

673
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,620
It's a trend.

674
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,320
It's a fad.

675
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,080
It's like, you know, tattoos.

676
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,880
And that should put all those foolish werewolf stories to rest.

677
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:45,280
Simply natural actions happening as they do in their turn, according to nature's wise

678
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,700
book of saws and aphorisms.

679
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:52,040
So, we repeat, Wisteria is a safe campground.

680
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:52,760
Everything is...

681
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,560
Any stories you've heard about...

682
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,480
...perfectly safe...

683
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,600
...monsters, raping cars full of people...

684
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:58,600


685
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
...or with two people...

686
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
...the little murder...

687
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,640
Admittedly, there was an accident involving a little puppy.

688
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:10,080
A dog that was not a puppy, but was aged and would have died anyway.

689
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,180
Well, it sounds better if it's...

690
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,600
We go on and on about this dog.

691
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:18,300
I'm very sorry that it happened, of course, but let's not get hung up here.

692
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,980
We've got a show to do and...

693
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,020
By the way, the footprints of the...

694
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:28,180
I mean, the photos of the mysterious tracks are on Facebook on 17X.

695
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:28,540
Oh, Tadon.

696
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:28,580
17X.

697
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,620
Facebook already.

698
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,200
Page.

699
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,220
Yes.

700
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,720
As it happens.

701
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,460
I saw a shameful and sad thing when I was looking at Facebook.

702
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,460
What was that?

703
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:38,760
Breakdown.

704
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:49,440
Reverend Pease, who's not here, has already started an 18X day page, and yet, at 7 o'clock

705
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,660
in this very morning, just a little more than 12 hours from now, the world is going to end.

706
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,160
Why is there an 18X day page?

707
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,360
That's crazy stuff.

708
00:27:59,460 --> 00:27:59,860
Kid stuff.

709
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,400
An impudently heretical posting.

710
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,240
I think it was just a joke.

711
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,000
He was trying to kid us.

712
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,180
What if it doesn't happen?

713
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,840
He might be schismatic.

714
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:15,820
He might think that it is next year, and so he puts that up in the...

715
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,320
I was actually surprised.

716
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,340
I was thinking, wait a minute.

717
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,100
When is 7 AM?

718
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,200
When do we have to get up early?

719
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,360
Yes, what a horrible...

720
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,900
It's tomorrow.

721
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,320
Yes, it's true.

722
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,160
This is July 4th.

723
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:32,900
It's funny how time sort of compresses and expands and shrinks and grows out here.

724
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,260
Well, out here, subgenius July 4th, you don't hear any pinks setting off firecrackers.

725
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:42,760
No, you don't hear anything like that, because it might as well be July anything, since X

726
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,340
Day overshadows it the way it does.

727
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,700
You don't hear fireworks, but you do hear things in the woods.

728
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,440
Crashes.

729
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,140
Huge bodies breaking down the forest.

730
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,080
I understood that Reverend Anacron and Luna heard such horrible sounds that they packed

731
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,900
up and left.

732
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:56,800
It's true.

733
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,120
They left.

734
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,760
Although later it was revealed that the horrible sounds came from the possibly drunken

735
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,300
Reverend Synphaltimus sex mortis.

736
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,500
He tends to wind up in the...

737
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,040
Who can't look and sound like a large grunting animal?

738
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,200
Yeah, they left.

739
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,180
They really did leave because of too much noise in the quiet.

740
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,440
And they were parked in the quiet area.

741
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,160
Unfortunately, so was Synphaltimus.

742
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,820
Yes, in the no longer quiet area where the echoes roll to this moment.

743
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,060
Yes.

744
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,320
Well, they're nice people.

745
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:33,880
And to hear the ranting of that New York City-raised crazy man, why, it'd be terrifying

746
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,580
to nice country folks like me.

747
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,660
Well, fortunately, I had earplugs in and I didn't catch a bit of it.

748
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,180
Well, plus we were way up the hill inside of a fallout shelter.

749
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:52,660
But from what I understand, this volcanic eruption could be heard for quite some time.

750
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,560
You should hear what he talks.

751
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:54,960
Yeah.

752
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,700
Yeah, the farting is bad enough.

753
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,220
Anyway...

754
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,100
A pyroclastic flow.

755
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:00,800
Yes, the world...

756
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,720
You know, it sounds so prosaic to sit here and go, oh, hum, the world ends tomorrow.

757
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,160
But we have said that a few times before.

758
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,540
It's hard to build up the excitement sometimes.

759
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,140
One simply needs to wait and find out what will happen.

760
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,580
Much less drag oneself out of bed at six in the morning.

761
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,520
Come out and give it a try.

762
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,140
That's all anyone can do.

763
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:30,140
You know that you'll be ruptured out of your bed too, but surely it's more fun to stand

764
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,620
there and greet the space brothers in person with the dew on your brow and the rust on

765
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,080
your mail.

766
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,080
Don't feel like you have to sit to take a shower or something when you get up.

767
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,120
You won't have the same body.

768
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,260
You can always do that after you go back, go to sleep and get up again later.

769
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,480
Your clothes will...

770
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,220
At this important subgenius event.

771
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:50,820
Right.

772
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,520
Your clothes are going to be left behind anyway.

773
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,840
Just a pile of clothes, hopefully not covered with blood like those ones we found at the...

774
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,220
You go out, you pass the great Ciqua turtle mound and you're there.

775
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,560
That's the landing field.

776
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:11,080
That broad open area where the great silver saucer can put down just one landing leg,

777
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:15,840
which is fortunately hollow and equipped with an express escalator.

778
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,580
Oh, I didn't know that.

779
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,260
Well, you get, you see people gliding up.

780
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,020
You don't know how.

781
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,760
Maybe it isn't.

782
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,360
Maybe they glide up on some alien ray.

783
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,260
It's not close enough.

784
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,760
You can't see it.

785
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,560
I've read that we were lifted bodily up, butt first.

786
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,440
There you go.

787
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,720
With our arms and feet hanging down.

788
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:41,500
But first, more messages from our same sponsor, Caffeinas, where they make food for you,

789
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,940
take care of you.

790
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,200
If you were infants, they would be rocking you to sleep and they've produced a huge smorgasbord

791
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,820
of toothy, tasty, sugary cookies and...

792
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,900
And breads over there, which are easily available from a small premium.

793
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,900
Just saying.

794
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,200
And now back to our program, still in progress.

795
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,100
Did we just stop talking about the end of the damn world to do a little promo for Caffeinas?

796
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,560
Well, the strange thing is, Ivan, the human beings are an incredibly adaptable species

797
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:17,960
and no matter what's going on, one tends to think of sugary treats, cakes with crunchy

798
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,820
crusts and pastries.

799
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,260
You know, why just get a cup of coffee?

800
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,540
Get one of those pastries with it.

801
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,660
Just like in the old country...

802
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,880
You're talking about pastries and coffee and the damn world is about to end.

803
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,820
Are you trying to distract me from something?

804
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,660
I'm talking about saucers, particularly the saucer in Amsterdam where they put a tiny

805
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,960
pastry on it when you have a cup of coffee.

806
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,840
They automatically give you a delightful little pastry and you don't need one as large as

807
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,500
a sofa cushion.

808
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,300
Just a bite gives you the idea.

809
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,700
Enough of this pastry talk.

810
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,440
You're going to have to...

811
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,980
You know as well as I do that the men from Planet X do not fly around in flying saucers

812
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,200
from 1953.

813
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,580
They're not even physical.

814
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,440
There have been great modifications in designs since then.

815
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,080
And that's why we have to do it outdoors.

816
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:11,000
Gone are the flowing Dynaflow chassis, the rocket fins and other extravagances.

817
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,940
Is he talking about pastries or rockets or something?

818
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,920
Well, you can have pastries with these features.

819
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:20,420
In the future, we assure you that we're taking you to everyone's home.

820
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:26,220
Everyone gets whatever everyone wants, including exotic cookies and cakes.

821
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,300
They're magically delicious.

822
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,960
They probably are.

823
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,920
Let's just talk an Irish accent for an hour.

824
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,500
Pretend Philo's here.

825
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,740
Friends, this is a serious subject matter.

826
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,860
I don't know why my colleague Dr. Howell is trying to change the subject.

827
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,740
But to the exes, we will be the leprechauns.

828
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,300
They are infinitely greater beings than us.

829
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,400
And our most intellectual discussion to them will be in the future.

830
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,540
I think that's the way it is, Dr. Howell.

831
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,760
I'm afraid that's the way it is to most people, Dr. Howell.

832
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:06,040
You see, people tend to think that when aliens come, if they're not the bad kind, whatever they are, they'll be cuddly somehow.

833
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,280
Or weird and gawky, but at least somebody you can shove in the closet with your toys.

834
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
I'll be right here.

835
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:20,380
But in fact, you will be the junior to their senior, since they are in advance of us in the future.

836
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:20,380


837
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:20,380


838
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:26,740
And if you manage to get here, you will be not so much as an infant to them as a puppy or something like that.

839
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,020
So you've got to mind your B's and Q's.

840
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,820
Apparently, Mr. Sister has some sort of an interruption here.

841
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,560
Let's hear it.

842
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:42,600
I just wanted to tell you that as part of the socialist regulations for ADA, they still apply on the pleasure ship, but in reverse.

843
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,980
So for those of us with diabetes, we're going to be force-fed honey.

844
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,480
Honey?

845
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,680
And syrup.

846
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:55,480
And there will be a whole pastry room on the ship.

847
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,180
Yes.

848
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,620
It consists of pies, particularly pecan pies.

849
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,200
Homemade, of course.

850
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,300
Homemade pies.

851
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,400
Is this a church of pastries and pies all of a sudden?

852
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:11,780
I mean, there's serious murders and problems we have to deal with here.

853
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,300
Come on, Dan. I'm trying to distract from that stuff here.

854
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,340
We're talking about pie in the sky tomorrow at 7.

855
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,520
Pie in the sky, yes.

856
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:18,960
How do you do that?

857
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,580
Heavenly pies.

858
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,180
Exactly.

859
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,020
Okay, if that's all you got.

860
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,960
You know, if there's some murdering behind on this planet.

861
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,960
I will talk about it.

862
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,040
If there's some monster sucking people's fluids out, what good is it to go on and on about it?

863
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,400
You know, you can't do anything about it.

864
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:38,240
There's no monster sucking fluids out, and if there is, it's probably just Dr. Legume or phyllo.

865
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,100
And then the pies don't have anything to do with it.

866
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:41,660
No.

867
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,660
It's starting to sound like a Terry Pratchett novel.

868
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:48,960
A pie, damn it, is like just one scintilla, one fragment, one minim of pie.

869
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,040
It's the vast reward that is coming.

870
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,920
We've got this great ripped off Philip Glass music in the background that's suitable for

871
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,280
talking about the soul and the spirit and sex goddesses and porno, and you're talking

872
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,040
about pies.

873
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:10,920
By the way, Reverend Ankara is sponsoring a chili feast tonight.

874
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,860
Oh, we can talk about chili but not pies.

875
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,960
We're more democratic, proletarian.

876
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,380
Sure, I understand.

877
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:18,940
I like chili.

878
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:18,940


879
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,140
I like chili and I don't like pie that much.

880
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:28,760
How long has it been since you have kept yourself to a warm steaming bowl of Woof brand chili?

881
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,940
All I know is I get the Grand Canyon and you don't.

882
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,880
You can have Gunderson Canyon or Black Canyon or whatever it is.

883
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,920
It takes a lot of chili to fill that one up just on the QT.

884
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,980
But that's quite all right.

885
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,080
You take this geological wonder for your own.

886
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,560
People take...

887
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,600
They take the X day for granted.

888
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:51,800
Granted.

889
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,220
And they don't really think ahead.

890
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,340
They don't...

891
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,840
You know, y'all are going to be fighting over the Eiffel Tower.

892
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,140
Then they'll see.

893
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,640
And other trinkets from Earth that you'll want to take with you.

894
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,500
Alluvial limestone and red sandstone.

895
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,160
The interesting thing is you can also...

896
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,980
Triassic age.

897
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:17,300
Once you're on your saucer, you can rupture up not only these great wonders of the Earth

898
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,440
that mankind has built.

899
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,740
And things like the Grand Canyon.

900
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,700
But you can...

901
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,280
You could also take captive the pink human caretakers.

902
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,940
Even though you could have robots sweeping it up and fixing...

903
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,500
So you force the rangers to recapitulate their spiel in space.

904
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,300
What?

905
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,480
You force the park rangers to come along with you and give you the Grand Canyon guide with the...

906
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:44,980
Right.

907
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,740
I've always wanted to do that on a donkey.

908
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,940
But not an Earth donkey.

909
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,500
I want an Exus donkey.

910
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,840
They won't chafe my...

911
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,860
You can get a Robas.

912
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:02,540
Which not only will carry you but also converse with you on any subject that you desire.

913
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,220
Well, yeah, sure.

914
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,880
But I'd rather use a...

915
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,960
How about a talking donkey robot?

916
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,600
It is.

917
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,400
That's what it is.

918
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,320
It's a Robas.

919
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,680
You know, the point is you have to think about...

920
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,020
Whatever you're fantasizing about at 7 o'clock tomorrow morning, that's going to come true.

921
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:23,500
So if you're thinking, oh, now I've got to go back to work tomorrow, that's where you're going to end up.

922
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,940
That'll be perfectly recreated.

923
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,180
Perfect simulation of your tedious job in your crappy apartment.

924
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,160
Whereas if you're thinking big, think like Elvis.

925
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,740
You could have a big house full of glitzy gold-plated stuff.

926
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,240
Actually, they say the stuff in Elvis's house wasn't worth a dollar.

927
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:41,940
I know, I know.

928
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,820
But that's what you're...

929
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,460
I'm thinking about subgenius imaginations and tastes.

930
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,880
Oh, to a subgenius, yes.

931
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,360
Yes, of course.

932
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,660
It would be a glowing fantasy world.

933
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,260
A sea of rare comic books.

934
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,580
You don't think Elvis was into the comics as a reader?

935
00:38:59,600 --> 00:38:59,960
No.

936
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:11,500
Elvis is already dead, or actually, according to doctrine, Bob helped Elvis get out of a bad situation by faking his death.

937
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,400
But then he had trouble with a mummy when he got into the restaurant.

938
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,760
Well, that was supposed to be secret.

939
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,400
Because that other guy really was President Kennedy.

940
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,080
It's a complex tale.

941
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:25,720
It is.

942
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,200
It's damn complicated.

943
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,720
The conspiracy doesn't make it any simpler.

944
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:36,220
Has anyone had premonitory dreams of the saucer landing tomorrow morning?

945
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,040
Mr. Sister did, and he described them on tape earlier, but they were...

946
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,960
Censored.

947
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,680
Distressing.

948
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,260
They weren't inspiring.

949
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,680
Oh.

950
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:54,740
It was a giant...a crashing...a saucer crash in a place like the pond, and giant robots with X's on their chests coming out and knocking humans right and left.

951
00:39:54,860 --> 00:40:00,360
Just like in that movie, The Mysterians, where the huge robot bursts out...

952
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,120
Right, that was really about the Wisterians.

953
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:02,940
The Wisterians.

954
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,100
But it was...there's been this cover-up going on.

955
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,560
Right, that was the conspiracy version of this incident.

956
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,480
Not that we're covering anything up.

957
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,480
Well, you know, if there's a saucer crash there, that would be unfortunate.

958
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:29,060
Because it would mean that these people we conceive of as super beings and are turning everything over to, lock, stock, and barrel, because the deed's already done and Dobbs did it, are actually clumsy, maladroit idiots just like people on Earth.

959
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,560
I mean, I'm just shooting that out there.

960
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:40,160
Oh, speaking of clumsy, maladroit idiots, I was looking to see if Reverend Janice Blackseed was around, and here he is.

961
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,040
He is here.

962
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,540
Because you're gonna...we're gonna start the auction at 5.

963
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,260
And it'll end it at 5.05.

964
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,140
And you're the other auctioneer.

965
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,640
We've hardly got anything.

966
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,740
But what we do, we're gonna auction the bejesus out of.

967
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,340
We're gonna auction the hell out of it.

968
00:40:52,460 --> 00:41:02,280
Yes, that's right. We're going to. Because that is the Bulldada auction. It wouldn't be X-Day without a Bill, a Bull. Bulldada auction. So that...

969
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:13,520
Bulldada, the latest exploration into advanced surrealistic Dadaism in which the mind is filled with dirt and lux with trickle-like belated centipedes down the sides of the ice sockets to find shelter and rest inside the now-imperialized world.

970
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,340
I think I misquoted that slightly.

971
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:22,460
Well, at any rate, it's entirely salutary, fun for the whole family.

972
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,700
Thanks to Shredney Chisholm.

973
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,780
Yeah, it's a good point.

974
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,480
Shredney Chisholm coined that phrase, Bulldada.

975
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,540
Charges the corpuscles.

976
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:30,540
Yes.

977
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:40,400
It does. It wakes you up and alerts you to the many numinous possibilities offered by life itself.

978
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,660
What are we talking about? Frop? Bulldada?

979
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,460
Bulldada.

980
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:43,680
Bulldada.

981
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,260
One of those things.

982
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,360
And when you frop, it helps with the Bulldada.

983
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,180
I could turn anything into Bulldada.

984
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:56,800
For a while. For a little while, that's the problem. You know, the cheap frop wears off. The real thing never does.

985
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,260
Damn it!

986
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:10,720
Well, there might not even be time for it to wear off, as you say, in the current scheme of things, because we will have a new heaven and a new earth and a new nervous system zipped into our frames.

987
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,440
And hopefully...

988
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,980
I'd like to keep the same old hell, though. It was cool.

989
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,260
I thought that became the Christian heaven or something.

990
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:24,060
Well, we would keep it as kind of a theme park. Don't you think that would be, you know, the Dante's Hell?

991
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:32,480
Inferno. Did you see the Dante's Inferno movie? The giant hell theme park collapses and crushes a bunch of people.

992
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:32,760
Right.

993
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:39,580
Huge devil statues fall on screaming mobs. And this is just one of the set pieces in the movie.

994
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,200
Thou shalt not mock God.

995
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:48,560
Then it was badly built. You see, Spencer Tracy didn't spend enough money on the shoddy construction, so it's all his fault.

996
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:59,840
Then he goes to visit Old Pop in the hospital, the guy whose rinky dinky Dante's Inferno hell attraction he took over, Tracy, years ago and built it up into this huge monstrous thing.

997
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:09,260
And Old Pop tells him about hell. And then it goes into the hell scene that lasts about ten minutes of souls getting tortured.

998
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,680
And naked women running around getting lashed and so forth.

999
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:20,100
And lots of scenes right out of Dante's Inferno. The Wood of the Suicides, the tombs of the Heresiarchs. They're all there.

1000
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:25,820
The rain of fire and people forced to hold hot rods and be upside down in blazing tombs.

1001
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,900
Arms reaching up out of the ground.

1002
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:33,020
Yeah. And out of the river Styx where you have to take that long boat ride.

1003
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:39,560
And then that scene ends with newspaper boys in the street calling out for the indictment and prosecution.

1004
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:39,560


1005
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:48,960
Of our hero. And I'm sorry to keep talking about this movie, but I'll just say that then it goes into a third giant spectacular climax.

1006
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,160
First you have the hell amusement park collapses and crushes a bunch of people.

1007
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,880
Secondly, you have hell itself.

1008
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:04,880
Third, the guy takes all the money that he got from the hell amusement park and sinks it into a giant floating casino ship with all the latest luxuries.

1009
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,560
But unfortunately he cuts corners again and hires a bunch of criminal thugs who sabotage the movie.

1010
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:16,980
And the whole ship is sinking like the Titanic with his only little son, the apple of his eye, Sonny, aboard.

1011
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,300
Sonny, Sonny's gonna go down.

1012
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,200
I tell you they don't make movies like that.

1013
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,280
It has three climaxes. Enough for three movies.

1014
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,160
Well, doesn't the latest Spider-Man movie have at least three climaxes?

1015
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,420
They go on and on and on. It's like, come on, can I go now?

1016
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,380
I believe it was Louis B. Meyer who said, start with an explosion and build to a climax.

1017
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,600
Well, as long as you have a guy flying through the air in front of a fireball, you know you got your money's worth.

1018
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:53,320
They used to run in front of a slowly growing fireball, but now they fly in front of the fireball.

1019
00:44:53,540 --> 00:45:02,880
Now, in the subgenius movie, I wanted to have Bob flying in front of a fireball coming out of the pipe of an even huger Bob,

1020
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:09,540
who is himself flying through the air in front of the fireball that's coming from the pipe of an even huger Bob.

1021
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:09,540


1022
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,020
And so on and so forth, you know.

1023
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,000
See, we don't need Philo here.

1024
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,260
It would be a great special effect, but you'd only have to do the animation once and then you just repeat it, you know?

1025
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,060
Right.

1026
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:23,360
So you'd only have to, you'd save money. I learned that trick from Ray Harryhausen.

1027
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,960
Worlds within worlds. He used six.

1028
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:31,660
I'm sorry to disabuse that old legend that he had a quintipuss. It was actually a sextipuss.

1029
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:37,360
Six is good. Five, that would kind of give the game away.

1030
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,520
Well, the point is you can make a doctor.

1031
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,180
Dante's Inferno come to life on your escape saucer.

1032
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,720
Not only that, the Paradiso.

1033
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,580
You can bring heaven on your saucer.

1034
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,700
Just make sure it's not the Mohammedan heaven.

1035
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:59,480
Not that I'm criticizing it, but there was some talk today about the fact that the translation is very iffy.

1036
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:09,540
Instead of getting 72 virgins, what you probably actually get, according to a more accurate translation of the text, is 72 raisins.

1037
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,620
That's a big difference.

1038
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,220
And the followers of Islam...

1039
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,800
What? I killed myself for these 72 stinking raisins?

1040
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:19,880
After they blow up, they get there and they're given their 72 raisins.

1041
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,480
Now they're eternally renewable raisins.

1042
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:29,280
So even if you throw the raisins on the floor in despair, they're still there in eternity.

1043
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,120
It all comes out of the desert culture.

1044
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,500
Raisins were quite a valuable commodity.

1045
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:40,320
It's a waste of moisture and nutrition on long camel besotted voyages.

1046
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,720
Where'd they get the damn circumcision idea?

1047
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,160
Too much time on their own in the desert.

1048
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,520
That probably could answer a whole lot of otherwise difficult questions.

1049
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,240
Now we know what all our guys look like.

1050
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,240
Hidden in the mist.

1051
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,160
In the depths of time.

1052
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,480
You know, we've tried to have mock battles.

1053
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,920
Like the big battle of Armageddon, if that's day.

1054
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:12,520
Where the subgeniuses would divide up into holocaustals and evangelicals, or whatev.

1055
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,540
Well, don't let me hold you back.

1056
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:21,380
Well, but the problem...the reason that those just always fell apart was you couldn't tell who was on what team.

1057
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,860
Every soldier was dressed completely differently.

1058
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,260
Fractured tibias and dislocated shoulders and unsightly bruises.

1059
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:29,460
You have...

1060
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:35,980
You had the embarrassing spectacle of people in these outrageous suits walking up to each other and politely going,

1061
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:39,080
Are you like a holocaustal or an evangelical?

1062
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,520
I'm holocaustal.

1063
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,880
Well, how about you?

1064
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,780
And then the nerve battle starts.

1065
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:45,980
And out comes the boffin sword.

1066
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,860
Yes, Sir Scatterwack Buffet's...Sir Wackenpoof.

1067
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:57,120
Well, what's the big Hollywood movie that came out this week to distract people from X-Day?

1068
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,800
Because every year...

1069
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,260
On July 4th, there's the opening of a movie.

1070
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,720
It was...and it's always the end of the world and the humans always win.

1071
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:12,220
It was Independence Day in 96, Armageddon in 97, Deep Impact in 98.

1072
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,500
And I've lost track of them since then.

1073
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,080
But there's always an end of the world movie every summer.

1074
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,260
With zombies or something?

1075
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,500
It's always got Morgan Freeman in it.

1076
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,280
Morgan Freeman.

1077
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,260
Which?

1078
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,740
Oh, Transformers!

1079
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,360
That's the one?

1080
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,500
It's out now.

1081
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,440
Extinction.

1082
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:28,880
Uh-oh.

1083
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,300
The sword that meets the eye.

1084
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,460
Boy, is that telling, huh?

1085
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,680
Extinction, you see?

1086
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,780
They're trying to get the news out in their own conspiracy, be slimed way.

1087
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:46,140
Actually, I shouldn't say this, but I love those Transformers movies.

1088
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:46,780
So does K-Rob.

1089
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:47,500
With the sound off.

1090
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,120
If you turn the sound off and put on some other music...

1091
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,060
K-Rob watches them too.

1092
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:51,760
Psychedelically.

1093
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,200
So the music is bad, huh?

1094
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,780
And you put on pounding disco music...

1095
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,300
Well, the dialogue is bad.

1096
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:56,580
Oh, the dialogue.

1097
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,680
The dialogue is bad.

1098
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,940
And if you're a Transformers purist, those things are...

1099
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,440
It's despicable.

1100
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:12,100
That Bryan Singer guy took the original Transformers purity and just mucked it all up as if he was God.

1101
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,780
With the effects, you mean?

1102
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,220
No, the whole story.

1103
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,080
And you know what?

1104
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,700
He's doing it to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles now.

1105
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,760
In the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, this is what pinkness does.

1106
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,540
They're not teenage.

1107
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,820
They're not mutant.

1108
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,120
They're not ninjas.

1109
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:27,980
Is that really real?

1110
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,200
And they're not turtles.

1111
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,200
How's that?

1112
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,640
Johnny Knoxville plays Leonardo.

1113
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:40,300
Too bad that Kevin Eastman let loose of the most profitable thing he ever owned or ever

1114
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:46,340
will own, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which he created as a marijuana-smoking comic

1115
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:46,820
book artist.

1116
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,320
Well, to get back to what's important, where's the nearest theater and when's that Transformers

1117
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:53,940
movie showing?

1118
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,760
It's not 7 a.m. until...

1119
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,020
No, you can't sneak off to look at the movies of giant robots.

1120
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:06,600
Just wait a few hours and according to Ms. Darcystar, there'll be giant robots physically

1121
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,140
present.

1122
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,640
Oh, that was just a dream.

1123
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,800
One thing to see them in the movies.

1124
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,620
But then the aliens always make you think it was just a dream, don't they?

1125
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,820
If they have the ability to alter your memories, of course they do.

1126
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:21,160
Like when they come and they make offers to the U.S. president.

1127
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,880
If he won't go along with them, they erase his memory.

1128
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,040
Well, that also explains a lot.

1129
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,940
Believe me, that is not a job that many people would really want.

1130
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:39,220
If you've ever noticed pictures of presidents, the older they are, the aging seems to occur

1131
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,320
across the board.

1132
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,500
And even in office, Obama's gotten white-haired, Clinton visibly aged.

1133
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,420
It happens to them all.

1134
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,880
George Bush went from preppy to avuncular.

1135
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,600
The old presidents were long-haired, though.

1136
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,080
Well, they were.

1137
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,020
And I got to use that.

1138
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:02,040
I went to a family reunion with some aged stangs from the deep south.

1139
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,400
From the 18th century?

1140
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,400
There were young stangs, too.

1141
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,300
There was a young long-haired feller and his blue-haired girlfriend.

1142
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,800
They had tattoos and everything.

1143
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,860
And he had a big beard and really long hair.

1144
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:17,160
And this old lady relative of mine was saying,

1145
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,660
Now, Ivan, now see, would you hire a boy that looked like that?

1146
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,600
And I went.

1147
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,420
Hey.

1148
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,660
And she goes, Yeah, but we can see your face, Ivan.

1149
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,420
Would you hire a boy like that?

1150
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,320
So I pulled out a nickel and said, Would you hire a man that looked like that?

1151
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,560
Thomas Jefferson.

1152
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,800
With a ponytail.

1153
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,320
Actually, I didn't.

1154
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,180
I thought of it later.

1155
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,180
I didn't actually.

1156
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,640
But now I have, see?

1157
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,080
Now you can do it.

1158
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,940
Next time somebody complains about your nephew with his long hair, you say, Would you hire

1159
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,700
George Washington with hair like that?

1160
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,700
Jefferson died on the street.

1161
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,320
And you have to say it in a southern accent like I just did.

1162
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,940
This is the anniversary of Thomas Jefferson's death.

1163
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:58,880
Is it?

1164
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,140
Yes, I believe so.

1165
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,100
What, right now?

1166
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,280
Yes, I think it is.

1167
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,240
Fourth of July?

1168
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,180
Don't you know that story?

1169
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:08,000
They let Thomas Jefferson die on the Fourth of July?

1170
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,560
He waited until it was the Fourth of July to die.

1171
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,680
He wanted to die on the Fourth of July.

1172
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:15,380
Oh, really?

1173
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,680
And then somebody else, one of his founding father peeps, but I don't remember who, also

1174
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,200
died on that day and was saying,

1175
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,020
At least Jefferson still lives.

1176
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,320
No, he didn't.

1177
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:27,520
Sorry.

1178
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,900
He also cashed in.

1179
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:32,500
Good thing they didn't have the internet or somebody would have instant messaged him

1180
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,300
and said, I'm sorry.

1181
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:36,080
Now the internet is destroying Jefferson today.

1182
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,580
It's probably pretty much destroying life as we know it.

1183
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,980
It makes everyone stupider and less well informed.

1184
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,540
It has helped the Church of the Subgenius, man.

1185
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,580
We were about to go under when the internet broke.

1186
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,100
Right.

1187
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:49,700
Yeah, right.

1188
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:50,560
Really.

1189
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:58,900
We'll defeat the conspiracy if we have to hair lip every man, woman, and child on Bear

1190
00:52:58,900 --> 00:52:59,280
Creek.

1191
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,700
Clean up America.

1192
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,640
Get a hair lip.

1193
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,620
But this year we paid our dues, friends.

1194
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:09,100
We suffered the last three years so that you could have good weather at Wisteria this time.

1195
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,760
It's karma, see?

1196
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,280
It all balances, adds up.

1197
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,580
We had to do a lot of stuff that we did not like in order to achieve this weather for

1198
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:15,780
you.

1199
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:22,680
I guess we had to make some bargains, which perhaps in the long run were better than we

1200
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,300
ever would have hoped.

1201
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:40,560
This year we decided to戲en with the города er's

1202
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:40,560


1203
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:40,660
Try, count all day and atmosphere has gonna be different like when you're in a Síle

1204
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:40,660


1205
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:40,660


1206
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:40,680
Every though I've seen the beautiful women.

1207
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:40,680


1208
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:40,680


1209
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:40,680


1210
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:40,680


1211
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:40,680


1212
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:49,680
She said you were a pe sufficient, old woman, one who Nederlandh

1213
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:52,660
Dou tn3

1214
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,820
The microwaved cat.

1215
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,900
The empty suit of bloody clothes.

1216
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,840
And all the other things people talk about.

1217
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:00,920
The three-toed tracks.

1218
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,160
Yeah, the weird tracks.

1219
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,200
And also...

1220
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,840
We need a Geiger counter is what we need.

1221
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,300
Are we getting one?

1222
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,600
I bet we could.

1223
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:12,640
Have one brought in from Spudville.

1224
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,180
Oh, that's right.

1225
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,240
Pisces and Suds carry one wherever they go.

1226
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:19,400
So we don't need it now, I don't think.

1227
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,280
Do you guys have a Geiger counter, I understand?

1228
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,900
Most subgeniuses do.

1229
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,080
Yes, you're saying yes, you do.

1230
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,040
You're nodding yes.

1231
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,220
Well, very good.

1232
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:32,420
We'll be able to test for radiation exposure and radiation leakage also,

1233
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,920
which is quite important,

1234
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:38,700
without having to resort to making our own dosimeters.

1235
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,140
But, yeah, that might...

1236
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,500
Maybe we can track the...

1237
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:44,900
Whatever it is.

1238
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,060
Not that there's anything out there.

1239
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:48,600
With some tinfoil and a milk carton,

1240
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,780
you can test the sensitivity to radiation.

1241
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,360
The Church and subgenius have said...

1242
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,320
You did sign the liability forms.

1243
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,720
Of course, radiation will go around corners,

1244
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,680
even though it travels in straight lines.

1245
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:03,320
A paradox.

1246
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,240
Radiation can go around corners?

1247
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,360
That's right.

1248
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:15,000
Radiation, of course, can be airborne as radioactive foil.

1249
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,120
Oh, right, of course.

1250
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:21,620
Well, it can go around corners while broadcasting through the corners,

1251
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:24,540
through whatever the corner is made of, unless it's lead.

1252
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,620
I say radiation very generally,

1253
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:32,420
but cosmic radiation is pelting and sleeting through you right now,

1254
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,660
and everyone else here is being interpenetrated.

1255
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,500
Ah, we have our Geiger counter now.

1256
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,360
She had one handy.

1257
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,340
I would have had to go all the way to my truck to get mine.

1258
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,820
Is it charged up?

1259
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,840
Oh, it needs batteries.

1260
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:43,400
Right.

1261
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:48,080
Of course, I have my Geiger counter batteries ready to go.

1262
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,320
Yeah, there's a huge hole in there.

1263
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,980
Obviously, you have to put something in.

1264
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,740
A Geiger-Muller counter, painted a jaunty yellow,

1265
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,140
and an oscilloscope-like screen.

1266
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,120
Yeah, um, yeah.

1267
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,820
It's a real Geiger counter, folks.

1268
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,900
As if you didn't already know.

1269
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,880
As if you didn't keep one just for...

1270
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:12,560
Oh, well, all right.

1271
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,660
We'll fire that baby up.

1272
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,840
The Geiger counter will help us investigate

1273
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,220
and put these silly monsters...

1274
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,600
...monster stories to bed once and for all.

1275
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,040
Monster, ha!

1276
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,040
Well, I wouldn't be so sure, Hal.

1277
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,360
You know, there's some things science hasn't fully explained.

1278
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,680
I know that.

1279
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,160
I know that.

1280
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:38,200
There are mysteries in space that perhaps mankind has not yet stumbled upon.

1281
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,300
Yeah, but...

1282
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,660
Maybe things that perhaps we shouldn't tamper with.

1283
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,580
Forces, you know.

1284
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,040
Well, uh...

1285
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:46,380
Things.

1286
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,780
You know, for somebody who's got a war on God going,

1287
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,300
I don't know why you're offering me a war.

1288
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,620
I'm offering the excuse of not meddling in God's domain.

1289
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:59,560
But, uh, the human mind's a strange thing.

1290
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:04,140
It can play funny tricks and make you think you see a monster,

1291
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,760
or a sea monster.

1292
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,480
Makes you think you see a sea monster.

1293
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,760
Or a saucer.

1294
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:13,960
Like, uh, you know, they could give you good testimony about a saucer.

1295
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,520
Say, that saucer's the one I saucer.

1296
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,800
That saucer.

1297
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,420
And you say, where?

1298
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,140
What saucer?

1299
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,640
There isn't a saucer.

1300
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,440
And there wasn't the sea monster.

1301
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,380
Case closed.

1302
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,640
I wouldn't be so sure about that, Dr. Howell.

1303
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,140
We'll see.

1304
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,080
Time will tell.

1305
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,620
We still have a few hours left on this...

1306
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,560
Yes, time is the operative word, isn't it?

1307
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,540
Yes, and it's time...

1308
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,180
Time is trickling and dwindling away.

1309
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,600
It's time for the Bulldada auction.

1310
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:41,400
Time...

1311
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:46,080
It's even if the world ends in about 14 or 15 hours...

1312
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:50,740
You'll still want the cool latest subgenius gear, which unfortunately and coincidentally,

1313
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:51,280
That's right.

1314
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,180
...we're going to be auctioning from up here.

1315
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:58,520
You're not going to need that money or that money in the bank, because now, for the first

1316
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:03,020
time ever, we can take credit cards for the Bulldada auction.

1317
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,200
Yes, it's a matter of spiritual giving...

1318
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:05,880
You can charge it.

1319
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,480
...and spiritual receiving.

1320
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,980
Actually, we did that for years.

1321
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:13,680
So we'll strap on our spiritual chest protectors and get going in a moment.

1322
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:20,080
But remember, this is the last pre-X moment Bulldada auction, which will take place, and

1323
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,260
coincidentally, the first one.

1324
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:28,260
Time hath endless rarities and shows of all varieties, which reveals all things in heaven,

1325
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:32,800
maketh new discoveries in earth, and even earth itself a discovery.

1326
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,500
Well, that's heavy.

1327
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,020
So where did Janus go, anyway?

1328
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:43,600
Yes, ladies and germs, time is a thing of dragonflies and angels.

1329
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:47,240
The former live too little, and the latter live too long.

1330
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,780
But it's all relative.

1331
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:52,380
It depends on where you stand.

1332
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,960
And especially to you, ladies, I would say.

1333
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:02,000
When time takes you out for a spin in his car, you'll be hard-pressed to stop him from

1334
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,120
going too far.

1335
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,220
Hey, this is great.

1336
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,580
I didn't see this before.

1337
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,120
I'm going to change my recording here.

1338
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,320
Soap on a rope of Mr. T.

1339
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:18,760
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slavery.

1340
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,120

But sire, there is no more money!

1345
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,960
We gotta get some money!

1348
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:04,100
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show, and we're even more glad that some listeners

1349
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:08,020
have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1350
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:13,060
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1351
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,600

1356

as best you can.

1357
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:37,320
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty, and we don't want any subgeniuses

1358
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,000
to make their own situations worse.

1359
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,940
But some of you still have jobs.

1360
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:47,300
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month.

1361
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:51,160
50 bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1362
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:59,340
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs if you don't pay

01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,000
