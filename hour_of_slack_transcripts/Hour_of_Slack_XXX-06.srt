1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Usually radio announcements merely recommend a product, but this station provides its clients with a special service.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,300
The Subgenius. Our host.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,100
In the radio studios of art, the technicians, the entertainers, the commentators, the administrative personnel,

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,380
daily unite their efforts in the creation of programs to please and entertain a vast radio public.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:23,700
Ah!

6
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:36,140
The wide variety of broadcasts include group discussions, political speeches, and comedy.

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,880
On this program, frank opinions are expressed in response to their leaders' questioning.

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,760
Questions of the day are discussed and opinions and attitudes freely expressed on issues of the moment.

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,840
For there is keen interest in a radio program that invites personal participation by the public.

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,660
This is...

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,160
This is Independent Radio in a Democracy.

12
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,280
Sir, hadn't you better buckle up?

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,380
Now buckle this!

14
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,600
Enjoy your little nap. I'm off to the warm embrace of my afternoon enema.

15
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,700
Ah, yes, dear friends.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,300
It's another one of those triple X rated internet only hours of slack.

17
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,920
Well, I suppose it might end up being broadcast illegally somewhere.

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,940
Yes, indeed.

19
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,480
And it's inspired by the fact that we can.

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,240
And now, as we always have in any hour of slack show,

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,360
lots of collages by Federico Fernandinande Lemur.

22
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,120
The great Lemur.

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:51,580
Only in this case we can play some that normally would appear only in their home territory of alt.binaries.slag.

24
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,800
Become a welcome guest and ask through adventure apps.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:00,800


26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:00,800


27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,880
No, no

28
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,380
The cookie is.

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,420
The cookie is

30
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,240
No, Lindsay, please don't!

31
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:07,620


32
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:07,620


33
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:07,620


34
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:07,620


35
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:13,860
Eric Elcom

36
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,360
Then, Leo Levi

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:32,320
No, no, what do you mean no? No, I don't want to go for a ride, a ride. Now that's a good idea.

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:44,360
Heineken, fuck that shit. Heineken, fuck that shit. Heineken, fuck that shit. Heineken.

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:55,900
Fast Blue Ribbon! Fast Blue Ribbon! Fast Blue Ribbon! Heineken, fuck that shit. Heineken.

40
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:09,520
Fast Blue Ribbon! Fast Blue Ribbon. Fast Blue Ribbon!

41
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,460
For the glasses

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,900
That beer's gonna get warm

43
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,440
One thing I can't fucking stand is warm beer

44
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,580
Makes me fucking puke

45
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,560
Pass Blue Ribbon

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,420
Pass Blue Ribbon

47
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,280

48
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,140
Fuck that shit

49
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,180
Heineken

50
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,040
Fuck that shit

51
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,080
Heineken

52
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,880
Fuck that shit

53
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,000
Heineken

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,980
Pass Blue Ribbon

55
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,040
Pass Blue Ribbon

56
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,860
Pass Blue Ribbon

57
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,680
Heineken

58
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,480
Fuck that shit

59
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,560
Heineken

60
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,380
Fuck that shit

61
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,440
Heineken

62
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,280
Fuck that shit

63
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,320
Heineken

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,140
Fuck that shit

65
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,980
The Punk Group

66
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,860
A new...

67
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,020
Oh, by the way,

68
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,820
I should mention the new title there of the show

69
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,900
was by the Bishop.

70
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,440
But what we just heard was

71
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,840
the Punk Group

72
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,240
fine song there

73
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,880
called Heineken.

74
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,680
Every year, thousands of listeners

75
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,720
never contributed.

76
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,640
If you are one of these people,

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,160
fuck you very, very much.

78
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,680
You're not the first one to say that about the masked man.

79
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,100
Gee.

80
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,120
He's the loner.

81
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,280
Heineken

82
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,280
Heineken

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,280

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,340
Heineken

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:09,400
Heineken

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:09,400


88
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:09,400


89
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:09,400

Dandwicha, Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

108
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,580
Dandwicha, Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

109
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,260
Now if you're hungry for some bologna

110
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,060
And you got buns that you wanna show me

111
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,940
Open up wide, you can eat this

112
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,400
Azkama that's really bony

113
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,040
I wanna get down into your jujubes

114
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,540
And I think I'm gonna flick em

115
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,880
Your titties all smelling like chocolate chip ice cream

116
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,060
And I think I wanna lick em

117
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,220
I got some hot people that run frozen but ya

00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,440
Ya gotta say please

119
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,500
I'll dig into the thigh every time

120
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,800
But you hold the cottage cheese

121
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,880
And for dessert we can do the worst

122
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,460
If I'm a whipped cream in your pie hole

123
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,580
And don't flinch when you feel a pinch on that

124
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,840
Pretty little taco

125
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,140
Cause I've tried to pry your beaded clams there

126
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,480
That will not budge

127
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,420
So I went around the corner to keep on trying

128
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,000
And I got a little fudge

129
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,620
Dandwicha, Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

130
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,040
Dandwicha, Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

131
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,520
Dandwicha, Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

132
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,920
Dandwicha, Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

133
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,780
Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

134
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,500
Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

135
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,860
Dandwicha, Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

136
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,800
Dandwicha, Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

137
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,700
Dandwicha, Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

138
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,240
A pile of potatoes, Wendy's

139
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,820
But she doesn't lend them

140
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,720
She moves a couple of tits more than a cart's dick

141
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,180
Bring a burro spaghetti with a beer in a can

142
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,760
The bad ones that she doesn't like

143
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,500
Step on her fifth leg

144
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,540
Save some chilaquiles for her

145
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,060
She's going to breakfast tomorrow

146
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,780
And some more chips for her

147
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,340
We're divorced, we don't want to get involved

148
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,840
White or integral, I don't care, I don't care

149
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,620
Mama chapata, mama chapata

150
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,460
And here are her chapatines

151
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,880
Dino, triple, pronto, doubler, quarter, pounder, whopper, double

152
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,220
I want to make her a sandwich

153
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,180
A tighter dance

154
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,900
Better than lamb, a spicy Italian one

155
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,080
I want to dance with the bora

156
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,420
But with the machichona

157
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,700
Dandwicha, Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

158
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,780
Dandwicha, Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

159
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,540
Dandwicha, Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

160
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,040
Dandwicha, Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

161
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,460
Dandwicha, Dandwicha, Dandwicha la chichora

162
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,240
Chankwicha achichona

163
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:26,540
Molotov did that song, Chankwicha achichona. I'm pretty sure that that's fairly dirty.

164
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:35,400
Let's see what's in the bag tonight. The thick yellow-green discharge from his genitals to your

165
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:45,100
lip. Oh, oh. And now we're going to move on. We're going to talk to Ribka. Hi, Ribka. Hi,

166
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:51,700
I have oral sex. All right, Ribka. Okay. Bye-bye. Bye. And we've got back Rib calling in. Hi,

167
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,000
back Rib. Hi, how are you? Very gross or dirty. And this is the result of upbringing.

168
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,820
I'm fine. I have a penis. She has a thick yellow penis.

169
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,640
It's gross. I heard that there was a way to get rid of that, but I don't know how.

170
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,220
Your butt can't do it. Really? Someone told me that vibrates. You're vibrating, but won't do it. No,

171
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:24,580
no. All right. Have fun. Okay. Bye-bye. Bye, back Rib. The S word, oh, shit. That's Old English.

172
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,340
It appears in Old English, but it's not common. And there it just seems to refer to diarrhea.

173
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,840
Do you have a bathroom problem in your house? It's a very busy place, isn't it? Where everyone in the

174
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,380
family...

175
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,160
has to brush their teeth, wash their hands, take a dish.

176
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:53,820
Here's the moon pants song. Mooney, mooney, moon pants, ejaculating your moon pants. That didn't

177
00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:03,060
come out right. Mooney, mooney, moon pants, ejaculating your moon pants. What are moon pants?

178
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,840
Pants like the asterisks.

179
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,000
And that's war to the moon.

180
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,860
Hard driving. Hard driving blues rock.

181
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,940
Sounds like Kilbilly.

182
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,520
That's a Kilbilly.

183
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,840
That's some Kilbilly music.

184
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,580
Woo!

185
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:23,880
Woo!

186
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,240
I'm a mean old Kilbilly.

187
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,300
I'm an X.

188
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,360
I'm an X.

189
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,180
I'm an X.

190
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:35,380


191
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,800
I've been sitting around way too long

192
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:49,640
I've been sitting around way too long

193
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:58,100
Hell, right on Monday, I gotta get up

194
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,560
Oh, it's your modest alone

195
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,800
And I wanna get home

196
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,820
Mama

197
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,700
Oh, yeah, you're just gonna get over there to me

198
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,980
Let it all in and I'll spread it and go back down

199
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,580
Count those hotcakes that you will drive way up there

200
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,820
In between your legs like cheetahs

201
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,080
You'll be back in a minute

202
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,460
Take me to the bottom

203
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,380
Just hang it out there

204
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,560
I love it

205
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,220
I don't like how old I am

206
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,620
Can I stay away like that?

207
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,700
You look so old

208
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,820

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,240

What man?

271
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,440
He's got his hands in his pockets

272
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,080
Oh, that?

273
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,120

00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,980
In his lapidary pockets

276
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,540
Pockets

Oh, my love

286
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,180
Oh, my love

287
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,920
That's all that I have for you, baby

288
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,820
It's so sweet

289
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,600

Beaver

300
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,720
This episode was the very first script written by episodic shoplifters

301
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,860
starring Beaver

302
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,180
I think it's better if you don't look

303
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,340
What would I want to see?

304
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,880

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,280
Hmm

00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,320
Hmm

368
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,760
Gee, Dad

369

373
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,300
Oh, okay, Dad

374
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,920
So long

375
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,900
So long, Dad

376
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,100
They are now planning for

377
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,460
Sex on the streets

378
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,800
In every major city from coast to coast

379
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,320
The music that they're planning to use

380
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,380
To crumble the morals of America

381
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,000
Is this rotten, filthy, dirty

382
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,420
Lewd, lascivious

383
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,500
Junk

384
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,720
Oh, rock and roll

385
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:27,580
Sex

386
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,500
It's the beat

387
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,140
Sex

388
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,320
It's the beat

389
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,800
How this beat gets them

390
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,360
Four hundred teenage girls

391
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,020
Which were interviewed

392
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,040
Asking why they had illegitimate babies

393
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,880
They said not just the word

394
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,700
The beat

395
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,960
Who's behind it all?

396
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,200
What this mysterious PT

397
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,600
Called sex

398
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,120
Sex

399
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,680
The fertility rights of the jungle

400
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:52,980
The fertility rights of the jungle

401
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,100
Those are the same beat

402
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,260
Incorporated in this modern rock

403
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,240
Just threw them up

404
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,820
The fertility rights of the jungle

405
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,280
Sex

406
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,380
Sex

407
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,120
The beat

408
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,940
It's the beat

409
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,820
That will destroy people's minds

410
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,520
The fertility rights of the jungle

411
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,000
Seat

412
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,940
Seat

413
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,060
Rock, rock, rock and roll

414
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,000
Rock, rock, rock and roll

415
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,180
Sex

416
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,960
It's the beat

417
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,180
The beat

418
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,340
It'll destroy people's minds

419
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,400
It's the beat

420
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,000
The beat

421
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,800
They are now planning for

422
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,940
Sex

423
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,180
On the streets

424
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,240
In every major city

425
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,500
From coast to coast

426
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,140
Rock and roll

427
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,020
Rock and roll

428
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,400
She's mine

429
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,520
Bug, bug, bug, bug, bug, bug, bug, bug, bug, bug, bug, point

430
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,520
She's mine

431
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,640
Cums lurking off the Oregon coast.

432
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,360
With more on that, here's Cheryl.

433
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,680
We pick up more moisture, too, as we slide into eight inches of new cum.

434
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,740
Swirling and churning along Interstate 5 yesterday afternoon.

435
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,680
Also, too, notice these little puffies here.

436
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,760
I wouldn't be surprised to see a few more propping up later

437
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,280
as that moist cum continues to pour into your butt.

438
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,380
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

439
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,680
Scattered cum showers remain in the forecast,

440
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,000
along with cloudy cum scattered about Seattle, Olympia, and Tacoma, Washington.

441
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,220
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

442
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,100
I've been convicted of wanton sexual encounters.

443
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,380
Connie?

444
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,540
Now, who was that?

445
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,120
You're in big trouble now.

446
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,740
Was that Lenny Bruce?

447
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,120
You've got a lot of splatting to do.

448
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,360
That's the Queen of England, isn't it?

449
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,440
Queen Connie Dobbs.

450
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,520
Her Majesty Queen.

451
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,080
Dissexed.

452
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,940
Feel ill.

453
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,860
That's exactly it.

454
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,600
Because you're getting...

455
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,680
She does not wish to be dissexed.

456
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,240
She has childbearing hips.

457
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,480
You ever notice that about Regina Vaginas, whatever her name is, Ruthless Betty?

458
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,560
What's her name?

459
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,600
They live forever.

460
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,380
A horrible thing.

461
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,500
The Queen's a royal stew.

462
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,140
I'm cured.

463
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,360
Well, the Queen Mother lived to be 9,000 years in Methuselah years.

464
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,260
Different frog years.

465
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,680
Of course, they hate frogs.

466
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,840
Lesson one.

467
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,080
Grr.

468
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,460
Lesson two.

469
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,440
Grr.

470
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,000
Lesson three.

471
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,060
Grr.

472
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:25,620
Grr.

473
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,760
也很漂亮。

474
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,360
请进。

475
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,680
Check it out, check it out.

476
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,900
This is a real, real ghost shirt.

477
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,180
Made famous by the ghost dancers.

478
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,660
啊!

479
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,680
啊!

480
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,060
啊!

481
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,520
nekano.

482
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,840
Have a good day.

483
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,480
Have a good day.

484
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,800
阿 ramen.

485
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
Hot reason why.

486
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,420
Friday night .

487
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,360
Who's rising again?

488
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,940
死牛 .

489
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,160
Yeah.

490
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,160
сх。

491
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,700
胶卷。

492
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,100
Ah!

493
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:02,920
Yeah.

494
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,540
Ah!

495
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:03,760
The rabbit.

496
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,800
Psychotronic Babel.

497
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,120
Nothing a Psychotronic Babel.

498
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,900
As if to wake the sleeping eruptions around the town.

499
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,420
You have been convict.

500
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:17,800
Uh.

501
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,200
of wanton sexual encounters.

502
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,940
Do you know what that means?

503
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,880
I've been wanting some sexual encounters.

504
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,740
And wanton?

505
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,480
I've been wanting one for a long time.

506
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:35,140
And still, my people have yet to come.

507
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,780
Come, come, come, come.

508
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,960
Come, come, come, come.

509
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,020
Our newborn king to come.

510
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,880
Come, come, come, come.

511
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,740
Our finest gifts we bring, come.

512
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,000
To lay the king, come.

513
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,620
Come, come, come, come.

514
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,640
So to lay him, come.

515
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,000
When we come.

516
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,080
On my bum.

517
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,140
Me and my drum.

518
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,640
The King's

519
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:53,700
The King's

520
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:53,780
The King's

521
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,040
The King's

522
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,520
53 years old?

523
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,120
Oh, now I'll need a fake ID to rent ultra porn.

524
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,040
And the Lord Jesus Christ quoting that verse.

525
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,480
Fags and dykes.

526
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:12,880
That jackass behind that black robe is a genuine hero that lives in god awful killing machines.

527
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,640
There's some little thing wrong in a piece of that equipment.

528
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

529
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,780
Some little thing.

530
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:17,980
Something wrong.

531
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,200
God did it!

532
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,220
Spitting in the face of God, the only real important enemy.

533
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,740
The vicar of Christ!

534
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,900
Evangelizing the world with the wonders of fagdom.

535
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,620
Come on!

536
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,200
The evidence is overwhelming.

537
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,860
It is not right.

538
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,320
And it's all one way.

539
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,040
God hates fags and God hates dykes and God hates Melissa Etheridge.

540
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,840
It is not right.

541
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,700
God hates this evil god forsaken town.

542
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,400
Slam that mother and grandmother.

543
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,300
Fag propagandists.

544
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,560
Makes America killing machines.

545
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,280
That would allow itself to be famous for one thing.

546
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,620
It's Sappho of Lesbos time.

547
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:02,900
Mother and grandmother sitting around up there in that space station sending emails to their friends and in an instant of time.

548
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,420
Yeah.

549
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,200
This god awful fag nation of ours.

550
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
But a militant fag.

551
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,920
An aggressive fag.

552
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,020
A pushy fag.

553
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,780
Evangelical fag.

554
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,020
That idiot Bush is talking about praying for these cybolical.

555
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,600
Christ inmates of hell.

556
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,360
Fag.

557
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,180
Name Steve.

558
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,260
Steve.

559
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,580
Praying for them.

560
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,340
Yeah.

561
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,160
God almighty killed them and cast them into hell.

562
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,800
Italicized and underlined and if we could put it in neon lights.

563
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,520
Fags and dykes.

564
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,560
Your preaching is a lie.

565
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,620
Come on!

566
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,100
The doctrine that we deliver.

567
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,700
Lord.

568
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,860
Slam that space shuttle to the ground in little fragments as it relates to the killing machine.

569
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,680
That fag pimp Bush.

570
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,520
Sitting around.

571
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,140
Ready to push the buttons.

572
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:53,600
And the San Francisco Chronicle just published technological killing machines.

573
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,380
You see that streak going across the sky.

574
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,780
It is not right.

575
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,260
Kill them all at once.

576
00:24:59,340 --> 00:24:59,680
Lord.

577
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,160
Punch one button.

578
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,660
Honor.

579
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,040
This is our report.

580
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,460
This is our report.

581
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,880
This is our report.

582
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:14,120
This is our report.

583
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,220
Mmm.

584
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:22,020
Hm. Well, a smart workman would cut that nut off with a hammer and a greasy chisel, so it would slip, like this.

585
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,380
Amazing!

586
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:40,540
Um, the S word, oh shit, that's Old English. It appears in Old English, but it's not common, and there it just seems to refer to diarrhea.

587
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:52,480
Those are my rapist noises. You see, it sounds like I'm just whistling a tuneless whistle, but the

588
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,060
really means

589
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,320
that's the sound of the sperm coming out when a guy's raping a chick.

590
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,980
Now, you're gonna be subjected to a song that I made up.

591
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:26,320
Horny with a chick, horny with a chick, horny, horny, horny horn, horny with a chick.

592
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,680
I'm too sick to get the horn of those horns.

593
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:42,700
Horny with a chick, horny with a chick, horny, horny, horny horn, horny with a chick,

594
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,080
Horny with two chicks.

595
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,480
Horny with two chicks.

596
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,360
Horny, horny, horny, horn.

597
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,800
Horny with two chicks.

598
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
I am too sick

599
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,780
to get a horn?

600
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,520
With two chicks.

601
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,620
With two chicks.

602
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:12,140
With two chicks.

603
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,120
I'm gonna be a horny in my socks.

604
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,320
Horny in my socks.

605
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,440
Horny, a horny, horny horn.

606
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,780
Horny in my socks.

607
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,240
I'm gonna force you into bed with me.

608
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,120
Horny with two dykes.

609
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,380
Horny with two dykes.

610
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,320
Horny, horny, horny horn.

611
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,720
Horny with two dykes.

612
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:21,320
I'm too spiked, to get a horny with two dykes.

613
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,540
Horny with two dykes.

614
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,340
Horny, a horny, horny horn.

615
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,900
Horny with two dykes.

616
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,760
Horny with two punc one P's.

617
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,840
Horny with two punc one P's.

618
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,260
Horny, oh horny, horny horn.

619
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,060
Horny, oh with two punk chicks.

620
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,880
Horny with a pregnant chick on roller skates.

621
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,080
Horny with a pregnant chick on roller skates.

622
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,440
Horny, oh horny, horny horn.

623
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,680
Horny with a pregnant chick on roller skates.

624
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,240
How do you get horny in your socks, you wonder?

625
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,020
Well, maybe I'll just have to demonstrate to all of you someday.

626
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,160
See, this one time I had an itch in my foot inside my socks,

627
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,500
and that's how I came up with the idea of horny in your socks.

628
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,740
I eat lots of horny with a chick food.

629
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,840
It gives me energy to get horny with a chick on.

630
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:28,980
Always be careful what you drink and how you mix your drinks,

631
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,900
because if you're not careful,

632
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,900
you'll throw up all of your horny with a chick food.

633
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,000
Horny with a chick food.

634
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,580
And then you won't have energy to get horny with a chick on.

635
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,980
Joe Offrecht, the great Joe Offrecht,

636
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,380
with his song Horny with a Chick,

637
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,500
thanks to the Temple of Dionysus Sabazio.

638
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,220
And now a song by Reload.

639
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,780
Actually, it's one of the guys in the punk group.

640
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:00,700
And it's a song originally by Devoe called I Need a Chick.

641
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,080
And it's a song that I wrote for my band.

642
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,080


643
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,080


644
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,080


645
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,780
I need a chick.

646
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,740
I need a chick.

647
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,700
I need a chick.

648
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,520
Well, I need a chick.

649
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,200
I need a chick to suck my dick

650
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,100
I need a dog to lift my hog

651
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,860
I need a cat to stroke my back

652
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,560
Well, I need a chick to suck my dick

653
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,400
I've been poopin' and shittin' and dyin'

654
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,960
I'm thirsty, ain't got no feel to plow

655
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,660
No hole for my pole, I fuck a pink store

656
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,640
I need a chick to suck my dick

657
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,620
I need a dog to lift my hog

658
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,420
I need a cat to stroke my back

659
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,920
Well, I need a chick to suck my dick

660
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,440
Gonna find her, gonna find her

661
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,360
Gonna get down on my knees and eat her

662
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,240
Cause she's the move

663
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,840
Yeah

664
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,200
Cause she's the move

665
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,200
Cause she's the move

666
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,980
Well, she's the move

667
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,920
I need a woman who understands

668
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,300
There's nothing more spiritual than dog-style love

669
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,180
There's nothing more spiritual than dog-style love

670
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,540
I need a chick

671
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,600
I need a dog

672
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,400
I need a cat

673
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,400
I need a cat

674
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:05,400


675
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,780
Well, I need a chick to suck my dick

676
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,600
I need a dog to lift my hog

677
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,460
I need a cat to stroke my back

678
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,480
Well, I need a chick to suck my dick

679
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,340
I need a chick to suck my dick

680
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,100
Well, I need a chick to suck my dick

681
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,220
I need a chick to suck my dick

682
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,020
Wow!

683
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,020
I need a chick to suck my dick

684
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,000
I need a chick to suck my dick

685
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,900
Well, I need a chick to suck my dick

686
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,900
I need a chick to suck my dick

687
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:56,380
I want that thick white hot cum on my face right after it comes out of my ass, baby.

688
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:56,460
Baby.

689
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,840
God knew that when he did will to create a new little soul inside the mother...

690
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,200
Uh-huh.

691
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,100
...is essential in all sex instructions.

692
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,140
Mmm, yum.

693
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,360
Get your fingers out of my...

694
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,540
Oh, your breast's beginning to grow.

695
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,760
Oh, I hug you a pat on your...

696
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,120
Oh, no.

697
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,920
So wonderfully has God designed our bodies.

698
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,360
Uh-huh.

699
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,100
Oh.

700
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,660
That's wonderful, isn't it, mother?

701
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:24,940
Oh.

702
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,180
Flows out again.

703
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:26,740
Through the vagina.

704
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,840
Mmm, yum.

705
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,880
What's it worth to you?

706
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,320
Uh-huh.

707
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,420
It's a perfectly natural bodily function.

708
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:41,160
And a holy one, really, when you consider that it's part of God's wonderful plan for creating new little souls in his own image.

709
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:41,700
Oh.

710
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,700
This is a natural thing.

711
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,680
A holy thing.

712
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,740
Oh, baby.

713
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:51,200
God is preparing your body for the wonderful calling of motherhood.

714
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:51,740
Uh-huh.

715
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,000
Use the slipper on you first.

716
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,200
How about licking the bowl?

717
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,520
Uh-huh.

718
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,420
Uh-huh.

719
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,260
God planted the little seeds inside old Bess's tummy, and they grow into puppies.

720
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,760
Oh.

721
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,280
Oh.

722
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,100
Bess has a tiny opening in her body, and it stretches open so the puppies can come through.

723
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,500
Oh, gee willikers.

724
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,500
Oh, golly.

725
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:16,920
Oh, ew.

726
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,000
Oh, golly.

727
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,240
Oh, golly.

728
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,380
Oh, gee willikers.

729
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:21,880
I...

730
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,620
Well, mothers have a little opening between their legs.

731
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,640
Yeah, that's right.

732
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,580
You mean, Mommy has a hole in her body?

733
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:28,800
Gee.

734
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:35,320
Uh, Sex Education by I.M.B.J.R.

735
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:42,140
And now, some cut-ups by his fellow Britisher, Reverend Chartot.

736
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,860
She's at who?

737
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,380
Mother.

738
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,320
Since this morning.

739
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:45,960
Have you seen her?

740
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,080
If I'm supposed to make a fuss and kiss her hairy cheek, I won't.

741
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,780
What do you kiss, little prince?

742
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,340
Where's Henry?

743
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,240
Upstairs with a family whore?

744
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:55,760
Not yet.

745
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,940
Let's hope he's grown up like his father, Simon Pure, and sex in history.

746
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,860
Tell me, what's Philip like?

747
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,240
I hear he's quite impressive for a boy of seventeen.

748
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,180
My lord!

749
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,180
And you are impressive.

750
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,320
I'm Eleanor, who might have been your mother.

751
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:10,800
Impressive.

752
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,580
Your grievances, if we have understood them, have to do with Princess Alice and her behind.

753
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,720
You see my problem?

754
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,360
Clearly.

755
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,660
But it's yours, not mine.

756
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:18,960
Authority.

757
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,720
It's got my troop ass on purple cushions.

758
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,680
It's all over it.

759
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,520
That makes it mine.

760
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,760
Now hear me, boy.

761
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,780
Suit gum.

762
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,400
She has some surgeons looking for a lump.

763
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,720
We'll state the station like two sursays.

764
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,240
Does your suit gum naturalization like two sursays?

765
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,640
I'll wash my gills and your suit gum through the holidays until I win.

766
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,620
Why will I?

767
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,720
Out of duty, dear.

768
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,120
Impressive sex.

769
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,560
You're better at this than I thought you'd be.

770
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,700
Stop looking in my eye!

771
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,680
And then it pops out.

772
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,700
No, but they're just gelatinous balls of jello.

773
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,600
What are actually, what are eyes other than mucilaginous spheres?

774
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:54,640
Modified.

775
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,520
They're just booger glands.

776
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,100
Eyes are pretty amazing things.

777
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,680
I'm fine with just having to accidentally have lenses on them and have them there.

778
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,940
There might be a guy or something.

779
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:05,620
Eyes are, I remember when I studied eyes in biology class or something.

780
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,280
I just remember being just completely amazed at how amazing they are.

781
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,420
They are really amazing.

782
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,280
There actually is an eye expert here.

783
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,760
Yes, my father was an optometrist.

784
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,640
Oh, I thought you said he was an eyeball.

785
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:22,640
Turn reality into like, you know, chemicals.

786
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,600
And then your brain does things.

787
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,740
Yeah, a photon dance.

788
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,700
How do you know it's reality?

789
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,980
I don't even know you're really seeing anything.

790
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,200
That's the truth.

791
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:30,740
What is reality?

792
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,420
Well, the convex part of our eye blot.

793
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,120
It's all a big joke.

794
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,420
Take the red pill or take the blue pill.

795
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,720
Yeah, they're both upside down.

796
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,600
I could show you what reality is if I had a...

797
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,460
A plunger?

798
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,220
A two by four.

799
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,840
I'd whack you up in the back of the head with it when you got a plunger.

800
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,780
I thought you were going to say a plunger.

801
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,340
I haven't done that.

802
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,960
Oh my God!

803
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,140
Was, was he just masturbating?

804
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,280
Yes.

805
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,580
Oh, my God.

806
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:54,580


807
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:54,580


808
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:54,580


809
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:54,940
Oh, my.

810
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,540
Did we, did we rub his nose in it?

811
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,440
I was horny up against a chick when I went to see Ozzy Osbourne.

812
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,860
I'm just kidding.

813
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:12,020
But I was horny up against a chick when I went to see a punk rock band called The Accused.

814
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:23,640
I, I positioned myself in a big crowd up against her, got close to where she was, positioned my leg up against hers.

815
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,100
She turned around and looked at me once but didn't really pay attention.

816
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,300
I think it was much of anything.

817
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,200
But then I went and told a couple guys that knew who she was.

818
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,160
I was horny up against her.

819
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:42,380
And it must have gotten back at her because one day when I was walking around at the mall, she gave me a funny look.

820
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,240
Horny with two smother me chicks.

821
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,740
What's a smother me chick?

822
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,080
They smother my dick with pussy juices.

823
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,820
When I fork them.

824
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,260
I'm a squeaky voice.

825
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,220
Perfect.

826
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,700
Dang me, dang me.

827
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,060
They ought to take the rope and hang me.

828
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,360
High from the highest.

829
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,000
Woman, would you wait for me?

830
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:17,300
And I was strumming the air guitar by strumming my cock as I did that.

831
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,680
People should fear me because...

832
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,340
I got a big cock.

833
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,700
Wait upon him.

834
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,300
Lead him to my bar.

835
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,360
Oh.

836
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:31,560
Oh.

837
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:38,880
Feed him with their waxen thighs and piece of cobweb morph.

838
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,980
And I.

839
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,440
And I.

840
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:40,960
And I.

841
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,600
Boxer.

842
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,760
If it's to make an ass of me.

843
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,760
To fright me.

844
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,580
If they could.

845
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,380
Oh.

846
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:50,760
Oh.

847
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:51,640


848
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,280
Oh.

849
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:52,800
Oh.

850
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,440
To swear.

851
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,360
I love them.

852
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,060
Methinks mistress.

853
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,880
You should have little reason for that.

854
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:11,760
These beautiful four by nineteen flags come all the way from Radio City, California or

855
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,700
they're made by the organizations there.

856
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:19,380
Many organizations have put in almost everything they've got about precious bodily fluids,

857
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:27,200
pieces of hair, old strings of wax, and believe me, they made the kids awfully happy tonight

858
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,520
with this wonderful, wonderful emission.

859
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,380
Look, look, look right here.

860
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,720
It's creamy and only one of them is melting right there.

861
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,440
The other one is standing so firmly.

862
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,380
That's the one with the flags.

863
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,860
These beautiful blue-white, red-white, red-white...

864
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:48,140
And look at those cheerleaders go by with those bugle-encrusted broomsticks wedged firmly up their nether regions.

865
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,700
The latest fad is...

866
00:39:49,700 --> 00:40:00,920
Bob prophesied the broomstick up the butt is supplanted of tattooing and savage primitivism and so forth.

867
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,020
Aren't they adorable?

868
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,700
We're glad you called us for masturbation.

869
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,220
Thank you.

870
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:12,380
If you don't spend all of your spare time alone masturbating, it may indicate a serious problem.

871
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:18,380
The problem, however, is lack of masturbation, even though we know that masturbation is physically harmful.

872
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,680
Masturbation is a form of masturbation.

873
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,280
Masturbation is touching and handling your sex organs in a way that creates hair on your palms or makes you sterile or weak.

874
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,160
Some figures show that a total male population masturbates with a total female population.

875
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,360
Many people have sexual thoughts about all sorts of things while they're masturbating.

876
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,180
Whatever these fantasies are, it's important to remember that things could mess up your head.

877
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:45,840
You'll probably hear a lot of scary things about masturbation from people who know the facts.

878
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,680
Remember the disgust.

879
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,300
Especially the part about hurting your school nurse.

880
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,460
If you'd like to masturbate your nurse practitioner, try putting warts into the end of the penis.

881
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,960
This is a dirty sexual urge.

882
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,660
We hope the information we've given you will help you get stuck in the vagina and have to be removed through a toilet paper tube.

883
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,460
Thank you for your extension.

884
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,740
Goodbye.

885
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,220
Hey, did you catch the Willie Nelson picnic?

886
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,660
Yeah, Bill Clinton was there.

887
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,520
And Willie said,

888
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,280
Hey Bill, we'll see you later up on the roof.

889
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,140
Ha ha ha ha.

890
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,020
What does that mean?

891
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,380
I laughed but I didn't know what it meant.

892
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:28,520
Because the first time Willie Nelson played the White House, him and Bill Clinton were getting high on the roof.

893
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,720
Oh my, is that true?

894
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,420
Absolutely.

895
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,340
Oh wow.

896
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,960
But Bill didn't inhale, did he?

897
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,260
He just kind of like put it between his butt cheeks and smiled.

898
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,380
Bill was blowing Willie's shotguns, man. What are you talking about?

899
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,440
Bill was blowing Willie on the White House roof.

900
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,320
Santa Claus went away and never returned to the White House ever again.

901
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,360
Well that better know W blowing Satan in the front porch.

902
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,920
Yeah, I mean the oval on the lawn or whatever.

903
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,960
Bill came out with his blue dress and threw it at Willie and said,

904
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Put this on, bitch.

905
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,020
Ha ha ha.

906
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,300
Ha ha ha.

907
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,680
Ha ha ha.

908
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,360
Ha ha ha.

909
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,280
Ha ha ha.

910
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,300
Ha ha ha.

911
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:07,940


912
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:08,500


913
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:08,760
Ha ha ha.

914
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,200
Ha ha ha.

915
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,320
Ha ha ha.

916
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,200
Ha ha ha.

917
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,760
Ha ha ha.

918
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,500
Ha ha ha.

919
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,600
Ha ha ha.

920
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,400
Ha ha ha.

921
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,800
Ha ha ha.

922
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,940
Ha ha ha ha.

923
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,520
That that was the fucking

924
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
no nun hon!

925
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:31,780
I've been specifyin' that

926
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:31,780


927
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:31,780


928
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:31,780


929
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:31,960
I'll get you,,oses!

930
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,560
Eurovision.

931
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,780
There's a poor missionary.

932
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,400
He saves fallen women from sins.

933
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,680
He'll save you a blot for five dollars.

934
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,680
My God, how the money rolls in.

935
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,960
Rolls in, rolls in.

936
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,360
My God, how the money rolls in.

937
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,080
Rolls in, rolls in.

938
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,540
Rolls in.

939
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,920
My God, how the money rolls in.

940
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,180
Now my grandma sells cheap prophylactics.

941
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,900
She punctures the head with a pen.

942
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,140
Cause grandpa gets rich from abortion.

943
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,460
My God, how the money rolls in.

944
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,660
Rolls in, rolls in.

945
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,100
My God, how the money rolls in.

946
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,740
Rolls in, rolls in.

947
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,220
Rolls in.

948
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,600
My God, how the money rolls in.

949
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,440
Now my uncle is whittling out candles

950
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,340
from wax that is specially soft.

951
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,760
He says that they'll come in real handy

952
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,980
if ever his business falls off.

953
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,100
Rolls in, rolls in.

954
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,520
My God, how the money rolls in.

955
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,140
Rolls in, rolls in.

956
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,640
Rolls in.

957
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,140
My God, how the money rolls in.

958
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,180
Rolls in, rolls in.

959
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,720
Rolls in, rolls in.

960
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,100
Teaching a parakeet sex instruction is fun.

961
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,560
But the old method took too much time and patience.

962
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,100
This record is specially designed to teach

963
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,140
any healthy normal parakeet sex instruction.

964
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,700
By using a scientific new method that is acknowledged to be far superior.

965
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:57,500
Because a carefully trained voice, specially chosen for excellence in clarity and diction.

966
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,380
Hello, baby.

967
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:07,720
Repeats over and over the same words, the same phrase, in a manner that most parakeets are most likely to imitate.

968
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:14,400
Always place your parakeet near enough so that he can plainly hear the inflection and sound of every word.

969
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:21,620
In this first recording, a little parakeet has just discovered that the neighbor's dog has given birth to a litter of puppies.

970
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:28,220
Out of this natural situation arises the first question usual in all sex instruction.

971
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,960
Hello, baby. Want a kiss?

972
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,420
Hello, baby. Want a kiss?

973
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,900
Hello, baby. Want a kiss?

974
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,860
Hello, baby. Want a kiss?

975
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:50,220
Hello, baby. Want a kiss?

976
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,560
New from Dobbs Cove. Tasty prairie squid spread.

977
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:59,120
Salted and unsalted varieties available on the East Coast only.

978
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,040
The radioactive cloud is now over Little Rock.

979
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,940
Crager shat piercingly.

980
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,840
Come on, let's go.

981
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,780
Poo, poo.

982
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,620
P-N-E. We can go.

983
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:22,900
Poo, poo.

984
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,420
Come on, let's go.

985
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,300
Poo, poo.

986
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:34,520
It's very easy, just poo, poo.

987
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:38,880
Poo, poo.

988
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,560
Poo, poo.

989
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,540
Let us go.

990
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,740
Poo, poo.

991
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,240
Poo, poo.

992
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,640
Poo, poo.

993
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,140
Let us go.

994
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,280
Poo, poo.

995
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,460
Poo, poo.

996
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,600
Poo, poo.

997
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:03,960
Poo, poo.

998
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:04,360
Poo, poo.

999
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,500
Poo, poo.

1000
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:13,100
Artemia Salina did that and the previous.

1001
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,380
The last time I saw her, I was in a coma.

1002
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,880
The parakeet pussy song.

1003
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,580
It prays Artemia.

1004
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:21,060


1005
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:21,060


1006
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,100
I have no new messages.

1007
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:28,880
Saved messages.

1008
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,740
Saturday, February 3rd, 9.09.

1009
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,460
Saturday, February 3rd, 9.09.

1010
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,240
Saturday, February 3rd, 9.09.

1011
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,400
You better fucking call me back on my cell phone.

1012
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,800
I'm done doing this thing with you, chasing you,

1013
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,140
I'm done doing this thing with you, chasing you,

1014
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,140
until the part where you exhaust me.

1015
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,360
Well, you have already.

1016
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,140
What the fuck are you doing?

1017
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,320
So you really want it to be over?

1018
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,720
Is that what you want?

1019
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,000
Are you gonna be a happy boy then?

1020
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,080
And I guess so.

1021
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,580
That's what you told me.

1022
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,260
So I guess I should just listen to that.

1023
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,740
Call me back, Mark.

1024
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,100
You better call me soon,

1025
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,840
cause I'm done chasing you.

1026
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,880
I can't express this to you enough.

1027
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,440
You know, sometimes,

1028
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,880
you only do this so many times,

1029
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,320
and then it just becomes fucking old,

1030
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,240
doesn't it?

1031
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:11,840


1032
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,500
...

1033
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:17,220
See, it's a fluid philosophy, friends,

1034
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,020
which is lucky, you know,

1035
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,140
I mean, you don't always want to be good.

1036
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:22,980
And, uh,

1037
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,080
we certainly don't know what the right

1038
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,200
thing is, and we're always learning new

1039
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,820
things about the church, like the

1040
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,040
sex Connie.

1041
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,020
Now, here in the

1042
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,180
subgenius, we all know about it,

1043
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,460
worship and fear Connie Dobbs,

1044
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,960
the primary

1045
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,700
wife of our primary

1046
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,780
wife, Bob.

1047
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,660
Uh, and, uh,

1048
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,240
but then suddenly somebody started talking about

1049
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,500
the sex Connie.

1050
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,920
I've never heard of the sex Connie, I thought Connie

1051
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,240
was sex! And now I hear there's a

1052
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,600
a sex Connie!

1053
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,680
This is like the, the,

1054
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,160
the essence of sex, this is a sexy

1055
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,180
version of the essence of sex, I guess they're

1056
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:01,640
talking about.

1057
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,140
Fade message.

1058
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,840
Saturday, February

1059
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,240
3rd, 9th, 15th,

1060
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:09,680
6pm.

1061
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,080
All I can say is, if you're out at a

1062
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,280
fucking bar, when I went

1063
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,040
to your house, drove

1064
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,960
by you, you saw me,

1065
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,540
and you just drove by me,

1066
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,920
and I called you to

1067
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,300
apologize, to tell you

1068
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,780
how much I meant to you,

1069
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,380
how much you meant to me,

1070
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,660
if you're at a fucking bar right now,

1071
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,600
I will never, ever

1072
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,380
forgive you, ever.

1073
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,020
Because if you could be having a good time,

1074
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,140
then you know what, fuck you, and, you

1075
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,140
know what, you're right, then I need

1076
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:41,740
to move on.

1077
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,840
But I hope you know what you're doing.

1078
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,140
Because I'm not fucking

1079
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,060
playing around anymore. You know,

1080
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,040
what do you think, the world is gonna fucking

1081
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,660
chase you forever, Mark?

1082
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,180
That, you know what, everybody's

1083
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,140
gonna fucking chase you because you're

1084
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,060
Mr. Wonderful? Yeah.

1085
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,300
Well you've got some flaws going on yourself,

1086
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,420
so you know what, when I call you and apologize,

1087
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,340
they call you a million times

1088
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,780
to tell you how much you mean to me,

1089
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,300
that should mean something, but obviously it doesn't,

1090
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,400
so you fucking have a good time

1091
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,220
out at a fucking bar, but I'll tell you what,

1092
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,320
if you're there, don't ever fucking

1093
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,100
call me again.

1094
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,300
Can we play this message?

1095
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,320
This next one is called

1096
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,200
the Kindergarten Orgasm

1097
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,960
Dance. In the

1098
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,940
kindergarten I had

1099
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,220
orgasms, back in the

1100
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,480
kinder I had orgasms,

1101
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,300
kindery in

1102
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,400
the kindery,

1103
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,120
back in the kinder I had

1104
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,400
orgasms.

1105
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,300
When I hear an imitation

1106
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,060
of a chick pissing herself,

1107
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,040
ooh my underwear,

1108
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,360
ooh my underwear,

1109
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,100
ooh my

1110
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,260
dress, ooh my

1111
00:50:59,260 --> 00:50:59,700
dress.

1112
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,860
Back when I was in elementary

1113
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,360
school, I really hated

1114
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,620
it when girls wore

1115
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,220
dresses because it would

1116
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,120
expose their sexy

1117
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,240
legs, and I would get so fucking

1118
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,800
horny I couldn't concentrate

1119
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,220
on my schoolwork, so

1120
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,380
I made up this little chant

1121
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,340
back then that I would always do under

1122
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,880
my br- under my br-

1123
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,680
They wear

1124
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,340
They wear dresses,

1125
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,880
stupid dresses,

1126
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,740
why

1127
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,500
do they wear stupid

1128
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:33,640
dresses?

1129
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,440
Sometimes I would disguise it in code form

1130
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,120
instead of saying, when dresses

1131
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,000
I would say, ah-ho-dees,

1132
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,320
they wear ah-ho-dees,

1133
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,320
stupid ah-ho-dees,

1134
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:46,920
why

1135
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,720
do they wear stupid

1136
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,780
ah-ho-dees?

1137
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,020
Dee-lee-lee-lee-pa-dee-le,

1138
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,540
in the

1139
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,540
johnnies,

1140
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,880
you know what I mean by the johnnies?

1141
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,100
The underwear.

1142
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,320
Maybe I should say

1143
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,180
about

1144
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,960
stage door johnnies,

1145
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,600
Dee-lee-lee-pa-dee-le,

1146
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,140
in the

1147
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,140
johnnies,

1148
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,800
Dee-lee-lee-pa-dee-le,

1149
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,400
in your

1150
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,440
johnnies,

1151
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,700
Dee-lee-lee-pa-dee-le,

1152
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,300
in your underwear,

1153
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,480
in your wear,

1154
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,080
in your wear, in your little

1155
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:27,700
underwear.

1156
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,720
I'd love to be able

1157
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,960
to go to a party where I can yell out,

1158
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,480
I want to hear some

1159
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,780
pervert music!

1160
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,840
So what I mean by pervert music,

1161
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,640
it doesn't have to be

1162
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:42,300
overtly

1163
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,240
pervert music, but

1164
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,560
it does have to,

1165
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,740
for no particular reason,

1166
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:51,900
psyche up

1167
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,860
to

1168
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,900
wanna do sexually perverted

1169
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,460
things to women

1170
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,620
and or girls.

1171
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,380
Like that song by the monkeys,

1172
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,920
I Saw Her Face, Now I'm a Believer,

1173
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,840
when I hear the beginning of it,

1174
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,940
it, ah,

1175
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,840
it psychs me up to wanna do

1176
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,420
kinky sexual things.

1177
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,120
You're in big trouble though, pal.

1178
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,820
I eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast.

1179
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,960
You eat pieces of shit

1180
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,640
for breakfast?

1181
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,100
No!

1182
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,480
Sage message, Saturday,

1183
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,520
February 3rd, 9,

1184
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,940
29, PM.

1185
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,300
Well, you won.

1186
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,720
Not only have you ruined my day, but you've ruined

1187
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,760
my night, because I'm too

1188
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,940
upset to even think about going out to bed.

1189
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,200
I'm gonna have fun.

1190
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,700
Fun? I wanna be with you, and

1191
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,240
I wanna be with someone who doesn't wanna be with me.

1192
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,740
So, yeah, that would be a real good time out

1193
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,320
tonight, huh?

1194
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,120
Anyway, I know that I gotta move on,

1195
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,340
and I'm going to, and mark my words,

1196
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,120
if I don't hear from you shortly,

1197
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,520
I'm moving on, because I'm not gonna play

1198
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,440
this game tomorrow. And I know I keep

1199
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,180
saying that, and I know I keep calling you back,

1200
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,700
but it's fucking draining, Mark, and I'm tired

1201
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,680
of it. And I've chased after you

1202
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,600
once again, all fucking

1203
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,680
day and all fucking night.

1204
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:07,980
So, you know what?

1205
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,560
Have fun with your fucking

1206
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,580
stubbornness, and you know what?

1207
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,820
I hope the next fucking woman that you date,

1208
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,320
or girl, maybe I should say,

1209
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,960
puts up with your stubbornness, because I can't

1210
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,580
deal with it. I've given you everything.

1211
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,600
I've said to you every

1212
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,660
possible thing that I could say. I basically

1213
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,900
came crawling back, even though, you know

1214
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,820
what? It's not only my fault. It's

1215
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,960
us. And, uh,

1216
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,740
you know what? You continue to fucking

1217
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,880
torture me, and, uh, I just

1218
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,580
hope that you're really having a good time.

1219
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,380
And I know you're probably not, so

1220
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,860
whatever. I hope you got what

1221
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,920
you wanted from all this, because, uh,

1222
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,520
it's just fucking sad. So,

1223
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,380
um, I'm moving on.

1224
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,920
I'm going to bed, and I am

1225
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,760
certainly moving on tomorrow morning.

1226
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,160
Goodbye.

1227
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,460
You're just a good man,

1228
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:08,960
so,

1229
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:10,700
um,

1230
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,480
you beat me,

1231
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,300
I swear to God.

1232
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,680
Uh...

1233
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,480
Um...

1234
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:16,480


1235
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,860
Oh, baby.

1236
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:08,320
Why don't you follow me back to my hotel room?

1237
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,740
They got some pretty pictures on the wall I want to show you.

1238
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,480
Say you want another drink?

1239
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,600
Bartender, give me another colada of milk.

1240
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,780
That was what you wanted, wasn't it?

1241
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,240
Huh!

1242
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,920
Why the hell am I talking when my tape deck ain't running?

1243
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:41,920
That's what I keep asking myself every night before I go to bed.

1244
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,320
Some things in life are a bummer, baby.

1245
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,080
But you're a beautiful thing.

1246
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:57,460
Oh, baby.

1247
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:11,120
What can I do for you?

1248
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:23,540
What have you got there to say to that guy?

1249
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,940
The poor service boy couldn't do that.

1250
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,060
The company man wouldn't accept the service.

1251
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:27,440
Ap concealment?

1252
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:27,440


1253
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:27,440


1254
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:33,480
I can see it

1255
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,200
It's back in line

1256
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:41,000
Bang, bang, bang

1257
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:46,680
Bang, bang, bang

Bang, bang, bang

1260
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,720
I've got a dick made of steel

1261
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,120
Got a plate of grass

1262
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,240
I get all dressed

1263
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,960
It's back in line

1264
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,560
Bang, bang, bang

00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,960
Bang, bang, bang

Bang, bang, bang

Bang, bang, bang

00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,920
Well, I'm going to tell you

00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,320
I'm a soldier

1275
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,640
I'm on a land too

1276
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,420
And you say to me

1277
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,240
Boy, you're cheap

00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,320
Well, you don't cut me any slack

1279
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,900

00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:06,580
And you've got法

1281
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,860
All of it

1282
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:08,940
That f년

1283
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,060
All of it

1284
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:13,200
And you know me

1285
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:13,960
Well you're cheap

00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:13,960


1288
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:13,960


1289
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:13,960


1290
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:13,980
Young and poor

1291
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:13,980


1292
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:14,880
Big lady steel

1293
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,160
I've got some bad friends

1294
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,540
I get hunger

1295
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,040
I eat the grass

1296
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,420
I eat the grass

1297
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:20,100
I eat the grass

1298
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:50,500
I eat the grass

1299
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:19,700
I eat the grass

1300
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,240
I drink some wine

1301
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,240
With ice and spirit

1302
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,200
I saw a dick

1303
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,220
Made of steel

1304
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:37,140
I got the brat

1305
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,380
Now I get hungry

1306
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,080
I eat the grass

1307
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,280
I eat the grass

1308
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,380
I eat the grass

1309
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,660
I eat the grass

1310
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:13,700
I eat the grass

1311
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:50,520
I eat the grass

1312
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,180
I eat the grass

1313
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,020
And I eat the grass

1314
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,240
On the override

1315
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,700
I'm so hungry

1316
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,280
I eat the grass

1317
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,320
I eat the grass

1318
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:07,020
And I eat the grass

1319
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:07,080
I eat the grass

1320
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,780
I eat the grass

1321
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:10,940
I eat the grass

1322
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:10,940


1323
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:13,600
I drink the grass

1324
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:28,180
The Swingin' Love Corpses once again.

1325
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:34,360
And a special thanks to Einstein's Secret Orchestra, Swamp Radio, and WCSB.

1326
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:37,180
Whence come the live radio clips?

1327
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,780
Ah, yes.

1328
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:42,980
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Hour of Slack,

1329
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:44,920
the XXX-rated show number six.

1335
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:13,760
Ah, yes.

1336
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:22,400
Once again, that's Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1337
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:26,380
44118.

1338
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,060
Don't be afraid.

1339
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,080
Bob loves you.

1340
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,340
Everything's going to be just fine, really.

1341
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:45,480
Just come with me, and I'll tell you all about it.

1342
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:48,580
And Bob...

1343
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,440
Chateau Aubrillon, 1959.

1344
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,320
Magnificent wine.

1345
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,460
I love French wine.

1346
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:05,980
In fact, I love the French language.

1347
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:07,740
I have sampled every language.

1348
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,760
French is my...

1349
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:08,980
My favorite.

1350
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:09,820
Fantastic language.

1351
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,920
Especially to curse with...

1352
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,580
Nom de Dieu, de putain de bordel, de merde, de saloperie, de connard, d'enculé de ta mère.

1353
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:17,120
You see, it's...

1354
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,200
It's like wiping your ass with silk.

1355
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:21,020
I love it.

1356
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:26,520
Page message.

1357
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:31,360
Wednesday, February 7th, 9.34 p.m.

1358
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,560
I'm going...

1359
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,360
I'm going to the hospital because I...

1360
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:37,920
I...

1361
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:38,100
I...

1362
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,260
I'm going to the hospital.

1363
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,460
You don't fucking care.

1364
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,080
You got a fucking blue appointment.

1365
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,540
I hope you're fucking happy.

1366
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,020
I'm...

1368
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:05,400
Why do you say you feel trapped in a man's body?

1369
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,740
Well, sometimes I get the menstrual cramps.

1370
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,900
Real hard.

1371
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:10,960
That's correct.

1372
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,360
Don't get too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.

1373
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,260
But the new stage at X-Day is cool.

1374
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:20,280
I moved in with my 43-year-old Bible.

1375
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,920
The tranquility-based stage is cool.

1376
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,680
It's not a technological terror.

1377
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:27,260
But by the time I had learned to feed it what it needed,

1378
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:36,200
my own needs had grown to the point where I could see in its little head...

1379
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,780
Well, that's not a little head.

1380
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:37,980
A...

1381
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:38,360

1382
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:38,420

1386

1387
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:41,960
A...

1388
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,020
A...

01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020

1392
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1393
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1394
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1395
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1396
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020

01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020

01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1401
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1402
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1403
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1404
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1405
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1406
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1407
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1408
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1409
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1410
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1411
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1412
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1413
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1414
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,020


1415
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:45,080
I could see somewhere a glimmering of intelligence.

1416
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:51,640
That's not a boa constrictor, and would you please let go of it.

1417
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,120
I'm trying to pass water through it, sir.

1418
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:01,020
Oh, that reminds me of a joke about Milton Berle, who had the largest member in show business.

1419
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,560
And Dick Shawn, you remember Dick Shawn?

1420
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,920
Oh, and Shawn and Dick.

1421
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,120
He said he went to the Schvitz one time.

1422
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:12,560
He went into the steam room and saw Milton Berle there and he thought he was with his son.

1423
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:19,940
I don't know.

1424
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,540
Maybe he was wearing lipstick or something.

1425
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,520
You know what they used to say about Uncle Milton?

1426
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:30,580
I heard that Jim Neighbors was the best.

1427
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:31,500
The best pact.

1428
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,020
He didn't have any children of his own.

1429
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:35,980
It was just kind of a clone thing.

1430
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:39,640
I don't know about that old character actor Arnold Stang.

1431
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,060
He was a rock packer, man.

1432
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:43,020
Arnold Stang, too?

1433
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,240
Is that why you took that name?

1434
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,260
Yeah, he was the Johnny Wad of his day.

1435
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,500
What about Rodney Dangerfield?

1436
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:49,440
What's his name?

1437
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:54,100
Oh, you know, he was in all those B-horror movies.

1438
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:54,980
Reagan.

1439
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:55,640
No.

1440
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,880
Yeah, he did some B-horror movies.

1441
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,880
Reagan was castrated back before 1980.

1442
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:03,280
We're talking about the meat.

1443
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:04,980
The meat men of the B-horror movies.

1444
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,960
The meat men of the B-horror movies.

1445
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:06,160
The meat men of the B-horror movies.

1446
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,140
And Reagan was not known for that especially.

1447
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,900
Well, in many ways...

1448
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,420
He did some early porno when he was a communist.

1449
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:14,500
Until next week.

1450
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,180
And that's your man on time.

1451
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,720
You're back to the winning of the sack and the saddle.

1452
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,840
Take care, folks.

1453
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:23,460
Well, kids.

1454
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:28,000
Poor old commies out there having to do porno films for a living.

1455
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
To music like this.

1456
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:44,980
Happy new year.

1457
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:50,320
Although we're staying alive.

1458
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:50,620
It's a time like any of this.

1459
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:50,760
Wait.

1460
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,220
It's diciendo la muerte.

1461
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:55,880
With Obsec downtown this way.

1462
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:58,340
B- forehead standing and the right.

1463
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:58,340


1464
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,220
