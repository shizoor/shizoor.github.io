1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
This is the hour of slack.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,460
Born and raised.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,100
Upper West Side, which is born and raised.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,820
The home of bop.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,760
I understand, no I don't.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,000
I understand, no I don't.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,160
Remember bop, no one says it.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,820
No one says bop anymore.

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,540
I don't hear that bop, you see.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,080
That's old timey street talk.

11
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,940
Now are you, I'm curious, this is a...

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,260
Sometimes it hurts to say.

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,740
Sometimes it hurts to love.

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,520
But sometimes it hurts to say.

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,800
I don't care who you are, when you lose me.

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,080
I don't care who you are, when you lose me.

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,300
But sometimes it hurts to say.

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,120
Sometimes it hurts to say.

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,020
He's so funny and good at what he does.

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,040
Yeah, he is really good.

21
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,620
Performing a tribute to Bob.

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,620
I got mad at Bob.

23
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,000
Hey Bob.

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,260
Hey Bob.

25
00:00:59,260 --> 00:00:59,260


26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,820
Hey Bob.

27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,600
Hey Bob.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,480
Hey Bob.

29
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,480


30
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,480


31
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,480


32
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,480


33
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,480


34
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,480


35
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,480


36
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,480


37
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,480


38
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,480


39
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,480


40
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,480


41
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,480


42
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,480


43
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,480


44
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,140
Yes, I'm close to the hole.

45
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:08,920
Let's do this together.

46
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,300
There we go.

47
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,240
You're coming with me?

48
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,920
Hey, Mr. Beatles man, do you want some drugs?

49
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,900
No thanks, Bob.

50
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,860
We're clean living.

51
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,980
Yeah, drugs make you go potty and like Indian things.

52
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,540
Yeah, like the Kama Sutra.

53
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,300
That's rude.

54
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,980
Look, you even got a head bob for Melissa. That was really good.

55
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,420
Look, you even got a head bob for Melissa. That was really good.

56
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,300
Hey, give her some of that.

57
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:30,980
Still love a bob.

58
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,680
The head I need.

59
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,960
If we have too much slack, I'm just gonna fall down and break my neck.

60
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,300
We need tension, so it's gonna allow me to, like, actually pendulum.

61
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,760
I just made sure that we have a knife on this balloon,

62
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,300
because if you go swinging and you start taking us down,

63
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,560
we're... I'm cutting you loose, and we're saving ourselves.

64
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,260
Yes.

65
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,740
Oh, here we go.

66
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,680
I'm close to the hole.

67
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,480
Let's do this together.

68
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,880
There we go.

69
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,140
How'd it go? Did I get it?

70
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,900
I've been practicing all the ways I can die.

71
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,160
This reeks of bob.

72
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,560
This has nothing to do with my talent

73
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,640
and everything to do with his broken dreams in his head.

74
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,240
That's classy, Bob.

75
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,240
Hello Aunt Bob's is today the day?

76
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,760
What is going on?

77
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,980
Why do you want our of Bob?

78
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,000
A hot hello, 7-ger-ger-ker-nevus-colic.

79
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,820
I get it, Bob.

80
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,820
This next award's also for best impression of a celebrity,

81
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,780
and it goes to the person in seat 7J for their impression of Bob.

82
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,720
Ooh, we can do the song.

83
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,980
Alright, damn this love is skin tight.

84
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,360
Baby, come on.

85
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,500
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

86
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,640
Throw me like a bass drum.

87
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,220
Second number rhythm.

88
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,760
Baby, come on.

89
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,980
This Friday night, oh, oh, oh.

90
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,640
This Friday night, oh, oh, oh.

91
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,500
This Friday night, oh, oh, oh.

92
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,400
This Friday night.

93
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,640
We were streaking in the park, skinny dipping in the dark,

94
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,840
and had all the magic twirling Friday night.

95
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:58,960
Friday night.

96
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,100
We were streaking in the park, skinny dipping in the dark,

97
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,100


98
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,320
Wow.

99
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:07,860
Very.

100
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,000
Wow.

101
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,780
That is good.

102
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,860
That is really good.

103
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,380
Congratulations.

104
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,180
Yeah.

105
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,420
Yeah, that's right.

106
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,320
High five him.

107
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,560
Yeah.

108
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,760
High five a guy when he looks like Bob.

109
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:32,620
Bob.

110
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,220
Oh, well, thank you.

111
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,140
You're welcome.

112
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,840
I had to kill Bob because he made him.

113
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,360
Mistake.

114
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,640
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

115
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,400
I'm cashing you out, Bob.

116
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,820
And you need lots of stimulation, Bobby.

117
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,840
Bobby.

118
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,920
Yes, I do.

119
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,400
Don't move.

120
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,120
I won't.

121
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,580
Congratulations, Bob.

122
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,500
Thanks.

123
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,080
I remember when I was a young executive for this company.

124
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,660
Hey, hey, Bobby boy, vice president.

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,400
Congratulations.

126
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,060
Handball Tuesday night?

127
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,580
Bill, I'd love to, but I got a date.

128
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,860
A couple models come to my place.

129
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,200
Know what I mean?

130
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,760
I'd buy that for a dollar.

131
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,360
Bob, I needed that job.

132
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
So is Bob still a model?

133
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:47,840


134
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:47,840


135
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:47,840


136
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,940
Or is he simply chosen to obsessively memorize his entire life?

137
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,180
Not everyone is convinced.

138
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:00,040
People like Bob are a real phenomena with memories way, way beyond that of even the best minds.

139
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,200
Larger in people with super memory.

140
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,480
Could this somehow explain Bob's gift?

141
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:14,520
Could this be proof that Bob and others with super memory have some form of time space synesthesia?

142
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,520
Does the ability to see time.

143
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,660
Explain Bob's near total recall?

144
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,920
Or is it because he has a slightly different brain than the rest of us?

145
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:32,140
Or are people with super memory such fans of their own lives they can't stand to forget a minute of it?

146
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,340
This is Bob.

147
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,220
Do you two know each other?

148
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,240
Well...

149
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,680
No.

150
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,160
I do recognize you.

151
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:40,860
No, you don't.

152
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,080
Sure I do.

153
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,600
From your book.

154
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,600
Your picture's on the back.

155
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,700
Ooh.

156
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,840
What happened to your face?

157
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,020
Oh, this.

158
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,120
Uh, it's...

159
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,200
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

160
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,140
Get down with my sickness.

161
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,680
Dr. Howell, you know I infected dozens of subgeniuses on the way south.

162
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:10,380
Although when I hit Texas, um, my, uh, another disease wiped my disease out.

163
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,480
The two canceled each other out?

164
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,380
Yeah, typhoid Ivan is no more.

165
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,320
I was patient zero of the church.

166
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:23,020
I went to a pagan Thanksgiving party and everyone there came away sick.

167
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,520
I brought it to West Virginia, then to North Carolina...

168
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,100
But why were you such a carrier of...

169
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,820
Atlanta...

170
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:30,860
...contagion...

171
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,020
Little Rock...

172
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,320
...a pilgrim of pestilence?

173
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,820
...of trauma?

174
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,580
Why?

175
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes, why?

176
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,640
Well, you gonna ask Bob why there's cold virus?

177
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,700
You're asking Bob why again?

178
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,020
You're gonna ask Bob why there's...

179
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,620
You're gonna set Reverend Stang off again.

180
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,180
Um...

181
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,460
I'm sorry, I wasn't of course going to ask Bob this question.

182
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,280
I had a cold. It's funny because I'd had a flu shot a week before.

183
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,300
And it just flew by.

184
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,680
It's not ironic, yeah.

185
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,600
Don't be setting Reverend Stang off. Don't you...

186
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,680
I won't. I know he, uh, would have to feed him and...

187
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,440
Don't you ask him about his brother who died in Vietnam or nothing.

188
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,340
You're doing it, Bob!

189
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,440
There you go. That's...

190
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,240
Don't you be asking him about his brother.

191
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,260
I shouldn't die!

192
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,160
Just put the, uh, coochie tunnels there behind you.

193
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,460
It should have been me!

194
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,020
Nom, nom, nom.

195
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,140
It should have been me!

196
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,320
There, there. It's all right, Joe.

197
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,640
You know, his brother got his deferment.

198
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,120
Give him 20 more cc's.

199
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,980
Yes, his brother was deferred, but, uh, not, uh, deterred, as we know.

200
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,060
Actually, my brother is a goat boy.

201
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,560
He used to be a cowboy, but we had a drought and had to sell the cows.

202
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,040
Still got a couple goats around the property, eh?

203
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,760
Oh, a lot of goats. They go...

204
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,900
But what about...

205
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,080
They really do. I've got to record them.

206
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,240
The milk.

207
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,360
The milk.

208
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,140
I'm gonna do it today.

209
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,180
Is it snowing in Texas?

210
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,640
I'm on a new campaign now to get to Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, to pay me $1,000.

211
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm not sure if that's the right word.

212
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000


213
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000


214
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000


215
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000


216
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000


217
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000


218
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000


219
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000


220
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000


221
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000


222
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000


223
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000


224
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,280
I'm not sure what it is.

225
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,280


226
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,280


227
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,280


228
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,280


229
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,280


230
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,600
And when we get to a state like this, we need the money to, you know, to come here every month.

231
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,500
Because every time we come here, they finally get rain.

232
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,280
And the time we don't come here, there is no rain in Texas.

233
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,580
I'm, I'm working on trying to get the documentation together that proves this.

234
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,640
because I think I can.

235
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,180
I've got my records,

236
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,860
and I combine them with the weather records,

237
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,880
it'll prove that we are able to herd water

238
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,580
down from Ohio to Texas

239
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,000
where it's desperately needed.

240
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,100
And in fact, it's been raining,

241
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,600
and we're about to get blizzards

242
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,560
in Arizona and New Mexico.

243
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,740
So this is all thanks to me,

244
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,160
and Rick Perry can quit praying and start paying.

245
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,800
I ask only $1 billion a year,

246
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,740
and I will drive from Ohio to Texas

247
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,880
and back every month

248
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,240
for $1 billion a year,

249
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,540
which is a tiny fraction of the amount of income

250
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,380
it would generate.

251
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,240
That's right.

252
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,460
You want a blowjob while I talk to you?

253
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,360
No.

254
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,240
I wasn't offering it personally.

255
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,140
Make your point.

256
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,560
My point is,

257
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,820
before a guilty verdict would get executed

258
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,540
on that cop,

259
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:28,640
I'm not a cop.

260
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:28,740
I'm not a cocksucker.

261
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,380
Three men would walk in that meat locker

262
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,260
where he's being held with bags over their heads

263
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,380
and cut his fucking throat.

264
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,740
And within half an hour,

265
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,300
that celestial's little pigs will be on their backs

266
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,500
with their hooves in the air

267
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,780
belching up human remains.

268
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,700
Are you saying you'd order that to be done?

269
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm saying...

270
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,640
I had a vision.

271
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,000
It had happened.

272
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,400
My second of the day.

273
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,960
First come when I was watching you

274
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,460
and them lawyers online this morning.

275
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,560
And then they began to slither.

276
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,880
And my sight like vipers.

277
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,420
This was not to puke.

278
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,460
I had to close my eyes.

279
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,000
The vision went on.

280
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,520
Got worse.

281
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,720
I saw the vipers in the big nest in Washington.

282
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,200
They were taking us in the camp.

283
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,620
Acting like we could set our own laws up,

284
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,220
our organizations.

285
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,100
And then I saw the big vipers decide to strangle

286
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,060
and swallow us up

287
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,100
and every fucking thing we gained here.

288
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,020
It was horrible.

289
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,400
How could we fucking avoid it?

290
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,020
How could we let the vipers in the big nest

291
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,560
know that we're not going to be able to do anything?

292
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,300
They know that we didn't want to cause any fucking trouble.

293
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,580
And that's when you had your second vision.

294
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,200
Yeah, the cutthroats and the pigs.

295
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,520
But who wants all that blood spilled, Judge, huh?

296
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,480
Isn't there a simpler way of not pissing off the big vipers?

297
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,000
How do you suppose the trial's going?

298
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,720
I don't know.

299
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,480
Should've took them into the territory.

300
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,820
Hang them here, they'll be opening a can of worms.

301
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,740
Guess it's all a can of worms.

302
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,360
Now you're talking.

303
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,200
Will you help me with the body?

304
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:13,800
I don't know what my body can do.

305
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,080
I ain't tough any more.

306
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,880
I temch legal speed

307
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,580
That refusing to get вижу

308
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,180
Hit the fight!

309
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,740
I've got a right to pick a little fight for Kenta

310
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,860
Anybody fights, any one of us

311
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,700
He's gonna fight with me

312
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,740
Without one to saddle up and run for Kenta

313
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,920
Any one of us, got your little fuzz

314
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,780
So you can count on me

315
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,820
One for four, four for one

316
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,360
This we guarantee

317
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,020
I've got a right to pick a little fight for Kenta

318
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,160
Anybody fights, any one of us

319
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,820
He's gonna fight with me

320
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,280
I've got a right to pick a little fight for Kenta

321
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,380
Anybody fights, any one of us

322
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,140
He's gonna fight with me

323
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,700
I've got a right to pick a fight

324
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,820
I've got a right to pick a fight

325
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,800
I'm ready for it, can't wait to go

326
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,580
All the mensniggas say I'm right

327
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:05,080
A war will be a war

328
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,660
And I know that I'll blow away

329
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,900
And win however it be

330
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,160
Ove's and hers

331
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,060
The long and the hard

332
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,900
I've got curly hair

333
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,000
You've got jlime buns

334
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,260
And tight deciries

335
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:18,260


336
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:18,360
Get your life together

337
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,480
with a lot of 快

338
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,280
A long and the hard

339
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,100
I've got great Datab öl

340
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,360
Trying to get my legs out

341
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,960
The Large.

342
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,920
Oh, by the way, dear listener,

343
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,540
did you know that Bob's birthday is the same as yours?

344
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,480
I could tell you some even weirder birthday coincidences,

345
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,980
but it would get us all in really deep trouble.

346
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,140
Not on this station.

347
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,660
Yeah, yeah.

348
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Oh, with Homeland Security.

349
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,700
Well, they are a different matter.

350
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,720
I stopped myself from mentioning them last time.

351
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,140
There's so much I could say that I can't.

352
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,740
Oh, there's some I could go on for hours.

353
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,800
It's better if you don't.

354
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,460
And the horrible thing is, some of it would be true.

355
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,580
The parts that you most thought were a joke,

356
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,640
that'd be the true part.

357
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:05,300
Life is so strange when you're working for Bob.

358
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,700
That's true.

359
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,040
Every day is a new adventure.

360
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,720
Every day makes me feel a little more normal,

361
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,180
is the funny thing about it.

362
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,800
Every day I see something so weird

363
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,280
or learn something so strange about a fellow biped

364
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,500
that it makes...

365
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,540
Each day I feel a little more normal by comparison.

366
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,160
Well, we are over the Terminator

367
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,920
and on the other side of midnight right now

368
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,900
in the overtime of Ask Dr. Hal.

369
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,720
In the studio with Dr. Philo Drummond

370
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,040
and Reverend Ivan Stang.

371
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,820
Leslie Sternberg, Alexander Moderator.

372
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
I'm Dr. Howland Owl.

373
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,380
This is the Ask Dr. Hal Show live on radio.

374
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,480
It's Alexander.

375
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,900
Alexander's all the way down.

376
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,820
All the way down to infinity, you mean?

377
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,680
Two days ago I was staying with an Alexandra.

378
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,520
Oh, really?

379
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,980
His son is named Alexander.

380
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,200
Well, he conquered the world, you know.

381
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,140
He's my nephew.

382
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,940
And then he wept because there were no more worlds to conquer.

383
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,420
He was only 33.

384
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,200
But see, for a subgenius,

385
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,480
there's an infinite number of worlds left to conquer

386
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,540
because once you've joined the church,

387
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,080
it's now $35,

388
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,260
$35.

389
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,160
By the way, God, the postage went up.

390
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,380
Just last week.

391
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,700
It took a bite.

392
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,780
Anyway, friends,

393
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,440
if you're a dues-paid subgenius,

394
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,420
prove you love Bob

395
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,920
by giving up to him

396
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,440
the most important thing in the world,

397
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:35,880
$35,

398
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,740
then you will have your choice of planets.

399
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,880
As many planets of your own design as you want.

400
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,180
You can have an all-chocolate planet.

401
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,460
You can have a planet that's half chocolate and half vanilla.

402
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,100
You can have a planet made of,

403
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,180
of, uh,

404
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,600
what did Mr. Sister say?

405
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,560
You can have a planet made of comic books.

406
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Mr. Sister said,

407
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,480
I think,

408
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,240
somebody said,

409
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,940
what do you really believe, Mr. Sister?

410
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,200
He said,

411
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,380
I believe I'd like to crawl across an ocean of titties on my belly.

412
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,260
Well, that was right out of an R. Crumb comic.

413
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,880
It is.

414
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,900
Well, that Mr. Sister,

415
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,820
I can't believe he'd steal like that.

416
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,400
Or was it an ocean of keisters?

417
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,500
I do remember.

418
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,060
It was an ocean of keisters.

419
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,740
All right.

420
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,580
Reagan Spallup had that song,

421
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,080
I'd go to heaven on a boat.

422
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,380
Bridge of asses.

423
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,780
But Mr. Sister probably didn't see that R. Crumb comic.

424
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,500
He wasn't a hipster.

425
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,960
Well, great minds run in the same crack,

426
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,020
wouldn't you say?

427
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,140
Keats, ocean of titties, ocean of keisters.

428
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,440
It's big round things.

429
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,560
Bridge of asses.

430
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,040
It's big round things.

431
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,440
It'll get a boy's attention.

432
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,760
And lots of girls, too.

433
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,800
Thankfully.

434
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,040
If I had a pipe,

435
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,480
I could just, like, work from over here.

436
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,620
I really like the...

437
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,480
A pipe?

438
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,040
The...

439
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,580
The roundness and the softness.

440
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,360
And the firmness and the fully...

441
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,840
Women's breasts.

442
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,420
I don't care about...

443
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,640
Just the roundness is the...

444
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,420
And the softness.

445
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,860
We're pre-programmed for that.

446
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,160
Those are like basic cues.

447
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,100
My DNA makes me want to...

448
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,220
Even women like them.

449
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,900
...make more DNA.

450
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,100
It's addictive.

451
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,820
It's not even a sexual thing.

452
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,280
I did, too.

453
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,680
I had kids, and they had kids.

454
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,140
Well, some of them did.

455
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,100
Just think, the only reason you're here

456
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,680
is because your parents were, like,

457
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,360
fooling around long enough to make you.

458
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,060
Those poor things.

459
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,360
They just were...

460
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,680
They weren't even serious about it.

461
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,400
They weren't even serious.

462
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,920
They were just fooling around one night.

463
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,400
Like, oh, no.

464
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,720
Darn.

465
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,440
We made it.

466
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,660
My father still has to get up there.

467
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,300
We made an Ivan.

468
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,220
We made an Ivan.

469
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,820
Well, Pat and I get along just fine

470
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,980
for about three weeks.

471
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,480
Before we start buttonheads, we're a bit alike.

472
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,800
But you...

473
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,460
Mammy Stang went aboard the saucers in 2004.

474
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,960
...your very own fucking spiel.

475
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,420
Dong, dong, dong, dong, dong.

476
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,700
So much blood.

477
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,200
And on the battlefields of the Brothers' War,

478
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,400
I saw more blood than this.

479
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,740
And asked then after the purpose,

480
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,040
and did not know.

481
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,080
And don't know the purpose now.

482
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
But know now to testify that,

483
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,900
not knowing,

484
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,840
but knowing,

485
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,460
I believe.

486
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,700
I believe.

487
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,040
Saint Paul tells us,

488
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,940
Saint Paul tells us,

489
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,840
by one spirit are we all baptized into one body.

490
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:30,960


491
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,780
Whether we be Jew or Gentile,

492
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
Bond or free,

493
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,840
and have all been made to drink into one spirit.

494
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,880
For the body is not one member but many.

495
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,380
He tells us,

496
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:42,820
He tells us,

497
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,780
The eye cannot say unto the hand,

498
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,100
I have no need of thee.

499
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,720
Nor again the head to the feet,

500
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,900
I have no need of thee.

501
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,080
I have no need of thee.

502
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,240
And therefore those members of the body,

503
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,720
which seem to be more feeble,

504
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,580
and those members of the body,

505
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,260
which we think of as less honorable,

506
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,740
all are necessary.

507
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,740
He says that there should be no schism in the body,

508
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,120
but that the members should have the same care,

509
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,420
one to another.

510
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,700
And whether one member suffer,

511
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,880
all the members suffer with it.

512
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,740
I believe in God's purpose,

513
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,420
not knowing it.

514
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,660
I ask him,

515
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,020
moving in me,

516
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,960
to allow me to see his will.

517
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,640
I ask him,

518
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,560
moving in others,

519
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,740
to allow them to see it.

520
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,520
What chronic services are available

521
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:49,960
to you?

522
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,580
Only CryoSpan offers all of the following services.

523
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,140
Pre-suspension counseling.

00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,520

in our suspension module.

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,220
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, CryoSpan.

Suspension is for you who are thrilled by miraculous

00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,800
ever accelerating progress in science and technology.

540
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,980
This for those who believe that such electrifying features

541
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,880
as the Congress of the Moon and heart transplantations

542
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,820
are merely precursors of infinitely greater things to come

543
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,640
in the incredible drama of human development.

544
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,500
And crime expansion is for those who want to be a part of the future.

545
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,460
But want to contribute to and enjoy the wonders

546
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,620
of the fantastic world of tomorrow.

547
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,200
Cryonic suspension is for you.

548
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:13,720
Hello, hello.

549
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,460
Hello, hello.

550
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,300
Smokey the Bear.

551
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,980
Don't bogart that joint.

552
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,360
Pass it over to me, my friend.

553
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,120
Oh boy, come on, David, read the story.

554
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:22,460
Okay.

555
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,460
Once in the Jurassic, about 150 million years ago,

556
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,040
the great sun Buddha in this corner of the infinite void

557
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,240
gave a great discourse to all the assembled elements and energies.

558
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,640
To the standing beings, the walking beings,

559
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,760
the flying beings and the sitting beings, even grasses.

560
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,840
To the number of 13 billion, each one born from a seed.

561
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,680
All assembled there.

562
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,640
A discourse concerning enlightenment,

563
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,160
on the planet Earth.

564
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,500
He said,

565
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,280
in some future time,

566
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,360
there will be a continent called America.

567
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
It will have great centers of power,

568
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,540
called such as Pyramid Lake,

569
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,880
Walden Pond,

570
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,640
Mount Rainier,

571
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,320
Big Sur,

572
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,340
Everglades,

573
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:02,980
and so forth.

574
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,060
And powerful nerves and channels,

575
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,520
such as Columbia River,

576
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,560
Mississippi River,

577
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,360
and Grand Canyon.

578
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,020
The human race in that era will get into troubles all over its head,

579
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,160
and practically wreck everything in spite of its own strong, intelligent Buddha nature.

580
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,300
The twisting strata of the great mountains

581
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,100
and the pulsing of the great volcanoes

582
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,520
are my love burning deep in the earth.

583
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,500
My obstinate compassion is schist and basalt and granite

584
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,480
to be mountains,

585
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,860
to bring down the rain.

586
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,940
In that future American era,

587
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,140
I shall enter a new form

588
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,860
to cure the world of loveless knowledge

589
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,600
that seeks with blind hunger

590
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,340
and mindless rage eating food that will not fill it.

591
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,860
And he showed himself in his true form.

592
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,920
Smokey the Bear.

593
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,640
A handsome, smoky-colored, brown bear

594
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,280
standing on his hind legs,

595
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,200
showing that he is aroused and watchful,

596
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,000
bearing his right paw,

597
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,460
the shovel that digs to the truth beneath appearances,

598
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,500
cuts the roots of useless attachments,

599
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,560
and flings damp sand on the fires of greed and war.

600
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,920
His left paw,

601
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,360
in the mudra of comradely display,

602
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,440
indicating that all creatures have the full right to live to their limits

603
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,900
and that deer, rabbits, chipmunks, snakes, dandelions, and lizards

604
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,620
all grow in the realm of the Dharma.

605
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,760
Wearing the blue work overall,

606
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,840
symbolic of slaves and laborers,

607
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,160
the countless men oppressed by a civilization

608
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,520
that claims to save but only destroys.

609
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,440
Wearing the broad-brimmed hat of the West,

610
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,100
symbolic of the forces that guard the wilderness,

611
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,240
which is the natural state of the Dharma

612
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,840
and the true path of man on earth.

613
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,080
All true paths lead through mountains.

614
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,980
With a halo of smoke and flame behind,

615
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,300
the forest fires of the Kali Yuga,

616
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,660
fires caused by the stupidity of those

617
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,540
who think things can be gained and lost,

618
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,060
whereas in truth all is contained vast and free

619
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,420
in the blue sky and green earth of one mind.

620
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,500
Round-bellied to show his kind nature

621
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,440
and that the great earth has food enough

622
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,400
for everyone who loves her and trusts her,

623
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,960
trampling underfoot wasteful freeways in needless suburbs,

624
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,060
smashing the worms of capitalism and totalitarianism,

625
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,960
indicating the task his followers,

626
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,640
becoming free of cars, houses, canned food,

627
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,180
universities and shoes,

628
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,740
master the three mysteries of their own body, speech and mind,

629
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,480
and fearlessly chop down the rotten trees

630
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,460
and prune out the sick limbs of this country, America,

631
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,440
and then burn the leftover trash.

632
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,500
Wrathful but calm, austere but comic,

633
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,800
Smokey the Bear will illuminate those who would help him,

634
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,060
but for those who would hinder or stop him,

635
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,440
slander him, he will put them out.

636
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,940
Thus his great mantra.

637
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,760
I dedicate myself to the universal diamond,

638
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,120
be this raging fury destroyed.

639
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,340
And he will protect those who love woods and rivers,

640
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,360
gods and animals, hobos and madmen,

641
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,580
prisoners and sick people, musicians,

642
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,700
playful women and hopeful children.

643
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,940
And if anyone is threatened by advertising air pollution

644
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,700
or the police,

645
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,880
they should chant Smokey the Bear's war spell.

646
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,440
Drown their butts, crush their butts,

647
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,300
drown their butts, crush their butts,

648
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,300
drown their butts, crush their butts,

649
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,200
drown their butts, crush their butts,

650
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,340
drown their butts,

651
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,700
and Smokey the Bear will surely appear

652
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,900
to put the enemy out with his vajra shovel.

653
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,860
Now those who practice and recite this sutra

654
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,640
and then try to put it in practice

655
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,320
will accumulate merit as countless as the sands

656
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,420
of Arizona and Nevada,

657
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,800
will help save the planet Earth from total oil slick,

658
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,420
will enter the age of harmony of man and nature,

659
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,400
will win the tender love and caresses of men,

660
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,540
women and beasts,

661
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,400
will always have ripe blackberries to eat

662
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,220
and a sunny spot under a pine tree to sit at,

663
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,520
and in the end will win

664
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,280
highest perfect enlightenment.

665
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,940
Unless we have heard.

666
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,240
I hear you, Reverend Osman.

667
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,300
That was David Osman on a night

668
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,500
of 1970 Firesign Theatre radio show

669
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,040
lifted from the Divine Book and DVD

670
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,520
Duke of Madness Motors from FiresignTheatre.com.

671
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,140
This hour of slack for some reason

672
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,680
is covering various subjects of the recent

673
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,560
subgenius family road trip,

674
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,880
which resulted in many doctor bills,

675
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,480
broken bones, girded lungs, and pain pills.

676
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,180
But why would Bob do this to us?

677
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,380
Why?

678
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,860
We're going to ask ourselves as we wander along.

679
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,040
You're on the air.

680
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,820
Well, my friend,

681
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,940
it's difficult if I jump back in here.

682
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,920
Good luck.

683
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,420
...and say why.

684
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,160
We've got some...

685
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,540
...question.

686
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,820
Why do you leave us?

687
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,700
We're interviewing people who have which disease?

688
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,620
From the disease?

689
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,980
Sif from the disease.

690
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,140
Why do you keep getting sick all the time?

691
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,720
That's where I'm going.

692
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,560
I'm in a constant state of sickness.

693
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,680
I'm in a constant state of revulsion as well,

694
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,940
and everything makes me sick.

695
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,200
I hear you, man.

696
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,820
None true or way.

697
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,660
People will take the time to wash their hands, you know.

698
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,120
Well, I wash my hands and it's...

699
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,020
No, that makes it just worse.

700
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,340
That just makes it worse, dude.

701
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,940
It's also...

702
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,840
You're just breeding...

703
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,480
You're just breeding a new species of bacteria

704
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,340
that's going to be antibiotic resistant because of that.

705
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,240
Yeah, yeah.

706
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,600
Isn't that true, Rob, though?

707
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,560
I mean, isn't that...

708
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,640
...velte-be-conft?

709
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,240
What are you talking about?

710
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,880
If you really want to do something, stop using antibacterial soaps, okay?

711
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,260
I'm sorry.

712
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,600
It's going to build resistance.

713
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,240
So what are you saying?

714
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,780
We should use bacterial soap?

715
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,260
Use pro-bacterial soap.

716
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:57,840
Yeah, yeah.

717
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,940
Actually, it's a nice point.

718
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,860
If you breed the right kind of bacteria,

719
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,260
then they will keep some of those viruses in check and...

720
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,800
Right.

721
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,340
That's why we got MRSA in the hospitals right now,

722
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,660
is because you got too many people using the damn antibacterial soap.

723
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,520
We need to use the antibacterial people.

724
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,140
Well, you can be the first one to stop.

725
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,300
How about that, Ragnar?

726
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,520
I have.

727
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,580
I didn't...

728
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,480
You know, well...

729
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:19,760
Good.

730
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,180
I'm not using any medicines or any kind of stuff for my cold.

731
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,500
I'm trying to beat it the natural way,

732
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,980
because if you start training your body with antibiotics and all kinds of pills...

733
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,560
Well, antibiotics aren't going to do any good for a cold or the flu anyway.

734
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,200
No, really.

735
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,880
No, they're not.

736
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,960
Pig grease is what works best in this kind of weather.

737
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,240
Just mess it up.

738
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,360
You don't get a whole mess of lard.

739
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,700
Just rub it all over your body.

740
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,760
Put your big heavy pair of woolen underwear,

741
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,340
over-wear, under shoes,

742
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,540
on top of that,

743
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,820
and some Daffy Crone heckin' soup.

744
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,460
Because I am in the midst of a situation.

745
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,000
Smallpox?

746
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,780
And what the fuck is that to you?

747
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,940
A fella in the woods I see to say hello to has it.

748
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,740
Unless he caught it from a trout.

749
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,440
I figured some in the camp to be down with it too.

750
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,980
What was he doing in the woods?

751
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,360
Someone threw him there.

752
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,660
Anyway, he's better now.

753
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,260
And how do you feel?

754
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,720
What's that supposed to mean?

755
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,420
How do you feel?

756
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,020
Why?

757
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,920
I take it that you're feeling well.

758
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,800
Am I wrong?

759
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,960
No, you're not fucking wrong.

760
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,960
That's all I wanted to fucking know.

761
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,640
I will lay you out as soon as I look at you.

762
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,720
This is my point.

763
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,600
You've been caring for a sick man who doesn't seem to have gotten you sick.

764
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,540
Ain't she wise?

765
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,660
Fuck it out.

766
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:46,000
Ben, as you have a gift for it, and I'm gonna have sick people up to my hips,

767
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,500
I was wondering if you might wanna come back to camp.

768
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,320
My best friend died.

769
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,720
And he ain't coming back.

770
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,420
Now will you help me?

771
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,980
You can do your drinking off work like I do.

772
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,660
May I say, Dan, ever since I resumed drinking alcohol,

773
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,020
I cannot for the life of me figure out why I ever gave it up.

774
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,860
Takes the edge off the tough ones.

775
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,440
Ooh, takes the edge off.

776
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,020
Well put.

777
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,720
And may I say, Dan, that I often find you the source of many well-put and witty things that you say.

778
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,660
Thanks.

779
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,340
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.

780
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,420
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.

781
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,760
I keep the ends up all the time, you're mine.

782
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,980
Because you're mine, I walk the line.

783
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,960
I find it very easy to be true.

784
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,140
I find myself alone when each day is through.

785
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,300
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you.

786
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,920
Because you're mine, I walk the line.

787
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,400
As soon as night is dark and day is light.

788
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,580
I keep you in my mind for day and night.

789
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,580
And happiness I've known since the day of disgrace.

790
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,600
Because you're mine, I walk the line.

791
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,740
You've got a way to keep me on your side.

792
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,940
You give me cause for love that I can't hide.

793
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,120
But you I know are the one trying to turn the tide.

794
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,040
Because you're mine, I walk the line.

795
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,540
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.

796
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,680
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.

797
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,060
I keep the ends up all the time, you're mine.

798
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,580
Because you're mine, I walk the line.

799
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:57,220
Cause you're mine, cause you're mine.

800
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:01,360
I walk the line.

801
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:10,080
Cause you're mine, cause you're mine.

802
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,760
I walk the line.

803
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:22,880
Cause you're mine, cause you're mine.

804
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,220
I walk the line.

805
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,460
Walk the line, walk the line for you.

806
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,600
I walk the line, walk the line all the time.

807
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,860
But that was once again, the Deathbillies,

808
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,400
who Sister Decadence turned us onto while we were in

809
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,300
North Texas.

810
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,260
Now, most of our time there was spent at the Stang Ranch,

811
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,900
hanging out with Pappy and my siblings and nieces and

812
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,180
nephews and goats, lots of goats.

813
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,840
Stang Ranch really is a ranch complete with rattlesnakes,

814
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,240
barbed wire, cacti, cowflops, and every day that we

815
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,420
we didn't have broken feet, Princess, we and I went for long, leisurely walks among the hills and

816
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:18,240
vales looking for cattle to herd or have our way with as herded here. Now see, with Pappy's Voyager,

817
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:26,160
we could drive down this hill and fuck all those bulls rather than walking down here and fucking

818
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:35,400
some of the bulls. You see? Yeah, but we wouldn't get to stop and smell the bullshit. That's true.

819
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:45,660
Speaking of bullshit. I'm sick. That's not bullshit. I'm not. Did I make you walk like this

820
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:53,760
when you were sick? No, never. I took delicate care of you. Anyway, we have not recorded anything

821
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,140
in a couple of days because we've been too late.

822
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:01,360
And there really wasn't anything all that exciting. I finally was able to get online

823
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:08,540
and I learned then that everyone we visited got sick, but they all had different things. Oh,

824
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:15,320
by the way, Suds now has pink eye. Oh, no. I said, wow, that's not bad. That's the only time

825
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,580
that normal playboy type girls look cute to me. And this would be a good time to catch up on all

826
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,780
the hit TV shows that Mr. and Mrs. Everybody watches.

827
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:35,300
Well, you've got pink eye. Yeah. Then we went to stay with Doc Frop and Sister Decadence in Fort

828
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:45,620
Worth. And really, we just sat around and yacked and made them sick. Then we came here to Stang

829
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:54,100
Ranch and sat around on our butts yacking with Pappy. And that's about all we're going to do

830
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,080
for the next several days. I have to.

831
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:03,500
I have to fill all too few orders. It's kind of sickening. We're now getting more donations

832
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:09,740
than orders. I would. That is not sickening. That's beloved and wonderful. Yeah, but it's

833
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:17,800
kind of cult like. I feel more better when I send them something. Well, you can send people

834
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,060
something that sends you a donation. You can take them and send them a thank you gift.

835
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,620
No, that's different. You don't understand. It's too.

836
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:33,160
It's like a real. It's too religion like if they don't want something. I mean, it should be

837
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:40,220
religion like, but I prefer it to be a bit more business like than religion like. Now, maybe

838
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:47,880
that's what we're doing wrong. Maybe I should just quit trying to produce quality goods or even

839
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,060
shoddy goods and just go give us money or you're not saved and you're not in the cool nerd club.

840
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,480
No, it's the world.

841
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:01,500
It's first Industrial Church. That's what you told me. Now, do you want to go down to the

842
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:09,360
dark and scary woods where the cow pond might be and there's a dinosaur head or do you want to go

843
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,800
the regular way through the forest of werewolves? Man, with these creepy trees, it's scary everywhere

844
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:21,080
here. They're just cedars, aren't they? Yeah, but they're dead.

845
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,280
So,

846
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,780
they're black and craggy and they look like they came out of a mystery novel.

847
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,340
Yeah, they're cool, but there's prickly pear everywhere.

848
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,180
It's not snowing. In fact, it's probably about 60 degrees.

849
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,480
And look at those cute little koala bears up in that eucalyptus tree.

850
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,280
Aren't they nice? It's so green.

851
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,880
And look over in the pasture, the kangaroos are all loafing around.

852
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,120
It's all the grass.

853
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,100
It's all the green because we brought rain.

854
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,720
Yes, it's true. We are the rain makers. We brought rain. We always do. Every year. This

855
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:11,320
area hasn't had any rain since the last time we were here. And Governor Rick Perry should

856
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:17,480
quit praying to God and should start giving me a billion dollars a year to drive down

857
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:25,600
here once a month from Ohio and bring rain. But no. They're all religious nuts. They're all

858
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:31,720
superstitious about that kind of thing. They can't see the obvious science. When Stang and we drive

859
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:37,980
from Ohio to Texas, Texas gets rain. Period. That's it. That's the only time it gets rain.

860
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:47,000
And it gets rain every time. And I've got, we have gas station receipts and things to prove it. Car,

861
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:52,780
you know, store receipts, credit card receipts, and weather records.

862
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,880
What you were going to need was the verification.

863
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:01,020
Yeah, but we're talking about Governor Rick Perry. He's not going to believe science by

864
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,560
definition. He's going to consider that a lie. Anything with evidence will be a lie.

865
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:13,660
And I'm kind of a liberal, sort of. Well, at least compared to them.

866
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:23,540
So there's even if, even if it was, even if it would bring the state, if it would save the state

867
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,420
from destruction.

868
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:30,960
They'd refuse to do it because some liberal guy came up with it. That's just the way things are

869
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:39,060
now. It's more important to make the liberals look bad than to do than anything else. Literally,

870
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:48,260
because if the liberals start doing things, it'll destroy America. They hate our freedoms.

871
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,980
That's all I hear every time I turn on the liberal controlled media.

872
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,420
The liberals,

873
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:00,580
control the media and they hate our freedoms. So you better hate them because they're,

874
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,500
they're, the libtards can't do anything but make up stupid, unoriginal insults.

875
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,080
My brain turns off when I hear libtard.

876
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:17,620
My brain turns off when I hear republitard because I like to think more highly of my

877
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:24,740
fellow libtards that they would come up with something. But, but neither one is as bad as

878
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,240
sheeple.

879
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:32,340
I got one of those today on my YouTube account. Somebody commented on the subgenius commercial,

880
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:38,460
except they weren't commenting on the subgenius commercial at all. It was just some angry man

881
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:47,660
ranting about you sheeple keep going through your ant lines and die. I'm going to sit here with my

882
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:54,800
high quality chair and my high speed internet and have a good life.

883
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,400
What?

884
00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:01,640
I couldn't, honestly, I couldn't figure out which side he was being sarcastic about.

885
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,460
What is ant lines?

886
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:13,500
Lines of ants. And if I was on YouTube, I might've actually responded to it with my usual comeback,

887
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:22,520
which is, you know who I consider to be sheeple? People who use the term sheeple for other people.

888
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,440
Those, those are the real sheep.

889
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:32,940
They're just people. Cause they just say the same thing. They're just mimicking what they heard some other angry guy say.

890
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:46,180
Some other frustrated nerd. But this guy actually seemed to be saying, you people go ahead and do your idiotic ant like lives.

891
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:53,360
I'm going to sit here at my computer and have a real life. I honestly think that's what the guy was saying.

892
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:53,760
Hmm.

893
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,400
Without the slightest hint.

894
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:02,700
And the fact that he called everybody else sheeple makes me think, yeah, he probably doesn't realize that,

895
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,560
you know, when you keep using that, keep saying the same thing over and over again

896
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,420
and calling other people sheeple, what exactly does that make you?

897
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,100
A bad writer.

898
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,600
Can't you at least use a subgenius approved term like that?

899
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:25,840
Pink.

900
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,500
First time I ever heard the word sheeple was out of Chaz's mouth.

901
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,360
He had it in a song lyric.

902
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,100
That was a long time ago.

903
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,160
Yeah, but he probably got it from somewhere.

904
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,840
Alex Jones or some Alex Jones sheep.

905
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,340
Okay, boss, this is our song.

906
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,420
There's Mammy's grave.

907
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,880
Except that she's not really there.

908
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,300
It's just a marker.

909
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,900
And there's the crash picnic table.

910
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:10,400
It's so ironic that the one moment that a tree branch would come crashing down on a picnic table

911
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,220
would be the one time in 10 years that somebody was sitting there.

912
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,040
The preacher and his wife.

913
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,720
Funny that.

914
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,500
But you can still see a little blood on the picnic.

915
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:26,940
Remnants.

916
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,600
Where the preacher and his wife died.

917
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,520
And they only said they only had just sat down.

918
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,180
Out of, you know, that branch could have fallen down any time in the last 10 years,

919
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,440
but it chose that moment.

920
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,400
Damn it.

921
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,620
Don't play that upbeat music after a dead puppy bit.

922
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,940
Well, I thought that was the point.

923
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,160
We're trying to cheer our audience up.

924
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,800
After all, some puppies bite the dust.

925
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,520
That's part of nature's plan.

926
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,680
And many are called...

927
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,920
Where do they serve the food on this show, Dr. Howell?

928
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,060
But few were chosen.

929
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,020
Well, you know, that's only if the adoring fans bring it in.

930
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:09,380
And they won't bring it in unless they adore what we're doing, will they?

931
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,980
So we'd better start doing something a little bit more adorable.

932
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,360
That's what I say.

933
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,700
I'll tell you something adorable.

934
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,840
And what's that?

935
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,500
And it's on...

936
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,140
It somehow relates to what we were just talking about.

937
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:20,940
Okay, shoot.

938
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,520
There's a blue jay nest outside our neighborhood.

939
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:32,040
A little baby just hatched blue jay or two fell out of the nest.

940
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,300
Oh, that's not so adorable.

941
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:33,640
Or were pushed out.

942
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,560
And a horrible cat caught them.

943
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:41,200
My neighbor instinctively picked up one of the birds and took it in

944
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,940
and then suddenly got called out of town.

945
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,320
And so he came to our house and said,

946
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:49,240
Hey, will you feed this bird for me until I get back?

947
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,220
Feed a baby boy?

948
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,280
And we thought, Oh, yeah, sure.

949
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:53,660
Yeah, sure.

950
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,080
Feed it to the cat.

951
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,940
And we looked on the Internet.

952
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:03,500
The first thing it said was to grind up dog food and make a paste of it

953
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,560
and feed it to the bird.

954
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,600
And the bird loved it.

955
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,060
Baby birds eat dog food?

956
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,220
Yeah, I chewed it at first and then spit it into its mouth.

957
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,340
It loved it.

958
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,500
It thought I was its mommy.

959
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,960
It bonded with you, right?

960
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,400
And we named it J2 Paisley, which is so cool that I can't...

961
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,840
It would take me another hour to explain it.

962
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,660
It's a cool name.

963
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,600
I don't even need to know how you got it.

964
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:22,780
Anyway, the...

965
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,020
I don't care.

966
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,600
J2 Paisley got fatter and fatter.

967
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:33,480
We found another baby bird that we named Le Professeur after certain events in that movie, The Prestige.

968
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:37,360
Anyway, the second baby bird didn't do...

969
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,780
He was kind of late.

970
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:45,920
Then we read that really what you should do with a baby bird is kill it.

971
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,520
Is leave it.

972
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,200
Kill it, right?

973
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,120
Right there because that's part of the circle of life.

974
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:54,960
And, you know, there's a reason that a certain number of baby blue jays fall out of the nest.

975
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,540
Are born to feed the bird.

976
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:55,940
Cats.

977
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,540
And get eaten by cats, yeah.

978
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,780
Well, the cats are actually the interlopers in this scheme.

979
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,940
Not intended to be there by nature, but only by humans.

980
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,160
But it would be a wolf if it wasn't a cat or a dog.

981
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:07,960
The happy ending was...

982
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,820
A huge gray wolf would come and snap up those baby birds, you see.

983
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:12,460
An eagle.

984
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:19,000
After Wikipedia told us to just leave the damn birds alone, don't mess with it,

985
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:25,340
we attempted to return the birds to their nest, which we couldn't reach.

986
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,460
But we put them up high out of the reach of cats.

987
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,640
So you couldn't see where they died, right?

988
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:29,980
Right.

989
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,560
So we could...

990
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,840
And the next day they weren't there and...

991
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,220
Uh-huh.

992
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:33,740
Well, I guess...

993
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,580
So we were absolved...

994
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,760
Those ants are very thorough.

995
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,040
...of their knowledge.

996
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:36,740
Uh-huh.

997
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:41,620
And the next time we see a tiny bird struggling who's just been hatched, we'll just leave

998
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:41,900
it there.

999
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,620
We'll just walk away.

1000
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,800
Well, you know what you could do, if I can shove my oar in, is put on a rubber glove

1001
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,380
and then pick up the bird.

1002
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,900
Then your scent won't be on it.

1003
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,020
Uh-huh.

1004
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,700
I'm sorry.

1005
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:51,920
But your rubber...

1006
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,440
Your rubber will be on it.

1007
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,580
You can return it to the nest and it will not be rejected by its parents because

1008
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,060
your scent will not be on it.

1009
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:03,400
When we put it near the parents' nest, the parents did bring food to it.

1010
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,440
But they were very agitated over the whole thing.

1011
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,400
They were pissed off.

1012
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:07,640
They knew there was something unnatural about it.

1013
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,760
They didn't want to be bothered with this deadbeat out there, you know?

1014
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,860
Now, in another case...

1015
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:17,120
They kicked him out of the nest in the first place and now somebody brought him back and

1016
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,940
he's going, oh, shit, I'm gonna feed this guy.

1017
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,080
In downtown Cleveland, my...

1018
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,060
They were trying to save the rest of the family.

1019
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:32,000
...Princess Wee, to who I'm consort, found in the parking lot of the giant weather-controlled

1020
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,040
building where she worked, a seagull with a broken wing.

1021
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,660
And it had been there a couple of days and it was pretty miserable and everybody was

1022
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,560
ignoring it.

1023
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,340
But not Princess Wee.

1024
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,640
She's the sweetest thing.

1025
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,600
She blows with the power of good and gets everything...

1026
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,520
Yes, if anyone could save those damn birds, it would be Princess Wee.

1027
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:49,820
Yeah.

1028
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,060
Well, she had me come...

1029
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:56,920
She had me come down to the parking lot and put a throw sack over that damn bird and we

1030
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,340
took it to...

1031
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,380
Throw a sack over it?

1032
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:03,820
It turned out that there was, in fact, a bird rehabilitation place at one of the nature

1033
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,280
parks.

1034
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,200
The Federal Bird Rehabilitation Resilience.

1035
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:10,700
We drove it way out there and they probably said, we'll take good care of this bird and

1036
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,780
put it back out in the wild.

1037
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:15,260
And then, you know, as soon as we were gone, they said, throw it in the dumpster.

1038
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,440
Feed it to the lion.

1039
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:17,940
Yeah.

1040
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,280
Feed it to the...

1041
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:19,440
Feed it to the...

1042
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,140
So, Puget.

1043
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:20,560
Feed it to the...

1044
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,260
So, it is Mickey Mantle Day at last at Yankee Stadium.

1045
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,140
Yes, they're retiring number seven, the last glyph of the Southern cult, the Seminole in

1046
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:34,240
the creek, the Cherokee dying out in Oklahoma, a plaque in his name, the pottery style of

1047
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:40,040
the 50s, Elvis, Eros, temples of rock and roll, and Mel Allen's Southern voice calling

1048
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,660
across the Mississippi as far as Pawnee country and the Earth lodges, Arrowheads as far as

1049
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:49,680
Saskatchewan, bringing the Blackfoot and from the East, the Osage and the Assiniboine, calling

1050
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:55,200
from the pitcher's mound, the tumulus, this hallowed ground, rooting for his old team,

1051
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,320
but unaware of history itself.

1052
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,900
Well, now we've reached the age of discovery.

1053
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:05,380
Leary's ships wind through old, fablecious tapestries of the Turks and Navajos, the cellular

1054
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:11,260
strands, these ships using electromagnetism, which never ceases from the universe at large

1055
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:16,180
to the microcosm of molecular speed, the numbers of topology and numerology simultaneously

1056
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,680
turning into clothes.

1057
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,660
The first so we can get into the universe.

1058
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:19,660


1059
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:25,080
The second so that they take us into themselves as Ken Harrison's one big season in Boston,

1060
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:30,200
the flooding of the Southern cult in the Northeast, reaching the Algonquin and Penobscot in the

1061
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,000
form of pottery.

1062
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,580
Yeah, the sports page.

1063
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,140
It's the only section of the paper that has any sense of history.

1064
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:35,960
Time.

1065
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,280
Now, perhaps for some of these trades and statistics, not worth talking about.

1066
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,080
We're also given the arrivals and departures of ships and the moon, but they are the collection

1067
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:45,640
of the Earth.

1068
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,460
Like granite and elms and loss, they have nothing to do with consciousness.

1069
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,700
But once we throw out the key, all texts become one.

1070
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,600
There is time for nothing else.

1071
00:48:54,740 --> 00:49:00,040
As the Indian knew, though borrowed to their own ends by Mormons and snake doctors and

1072
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:04,580
diffusionists, we are free of Europe and Asia as occult.

1073
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,120
Declaration of independence.

1074
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,320
There is an American occult.

1075
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,500
Corn and tobacco.

1076
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:10,760
Migration.

1077
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,300
Pipes and mounds.

1078
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:17,460
We come to found a continent to begin an historical game.

1079
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,440
And cities are already.

1080
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:19,840
Here.

1081
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:26,000
And the tribes lost on the prairie and the plateau appears speaking new dialects on the

1082
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,380
plains.

1083
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:27,700
Play ball.

1084
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:36,420
I was I actually was in a restaurant last night in Dallas with a giant Elvis statue in the

1085
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,740
center of the restaurant.

1086
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:39,620
Not kidding.

1087
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,920
A fountain.

1088
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,180
A fountain Elvis.

1089
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,320
Well, tonight it's weeks later.

1090
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,980
That's the last time we recorded anything for our of slack.

1091
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:01,800
And tonight we're in Dallas, Texas, at Port David's Pub, a place which I can't believe

1092
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,620
still exists.

1093
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:06,860
It's very little that I remember from Dallas still exists.

1094
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:14,500
But we're here with Reverend Zaphod, our good friend, to see Fever in the Funk House.

1095
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,380
That's like his favorite band.

1096
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,660
And.

1097
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,320
We did this last year.

1098
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:24,520
We were here at in Dallas to see the same band fever in the fun.

1099
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:24,880
So.

1100
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,860
Yes, we did.

1101
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,680
They were wonderful.

1102
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:34,100
They're a little bit too good for our slack or should I say to mainstream sounding?

1103
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:34,940
That's regular.

1104
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:35,760
Good song.

1105
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,260
Yeah.

1106
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,980
It'd be like playing the Rolling Stones on the hour slack.

1107
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,520
It wouldn't be much like somebody is already hearing that.

1108
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,240
So this is not them in the background now.

1109
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:48,660
This is.

1110
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,780
I don't know what the hell it is.

1111
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,380
And I'll probably do this whole routine again.

1112
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,340
Later.

1113
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,060
Over and out.

1114
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,480
guitar solo

1115
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,400
solo

1116
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,480
That was Fever in the Funk House

1117
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,380
recorded live at Poor David's Pub

1118
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,540
in Dallas. It takes a lot to get me

1119
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,340
to set foot in Dallas anymore, but

1120
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,340
Reverend Zaphod made us an offer we

1121
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,140
couldn't refuse, the offer of

1122
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,360
slack. It was strange to

1123
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,160
see Dallas again. There's none of the

1124
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,280
old buildings left that I recognize

1125
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,220
and yet perfect strangers

1126
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,380
that I'd never seen before and yet

1127
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,600
somehow did recognize.

1128
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,180
I saw a Sarah look-alike

1129
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,280
in Dallas last night. So that's

1130
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,020
what happens any time you go to another city

1131
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,080
is you see, you realize that there's only

1132
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,160
you start understanding where

1133
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,680
Susie the Floozy is coming from.

1134
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,300
Everybody looks

1135
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,680
alike. You go to another city.

1136
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,180
You go to another city and you see the

1137
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,160
same faces everywhere and you keep doing double

1138
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,160
takes like, wait a second, I know that person. Wait, no, I

1139
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:50,460
don't.

1140
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,060
I went to China for six weeks and at the end

1141
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:56,060
of the end, after about three weeks

1142
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,100
I started seeing Chinese people

1143
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,020
that look exactly like, that guy looks

1144
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:00,680
like my uncle.

1145
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,800
Looks like my neighbor. Yeah, even like

1146
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,860
completely different so-called races

1147
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,820
like there's still only so many

1148
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,060
facial features that are there and once

1149
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,000
you're looking for them, once you're accustomed to looking at people

1150
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,960
who look a certain way, you're going to start putting

1151
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,980
them in the context of all the

1152
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,300
other faces you've ever seen in your life.

1153
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,320
How isolated you were before.

1154
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,840
Stang, didn't you tell me that there's like a

1155
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,960
Ragnar doppelganger that's working

1156
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,040
at one of the speedways up in

1157
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,160
Cleveland? Actually, at my conspiracy

1158
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,180
job, there's a guy who looks vaguely

1159
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:30,580
like you.

1160
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,100
I saw a Ragnar clone at

1161
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,640
a speedway in Tennessee.

1162
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,860
Well, there are Ragnar clones.

1163
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,080
In fact, he was so Ragnar-like that we

1164
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,800
sat and observed the

1165
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,160
meth head users coming and going.

1166
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,240
It seemed like that was the only kind of

1167
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,020
people going in and out of there, which

1168
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:48,760
I had me feel kind of strange about the dude.

1169
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,720
Yeah, that's exactly what I have to do in my story, is I have to watch the meth heads

1170
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,540
so that they don't steal the aluminum foil

1171
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,880
and the batteries. See, this is the

1172
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,300
dirty secret of Speedway.

1173
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,740
You know, the way they were able to build such a

1174
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,900
massive interstate empire of chain stores.

1175
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,040
No, the dirty secret is

1176
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,720
that they have clones of Ragnar.

1177
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,940
Exactly. As long as they can have

1178
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,080
a Ragnar in every store.

1179
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,840
But as long as they can have a Ragnar in

1180
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,080
every store, that's the secret to their success.

1181
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:15,800
And that's also the reason

1182
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,060
why there's never a mirror in any of the men's

1183
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,020
rooms in any of the 1100 Speedways.

1184
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,120
It's because

1185
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,920
the clones get so furious at seeing

1186
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,820
their faces all the time that they smash

1187
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,900
the mirrors, apparently. That's a lot of

1188
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,120
speed.

1189
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,800
Yeah, yeah.

1190
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,780
So anyway, obviously there's clones of

1191
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,100
everybody, everywhere.

1192
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,460
Anybody got a pen cap I can borrow?

1193
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,420
I'll give it right there.

1194
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,860
People report clones of me all

1195
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,440
the time, and I've seen

1196
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,680
kind of Dr.

1197
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:46,780
Sinister-like

1198
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,240
individuals.

1199
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:49,300
Liar.

1200
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,280
You know, visually, they just look that way.

1201
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:51,600
You lie.

1202
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,740
They don't sound that way.

1203
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:54,960
Show me, I will kill them.

1204
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,880
They make good targets.

1205
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,700
They make good sacrificial victims,

1206
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,980
you know, replacements,

1207
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,760
you know, stooges,

1208
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:03,660
patsies.

1209
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,780
You know, it's funny, the first girl I ever

1210
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,140
went out on a date with,

1211
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,800
eventually, like, this is

1212
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,900
when I was like

1213
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,220
14 years old.

1214
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,880
She, like a week later, she decided

1215
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,980
to start going out with this other guy.

1216
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,060
That's the only thing that I get mistaken for.

1217
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,600
Used to get mistaken for all the time.

1218
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,820
People walk up to me and it's like,

1219
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:24,820
Hey, Kevin, how you doing?

1220
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,920
It's like, that's not my name.

1221
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:26,700
Who do you think I am?

1222
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,560
The subgeniuses now are so old

1223
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,980
and senile that this show

1224
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,760
you're hearing was really just a random

1225
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,000
bunch of sentences like kids talking

1226
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,540
in a sandbox,

1227
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,280
later rearranged

1228
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,160
cleverly by young people

1229
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,320
to make it sound like

1230
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,140
we were really relating to each other.

1231
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:46,880
Death closes all,

1232
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,160
but something near the end,

1233
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,820
some work of noble note

1234
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,960
may yet be done,

1235
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,820
not unbecoming men who strove

1236
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:56,660
with gods.

1237
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,220
You sure have a pretty mouth, Dr. Howe.

1238
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,580
The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks.

1239
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,500
The long day wanes.

1240
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,260
The slow moon

1241
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,120
climbs.

1242
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,980
The deep moans round with many voices.

1243
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,220
Now let's just see you drop them paintings.

1244
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,860
Come, my friends,

1245
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:19,720
tis not too late to seek a newer world.

1246
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,300
Push off,

1247
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,120
and sitting well in order,

1248
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,960
smite the sounding furrows.

1249
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,040
Squeal like a howl.

1250
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,240
For my purpose holds

1251
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,000
to sail beyond the sunset

1252
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,140
and the baths of all the western stars

1253
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,780
until I die.

1254
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:38,000
Sir, if you were my husband,

1255
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,140
I'd give you poison.

1256
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,600
It may be that the gulfs

1257
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,620
shall wash us down.

1258
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,300
If you were my wife, I'd take it.

1259
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,000
It may be we shall reach

1260
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,340
the happy isles

1261
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:50,420
and see the great Achilles,

1262
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,200
who I knew personally.

1263
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,080
Though much is taken,

1264
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,860
much abides.

1265
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,660
And though we are not now that strength

1266
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,180
which in old days

1267
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,940
moved heaven and earth,

1268
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,020
that which we are,

1269
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,020
we are

1270
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,920
one equal temper of heroic hearts

1271
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,600
made weak

1272
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,240
by time and fate,

1273
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,920
but strong in will

1274
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,420
to strive, to seek,

1275
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:21,020
to find, and not to yield.

1276
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,580
That Jason and the Argonauts music

1277
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,540
went perfect with that boy.

1278
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,660
Well, you know,

1279
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,860
I am totally famous with this famous music.

1280
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,320
I mean, totally familiar

1281
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,520
with this famous music.

1282
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,540
Familiar, familiar.

1283
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,440
Familiar with this famous,

1284
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:37,700
very famous music.

1285
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,020
So I know when to shoot

1286
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,900
the razzmatazz in there.

1287
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:43,700
Because like you,

1288
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,840
I've heard this,

1289
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,900
this famous music,

1290
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:46,780
famously,

1291
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,480
many, many times.

1292
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,220
And it just keeps getting better.

1293
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,780
And it better keep it up, too.

1294
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,760
Thanks, Dr. Howell.

1295
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:56,860
Funny how this show,

1296
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:57,700
like the last one,

1297
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,840
kept somehow returning to the subjects

1298
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,900
of sickness and death.

1299
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:02,900
Oh, well.

1300
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,100
Anyway, this has been Hour of Slack

1301
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,420
from the Church of the Subgenius.

1302
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,320
You can find logs of everything

1303
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,420
and, in fact, copies of every Hour of Slack

1304
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:14,080
on our website, subgenius.com,

1305
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:14,820
along with a link to our website,

1306
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,720
with everything else we do.

1307
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,300
The music in the background

1308
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,060
is a mashed-up Onan cantovite.

1309
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,840
And now, to close out,

1310
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,040
a bizarre instrumental

1311
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,460
called Sharp Marker

1312
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,260
by the Psychoskeletons.

1313
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,200
Praise Bob.

1339

It's just, it's just a dream

1340
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,360
You're free

1341
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,620
It's just, it's just a dream

1342
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,240
You're free

1343
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,140
Cat has just been won

1344
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,880
Could this somehow explain Bob's gift?

1345
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:55,320
Could this be proof that Bob and others with super memory

1346
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,940
have some form of time-space synesthesia?

1347
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:04,020
Does the ability to see time explain Bob's near-total recall?

1348
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:07,020
Get down with my sickness

1349
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:15,200
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show

1350
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,720
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1351
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,520
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1352
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:26,540
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1353
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,080
But if you truly love Bob

1354
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,620
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1355
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,600
you should go to subgenius.com front page

1356
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,100
or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages

1357
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:41,700
and click on the subgenius.com front page.

1358
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,460
And help out financially as best you can.

1359
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:48,820
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty

1360
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:52,440
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1361
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,400
But some of you still have jobs.

1362
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,760
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1363
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,320
even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1364
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,720
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1365
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,040
All we're saying is that

1366
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,700
blowjobs could go the way of stevejobs

1367
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:11,700


1368
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,200
if you don't pay dogs.

1369
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,100
We also take checks and money orders to

1370
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,980
Subgenius Foundation

1371
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,300
P.O. Box 181 417

1372
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:31,440
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1373
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,640
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
