1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
No, no, no. How does that start? I can't remember.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,860
I, I, yes, friends. No, I, yes, dear friends.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,900
You're listening, no, uh, radio ministry.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:21,120
It's the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,720
Brought to you by the Church of the Subgenius.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,580
Produced here at the beautiful studios of WCSB, Cleveland, the home.

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,380
I love that show. It's so iconoclastic.

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,460
And, you know, everything is worth a poking at and it's making fun.

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,400
And sometimes throwing dirt on the shoes and pulling a knife at it.

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,380
Yeah, they're just a mirror that reflects the illness in society.

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,740
We may go on. We're going to go on for a long time tonight.

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,260
We're going to take over the station.

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,900
We might have to share bolts all night.

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:07,160
We're going to disregard any, uh, any attempts to take over the station by...

16
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,200
Stand back. They are killing me.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,420
The next... Oh, no, we won't go. I won't go there.

18
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,760
We're really, we are going to give it over to the next DJ if you're listening.

19
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,580
We were just teasing.

20
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,440
Yeah.

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,960
We're just kidding.

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,780
That's us. We've got our little cot set up here.

23
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,460
We've got us.

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,240
We're going to have a...

25
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,060
Hot chockeys here.

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,820
Getting ready for our slumber party.

27
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,220
And Philo and me.

28
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,660
All the kids will be here in a minute.

29
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,080
We each have a little candle here.

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,200
Why didn't you get to my hand?

31
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,600
And you got your little nightcap?

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,440
Yeah, I do.

33
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,180
Chestnuts are roasting.

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,620
Sexy guy show.

35
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,460
The sugar plums are dancing.

36
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,920
Yeah, this is the guy show because this is the last show of the millennium and we're

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,980
covering the history of the subgenius church, which is basically a guy church.

38
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,600
We would have a girl on the show, but she didn't show up.

39
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,280
That's the next show.

40
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,660
Next to the last show.

41
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,680
This is the last show.

42
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,180
We paid her.

43
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,900
When was the first...

44
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,700
We paid her and she still didn't show up.

45
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,740
When was the first...

46
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,860
I told you you should have given her that money in advance.

47
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,020
That was back in Jane Eyre's childhood because he had the little...

48
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,660
The little...

49
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,460
I said half now and half when you show up.

50
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,100
He had the original little head and he would watch that thing as a child and make little

51
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,840
songs and say little things and do little stuff.

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,500
Oh, you should always do the other half.

53
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,000
Always do the other half.

54
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,800
I have to do the other half now?

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,160
Amen.

56
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,240
I did not.

57
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,720
Yes, you did.

58
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,060
Okay.

59
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,920
Let this serve as a warning and a disclaimer.

60
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,420
If you are overly sensitive to vulgar terminology, I strongly advise that you fast forward the

61
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:34,660
tape.

62
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,420
Like everything I touch, this recording is on the cutting edge of societal evolution.

63
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,320
For example, women in combat.

64
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,820
See, I told you so.

65
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,800
Days in the military.

66
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,540
I may have a nice ring to it.

67
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,620
Universal health care.

68
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,140
I am committed to furthering this goal.

69
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,880
I really get no satisfaction out of saying anal sex.

70
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,880
You need to...

71
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,560
So horny.

72
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,400
Anal sex.

73
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,060
You need...

74
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,020
So horny.

75
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,960
And justify the means.

76
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,140
Well, let's set the record straight right here.

77
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,940
The cure for unemployment equals more taxes.

78
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,580
The cure for the recession equals more taxes.

79
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,140
The cure for the budget deficit equals more taxes.

80
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,840
The cure for illiteracy equals more taxes.

81
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,840
How many times do I have the right to say...

82
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,600
It happens to be the title of this recording.

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,940
Federally subsidized abortion.

84
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,620
This is no laughing matter.

85
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,060
This is no laughing matter, my friend.

86
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,620
Legal experimentation.

87
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,260
This is no action.

88
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,500
Anal sex.

89
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:42,280
Never, folks, in my wildest dreams could I have imagined just how exhilarating, fun, and emotionally rewarding this experience would be.

90
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,120
For example, women in combat.

91
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,600
See, I told you so.

92
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,640
Days in the military.

93
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,340
I may have a nice ring to it.

94
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,420
Universal health care.

95
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,020
I am committed to furthering this goal.

96
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,600
I really get no satisfaction out of saying anal sex.

97
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:55,720
I'm trying to say it.

98
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,760
Anal sex.

99
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,260
Me so horny.

100
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,160
Anal sex.

101
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,820
Me so horny.

102
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,780
And justify the means.

103
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,960
Well, let's set the record straight right here.

104
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,780
The cure for unemployment equals anal sex.

105
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,440
The cure for the recession equals anal sex.

106
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,020
The cure for the budget deficit equals anal sex.

107
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,680
The cure for illiteracy equals anal sex.

108
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,760
How many times do I have the right to say...

109
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,520
It happens to be the title of this recording.

110
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,600
Federally subsidized abortion.

111
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,900
This is no laughing matter, my friend.

112
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,520
Needle experimentation.

113
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,160
This is no accident.

114
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,340
Anal sex.

115
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:44,100
Never, folks, in my wildest dreams could I have imagined just how exhilarating, fun, and emotionally rewarding this experience would be.

116
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,640
That's it, folks.

117
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,740
Those are all things that I have said, and they are true.

118
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,180
Tell them, Russ.

119
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,100
So what do you think, Russ?

120
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,620
Excitement in the butt, I think is what EIB stands for now.

121
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,500
Excitement in the butt.

122
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,780
I honor you, Stangford.

123
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,360
Give me the money.

124
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:06,280
You know that, hey, Reverend Stang, you remember back there in Fort Worth and that boy named Patches?

125
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,220
Patches, he was a poor boy, but he was a great tap dancer.

126
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,480
All his britches were made out of patches.

127
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,120
You know, they wouldn't let him into the church, the regular church.

128
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,640
They said, get out of here with them Patches britches on.

129
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,480
Patches.

130
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,500
Get out of here, Patch britch boy.

131
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,500
But the bitches in the subgenius church.

132
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,600
That's what they said.

133
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,280
They liked the way he dangled in them patches.

134
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,820
Patches, get out of here with them Patches britches or I'm going to make you my prison bitch.

135
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,520
And so Patches.

136
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,940
They said that at church, too.

137
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,260
They did?

138
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,000
And so Philo scratched Patches' itches.

139
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,920
In churches.

140
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,100
And quit his bitching.

141
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,640
He did a batch of bitching that one night, though.

142
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,700
It is a new, not only a new year.

143
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,500
Some batching scratching.

144
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,520
Millennium.

145
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,980
It is a whole new millennium coming forth.

146
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,800
Wow.

147
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,240
As we, together.

148
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,940
Look at that, a new millennium.

149
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:17,680
The subgenii of the Bay Area and the Midwest, Mestern Western, come together.

150
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,780
Do you understand the Mestern Western show?

151
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,260
Ascendancy.

152
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,400
As we go forward.

153
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,700
Into what is now the only millennium that truly exists.

154
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,440
So are the subgeniuses going to be at Burning Man next year?

155
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,920
Yes, I'm afraid so.

156
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,940
We're at Burning Man every year.

157
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,520
Every single year.

158
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,920
We were at Burning Man before it was Burning Man.

159
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,540
That's true.

160
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,120
In fact, you know, it's a little known fact that the subgenius church is part of why Burning Man exists.

161
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
It really is.

162
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,560
It's just why I partly believe that Warm Boy should be there.

163
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,580
Did it start with Jainer talking about that burning monk?

164
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,620
I'm sorry, yes, it did start with Jainer.

165
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,380
No, that was actually 1988 or so.

166
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,200
That was when Trelloid still walked upon him.

167
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,900
Wow.

168
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,240
All hail Trelloid.

169
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,420
Yeah, yeah.

170
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,960
We're going over the subgenius history here on KPFA.

171
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,560
Let's rewind now back to 1982.

172
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,560
We're taking 1982 into 2001.

173
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,340
Doug Wellman used the sound effect.

174
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,380
On the air to represent a tape rewinding.

175
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,820
But when was the baby?

176
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,840
Since 1980, you've been getting tapes of me doing it.

177
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:39,200
And then of course we took the and made it into the West Coast.

178
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,500
Which then degenerated into .

179
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,620
What about Mama?

180
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,600
Where did Mama fit into it?

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,820
That was my Mama.

182
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,500
I thought that was Sterno.

183
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:53,920
Your Mama.

184
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,380
That was Sterno going, your Mama.

185
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,080


186
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,260
I'm the guest.

187
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,360
It's I who honor Sterno.

188
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,400
Frozen Graves.

189
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,020
Oh, I see.

190
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,100
As long as you honor somebody, you can then claim it as yours.

191
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,180
Sure, yeah, yeah.

192
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,240
I always do.

193
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,300
I honor you, Stang, for giving me the money.

194
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:18,260
You're listening to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Swag.

195
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,800
Now I really do have to say, I'm a fan of the radio.

196
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:20,800


197
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:20,800


198
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:20,800


199
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:20,800


200
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:20,800


201
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:20,800


202
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:20,800


203
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,000
Oh, please don't look in the mirror.

204
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,040
You're not going to like what you see there.

205
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,360
Principal.

206
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,080
Principal.

207
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,400
Oh, yes, dear friends.

208
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,240
This is Li Li Jing, the Chinese subgenius.

209
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,440
And you are listening to the Hour of Swag.

210
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,220
Oh, yes, it's so true.

211
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,380
Thank you, Li Jing.

212
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,340
I got a call from China just this morning.

213
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,020
The high priestess of all Asia.

214
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,880
You know, friends, if you had joined up.

215
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,120
If you'd been the first person on your continent to join up with the church, you'd be the pope

216
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,100
of this continent.

217
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:56,740
I know.

218
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,180
Dr. G. Gordon Gordon here.

219
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,520
I am the pope of South America.

220
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,360
The entire continent of South America.

221
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,920
It's mine.

222
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,920
When those souls.

223
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,120
Ah, the harvest, friends.

224
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:11,580
When we start collecting those souls, you know who's going to get to skim, to skim that

225
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,360
fine, fine layer off the top out of the soul rendering vat, don't you, friend?

226
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,860
Oh, and they're trying to keep them from selling any kind of soul.

227
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,120
They're trying to keep the soul down there nowadays.

228
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,700
Oh, yeah.

229
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,940
They don't.

230
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,220
Used to be in the old days, you couldn't give it away.

231
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,000
And now it's against the law to sell it.

232
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,880
So what are you going to do?

233
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,160
And all the religions want to have your soul, friends.

234
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,040
Bob wants your soul, but just temporarily.

235
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,540
He'll give it back after he's took the squeezes.

236
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,220
And he only uses it a little bit while he's got it, friends.

237
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,460
That's something to think about.

238
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,640
He doesn't dry you out.

239
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,300
That's right.

240
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,980
I'm going to go to the church.

241
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,440
I'm going to go to the church.

242
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,660
I'm going to go to the church.

243
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:49,860
I'm going to go to the church.

244
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:49,860


245
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:49,860


246
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:18,660
If I stay in that slowing and

247
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:26,740
Jesus walking in the sky, walking in, walking out.

248
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,580
One day a shiny silver psychedelic spaceship

249
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,380
took a long trip from the outskirts of heaven to the 7-Eleven.

250
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,240
They had a funeral going in the parking lot for the second going of Jesus.

251
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,700
And if he ever comes around again, I'll be the first to stick the spike in.

252
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,480
And if he ever comes around again, I'll be the first to stick the spike in.

253
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,820
And I get occupied with those lost things she can't even leave me.

254
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,300
And I get occupied with those lost things she can't even leave me.

255
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,680
And what is this spaceship doing?

256
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,420
Let's hope, let's hope now.

257
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,540
Let's hope now.

258
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,560
Let's hope now.

259
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,360
Let's hope now.

260
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,460
Yes, my dear, dear, dear friends.

261
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,560
That was the great, groovy Neptune.

262
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:47,100
With the song, Parameds on Mars, from his new CD.

263
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,460
groovy gravy, man.

264
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,540
Well, actually, it's just called groovy gravy.

265
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,840
You can contact the great groovy Neptune

266
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,140
or see its website at

267
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,380
Neptune.itgo.com

268
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,720
That's Neptune.itgo.com

269
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,440
And tonight, friends, it's a show battle

270
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,680
between the sub-shows of the ancient past,

271
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,560
like the KPFA Berkeley show of last Christmas

272
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,100
or just before New Year's

273
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,300
with Dr. Philodrum and guesting on Cuzzling Evidence's show.

274
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,020
And, of course, Einstein's Secret Orchestra Swamp Radio

275
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,040
hosted by Dr. Chaz Smith

276
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,040
and starring Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

277
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,780
a broadcaster from WCSB in Cleveland

278
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,600
and also with yours truly,

279
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,420
as a guest.

280
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,160
And, friends, at least it ain't reruns of Hour of Slack.

281
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,980
I've had to trip through four hours of Slack

282
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,400
in the last couple of days

283
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,300
to get things done ahead of time

284
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,440
because of our upcoming subgenius church field trip

285
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,340
to Amsterdam.

286
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,660
And the main reason we go to Amsterdam in a group

287
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,500
is so that we can come back and irritate our friends

288
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,720
by regaling them with tales of our ripping

289
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,580
and fripping times.

290
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,000
I get tired of people telling me

291
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,260
that they're tripping all the time

292
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,220
when it's so obvious.

293
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
Their faces have changed,

294
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,140
like blue and red things are coming out,

295
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,900
you know, wearing green.

296
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,180
And one eye is dribbling down the side of their face.

297
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,860
And they've got this kind of ripping.

298
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,780
And they're giggling.

299
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,300
It's cute.

300
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,020
You can tell they're high on something.

301
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,980
You know, the wall behind them is kind of like melting.

302
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:41,980
Yeah.

303
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,880
And all the black light posters around them

304
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,860
are fountaining.

305
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,280
Yeah.

306
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,420
I find them very disturbing to the environment.

307
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,880
Try and get them in your car

308
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,720
and have the windshield start melting

309
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,020
and have the radio playing.

310
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,460
It looks like toothpaste is coming out of the radio.

311
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,420
Man, you want to throw them right out of your car

312
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,380
and they still laugh as they roll down the freeway.

313
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,420
It seemed like everybody I looked at was tripping

314
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,900
because they were all just melting.

315
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,300
And they're, you know, they put on this music

316
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,240
that tasted like ice cream.

317
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,200
The air was tripping.

318
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,840
Hey, Mom.

319
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,540
Um.

320
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,660
One of the crackers.

321
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,900
Is that what you called them?

322
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,120
I thought it was...

323
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,380
Okay.

324
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,280
Hey, man.

325
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,420
Am I still sweating?

326
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,500
Hey, hey, I heard...

327
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,600
No, you're in New York, man.

328
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,540
You're in the Greenwich Village.

329
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,420
I heard that you had shrooms.

330
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:37,740
Shrooms.

331
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,540
They wanted a pound of flesh.

332
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,880
They wanted that which makes you alive.

333
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,260
They wanted your soul.

334
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,580
That's what they do want, the trippies.

335
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,860
They want a piece.

336
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,820
Could you make some coffee for us, man?

337
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,380
We've been walking out of the rain.

338
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,460
It's cold, I think.

339
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,620
Yeah, yeah, sit down.

340
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,040
Sure.

341
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,620
How did you get up?

342
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,520
Um, I don't know.

343
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,060
It was like, I think it was yesterday,

344
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,580
but this one kid died.

345
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,900
I think he died.

346
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,400
Um.

347
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:07,960
He was in the woods.

348
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,480
Well, yeah, that's where we found him first.

349
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,440
Down by the lake.

350
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,400
He almost got ran over by a pontoon boat.

351
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,020
He came to study consciousness,

352
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,760
but he ended up with his pants around his ankles

353
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,140
down by the lake,

354
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,160
freezing at dawn,

355
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,520
wondering what had happened.

356
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,260
Where, where, where?

357
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,240
My name is St. Andrew KSC

358
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,300
of Chicago, Illinois,

359
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,860
and I'm here to tell all of you

360
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,760
about the wonders and the truth

361
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,460
that is behind J.R. Bob Dobbs.

362
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,140
Can I hear an amen, brothers and sisters?

363
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,840
That is right.

364
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,560
Let me tell you right off the bat,

365
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,800
I was here earlier today.

366
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,980
I saw three fine young women here

367
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,680
who have not been ordained

368
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,720
in the Church of the Subgenius

369
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,360
because they didn't have the money.

370
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,380
$30 for salvation.

371
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,940
The only $30,

372
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,720
you can't even get a good hand job

373
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,260
in Chicago for $30.

374
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,900
But in this church,

375
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,540
if you pay your $30 from the body,

376
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,100
you will have more sex, more slack,

377
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,020
more fuck, more booze,

378
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,240
more anything that you want,

379
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,400
anything that you could ever dream about.

380
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,260
And it all comes with a money-back guarantee.

381
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,860
If you foof off yourself dead

382
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,320
and in the pits of hell,

383
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,040
with the flames of Satan licking your ass,

384
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,820
you will get a signed $90 check

385
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,860
from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

386
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,760
Can I hear another amen?

387
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,820
Your people are not stoked up enough for this shit.

388
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,660
You are not in the mood in order to be saved.

389
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,200
You need to get down on yourself,

390
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,920
get jiggy with it even if you have to,

391
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,460
because you know Will Smith is getting more pussy than you

392
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,980
because you haven't saved $30 to Bob.

393
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,640
No!

394
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,240
Sire, there is no more money.

395
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,660
We gotta get some money.

396
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,880
That dirty, purgish, hark-a-back,

397
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,880
flackin' whartin' Philip Duncan Burton,

398
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,160
purgaluma Burton,

399
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,280
dirtin' bostonite,

400
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,680
whacker-frazz,

401
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,660
whack-a-flaughtin' back-car,

402
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,380
and that kind of back-wrack-a-lattle.

403
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,100
Oof!

404
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,900
Ah, yes, dear friends,

405
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,740
St. Andrew at the Tampa Defifle.

406
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,540
And now, friends, let's go back to

407
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,400
Dr. Wood,

408
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,400
Dr. Philo Trumman,

409
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,760
and puzzling evidence with some more subgenius history

410
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,920
to be followed by some new non-music by New Monet.

411
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,400
I'm gonna be at an old person's convention that day.

412
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,020
Because the show will have been retired.

413
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,920
I'll be at a place where there's a lot of old people.

414
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,320
Oh, work?

415
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,440
They'll be having fun.

416
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,480
So is this gonna be the 20th anniversary?

417
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,580
I'll be whacking them on the head with this big long board.

418
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,680
20th anniversary of what?

419
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,940
It's got floppy appendages hanging over it.

420
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,800
This show?

421
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,380
This show started in June of 1982.

422
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,820
Was it that long ago?

423
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,640
Yeah, when it was, uh, Rob Nelson.

424
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,840
June of 1982?

425
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,780
Yeah.

426
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,400
I'll remember that for sure.

427
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,380
Yeah, because it was Ivan Stang and Lies and myself.

428
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

429
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,120
Get your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!

430
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,560
You want to touch my monkey?

431
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,940
I don't make monkeys, I just train them!

432
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,840
No more monkey business!

433
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,580
No!

434
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,620
No more monkey business!

435
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,820
Birds and the bees and the monkey babies.

436
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,380
I've seen them all!

437
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,060
All right, Bob's Banda!

438
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,280
Uh, uh.

439
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:52,040
Uh, uh, what does this have to do with Bob Slack and the conspiracy, the great themes which has driven the church?

440
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,700
Well, I'll ask you a question.

441
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,360
Well, just decide that...

442
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,480
Should we be concerned with George Bush being in the White House a fundamentalist Christian?

443
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
Or is this all part of Bob's plan?

444
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,200
All I know is that what language did Jesus speak on the cross?

445
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,560
Mayan

446
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,680
Yeah

447
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,240
It wasn't Aramaic, it was Mayan

448
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,400
Eli, Eli, Eli, Sabahana

449
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,200
Well you can just ask him, he's probably not awake right now

450
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,960
Everybody knows this, classic Mayan

451
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,760
It means

452
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,500
Mu, sad-eyed and bearded

453
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,140
Come down with your fierce temper

454
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,720
Wow

455
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,020
That's what it means

456
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,900
Because he was actually asking for revenge

457
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,000
On all those people

458
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,680
He's been misquoted because they thought he was speaking Aramaic

459
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,700
Hey dude, where's my car?

460
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,540
In Aramaic it means something like

461
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,740
Father, father, why hast thou forsaken me?

462
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,800
Oh, father, father

463
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,340
Where's my tandoori chicken?

464
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,840
In Mayan it means move

465
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,420
Come down and release your fierce temper

466
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,600
Thank you, thank you

467
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,180
In English it means

468
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,540
Please pass the

469
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,160
Kefeltifish

470
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,780
Oh

471
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,060
It's luminous blue

472
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,000
What is the next great frontier

473
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,640
Lonesome cowboy Dave?

474
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,620
The next great frontier

475
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,420
Is the frontier of the human mind

476
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,520
Delineated and demarcated

477
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,840
Sans frontiers

478
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,640
By only its only

479
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,300
Limited imagination

480
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,820
Imagination

481
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,300
Okay, alright, then I'll just forget about it

482
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,080
Can I get

483
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,200
The mind has been completely mapped and explored

484
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,760
And I'm not going to

485
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,660
The mind is still a vast frontier

486
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,500
Where very few have ever truly tried

487
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,260
Your mind maybe

488
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,500
The mind is still a place filled with cavernous muscles

489
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,560
And tiny little tissues which no one can reach

490
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,100
Except for their own cerebellum

491
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,880
The human or normal mind

492
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,960
Has been completely worked out by marketing companies

493
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,560
And conspiracy medical science

494
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,060
The last hundred years

495
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,180
They've had it down

496
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,180
Down, down

497
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,220
What the ancient Reese's have told us

498
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,020
That by properly using our minds

499
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,640
We can even fly as if gossamer on wings of felt

500
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,180
Is that what the ancient Reese's monkeys told you?

501
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,440
Not the Reese's monkeys

502
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,940
The Reese's of ancient India

503
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,020
You gotta lose your shit in order to fly

504
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,940
Anybody who finds himself that far off the ground

505
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,920
Without knowing why

506
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,900
Loses their shit

507
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,100
And that's a truism

508
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,220
And a falsehood

509
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,740
Tish, tish, tish

510
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,600
Tish, tish, tish

511
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,980
And it's nice to hear your show return

512
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,020
To a slower, more deliberate pacing

513
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,500
But of course that's the edited version

514
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,960
Over here we're doing the unedited version

515
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,840
Of the last show on the balloon

516
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,160
Yes, yes

517
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,080
But don't let it be forgot

518
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,580
That ere there was a spot

519
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,920
For one brief shining moment

520
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,780
Known as Camelot

521
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,720
In short, there's simply not a more congenial spot

522
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,700
Than happy ever aftering here in Camelot

523
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,260
Okay, I got it

524
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,160
I think that now that the bushes are back in

525
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,280
I think it's gonna be like Camelot

526
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,820
It is a lot like Camelot

527
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,220
Oh, certainly dad bush

528
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,560
I like that

529
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,040
I like the bushes

530
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,640
Now see, this is kind of like

531
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,720
This is really George Bush's second term

532
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,120
Yeah, exactly

533
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,100
Oh, no lie

534
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
It's like, uh

535
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,660
It's like the

536
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,140
We're rolling now, folks

537
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,780
Line

538
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,700
You know, it's like the emperor

539
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,400
Bush dynasty

540
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,540
We'll be rolling our way

541
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,660
I meant to bring my new

542
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,680
My new mix

543
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:27,620
Mixotology tape

544
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:27,880
That's low, I know

545
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,600
We didn't get the new mixotology

546
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,680
Actually, I have it on a CD in the car

547
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,020
But I'd have to go out there in the cold and rain

548
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,620
We should get it

549
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,400
So we can play the

550
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,860
See, there is your car driving away

551
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,700
Because you said that

552
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,280
Hey, come back here

553
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,140
So do you think that the news will be more entertaining now

554
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,180
In the next four years?

555
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,000
No, I think so

556
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,920
Because at least for those of us on the left

557
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,740
Or where we call ourselves the left

558
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,640
You know, you gotta have a target

559
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,400
I feel now like those right-wingers did

560
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,240
When Clinton was president

561
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,520
I always believed that

562
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,080
A vote against your conscience

563
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,800
Is a vote against boredom

564
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,060
I just wish Jesse Ventura had won

565
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,420
Me too

566
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,320
I really want him to win

567
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:05,360
I think so

568
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,900
You know, that made me so happy

569
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,840
When he was governor

570
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,660
And I thought that he should be president

571
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,100
Because he's stronger than those other guys

572
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,860
I think he should

573
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,540
No kidding

574
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,100
He kicked

575
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,520
But, you know, he's gonna be in the XFL now

576
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,700
He's got a new job in the XFL

577
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,860
Working for Vince McMahon

578
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,200
Really?

579
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:22,700
Yeah

580
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,680
When you lose it out there

581
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,340
You're in a world of hurt

582
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,080
Oh, you're doing Dennis Miller now?

583
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,260
You're out of control

584
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,600
Sure

585
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,620

We're out of here

590
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,480
See ya

591
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:55,500
Bye

00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,060
Thanks for watching

Gun or a job.

Thank you.

604
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,400
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

605
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,220
Hey, how you doing?

606
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,760
I appreciate you very much for the opportunity to speak with you tonight.

607
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,700
Oh, you know, it's our president, too.

608
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,100
And we are rolling, folks.

609
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:40,960
I'm rolling.

610
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,980
Getting ready for the second Bush dynasty.

611
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,460
Rolling, rolling.

612
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,060
Keeps them takes dicks rolling.

613
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,600
The Soptynia Show.

614
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,580
Rolling.

615
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,420
Oh, hi.

616
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,360
We'll be in the picture.

617
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,540
And then you'll see it on the air.

618
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,340
And then they'll be.

619
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,000
We knock down with the presidential election special.

620
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Oh, my God, what is that?

621
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,920
So funny it's just some guys saying I'm rolling.

622
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

623
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,920
Auto Democrats roll.

624
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,420
That's up in broken here.

625
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,840
Yeah, we're on the field.

626
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,400
Wow.

627
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:25,400


628
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:26,540


629
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,760
From the cradle to the grave

630
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,640
Someone got their eye on you

631
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,580
Someone got their eye on you

632
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,800
Someone got their eye on you

633
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,700
Someone got their eye on you

634
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,680
Someone got their eye on you

635
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:47,680
Someone got their eye on you

636
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:17,080
Someone got their eye on you

637
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:35,740
Someone got their eye on you

638
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:17,540
Someone got their eye on you

639
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:47,320
Someone got their eye on you

640
00:29:47,700 --> 00:30:16,920
Someone got their eye on you

641
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,120
Someone got their eye on you

642
00:30:47,700 --> 00:31:16,740
Someone got their eye on you

643
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:47,680
Someone got their eye on you

644
00:31:47,700 --> 00:32:17,680
Someone got their eye on you

645
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,680
Someone got their eye on you

646
00:32:47,700 --> 00:33:17,440
Someone got their eye on you

647
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:47,680
Someone got their eye on you

648
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:54,000
Someone got their eye on you

649
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:25,700
Because that blanket hating of abstract concepts is exactly the main conspiracy construct.

650
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:35,760
We must hate individual Christians and Republicans and Democrats and individual, you know, people.

651
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:45,080
Because the group, the them that you start hating, that's just a conspiracy defined sub-conspiracy.

652
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,040
I don't mean sub-conspiracy.

653
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:54,900
It's there to lull and lure certain especially frustrated sub-geniuses into thinking that there's a simple answer to everything.

654
00:34:55,180 --> 00:35:04,180
And this us versus them crap is in fact the very sort of mass fuzzy thinking that the conspiracy invented.

655
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,520
Not Bob, there's no us and there's no them.

656
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,700
There's just you, me, and everybody else.

657
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,740
But then you go, but what if the alternative conspiracies?

658
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,020
Can't I believe in anything?

659
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,540
Any of those?

660
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,380
Can't, you know, aren't some of them at least cool?

661
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:31,680
You know, the jokers, the deformed people, the outcasts, the trans and sexuals, you know, the mutants, the retards, and the hideous super geniuses in wheelchairs.

662
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,020
You know, what of, what of, what of them?

663
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,460
What of the bonobos, onobos, and monobos?

664
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,060
What of these once beloved minorities?

665
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,480
Must we distrust and hate them too and slay them?

666
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,620
Instead of worshipping them as we sub-genii always used to worship those weirdos and geeks?

667
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,760
In other words, can't we just kill without hating?

668
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:13,100
You know, it's enough that we're slowly, that on X-Day we're going to slowly dismember entire cities full of ignorant, disbelieving normals.

669
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,660
Do we have to drag hate into it?

670
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,800
Do we have to dirty up our clean killing with hate?

671
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,320
Friends, I don't, I don't feel that that's necessary.

672
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,460
I don't feel we need to lower ourselves to that kind of behavior.

673
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,160
Hating while killing.

674
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,560
We'll kill them!

675
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,540
Let's have the internet shut down.

676
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,420
I want them off the internet tomorrow.

677
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,660
If the Scientologists can do it, we can do it.

678
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,960
Stop the bandwidth.

679
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,900
I'm calling, I'm calling Ma Bell tomorrow.

680
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,920
And he can do it.

681
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,300
He can do it too. He knows the Bells.

682
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,880
I know Mrs. Bell. I'm going to give her a call and I'm going to ream her out.

683
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,440
And the crowd goes crazy.

684
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,740
Not much of a crowd.

685
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,640
Well, it's early in the morning.

686
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,280
It's early out here.

687
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,740
We have a last sub-genius show.

688
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,380
Yeah.

689
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,140
There's probably 20, 30 people there.

690
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,420
How many people can't be the last sub-genius show?

691
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,140
And how many people will come to the one on Flash's property?

692
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,420
Are we going to be able to do that on Flash's property?

693
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,260
The scariest thing in the world.

694
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:22,220
Why would we do anything on Flash's property if he doesn't have a hot tub?

695
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,360
Oh, yeah, you're right.

696
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,460
Because he's got two big legs.

697
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,460
Well, legs, great.

698
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,060
To throw Ivan Stang into, get it?

699
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,060
Yeah, it's like shooting Bob.

700
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,600
I know, exactly.

701
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,180
They did produce some amazing photographs, though, just like shooting Bob.

702
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,380
Yeah, just like shooting Bob.

703
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,860
Done there, been that.

704
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:44,700
Yeah.

705
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:53,680
Hey, if either one of you guys ended up at X-Day, you know, you'd see the next ones in line to get roasted.

706
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,640
I'll be there.

707
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,920
I can't wait to get roasted.

708
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,360
I'll be there.

709
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,660
Bob would love to get his revenge on puzzling evidence.

710
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,220
I know that for a fact.

711
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,960
Bob just wants to pay me back the money he owes me.

712
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,000
Yeah, oh, Byron has that money, Philo.

713
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,660
Yeah, it's been...

714
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,880
A guy gave it to Byron.

715
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,300
Along with your frock.

716
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,040
What's the matter?

717
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,380
Haven't you ever seen a man with throat cancer before?

718
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,160
I understand Byron still has your frock.

719
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,620
Is that right?

720
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,640
Thank you, yeah, thank you.

721
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,780
No, you have Byron's frock, and you need to give that back to him.

722
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,080
I couldn't remember who had it, but I knew one of us had it.

723
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,380
You have it, and you need to give it back to him.

724
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,600
I don't have it anymore.

725
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,480
I'm sorry.

726
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,260
Something happened to it.

727
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:40,100
It was in my possession for a long time, but little by little, it's just kind of flickered away somehow.

728
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,740
I don't know how it disappeared on its own like that.

729
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,920
It started out about a pound, and then little by little over the years...

730
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,320
Yeah, it was a pound of really good frock.

731
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,760
It dwindled down to nothing on its own.

732
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,240
It's sort of like it just...

733
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,460
Like the will of the wisps, or like the...

734
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:55,560
It was so beautiful.

735
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,000
The, um...

736
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,240
It was...

737
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,000
The legendary manna from heaven.

738
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,220
It sort of just dwindled away in the sunlight over the years.

739
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,940
The very manna of...

740
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,220
Manners of heaven.

741
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,480
And this was the gift of the subgeniuses.

742
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,360
If you go out in the street right now, you'll see the streets covered with haverfrop ziplocks.

743
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:14,760
They were talking about manna.

744
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,560
They were talking about banana.

745
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,020
Brought to you by the subgeniuses.

746
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,520
The subgenius church.

747
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,600
I got a banana from heaven.

748
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,600
I remember that.

749
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:26,240
I remember when I was eight years old, I saw Bob on night flight.

750
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,900
It changed my life.

751
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,060
And you let me down, man.

752
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,520
You let me down.

753
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,480
Come on, caller.

754
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,120
Be brave.

755
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:35,580
Poor Bob.

756
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,660
Light your own pipe.

757
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,960
He's gotten the brunt of all of our jokes.

758
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,420
Brody Culpepper just came back on Christmas Day from Laos,

759
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,980
and he said the entire population near Dobbstown, Malaysia...

760
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,060
walks around with little bob pipes.

761
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,560
Everybody.

762
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,880
Well, they were doing that back in the 60s.

763
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,300
Yeah, but no people were going there to look at it, so it wasn't really happening.

764
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,920
Wink, wink.

765
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,100
Oh, yeah.

766
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,900
I'll see you again, old scratch.

767
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,080
What are those funny things sticking out of your head?

768
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,320
Those are our antenna.

769
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,000
Are you a television set?

770
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,460
What in the ding-dong heck-a-madoodle hell is that?

771
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,020
Let's see if you bleed clean.

772
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,660
Chlorophyll.

773
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,640
Plants.

774
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:25,600
And the most cunning and savage of all life forms.

775
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,840
I was following up on a lead to what some might consider just another New York City massacre.

776
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:34,760
A pretty woman thrown out of a high-rise window, her Japanese husband disemboweled,

777
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,940
and their two kids turned into shredded wheat.

778
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,800
Do you know what it's like to be violated by a 300-pound Filipino skinhead named Gunther?

779
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,160
It ain't no picnic.

780
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,140
Stop living in dreams.

781
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,880
No woman can travel the world without a man to defend her.

782
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,760
Please allow me to introduce myself.

783
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,320
I'm a woman of wealth and taste.

784
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,080
I've been around for long, long years.

785
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,420
Seen many men go to waste.

786
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:26,260
I was round when Jesus Christ had his moments of doubt and pain.

787
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:34,300
Made damn sure the pilot washed his hands and sealed his fate.

788
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,460
Pleased to meet you.

789
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,820
Hope you guessed my name.

790
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,060
I'm a woman of wealth and taste.

791
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,260
I'm not so good at shoutin' and makein' up excuses.

792
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,260


793
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,820
It's the nature of my game.

794
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:58,240
I hung around St. Petersburg till I saw it was time for a change.

795
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,520
I killed the Tsar and the ministers.

796
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,220
Anastasia screamed in vain.

797
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:15,440
I joined the ranks in the General's tent as the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank.

798
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,580
And I shouted, who killed the Kennedys?

799
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,440
Well, after all, it was you and me.

800
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,820
Please, teacher, hope you guessed my name.

801
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,820
That thing that's puzzling to you.

802
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,340
It's the nature of my game.

803
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:46,240
Now, just as every cough is a thrill, and every sink a scent,

804
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:54,120
heads or tails just call me Lucifer, cause I'm in the middle of some restraint.

805
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:02,500
If you need me, have some courtesy, have some sympathy, and some taste.

806
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:10,680
Accept your well-earned apologies, or I'll lay your soul to waste.

807
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:22,620
Please, teacher, hope you guessed my name.

808
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,460
Who?

809
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,800
Lucifer?

810
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:03,800


811
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,220
joining in.

812
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,220
Uh, Earth

813
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,080
back to Mars.

814
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,100
But friends,

815
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,640
as we sort of start to wrap

816
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,440
up here, I want to leave you with

817
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,560
a thought

818
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,560
or several.

819
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,360
Consider these

820
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,580
alternate titles.

821
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,600
Earth Needs

822
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,240
Women.

823
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,580
Angry Blue

824
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,380
Planet.

825
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,460
Robinson Crusoe

826
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,400
on Earth.

827
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,320
Mission to Earth.

828
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:40,920
Uh,

829
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,740
Abin Costello Go to Earth.

830
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,360
Earth Attacks.

831
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,240
The Earth Chronicles.

832
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,440
Or even Reproduction Cycle

833
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,520
Among Lower Lifeforms Under the Rocks

834
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,180
of Earth. Now think of these alternate

835
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,000
titles. The Day

836
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,040
Mars Stood Still.

837
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,040
20 Million Miles to Mars.

838
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,300
Mars Versus

839
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,520
the Flying Saucers.

840
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,280
Now,

841
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,580
why do those somehow

842
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,180
ring true?

843
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,260
Maybe some of you, they didn't ring

844
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,240
true. You said, what? What the hell

845
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,020
is he talking about?

846
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,980
Well, friends, some of us, and I think

847
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,500
I think you

848
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,260
some of us have felt

849
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,200
for a long time that we're on the

850
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,260
wrong planet. As Susie

851
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,320
the Floozy put it, right hemisphere,

852
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,540
wrong planet.

853
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,020
Well,

854
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,300
you know, we always assumed, well, that's

855
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,420
because we're subgenius descendants of the

856
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,000
Yeti. We don't have pure blood

857
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,600
human genes, you know. We're, of course

858
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,920
we feel a little left out, but

859
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,300
you know, we begin, we've begun to

860
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,800
suspect because of certain

861
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,320
clues Bob left, mostly in

862
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,240
cheesy B-grade science fiction

863
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:51,740
movies.

864
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,440
Now,

865
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,360
this sounds, again, this sounds ridiculous.

866
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,380
Ludicrous to the

867
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,420
polished ears of the modernist, perhaps.

868
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,980
But, you know, it's

869
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,340
theoretically possible to bump a planet

870
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,320
out of its orbit.

871
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,240
Totally out of its orbit.

872
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,360
Put it into a new orbit. It might even

873
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,480
be possible to switch the orbit

874
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,240
of one planet with another one

875
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,780
that was a similar size.

876
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,520
Could it be

877
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,200
that the reason some of us

878
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,220
do not feel at home is because

879
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,240
we were native to the

880
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,200
planet now called by us

881
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,440
Mars, but which was originally

882
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,340
the one true Earth, and

883
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,780
in which, in fact, we,

884
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,000
the Martians, are in fact the only

885
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,820
true Earth people, and the

886
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,160
conspiracy of the normals,

887
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,360
in fact, the ones who, oddly

888
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,240
enough, seem to be trying to turn this

889
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,320
planet into a

890
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,820
place with a poisonous

891
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,060
atmosphere, a dry

892
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,860
desert covered with

893
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,840
just rock and concrete.

894
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,180
Maybe

895
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,200
somebody's pulled a trick

896
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,020
on us somewhere. Well, of course, now

897
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,140
at this point you're thinking, yes, that

898
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,120
all makes perfect sense. Earth was

899
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,260
switched with Mars. The true Martians

900
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,160
are us, and no wonder we

901
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,680
feel out of place, and the

902
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,200
true, the false Martians

903
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,280
are trying to turn this planet into a false

904
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,120
Mars with, you know,

905
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,060
carbon dioxide atmosphere and so

906
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,840
forth. Now,

907
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,060
and you all agree with that, right? That

908
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,820
makes sense. Here's the tricky part.

909
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,560
It happened in 1953,

910
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,140
and no one noticed.

911
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,060
I'm going to

912
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,120
leave you, I'm

913
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,000
going to charge you with thinking,

914
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,020
about that. How did they switch

915
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,540
planets in 1953

916
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,100
without any of us ever noticing?

917
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:40,780
Could

918
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,480
we be that

919
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,740
totally out of it? Could

920
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,020
perhaps the reason that X-Day hasn't

921
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,380
happened yet be that

922
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,740
1998 hasn't happened yet,

923
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,260
and that they kept it

924
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,840
1943 for 10 years

925
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,860
or something like that, and no one

926
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,720
even knew the difference.

927
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,460
Everybody cuff now.

928
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,000
It's time to be carnivorous,

929
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,620
with your friends and family.

930
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,660
Everybody cuff down

931
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,820
and pull out a paring knife, because we're going to

932
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,160
remove the sockets around Grandma and Grandpa's

933
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,200
eyes. They made a delectable

934
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,880
treat for afternoons.

935
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,280
Summer of pickles,

936
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,180
sitting by the old patio,

937
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,140
maybe talking to the fire.

938
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,000
It's time to go back.

939
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,620
We must get it off.

940
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,080
Talking to the fire.

941
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,020
It is time to get it off.

942
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,080
Shut up.

943
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,520
The boom is calling you now.

944
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,320
You can feel it for miles

945
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,660
and miles. Back to Mars.

946
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,240
The boom is calling you now.

947
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,200
Back to Mars.

948
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,920
The aroma is in the air.

949
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,720
You can sniff the aroma.

950
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,280
You can feel it.

951
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,540
It is talking to you.

952
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,460
The boom is talking

953
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,640
to you now.

954
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,020
How the hell?

955
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,520
It is

956
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:58,980
later

957
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,640
than

958
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,140
now.

959
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,180
You think

960
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,020
as we descend upon the minds

961
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:11,260
of the members of the Cabinet of the United States

962
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,060
Government and the Senate, the Congress

963
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,260
and the other representatives,

964
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,660
the representatives of the governments of the world,

965
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,460
we shall find in each one of them

966
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,120
the chip is completely unaltered.

967
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,880
The plan is now

968
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,500
in stage go.

969
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,160
The green light is lit and everyone is

970
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,720
smoking. The lamp

971
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,020
is at your feet, old Buddha.

972
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,760
Please, please,

973
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:33,980
put that back on.

974
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,180
I can't stand the sight of it.

975
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,740
It's dead.

976
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,800
The exhibitionist Buddha.

977
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,520
Little mentioned

978
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,720
in ancient texts.

979
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,840
Slathering Siddhartha,

980
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,060
he was called for his bow-legged

981
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,960
appurtenance and the strange

982
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,980
way he made the women in Gopi's cry

983
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:56,240
as they ran from the villages in fright.

984
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,980
For this is a matter

985
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,260
of life or death.

986
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,900
Your lives,

987
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,820
the lives of everyone,

988
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,520
everyone on Earth.

989
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,820
At one o'clock on July 24th,

990
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,140
Zyra,

991
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,840
a new planet, will pass so close

992
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,760
to the Earth, it will cause

993
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,960
vast destruction.

994
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,880
Never before in the history

995
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,500
of the world has humanity

996
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,300
felt so close to God.

997
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,060
As Zyra inexorably rushes

998
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,880
toward us, perhaps to destroy

999
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,640
the Earth, men and women

1000
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,000
of all races and streams

1001
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,120
pause to think, to pray,

1002
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,520
and to atone.

1003
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,680
As the evacuation of coastal cities

1004
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,320
progressed, tales of individual acts

1005
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,680
of heroism and sacrifice

1006
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,040
poured into newspaper offices.

1007
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,580
So that's what's happening.

1008
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,980
How can we get out of here on a broken...

1009
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,640
The planet Zyra is heading

1010
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,800
towards Earth.

1011
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,380
We must not tell the people.

1012
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,920
As inexplicably as life itself,

1013
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,920
the planet Zyra hurtles closer

1014
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,760
and closer to Stang's head, you know.

1015
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,960
Stang's head equipped with a special

1016
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,880
antenna. 19-year-olds today are so

1017
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,800
stupid, you could probably play that.

1018
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,600
on the radio and they'd believe it.

1019
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,020
No, no, they would not believe

1020
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,580
that the planet Zyra is actually

1021
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,500
approaching us. That's exactly why they

1022
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,860
let us play it on the radio.

1023
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,660
Just think if you were one of those skanks

1024
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,180
who had enough dough. Only those

1025
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,300
teenagers would believe it.

1026
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,680
Only the sub... and the subgenius

1027
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,620
would believe in anything.

1028
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:24,740
Praise God.

1029
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,780
Praise God.

1030
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,960
Praise God.

1031
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,040

without an O.

1035
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,580
Although we do have a decoy one

1036
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,580
there for the real subgeniuses

1037
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,900
so they won't get lost.

1038
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,540
And you

1039
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,860

00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:45,660
Now if you want to send your tapes or CDs or videos to me, Reverend Ivan Stang,

1049
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:50,480
my actual production studio is here at the Cleveland branch.

1050
00:52:50,820 --> 00:53:01,860
And you can send that to me at post office box 19355 in lovely Cleveland, Ohio 44.

1051
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,900
One one nine.

1052
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:12,400
And if that's too confusing, I'm Stang at subgenius.com friends.

1053
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,160
You can also, uh,

1054
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,480
you might want to get in touch with Einstein secret orchestra who's doing this

1055
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,860
music in the background and who has the show on WCSB on Thursday nights from

1056
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:28,320
which this show is scavenged like a Frankenstein's monster from the parts of

1057
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,520
dead shows.

1058
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,860
That's Einstein secret orchestra,

1063
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,820
Yes,

1064
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,180
friends.

1065
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:53,000
The church of the subgenius was born out of Bob in Dallas in the 19 in

1066
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,840
actually January 1st,

1067
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,420
1980.

1068
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,080
The pamphlet number one was first released,

1069
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,480
but my friends,

1070
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,920
it was never limited to Dallas,

1071
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,280
Dallas.

1072
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:02,540
We,

1073
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,420
it was a good place to begin the operations because it is a sterile town,

1074
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,620
a sterile city full of sterile pinks.

1075
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:15,300
Most of whom don't even come from Texas and,

1076
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:15,700
friends.

1077
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,040
I have gotten out.

1078
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:19,580
And of course,

1079
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:24,340
the church is in the hearts and minds of every subgenius everywhere.

1080
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:25,320
Uh,

1081
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,680
some find it on the internet.

1082
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,380
Some find it in the bookstore.

1083
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,880
Some find it in the junkyard.

1084
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,460
Uh,

1085
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:37,820
but the luckiest ones find it in the gutter at the bottom of a bottle of

1086
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,680
muscatel because friends,

1087
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:44,080
those are the ones that have reached the bottom that have yet achieved total

1088
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:51,380
slack through slacklessness and now can reverse their evolution as under Bob

1089
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:57,400
to become slackless millionaires who give all their money to Bob at post

00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:03,640

00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:03,860

1095
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,620

1096
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,640
let there be slack.

1097
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,740
Listen.

1098
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,900
Listen.

1099
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,240
Listen.

1100
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:28,480


1101
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:32,560
MMM.

1102
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,420
MMM.

1103
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:35,640
Music.

1104
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,100
MMM.

1105
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:39,740
Music.

1106
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:39,740


1107
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:40,120
MMM.

1108
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:44,540


1109
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:44,760


1110
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,060
Music.

1111
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,060
Music.

1112
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:48,500
Music.

1113
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,000
Music.

1114
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,000


1115
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,000


1116
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,000


1117
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,020
Music.

1118
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,220
Music.

1119
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:14,540
Thank you.

1120
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,860
Thank you.

1121
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,660
Thank you.

1122
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,240
Thank you.

1123
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,080
Thank you.

1124
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,300
Thank you.

1125
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,120
Thank you.

1126
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:35,920
Thank you.

1127
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,240
Thank you.

1128
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,060
Thank you.

1129
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:20,420
Okay, bye.

1130
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,000
Hello?

1131
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:23,900
Hello?

1132
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:25,080
Hello?

1133
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,120
Pardon me?

1134
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:26,960
Goldie?

1135
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,500
Uh, no, Goldie's not here.

1136
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:30,360
Yelda, you were talking to Mr. Miracle Man.

1137
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,200
Would you like to pump the obscenity?

1138
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,160
or would you just like to have your feet shaven?

1139
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,160
Well, I'm sorry you're going to have to wait

1140
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,140
because we're on wait mode, as you know, right now.

1141
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,540
As Scott and Mona have told us,

1142
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,620
we've been waiting here for the last 45 days

1143
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,800
and still there's no sign of it.

1144
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,280
We're calling it now Day 45.

1145
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:52,300
Can you tell us a little bit about where we stand right now, Riven?

1146
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,740
Well, yeah, that's exactly right.

1147
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,720
Day 45 and counting.

1148
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:02,240
Forty-five days until it is released.

1149
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,720
And it appears it will finally happen.

1150
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:08,040
And if tomorrow things go as the way they have been going

1151
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,500
and it's not likely to get much better,

1152
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,980
it'll probably be Day 46.

1153
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,980
It will be Day 46.

1154
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,560
It will be forever after Day 45.

1155
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:18,980
I'm going to say the wing.

1156
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:19,760
It will be it.

1157
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,240
For me and my family.

1158
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:21,960
It will be the world.

1159
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,260
I've been excruciating.

1160
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:27,020
My little dog, Norris, left me something in the mail.

1161
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,920
And the rest of my family just broke up.

1162
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,580
As it were, they didn't even bother to call me.

1163
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,260
They just, and it files a little splitter.

1164
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:37,200
I saw those horrible little melting pieces.

1165
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,320
We've had calls like this from everyone in town.

1166
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:45,220
In fact, everybody called at one time to tell us that everything is collapsing.

1167
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,360
It is, and it's time to go.

1168
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,960
Back to our original component parts.

1169
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,080
Keep your head on tight.

1170
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,000
Back to the wing.

1171
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,820
You're sacked in the saddle.

1172
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,400
Try to keep from bleeding.

1173
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,700
This is ESO Radio.

1174
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:57,700


1175
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:58,400
ESO Radio, kids.

1176
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,820
We'll be back next Thursday night.

1177
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:01,760
Taking air.

1178
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,300
After we go and sweep the Freetown Music Awards.

1179
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:10,940
Obscene thoughts and the big nasty from croaking up your throat and going into your head.

1180
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,300
I can't say it.

1181
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:16,020
I can't say it.

1182
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:39,600
Using the use of family as a barrier, let us catch one full surface of Простолом,

1183
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:46,780
let me support you on another mission with dash Renaissance and Fits you're already contact Untranspective.

1184
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:47,240
Looking for trouble in any particular relation of our vehicles you may contact iceicient ERIC,

1185
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,100
Sbrachter, of half age to point us to ESO Nitro.

1186
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:48,100


1187
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,480
Because ESO дисmania, it's 186.

1188
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,500
How with all these fun facts is music?

1189
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:57,340
Because ESO is small.

1190
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,480
Thank you.

1191
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,160
Thank you.
