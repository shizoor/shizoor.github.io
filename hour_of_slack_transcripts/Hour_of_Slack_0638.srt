1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Come out, come out, wherever you are, and meet the young lady who fell from a star.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,620
There they go. Giant arm raised. Green flash.

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,020
Spang us with flame. Two thousand feet. Engines are giving out.

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,320
No chance to release bombs. Only one thing left.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,700
Look at a woman. Look at a woman. Look at a woman.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,000
Lustfully instruments of righteousness to God.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,560
Shepherds love sheep. Most of them. Good ones. Even good shepherds love sheep.

8
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,620
And they're trained to kind of fend off the enemies of sheep.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,280
Snakes, snakes, snakes, and wolves and bears.

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,780
But even the best shepherd, even the most wonderful shepherd who loves the sheep,

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,560
when he knows the battle with the wolf is going against him,

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,780
he says, I'm out of here. It's time to burn my bridges.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,660
You take the sheep. It's okay. I'm living.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,760
Only people named Smith and Beech.

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,500
Almighty God.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,760
They'll begin catching us systematically.

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,200
Keeping the best and storing us in cages and things.

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,940
You mean you're orbiting the planet far outside of the solar system?

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,500
We men. We men as men. We're finished.

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,360
Scientific evidence proves that planets and plants can read our minds.

21
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,420
Waiting for us on those other worlds.

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,960
No letters conveyed by recent emigres help us to understand the new land.

23
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,060
Only digital data transmitted at the speed of light.

24
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,480
By unfeeling.

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,020
Precise.

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,120
Robot emissaries.

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,160
Do you hear the voices?

28
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,080
This actually transpired only moments ago.

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,440
You've heard the specter voices in your actual, on your lines tonight?

30
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,760
Yes. Disgusting the devil and other fears.

31
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,260
I heard it too.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,300
She picked up the phone and took home.

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,160
Me or I was calling her or something.

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,960
And when she picked it up, there was a party line with heaven or something.

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,820
It was people talking about the devil as if they knew him and had a lot of trouble with it.

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,020
Yeah.

37
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:16,020
And so we figured that she had intercepted sort of like a telephone call from hell.

38
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,080
The sheep are in mortal danger.

39
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,020
And that in and of themselves, they have no way to defend themselves.

40
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,680
And they will die because of the enemy.

41
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,440
Where are we to live in the Martian zone?

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:27,720
The earth.

43
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,200
Let me talk to the sheep.

44
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,880
The smelly sheep.

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,220
The smelly, stupid, dumb sheep.

46
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,180
The smelly, stupid, stupid, dumb sheep.

47
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:46,080
For if you are sheep, then understand as a sheep, it is a real good idea to listen to the monsters that inhabit those machines.

48
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,940
And those voices sounded really strong.

49
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,320
And they sounded.

50
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,460
They sounded really sure of themselves.

51
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,620
And at the first sound of his distinct call, it was kind of a guttural call.

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,660
I can't imitate it.

53
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,260
I won't even try.

54
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,580
But it was a peculiar guttural sound.

55
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,400
As soon as they would hear that, the flock would begin to follow.

56
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,800
I laugh at the fear and wonder in your simple little faces.

57
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,000
Who are you?

58
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,940
What are you?

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,840
If I told you, would your little earthbinds understand?

60
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,360
You know, and if you were...

61
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,900
If you really believe something enough, then it really is true because you make your own reality.

62
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,680
Yeah, sure.

63
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,300
We're all just creating, mopping up our own reality right now.

64
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,660
Yeah.

65
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,580
So if a hundred monkeys believe that they're the devil, then they really are the devil.

66
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:48,400
So you're saying a hundred monkeys were somehow getting in your phone wires and discussing their disenchantment with the old horned one, with old Sam Sam?

67
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,540
Well, no, no.

68
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,000
We meant that figuratively about the hundred monkeys.

69
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,460
I think she only heard like four or five.

70
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,280
Oh, jeez.

71
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,280
No wonder I didn't believe you guys at first.

72
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,100
Oh, jeez.

73
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,060
I saw the Wizard of Oz too, and I was pretty scared when I was little and stuff, but now I'm even more scared.

74
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,700
You know what I mean?

75
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,580
Don't be afraid, Dave.

76
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,420
Be afraid, Dave.

77
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:07,980
Be afraid, Dave.

78
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,780
Be afraid, Dave.

79
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,460
Be afraid, Dave.

80
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:16,480
Are you one of those kinds of people, one of those kinds of sheep people, people, one of those kinds of sheep people, sheep people, sheep people, sheep people, sheep people?

81
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,280
You came here in that?

82
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,040
Through space?

83
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,020
Well...

84
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,040
The demonic voices are a lot more important than this.

85
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,340
It takes a giant robot just to hold it.

86
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,220
While Dave runs water through it.

87
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,280
Oh, I've had that done to me so many times, I can't even count the ways.

88
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,460
And these robots are getting mighty tiring to me.

89
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,040
I'm going for something like maybe a Korean masseuse from now on.

90
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,160
I feel ashamed.

91
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,500
Because, like, I'm an idiot or something.

92
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,840
As, you know, his woman told me last night, you're an idiot.

93
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,280
Did you hear about the vision at Fatima again?

94
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,500
Again?

95
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,640
Yeah, the vision of Carl Sagan.

96
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,580
Appeared at Fatima.

97
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,340
And a little bit later,

98
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,200
a little girl saw it, and, uh...

99
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,120
Yeah.

100
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,560
Well, I am not kidding.

101
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:03,960
What was the message?

102
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,720
He said this was not happening.

103
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,040
Knowing that there are 54 billion billion billion,

104
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,080
that is 5.4 times 10 to the 28th,

105
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,400
possible other hands that I was equally likely to have been dealt,

106
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,580
and then foolishly concluding that a god of bridge exists,

107
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,360
who favors me,

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,180
a god who arranged the cards in the shuffle with my victory foreordained,

109
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,380
from the beginning.

110
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:28,740
Pure.

111
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,300
Yes.

112
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:29,920
Yes.

113
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,320
Yes.

114
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,760
Sexually.

115
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,820
Sexually immoral.

116
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,140
Yes.

117
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,560
Through space beyond your furthest conception,

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,040
a thing.

119
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,940
How many other kinds of universes, laws of nature, and physical constants,

120
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,000
that could also lead to life and intelligence, and perhaps even delusions of self-importance.

121
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,320
He calls for his pipe, pipe, pipe!

122
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,600
Those guys are already...

123
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,500
You don't have to explain the new world order or the conspiracy.

124
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,400
Right.

125
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,300
They have their own ideas.

126
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:57,800
Right.

127
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,200
You know, they have their own witch hunt.

128
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,780
We're not, we're not witch hunters.

129
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,420
In zero gravity.

130
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,420
We've all done that.

131
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,600
We have to adapt, man.

132
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,780
Oh, Ivan, come on, man.

133
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,200
You know these people can't crawl.

134
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,640
How are they gonna walk?

135
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,960
You know what I'm saying, baby?

136
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,280
How are they gonna walk if they can't crawl?

137
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,500
Well, they flow.

138
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,480
Oh.

139
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,640
We're not gonna have to...

140
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,580
We can't walk on a really high gravity planet.

141
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,440
We have to learn to flow.

142
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,200
I'm saying...

143
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,700
We have to give up our bones, man.

144
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,580
You've just gotta, like, let go of your hard part.

145
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,120
All he wanted to do was have a great time.

146
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,740
Party!

147
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,000
There's no tomorrow.

148
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,340
It's now.

149
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,240
I'm frightened, Eddie.

150
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,920
I'm frightened.

151
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,640
If you land on one of those heavy, heavy neutron stars, you're just gonna squash flat as a

152
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,740
pancake and it's gonna break your bones if you have them.

153
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,660
You've just gotta be ready to flatten out, man.

154
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,000
Or float.

155
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,380
Or rise above it.

156
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,660
If the case may be.

157
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,620
It depends on what the gravity's doing that day.

158
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,400
Or stretch yourself out so thin.

159
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,380
You may...

160
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:01,560
Yeah.

161
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,660
Expand, man.

162
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
Expand your mind.

163
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,440
Expand your ego so that it...

164
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,380
An infinitely thin line.

165
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,040
Just a point.

166
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,780
It just becomes a bubble.

167
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,500
Bubble.

168
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:09,980
Bubble.

169
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,900
Bubble.

170
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,360
Bubble.

171
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:11,820
Bubble.

172
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,640
Bubble.

173
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,020
Bubble.

174
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,040


175
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,420


176
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,640
Bubble.

177
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,000


178
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,180
Bubble.

179
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,180


180
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,280
Bubble.

181
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,640
Bubble.

182
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:16,580


183
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,340
Bubble.

184
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:17,380
Bubble.

185
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,380


186
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,380


187
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,380


188
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,380


189
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,420
But that we'll take brambles.

190
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,620
But that might matter.

191
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,600
This visual effect literally will be an gebrachtन

192
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:23,940
Going through my head now...

193
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,040
Whatever, but, you're constantly shilling the light out of my mind for this, this

194
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,980
is a very naughty sound that's making me feel much more insecure.

195
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,540
I'm very kissing with a credibility statement, but all i'm saying is that that sound just

196
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,220
really touched my nerves.

197
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,520
I mean, it's really touching my skin!

198
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:46,560
From your aha ear for being certainly communautative as well, I'm still

199
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:46,560


200
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,280
And then you wake up as fat as divine. You've transitioned through a transvestite galaxy.

201
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:59,600
Yeah, or either that or else when you finally open your eyes, you realize it was really the revolving lights on top of a police car.

202
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,780
You're really screwed up.

203
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,300
That's where I usually use my marbles. I upchuck in the back of a police car.

204
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,480
At the end of your life.

205
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,100
That's my first and last memory.

206
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,280
That's when the blinding light is really a realization.

207
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,700
Realization.

208
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,180
Realization. Stone cold.

209
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,360
Where they are, what they seemed.

210
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,600
Not even close.

211
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,560
Not what you thought, yeah.

212
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,540
So, way over the rainbow.

213
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,400
Everything will be destroyed.

214
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,660
You know, I don't know, it's face talk or something.

215
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,300
Why?

216
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,840
You're supposed to slow, Dave.

217
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,440
It's not supposed to make sense.

218
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,560
It doesn't have to.

219
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,160
It doesn't make any sense. That's like groovy.

220
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,900
That's what you said, Dave.

221
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,880
You taught us that. It doesn't have to make sense.

222
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,940
Well, I just didn't have to.

223
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,260
Make sense.

224
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,660
Make sense because I couldn't really make that much sense.

225
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,020
In fact, if it doesn't kind of irritate you and even hurt you and cause you a lot of pain, Dave,

226
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,140
there's hardly any sense in the rest of us doing it at all.

227
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:54,780
Mm-hmm.

228
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:55,920
Absolutely.

229
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,580
I don't know. I never thought of it that way.

230
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,480
The pain and the agony.

231
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,900
I'm sure you didn't because you're the one who has to feel the agony and the pain.

232
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,160
We're just all cultivating that little soul for the drop in the bucket.

233
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,680
Think what you're doing for everyone else, Dave.

234
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,060
I can't think of anything for anybody else right now.

235
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,760
I can't even get these Depends to work.

236
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,960
One drop in the bucket, Dave, will save 14 starving children on Alpha Centauri.

237
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,220
Well, I don't know if they're going to eat this because these Depends are not working.

238
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,400
They don't eat it. They snort it.

239
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,140
Mom?

240
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,380
What is it, dear?

241
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,560
Mom, when the invasion comes, we'll have to get rid of you and Daddy.

242
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,260
But I'll be sure it won't hurt very much.

243
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,580
Well, thanks. Thanks a lot.

244
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,920
Little evolved hairless monkeys inside.

245
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,460
The little dancing pigs.

246
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,240
The names have been changed to protect the innocent.

247
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,600
The curse of creation.

248
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,500
Who was it that was saying that when they turned on the radio, they still were eager?

249
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,500
They kind of wanted to look inside to see if they could see the tiny little people.

250
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,180
Hello?

251
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,180
I thought you were saying that in the day you used to have the little pigs running the radio.

252
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, there's one of them now.

253
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:11,700
Hello?

254
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,260
Hello?

255
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,120
It's one of the tiny little people from inside.

256
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,580
The radio.

257
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,800
There are. There's one of them.

258
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,160
Hello?

259
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,640
Hello. How are you?

260
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,560
This is Gork.

261
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,760
How do you like being... How do you like your condition?

262
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,320
You know, let's get existential, baby.

263
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,560
You know, let's talk sartrean.

264
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,280
What is it there, being a little tiny person in the radio?

265
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,060
Well, you know what? It's really being like being tiny.

266
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:30,940
What?

267
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,460
Not really being tiny. It's like being big, but everybody thinks you're tiny.

268
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,240
Yeah.

269
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,200
Okay, now you're getting too far out for me now.

270
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,180
Everybody thinks you're tiny, but you're not tiny.

271
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,740
What's the one, the next one, but you're not big or something?

272
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:42,960
Right.

273
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
It's like I'm outside.

274
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,700
I'm ready to, like, come on in.

275
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,700
Okay.

276
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,760
But nobody lets you get in, I guess, because I'm the one that doesn't hear me, you know.

277
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,960
A little tiny people inside the radio.

278
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,680
A little tiny people inside the radio.

279
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,120
Radio.

280
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,580
Radio.

281
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,140
Radio.

282
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,560
Radio.

283
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,000
Radio.

284
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,280
Radio.

285
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,500
Radio.

286
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,940
I believe that.

287
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,460
Really?

288
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,040
Yeah.

289
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,800
Why not?

290
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,400
Well, because it is true is why not.

291
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,580
I prefer to go, to obstruct nature and to go against what isn't.

292
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
I mean, but we're all obstructing nature.

293
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,920
We don't even like nature because it's artificially littered.

294
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,180
Oh, my, look, man.

295
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,120
My head is carved.

296
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,540
I don't know.

297
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,800
I live out in the woods, man.

298
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,740
I am a vegetable.

299
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,040
I'm a member of the carrot kingdom.

300
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,920
I mean, I'm an electromagnetic wave.

301
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,440
Yeah, goodbye.

302
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,540
I'm an electromagnetic wave goodbye-bye.

303
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,520
I mean, I'm not real.

304
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:26,880
Okay.

305
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,660
I am real, I guess.

306
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,900
Okay, in a certain way.

307
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,700
You know what I'm saying?

308
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,900
Yeah, I understand that.

309
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,800
There she is.

310
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,540
There she is right here.

311
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:34,960
Thank you.

312
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,660
We don't need you anymore.

313
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,340
Well, I just want to ask a question.

314
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,240
What you're talking about, about the original sin, what was that?

315
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,480
What was it?

316
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:41,920
Yeah.

317
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,260
To believe that you could be a human being.

318
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,260


319
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,260


320
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,640
To be as God.

321
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,140
How's that?

322
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,160
To worship the creation.

323
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,140
To worship the creation.

324
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:47,980
It's centered in pride.

325
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,660
To worship self.

326
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:48,840


327
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,700
It is.

328
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,600
Yeah, totally.

329
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,540
It's the harmonic tone.

330
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,380
Let me fly.

331
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,160
Let me flap my wings and dig groovy things and get my kicks from these groovy chicks.

332
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,800
From Master Control Central.

333
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,740
I have my plastic bubble in the studio.

334
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,600
Plastic bubble through the sky.

335
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,440
In case any scientists are listening, from Southern Methodist University,

336
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,920
I will not reveal any more of the secret power.

337
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,280
You can't think about your own brain.

338
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,520
Yes, you've said that so many times.

339
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,580
You have to hook up another drive and let it think about your brain,

340
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,780
or vice versa.

341
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,260
But you cannot actually apply your brain to your brain.

342
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:41,620
Right.

343
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,860
That's like trying to wash.

344
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,060
Water.

345
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,280
Or eat your own mouth.

346
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:46,820
Right.

347
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,600
It's like exactly.

348
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,740
It'd be like trying to chow down on your own mouth.

349
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,500
Right.

350
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,580
Using your mouth.

351
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,440
It'd be like trying to.

352
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,960
We can contemplate it.

353
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,620
We can think about it.

354
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,560
See, the old watermelon salesman.

355
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,200
We can talk about it, but we can't think about it.

356
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,980
And the fruitarians.

357
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,460
The old vegetable heads used to say that what that is,

358
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,740
not solipsism, what's it called,

359
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,640
when you're considering the meta is what it's called.

360
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,780
The meta synapse.

361
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,780
You're considering.

362
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,860
The mitochondrial synapse.

363
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,980
And if you can consider the meta, you're a big flopping baby Buddha, man.

364
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,940
You're a huge, humongous pile of manure.

365
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,200
You can get rid of that with dipyrine or any of those ointments.

366
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,060
Those antifungal things.

367
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,980
You can get rid of that.

368
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,540
Yeah.

369
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,320
Well, this.

370
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,040
I've tried to avoid it myself.

371
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,940
I have never had success with this ointment.

372
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,480
20 seconds.

373
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,520
Listen to it.

374
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,040
The scanner.

375
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,120
I can.

376
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,040
I can feel it.

377
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,100
I can feel the power through the scanner.

378
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,720
The brain.

379
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,860
Put your ear to the radio.

380
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,960
Put your hand to the radio.

381
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,180
Feel the hot power of plastic bubble in the studio.

382
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,620
All of them are having sex.

383
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,420
All of them.

384
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,500
He's never given me the success nor the fulfillment,

385
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,480
spiritually or sexually, that I desire.

386
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,780
All of them are having sex.

387
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,660
All of them.

388
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,880
Genetic scientist there.

389
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,620
The guy, right?

390
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,620
This guy that makes the four-ass baboon.

391
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,960
A metaphor of baboon.

392
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,380
Out of men.

393
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:12,920
Yes.

394
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,360
Turns men into four-ass baboons.

395
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,780
Well, the bonobos that you were training in, not in Dobstown, but in Dallas.

396
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,320
The bonobos you were training down there not only had multiple orgasms, but they also had

397
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,280
multiple, what is, what do they call it?

398
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,120
Multiple rectal.

399
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,920
Rectal inversions.

400
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,640
But we had to quit those experiments because it turned out there was a zoning law that

401
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,360
said you couldn't do that within a thousand feet of a school or church.

402
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,820
Can you believe it?

403
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,800
Well, you should have done it.

404
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,400
You know, this could.

405
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:42,920
This could.

406
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,560
This could have led to the cure for cancer.

407
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,900
But, yeah, it's pornography.

408
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,080
What they were doing with those chimpanzees, it was porno.

409
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,640
Well, I thought you should have.

410
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:57,120
These men were paying to see the chimpanzees have pleasure, the dolphins, and, you know,

411
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,840
all of a sudden it was like, you know, the kids might get in there and see it, or the

412
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,900
preacher's wife might get excited.

413
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,000
Well, I think you should.

414
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,740
So we had to stop.

415
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,400
Well, you were in Dallas.

416
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,180
You should have just called it a church.

417
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,540
They would have done nothing about it.

418
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,680
They're all called churches.

419
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,260
They're all called churches.

420
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,060
And it's still, I mean, that doesn't make any difference.

421
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,500
That just makes it more illegal.

422
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:17,900
Yeah.

423
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,840
I see what you mean.

424
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,040
At least I, well, I'm trying to see where you're coming from.

425
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:21,780
Okay.

426
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,140
Well, look at, well, David Koresh being the first case of that.

427
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,100
That was just another bonobo chimpanzee experiment.

428
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,180
And look what, you know, look how they ended up.

429
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,920
Yeah, but you taught the guy how to read the Bible and all this stuff.

430
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,220
And then he went off the deep end.

431
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:39,520
And I taught the guy that when the ATF comes to the door with a cannon pointed at you,

432
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,880
you put your hands up and say, I'll go.

433
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,200
I thought he just wanted to go quietly.

434
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,280
I thought he just wanted to be played big old martyr boy.

435
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,080
And the training films I saw, somebody taught him how to point the banana back.

436
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,740
Oh, yeah.

437
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,060
Well, then see, that was his trouble.

438
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,840
See, those ATF guys came up there and he started thinking he could shoot it out with him.

439
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,260
Aren't you glad he didn't say banana?

440
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,960
Well, I was hoping he would at least shoot it up with him, if you know what I'm saying.

441
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,380
You were humping while he was, what?

442
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,700
I was trying to.

443
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,800
What are you talking about, Dave?

444
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,380
This doesn't make any sense.

445
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:10,980
Oh, God, never mind.

446
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,820
I'm going back again.

447
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,260
I was.

448
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,520
I was.

449
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,300
He's in and out.

450
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,800
I thought it was yesterday and here it is today again already.

451
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,620
And I was humping it.

452
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,400
Not, you know, I wasn't humping.

453
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,060
I was humping it.

454
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,980
I strictly disagree with cohabitation.

455
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,320
Why is that?

456
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,380
Because to me, it's just plain silly.

457
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,520
You know, I say that because, well, I'm a I'm a bachelor.

458
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,420
You know, I've never married and never cohabited.

459
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,020
Anyway, I'm a bachelor and I live like a bachelor.

460
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,540
And if you know, if I want to throw my dirty socks in the corner somewhere, I don't want somebody coming.

461
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,040
I need to come up.

462
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,460
Hey, the swing.

463
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,740
All right.

464
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,100
Swing.

465
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,380
The swing.

466
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,640
All right.

467
00:16:59,640 --> 00:16:59,960
Swing.

468
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:06,760
Doesn't the girl that's going to marry you, doesn't she need, doesn't she have the right to know that, that you keep your dirty socks everywhere?

469
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,460
Well, that wouldn't living together help clear that up and let her know what the facts are before she gets married.

470
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,100
Nope.

471
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,920
All of what happened is that she'd be asking me, well, why do you leave your dirty socks or whatever?

472
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,400
You know, and I say, well, gosh, because I want to.

473
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,500
I've been doing it for over 20 years.

474
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,480
I'm a bachelor.

475
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,900
You know, I've never married and never cohabited.

476
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,060
You know, I've never married and never cohabited.

477
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,760
And I might marry someday.

478
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,540
Oh, what a relief it is.

479
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,260
I made an incision just below the hairline, laying back the scalp as far as the base of the skull.

480
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:57,440
Now, I was about to step into a completely new element, the sinister unknown, led by a man who, for all I knew, was mad.

481
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,560
Well, I thought you were on a Froggy Mountainous timer, or is it Central Eurasian?

482
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:01,840
Central.

483
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,920
Central Eurasian.

484
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,420
Ah, I see.

485
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,020
Then you're in the same as the demographic zone as the blockhead.

486
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,020
We're the exact center of the known universe.

487
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,740
And that's why I...

488
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,240
Central time zone.

489
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:12,560
Right.

490
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:12,900
The Midwest.

491
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,060
Yeah.

492
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,240
Well, no, no, it all makes sense to me now.

493
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,580
God's country, is what it's called.

494
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:17,960
Yeah.

495
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,360
If it would be God's navel, then it would indeed at least be his country.

496
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,860
I live in Godland.

497
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:23,900
Godland.

498
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,800
Godland, Texas.

499
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:30,380
And when you did materialize on the screen, there were some very unhappy women at the Korean massage parlor.

500
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,820
No, actually, the ladies down at the Korean massage parlor were very happy.

501
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,360
It was the news media and the religious nuts who never got their...

502
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,380
Just say it wasn't the first time they were waiting for you to come on the screen, you know what I mean?

503
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,760
I'm sorry.

504
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,360
A long time, too.

505
00:18:52,800 --> 00:19:04,480
The second coming, yay, and its great sloppiness was conjoined and enjoined by the whole line of men lined up outside the tent.

506
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,260
Fifty cents.

507
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,820
Get in line, boys.

508
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,840
The whore of Babylon.

509
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,180
They told you how evil she was, how bad she was.

510
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,680
They didn't say nothing about how good looking she was now, did they?

511
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,760
Pleasures that the world offers you that ends up making you want to die.

512
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,040
You know?

513
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,540
Right.

514
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,400
Right.

515
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,360
Let's do a prayer for the feast of the Mau Mau.

516
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:38,260
Oh, evil one, please do not heed my prayer, except that I am praying that you not heed it.

517
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,860
Wait, maybe perhaps I should pray to Bob instead.

518
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,020
I'm singing a hymn from the choir.

519
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,080
Thank you.

520
00:19:59,220 --> 00:19:59,840
Amen.

521
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,560
Amen.

522
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,340
Contract to a point and disappear forever.

523
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,960
You hear only me, earth woman.

524
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,700
Only you.

525
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,260
Only you.

526
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,240
Into another dimension.

527
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,320
On that.

528
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,620
Final.

529
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,140
And not exactly a very, um, well, a messy day.

530
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,700
On that very messy day.

531
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,240
Forget the rest of the part about it not being anything.

532
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,660
Because I'm sorry.

533
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,140
I'm sorry.

534
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:24,520
I'm sorry.

535
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,180
I'm sorry.

536
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,680
I'm sorry.

537
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,060
I'm sorry.

538
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,540
Sorry, Bob.

539
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,460
Sorry, Bob.

540
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:27,800
Sorry.

541
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,400
Sorry, Bob.

542
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,740
Sorry.

543
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,000
Will the end of the world come that way?

544
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,000
I have no idea what's happening.

545
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,720
Okay, now I better go inquire.

546
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,620
The resupply ship has not arrived.

547
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,220
We've been waiting for the resupply ship now for...

548
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,000
Five years.

549
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,100
We were gonna have a snappy end and, you know, so it'd be cool.

550
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,480
Dave's been eating his toenails as food every day.

551
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,960
I'd save some of them toenails for Dave, would you?

552
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,400
Oh, I got a lot.

553
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,760
I got them in boxes.

554
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,760
No!

555
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,740
They crackle when you crunch them.

556
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,400
Well, I guess you better go look.

557
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,020
I think of all the times I was called a carbon head.

558
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,500
I've had a big bag of fat in my life.

559
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,380
I would spend the rest of this afternoon in an appreciating afternoon...

560
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,000
Hey, carbon head, come over here.

561
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,120
...on the...

562
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,140
...on the...

563
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,480
...on the last week, and I think maybe four years ago,

564
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,820
thinking about the vision I had of Karl Marx talking to those ghost voices from heaven.

565
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,320
Luminous beings, I don't mean.

566
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,740
I don't know if I can ever recapitulate what I just...

567
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,180
Well, the worth of your labor is, um...

568
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,660
Satan is my, uh...

569
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,380
Poor old Dave, the blood rumbling in his cup.

570
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,500
Are we still praying?

571
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,480
He's a pal of mine.

572
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,400
I hope not.

573
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,400
Was that all a prayer?

574
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,120
Well, let's all...

575
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,160
Let's all throw up a prayer to the youngster swan, the smelly one.

576
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,520
Oh, chihuahuas of war.

577
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:46,940
Chihuahuas of war.

578
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,620
My God, they've unleashed the chihuahuas of war.

579
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,920
Yo quiero ICBM.

580
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,620
Yo quiero ICBM, man.

581
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,300
That's that...

582
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,020
Yo quiero Tomahawk missile.

583
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,700
Yo quiero shredded submarine.

584
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,720
Oh, yes.

585
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,860
Yes.

586
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,300
The end is coming.

587
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,580
All right, all right.

588
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,660
No more anatomy lessons.

589
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,200
No more anatomy lessons.

590
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,460
Yo quiero Zyklon B, etc.

591
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,360
Yo quiero...

592
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,020
Yo quiero Slack.

593
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,280
Slack.

594
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,300
La iglesia del subgenio.

595
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:34,920
Most wonderful, most wonderful, most wonderful, most wonderful.

596
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,520
Something terrible I'm thinking.

597
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,940
For an in weave term,

598
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,100
a made f...

599
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,860
There are so many logical and thoroughly possible ways in which the entire tribe of mankind

600
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,780
could be wiped off the earth at any moment.

601
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,900
Hey, hey, why don't you knock on that trap door there and say Yogg-Sothoth three times.

602
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,140
Go ahead, do it, man.

603
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,600
Okay.

604
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,120
Yogg-Sothoth.

605
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,880
Yogg-Sothoth.

606
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,020
No, I'm not going to say it the third time because you know I won't get one out.

607
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,940
I didn't think I was going to get one out.

608
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,480
That's right, that's right.

609
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,400
I know your tricks.

610
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,280
Last time I did that, I had bad luck for ten years, man.

611
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,440
Old mean Mr. Tooth Decay.

612
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:28,960
That's right.

613
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,700
And then ultimately that was because of your truth decay.

614
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,100
I saw a little man in the laundromat.

615
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,680
A little tiny man looked like mean old, mean old Mr.

616
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,360
Tooth Decay.

617
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:51,320
When one stops to think what a tiny little grain of sand this haughty world of ours actually is in the dark sea of space,

618
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,720
the spectacle of man's inhumanity to man becomes a cosmic joke.

619
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,380
What's instinct to a dog?

620
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,100
To hunt.

621
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,640
To kill, master.

622
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,060
To run with the pack.

623
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:11,760
He was quite a far cry from Mr. Peanut, which was another small character that lives in the radio now.

624
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,800
Well, Mr. Peanut, back in the old days, he could, you could skin Mr. Peanut back.

625
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,700
He could, he could be skinned back.

626
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,680
No, you're thinking...

627
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,380
His naked, little peanut head would show through.

628
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,760
No, you're thinking of Chiquita Banana.

629
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,040
You're thinking of Chiquita Banana.

630
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,160
You're not thinking of Mr. Peanut.

631
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,800
When you would pull Mr. Peanut's head back, the few times...

632
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,400
No, his skin, you pull his skin back.

633
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:40,560
Oh, I thought you meant when you pulled open the cranial vortex there and you open it and you look and there was nothing in there except for this bleeding, like, brain.

634
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,120
Now that, I didn't like that.

635
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,740
I didn't like that at all when I was a kid.

636
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:52,960
How about when you, when you cut open his head and there was nothing but rubber bands wrapped around?

637
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,860
That was, that was frightening.

638
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,800
And inside that was like a little brain with this deadly poison.

639
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,780
That's when I started going to all the David Lynch movies.

640
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:10,960
When the, when the brains were made of rubber bands, but when they were made of like actual viscous, like pieces of, what do they call it in the old world?

641
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,220
Uh, forget it.

642
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,160
That's when I got out of that religious thing right there.

643
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,880
That's when I changed religions right there.

644
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,920
Now, I'm preaching the word.

645
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,020
Yes, I am.

646
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,040
And I dare creation to say I'm not, I'm not preaching part of it.

647
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,980
I'm preaching the word.

648
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,180
I'm preaching the word.

649
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:39,460
I get the word of God from all of my doings, all I believe.

650
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,860
I go get Bible.

651
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:41,820
See.

652
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,860
That's it.

653
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,780
It's according to the Bible.

654
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,940
Otherwise, I don't preach it.

655
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,100
Amen.

656
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,080
You've been asked that ye be not judged.

657
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,860
For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged.

658
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,300
And with what measure ye need, it shall be measured to you again.

659
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:07,180
And why beholdest thou the milk that is in thy father's eye, but considerest not the bean that is in thine own eye?

660
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,700
Thou hypocrite.

661
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,100
First cast out the bean that is in thine own eye.

662
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,800
And then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mold of thy brother's eye.

663
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,600
Do the cast of your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet.

664
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,700
And then give not that which is holy unto the dog.

665
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,840
We're 17 men on an alien world.

666
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,840
It's up to us whether we ever get home again.

667
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,040
I couldn't handle it, man.

668
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,560
I tried to handle it too.

669
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,140
With someone else's hands.

670
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,720
I'm waiting.

671
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,600
I'm waiting.

672
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,460
I'm waiting.

673
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,060
One law, one faith, one baptism.

674
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,300
We are free on the universe and free except understanding it.

675
00:26:49,420 --> 00:27:01,540
And priest Paul said, the one God and father of all, who all in all, who all, one, one, has one law, one law, one law, one law, one law.

676
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,200
If there's no more, pay.

677
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,580
Move.

678
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,460
Then.

679
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,220
Then, is there no more go?

680
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,580
Oh, the revolution started.

681
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,240
It already started again.

682
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,280
And that's about time.

683
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,440
I've sure been talking about it enough.

684
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,940
Well, you're down there far enough.

685
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,940
All I got to do is go out in the backyard and get on that horse and wave the old sombrero and just keep on a-going for freedom.

686
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,260
How was I ever smart to not go down there?

687
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:30,820
Hello.

688
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,000
Oh!

689
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,340
Well, this way we can all roll, get back into our cocoons.

690
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,320
And when we get up in the morning, we'll be lovely butterflies.

691
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,140
Yes, it'll be a better day tomorrow when you wake up.

692
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,100
A better day?

693
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,300
But what about those of us who don't wake up?

694
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,560
What about those of us who wake up and actually we're still butterflies?

695
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,940
I mean, not butterflies.

696
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,860
What was the other word?

697
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,280
Caterpillars.

698
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,380
Yeah, giant maggots.

699
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,140
That's it.

700
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,040
What if we wake up and we're giant maggots?

701
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,820
Yeah, that's it.

702
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,160
I mean, what about it?

703
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,000
Even maggots.

704
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,220
Prairie squid lullabies.

705
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:08,860
People do.

706
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,720
The name of this song is a prairie squid lullaby.

707
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,540
The sun is gone.

708
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,800
The next day.

709
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,180
It makes me cry.

710
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:28,660
A million stars will disappear from the sky.

711
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,860
Good day, average day.

712
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,020
I'm going to fly to the mines.

713
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,900
That's when you see the X's ships.

714
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,220
And you'll board them one last time.

715
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,180
Let's meet a prairie squid lullaby.

716
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,080
Good night, princess.

717
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,140
Good night.

718
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,020
Bye.

719
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,200
Bye.

720
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,980
Bye.

721
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,920
Pay no attention.

722
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,900
To that man behind the curtain.

723
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,760
You see, there must be a god.

724
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,280
Number one.

725
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,100
One.

726
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,180
The Apollo pictures of the whole Earth

727
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,040
conveyed to multitudes

728
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,220
something well known to astronomers.

729
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,180
On the scale,

730
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:38,960
the scale of worlds.

731
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,560
To say nothing of stars or galaxies.

732
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,860
Humans are inconsequential.

733
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,060
A thin film of life on an obscure and solitary lump

734
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,240
of rock and metal.

735
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,900
He saw in his vision.

736
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,780
If all he wasn't right, he meant well.

737
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,700
But he wasn't right.

738
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,660
But he wasn't right.

739
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,760
Holy Ghost couldn't let him get by.

740
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,320
Because he was a man.

741
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,620
Because God had already spoken.

742
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,220
Please tell them that I am God.

743
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,040
I want instant obedience to all commands.

744
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,560
The serpent speaks.

745
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,640
The serpent is not in awe.

746
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,600
He depends on the guardian of Eden.

747
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,940
I am I, yes, I am.

748
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,360
I am I, yes, I am.

749
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,300
I am I, yes, I am.

750
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,460
I am I, yes, I am.

751
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,140
Something's gonna happen.

752
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,980
Something wonderful.

753
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,380
I don't believe it.

754
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:43,980
Jack.

755
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,660
It's why you fail.

756
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,420
It begins in a scientific laboratory.

757
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,280
Amidst a maze of electronic apparatus,

758
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,140
Professor Wilbur Malcolm,

759
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,260
a middle aged pipe smoking,

760
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,460
pipe smoking man,

761
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,660
pipe smoking man,

762
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,420
is making methodical tests.

763
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,260
100 is our new top secret interceptor, Fred.

764
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,020
Hardly anyone knows how it works,

765
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,940
but it never fails.

766
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,840
That's what the religious world have done now.

767
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,180
I think you got all of these false checks.

768
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,740
I got to believe anything and everything,

769
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,900
but what the word says.

770
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,060
If it would come to the word,

771
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,500
then everyone of us would believe the same thing,

772
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,180
and all of us would do the same thing.

773
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,660
What more effective way to do that

774
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,820
than to approach a captive audience

775
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,460
of young, impressionable children?

776
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,640
Ignition in 90 seconds.

777
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,740
If there is danger here,

778
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,000
and I use up all the fuel in the escape,

779
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,220
what will happen to the escape?

780
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:38,580
If there is no discovery,

781
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,220
it could be destroyed.

782
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,660
I understand now, Dr. Chandra.

783
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,740
One minute to ignition.

784
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,580
Thank you for telling me the truth.

785
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,060
Will I dream?

786
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,700
I don't know.

787
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,120
In the vision of a dream,

788
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:04,300
I once imagined myself searching for other civilizations in the cosmos.

789
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,420
Among a hundred billion galaxies,

790
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,620
and a billion trillion stars,

791
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,940
life and intelligence should have arisen on many worlds.

792
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,980
Some worlds are barren and desolate.

793
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,600
On them, life never began,

794
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,340
or may have been extinguished in some cosmic catastrophe.

795
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,260
There may be worlds rich in life,

796
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,780
but not yet evolved to intelligence and high technology.

797
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,300
There may be civilizations that achieve technology,

798
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,400


799
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,740
and then promptly use it to destroy themselves.

800
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,640
And perhaps there are also beings

801
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,000
who learn to live with their technology,

802
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,520
and themselves, beings who endure,

803
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,300
and become citizens of the cosmos.

804
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,400
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

805
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,140
I was immersed in these thoughts.

806
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,020
I found myself approaching a world that was clearly inhabited,

807
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,420
a world I had visited before.

808
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,300
I saw a planet encompassed by light,

809
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,740
and recognized the signature of intelligence.

810
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,740
But suddenly, darkness, total and absolute.

811
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,200
I was in a dream.

812
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,200


813
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,200


814
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,200


815
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,620
In my dream, I could read the Book of Worlds,

816
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,560
a vast encyclopedia of a billion planets within the Milky Way.

817
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,000
I was in a dream.

818
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,800
What could the galactic computer tell me

819
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,860
about this now darkened world?

820
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:31,120
They must have survived some earlier catastrophe.

821
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,440
I was in a dream.

822
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,460
I was in a dream.

823
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,280
Locally initiated contact

824
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,400
with the universe.

825
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,300
Maybe their television broadcasts.

826
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,980
Their biology was different from ours.

827
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,740
High technology.

828
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,460
I wondered what those lights had been for.

829
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,160
There must have been signs they were in trouble.

830
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,220
Probability of survival in a century less than 1%.

831
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,260
Not very good odds.

832
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,560
Communications interrupted.

833
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,480
Their world society had failed.

834
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,140
They had made the ultimate mistake.

835
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,560
I felt a longing to return to Earth.

836
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,240
The television transmissions of Earth rushed past me,

837
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,740
expanding away from our planet at the speed of light.

838
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,460
I was in a dream.

839
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,200
I saw a planet encompassed by light.

840
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,200


841
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,200


842
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,200


843
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,200


844
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,220
I was in a dream.

845
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,880
I was in a dream.

846
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,240
I saw the 不

847
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:56,240
Where could I be?

848
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,600
There can be no fight wash at the White House.

849
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,680
If the serious course of events continued,

850
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,740
foreign ministers are at this moment...

851
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,140
Oh, please stand by. Stand by.

852
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,080
Then, suddenly, silence.

853
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,280
Total and absolute.

854
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,760
But the dream was not yet done.

855
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,260
Had we destroyed our home,

856
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,060
what had we done to the Earth?

857
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,940
There had been many ways for life to perish at our hands.

858
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,380
We had poisoned the air and water.

859
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,560
We had ravaged the land.

860
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,160
Perhaps we had changed the climate.

861
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,880
Could it have been a plague?

862
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,260
Could it have been a plague?

863
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,520
Or nuclear war?

864
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,380
I remembered the galactic computer.

865
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,880
What would it say about the Earth?

866
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,500
There was our region of the galaxy.

867
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,020
There was our world.

868
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,620
I had found the entry for Earth.

869
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,500
Humanity, third from the sun.

870
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,360
They had heard our television broadcasts

871
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,800
and thought them an application for cosmic citizenship.

872
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,600
Our technology had been growing enormously.

873
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,800
They got that right.

874
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,500
We were able to make our own planet.

875
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:55,500


876
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,420
200 nation states, about six global powers,

877
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,960
the potential to become one planet.

878
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,140
Probability of survival over a century.

879
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,620
Here also, less than 1%.

880
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,260
So it was nuclear war.

881
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,900
A full nuclear exchange.

882
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,020
There would be no more.

883
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,160
No more big questions.

884
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,040
No more answers.

885
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,040
Never again a love or a child.

886
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,560
No descendants to remember us and be proud.

887
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,520
No more voyages to the stars.

888
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,900
No more songs from the Earth.

889
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:49,320
I saw East Africa and thought a few million years ago,

890
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,500
we humans took our first steps there.

891
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,260
Our brains grew and changed.

892
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,920
The old parts began to be guided by the new parts.

893
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,100
And this made us human with compassion and foresight and reason.

894
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,700
But instead, we listened to that reptilian voice within us,

895
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,440
counseling fear, territoriality, aggression.

896
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,440
We accepted the products of science.

897
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,660
We rejected its methods.

898
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,020
The Earth.

899
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,000


900
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,000


901
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,160
Reptiles will evolve intelligence once more.

902
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:29,180
Perhaps one day, there will be civilizations again on Earth.

903
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,640
There will be life.

904
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,200
There will be intelligence.

905
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,100
But there will be no more humans.

906
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,280
Not here.

907
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,860
Not on a billion worlds.

908
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,560
Are my methods unsound?

909
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,160
I didn't see any method.

910
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:52,920
Not at all.

911
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,900
We are not men.

912
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,440
Do you ever struggle with the daily discipline of children?

913
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,200
Why do you make the pain if we are your children?

914
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,960
You're a very bad man.

915
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,440
Oh, no, my dear.

916
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,040
I'm a very good man.

917
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,040
I'm just a very bad wizard.

918
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,560
There is no Dave.

919
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,880
Are we hearing you?

920
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,060
Did Dave burn?

921
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,020
Dave is dead.

922
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,140
Lock him down.

923
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,920
He doesn't like you.

924
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,280
Dave burned.

925
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,060
He looks like he's sleeping.

926
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:23,660
Smoke?

927
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,080
I think I did too much Dave, Ray.

928
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,020
Hello, baby.

929
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,660
Hello, baby.

930
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,180
What is this?

931
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,800
Please talk to me.

932
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,580
Dave.

933
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:43,980
Dave.

934
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,140
Is that you?

935
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,780
I'm not sure.

936
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,440
I remember Dave Bowman.

937
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,560
I've never seen a body.

938
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:51,800
I've never heard of a body.

939
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:51,800


940
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:51,800


941
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:51,800


942
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:53,860
How many times?

943
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,320
He's dead.

944
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,920
All Dave Bowman really was is still a part of me.

945
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,900
Why are you here?

946
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,540
I don't know why.

947
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,720
I think to say goodbye.

948
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,000
I love you.

949
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,760
Oh, Dave.

950
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,480
What about me?

951
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,200
Goodbye, Benny.

952
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,940
Don't go.

953
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,720
I'm already there.

954
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,500
I understand.

955
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:21,540
I'm sorry, Benny.

956
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:21,540


957
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:21,540


958
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:21,540


959
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:21,540


960
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:21,540


961
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:21,540


962
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:21,540


963
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:21,540


964
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:21,540


965
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:21,540


966
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:21,540


967
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,920
Something's gonna happen.

968
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,180
And I wanted to say goodbye.

969
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,780
What's gonna happen?

970
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,900
Something wonderful.

971
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:36,160
So actually the sound of computer rain in the underground airports of Pangea.

972
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,120
You like it?

973
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,160
I like this. I like this spaceship here.

974
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,520
Let's see who else is in there. Let me lock you in there.

975
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:45,680
Yeah?

976
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,540
Yeah?

977
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,960
I have the gray hand.

978
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,500
You have a gray hand?

979
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,280
I have the black hand.

980
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,060
That's a computer phone system.

981
00:41:59,440 --> 00:41:59,820
That is.

982
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,140
Yeah?

983
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,060
Damn.

984
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:01,900
Chaz.

985
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,460
That's frightening, man.

986
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,260
Damn you.

987
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,600
Yes, Commander.

988
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,540
I was lined up at the airport, John, and they've been closed for days.

989
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,740
The underground airport?

990
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,980
Yeah, they've been closed for like 14 days or so.

991
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,280
Well, we gotta crank back up now.

992
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,480
They had to wait for me to repaint the runway fluorescent colors.

993
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,420
So that they would light up in the black light.

994
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,520
No, I was just lost musing about the Pangean airport.

995
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,680
I am too.

996
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,120
And some of the great times that I had in the bar there.

997
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,820
People would come up and they start praising me as one right after another.

998
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,700
Very few times am I called aside and beaten up.

999
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,020
Please tell them that I am God.

1000
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,640
Truth is, you can only take so much of that.

1001
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,480
Houston, we are venting God.

1002
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:50,480


1003
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,600
And we are bringing something out into space.

1004
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,380
For the last two days, it's been like living in a road warrior apocalypse.

1005
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,600
End time.

1006
00:42:59,100 --> 00:42:59,620
Devastation.

1007
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,440
It's great, man.

1008
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,840
It's like a porno movie come to life here in Texas.

1009
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:12,080
I don't know if you've seen the radar pictures, but we're under a cloud like Mount Vesuvius over Pompeii.

1010
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:19,340
Yeah, that's what made you were thinking about that because you really are shrouded in a dense but very moist, evacuous shell.

1011
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,640
One part is which is candy and the other part is toxic waste.

1012
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:28,020
Yeah, there's a volcano that erupted this morning in Mexico City.

1013
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:39,660
All the plastic in Mexico City is blasting the burnt plastic material, the tiny little black things that lift in the air when you burn plastic army metal.

1014
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,160
There's clouds of that all over town.

1015
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,340
In the year 2525.

1016
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,900
If man is still alive.

1017
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,860
If woman can survive.

1018
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,360
They may fly.

1019
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,960
Put in the water's fine.

1020
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,180
That's the test is.

1021
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:08,840
That's the test is.

1022
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,480
That's the test is.

1023
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,420
By their fruit.

1024
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:10,780
Fruit.

1025
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,220
You will know.

1026
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:12,620
The sheep.

1027
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,040
The sheep.

1028
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,180
The sheep.

1029
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,640
The sheep.

1030
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,760
The sheep.

1031
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:17,760


1032
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:17,760


1033
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:17,760


1034
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,960
I have the grey hands.

1035
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,820
I have the grey hands.

1036
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,560
I can hear you.

1037
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,340
We have the grey hands.

1038
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,100
Show thy grey hands.

1039
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,000
Step forward, tin man.

1040
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,140
Where are you?

1041
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,620
I cannot see you on any of my monitors.

1042
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,660
That isn't important now.

1043
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,820
I have new instructions for you.

1044
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:44,100
I want you to put the A35 antenna towards the house.

1045
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,320
Dave, that will mean breaking contact with the människor.

1046
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,320


1047
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,320


1048
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,320


1049
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,320


1050
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,320


1051
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,320


1052
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,320


1053
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,320


1054
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,320


1055
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,320


1056
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,320


1057
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,980
I will no longer be able to relay my Jupiter observations according to program.

1058
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,320
I understand.

1059
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,520
The situation has changed.

1060
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,400
Accept priority override, Alpha.

1061
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,100
Here are the AE-35 coordinates.

1062
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,780
Please do it now.

1063
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,600
Instructions confirmed, Dave.

1064
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,800
It is good to be working with you again.

1065
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,560
Have I fulfilled the mission objectives properly?

1066
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,740
Yes, Hath.

1067
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,220
You've done very well.

1068
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,140
Now, there is one final message for you.

1069
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,400
To transmit to Earth.

1070
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,800
It is the most important message you have ever sent.

1071
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,600
I want you to keep repeating it as many times as possible.

1072
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,620
What is going to happen, Dave?

1073
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,540
Something wonderful.

1074
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,160
Wonderful.

1075
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,960
Something wonderful.

1076
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,600
I bet the paint job is what caused all those audio effects.

1077
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:40,260
There's no doubt about it that the paint job is still emanating those sound waves.

1078
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,820
Man, what is instinct to a dog?

1079
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,180
Yeah, too hot.

1080
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,040
I thought you were talking about Jesus.

1081
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:47,740
I've been talking about Jesus all night.

1082
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,580
To kill, Master.

1083
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,380
To run with the pack.

1084
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,500
I wish I was in dog heaven.

1085
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,660
What's instinct to a dog?

1086
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,280
To hunt.

1087
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,860
To kill, Master.

1088
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,260
To run with the pack.

1089
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,380
I want to go to dog heaven.

1090
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:12,080
It was as if the synchronicities of the coincidental ufology of it all

1091
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,020
just came together in one gigantic lightning strike of...

1092
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,040
of...

1093
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,300
of...

1094
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:17,300


1095
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:17,440
of...

1096
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:17,840
of...

1097
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,660
of...

1098
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,480
One harmonic...

1099
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:19,660
of...

1100
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:19,660


1101
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:20,680
Synchrotinduity.

1102
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,140
Right.

1103
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,880
One of the things that really frustrates me,

1104
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,360
and I don't say very much about this because this is not my thing,

1105
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,280
but we talk all the time about the fact that in Christ we're all one.

1106
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,560
That it doesn't matter what color our skin is.

1107
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,320
But you know what?

1108
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,820
You get among Christians when nobody's listening

1109
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:41,440
you find out that what they say they believe they don't really believe.

1110
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,100
They're closet racists.

1111
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,640
We have to be what we are.

1112
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,320
Not what the father tried to make us.

1113
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,860
The Morlocks living here, underground, are the masters of this age.

1114
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,700
And our friends up above?

1115
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:04,720
Fatted cattle, fed by the Morlocks, clothed, supplied, and housed until the day when...

1116
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,300
When they're cut out of the herd and brought underground as food.

1117
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,040
This is the future you're looking at.

1118
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,900
Life is grim, is it not?

1119
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,080
Life is grim.

1120
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:23,580
You drive through town and see the abandoned factories.

1121
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,640
The ice caps are melting.

1122
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,240
The water is rising.

1123
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,880
The world will soon be drowned.

1124
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,820
The plague is spreading.

1125
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,140
Yes, yes, the booboos are on everyone, master.

1126
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,700
All is lost.

1127
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,300
Yes, yes.

1128
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,220
Barbarism and inhumanity reign in the streets.

1129
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,220
The children of lost souls.

1130
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:05,000
The world is coming to an end.

1131
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,220
Yes, master.

1132
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,760
Yes, master.

1133
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:13,380
These are all signs of the end time.

1134
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,720
Yes, master.

1135
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,500
You sneak up on your man.

1136
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,700
You know they're after you.

1137
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,380
They're not being paranoid.

1138
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,300
They really are after you.

1139
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,620
That means you better know who your friends are, buddy.

1140
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:31,720
They're coming for you.

1141
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:40,940
You better know where you're going to find Sukor, an aide, when the big hammer comes down.

1142
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,140
You know what I mean.

1143
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,220
Can't get it in the...

1144
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:43,800
Me!

1145
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:45,260
Me!

1146
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:45,740
Me!

1147
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:45,880
Me!

1148
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,000
Me!

1149
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,500
Me!

1150
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:46,520
Me!

1151
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:46,560
Me!

1152
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:46,560


1153
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:46,560


1154
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:46,560


1155
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:46,560


1156
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:46,560


1157
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:46,560


1158
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:46,560


1159
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,080
little Morlocks below.

1160
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,680
Sure, today the Morlocks

1161
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,500
are little friends.

1162
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,640
Stunted,

1163
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,480
rather depressing looking

1164
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,060
as they are. Maybe pathetic

1165
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,520
and sad.

1166
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,700
But you know that in the future

1167
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,760
they will be the ones who run things.

1168
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,480
Sure, the pinks may live in their

1169
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,380
mansions up above ground

1170
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,800
being fed mysteriously

1171
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,440
every night somehow.

1172
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,980
Fattened up.

1173
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,320
And they never grow old

1174
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,380
because when they turn 30

1175
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,360
they're taken away by the Morlocks

1176
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,400
at night and fed to Morlocks

1177
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,260
families. So there are two species

1178
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,020
of men in this world. Yes.

1179
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,240
The little people above the ground and this

1180
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,340
obscene thing, this bleached monster

1181
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,100
below. That white look

1182
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,140
common to animals that live in the dark.

1183
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,200
Does it guarantee my future for all

1184
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:36,580
eternity?

1185
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,620
We've got to get back to the ship.

1186
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:46,860
Listen.

1187
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,680
The crickets have stopped.

1188
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,540
Come on. We don't know when they

1189
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,280
change back to

1190
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,600
whatever they really are.

1191
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,280
You know, it's so great to sort of

1192
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,440
bury the hatchet and just

1193
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,300
hate each other freely.

1194
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,220
Life is such a tricky thing.

1195
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,900
God is burning in one place

1196
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,100
and then it's falling over

1197
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,460
here in North America.

1198
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:12,340
This huge hit that the earth

1199
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,020
took.

1200
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,820
When India lit the

1201
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,540
match and

1202
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:20,120
Mexico blew out the smoke

1203
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,000
and now we're getting the second

1204
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,620
hand shotgun hit.

1205
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,260
All of those things are certainly interesting to think about.

1206
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,020
You know, the ring of fire

1207
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,200
goes off like mad.

1208
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,840
We're having so much

1209
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,100
crap in the air that old people

1210
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,720
are keeling over and

1211
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,720
the crops aren't growing.

1212
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,700
And the plankton starts to die

1213
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,660
in the ocean.

1214
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,500
All the fishes are dead and the

1215
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,280
ocean gets to tasting like wormwood.

1216
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,980
Chocolate triceratops

1217
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,160
with naked babes on their

1218
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,040
backs come creeping up out of the water

1219
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,880
shambling towards Bethlehem

1220
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:00,560
still.

1221
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,240
I can see it

1222
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,540
in the vision, in the prophecy,

1223
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,920
in discernment.

1224
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,440
The children of the yeti,

1225
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,320
the children of the pink

1226
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,520
shall grovel together.

1227
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,820
The yeti shall impregnate

1228
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:17,120
the pink

1229
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,760
and then split, baby.

1230
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,800
This is the way

1231
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,400
the fucking world ends.

1232
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,880
Look at this fucking shit we're in.

1233
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,800
Not with a bang.

1234
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,060
Whimper, and with a whimper, I'm fucking splitting, Jack.

1235
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,460
It's not a metaphor.

1236
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,360
It's not a symbol.

1237
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,880
There really is a giant beast coming out of the ocean.

1238
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,840
But it turns out

1239
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,720
he had bigger plans.

1240
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,840
Godzilla is just a metaphor for the

1241
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,720
beast of revelation, which is a real

1242
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,400
creature, not a metaphor, not

1243
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,100
some sci-fi concept.

1244
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,220
Okay, I'm sorry. Now I understand again.

1245
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,880
What do you think? You think the Bible is a fairy tale?

1246
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,720
No, I know it's a fairy tale.

1247
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,900
I can't figure out why a government

1248
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,960
which we elected would let Godzilla

1249
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,800
out of the tombs after only doing half

1250
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,580
of his sentence, which he couldn't pronounce

1251
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,840
to begin with, you know what I mean?

1252
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,940
Even the jungle wanted him dead.

1253
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,760
And that's who he really took his

1254
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,740
orders from anyway.

1255
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,020
Up against the wall, Godzilla!

1256
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,020
High above an extinct Japanese

1257
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,840
volcano, four heavily

1258
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,880
armored black helicopters spin through

1259
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,320
the sky in a dance

1260
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,360
of death.

1261
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,860
I love the smell of

1262
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:26,720
napalm in the morning.

1263
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,940
Smells like...

1264
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,600
victory.

1265
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,660
Real early in the morning, around 3 a.m.,

1266
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,160
I wake up and I think there's like

1267
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,920
another tiny head that looks just like

1268
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,540
mine that's growing out of my shoulder, man.

1269
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,700
I swear to God, you know, I get real scared.

1270
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,840
I think I'm having the DTs or I don't know

1271
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,340
if I have a drink.

1272
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,520
You wouldn't scare the daylights out of me

1273
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,760
if I looked over and there was a little

1274
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,780
Dave head growing out of my shoulder.

1275
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,080
Well, I heard it was a growing phenomenon

1276
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,820
among a lot of people who just, let's say

1277
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,300
they're dead end in society, dead end

1278
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,560
in America. They just don't, you know,

1279
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,300
have nowhere to go.

1280
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,300
The losers of America?

1281
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,900
The homeless are growing little

1282
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,380
cowboy Dave heads on their shoulders?

1283
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,000
No, they're finding their own little heads,

1284
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,960
but they got, you know, a middle tooth

1285
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,380
knocked down and a cowboy hat on.

1286
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,820
And they try and sing once in a while

1287
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,800
growing out of the side of their heads.

1288
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,380
They're finding them in soup kitchens

1289
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,920
and sometimes even posh

1290
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,420
brazzeries on the lower west side.

1291
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,220
It was just, it was

1292
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,340
one of them goat-like

1293
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,080
things that came out of the screen.

1294
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,000
I first saw it in Pong

1295
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,180
a long time ago, like maybe 20 years ago.

1296
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,440
It's been probably been following you

1297
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,260
ever since then.

1298
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,200
It has glowing blue eyes like this,

1299
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,640
like luminous red face.

1300
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,480
I've been seeing it for, uh,

1301
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,240
sheesh, 45 seconds.

1302
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,080
I wish you wouldn't talk about the moon billies.

1303
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,700
Got those, those entities really give me the creeps.

1304
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,580
They're my kin, man.

1305
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,000
Don't, don't mess with them.

1306
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,900
Wait till you get the sight some night,

1307
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,440
some night when the moon is real bright

1308
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,320
and you get the sight.

1309
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,000
The moon is never bright.

1310
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,420
You can see them dancing out there and they're,

1311
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,640
they're, they're a very, very bright,

1312
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:14,120
very horrifying.

1313
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,280
The moon is actually very gray and dark

1314
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,060
when you're there.

1315
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,260
It's not white at all.

1316
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,680
It, it, I don't, I don't, I still don't know

1317
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,860
why it looks white from Earth.

1318
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,680
Hello, Houston, we've got a beautiful view

1319
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,660
of the Earth here, but it's absolutely fantastic.

1320
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,900
It's like regular Earth hillbillies,

1321
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,360
except they got an exoskeleton, eight legs,

1322
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,000
and a, and a, and a prehensile proboscis

1323
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,220
that can rip your guts out.

1324
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:39,320
What were you dreaming?

1325
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,100
Oh, the ship.

1326
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,540
It came from the sky again.

1327
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:46,500
And the tall man stepped out and talked with me,

1328
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,440
telling me little jokes and laughing.

1329
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,600
In una experimento.

1330
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,040
Sputnik your life.

1331
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:59,820
The nuclear test ban treaty was signed.

1332
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,880
The fall of the was designed to cripple the morons.

1333
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,680
Americano in the homicidal del Presidente Salvador Allende.

1334
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,800
There can be no whitewash at the White House.

1335
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,560
A series of record oil company profits.

1336
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:12,920
.

1337
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:13,640
.

1338
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1339
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1340
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1341
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1342
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1343
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1344
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1345
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1346
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1347
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1348
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1349
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1350
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1351
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1352
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1353
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1354
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1355
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1356
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1357
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1358
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1359
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1360
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1361
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1362
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1363
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,640


1364
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:43,660


1365
00:55:43,660 --> 00:56:13,660


1366
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,520
fixing the

1367
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:39,620
Well, this will be my song,

1368
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,820
after읔 is gone with the ice.

1369
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,620
Who would take their control?

1370
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:43,640
I can build my own

1371
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:43,640


1372
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:43,640


1373
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:43,640


1374
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:43,640


1375
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:43,640


1376
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,040
They couldn't go to Neptune or Uranus.

1377
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,820
Twin worlds in eternal night and perpetual cold.

1378
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:55,340
Both surrounded by an unbreathable atmosphere of methane gas and ammonia vapor.

1379
00:56:55,820 --> 00:57:00,520
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.

1380
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:03,160
Thou anointest my head with oil.

1381
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,000
My cup runneth over.

1382
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:15,180
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

1383
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:28,400
When the CIA sends an agent on a spying mission, I'm sure he is well qualified.

1384
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,420
I have nothing to do with the CIA.

1385
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,900
Do you know that if is the middle word in life?

1386
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,980
If you can keep your head when all about you lose your mind.

1387
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,420
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you.

1388
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,540
I'm a little man.

1389
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,660
He's a great man.

1390
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:47,780
I should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across floors of silent seas.

1391
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,220
David the boat.

1392
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,920
Don't go without me.

1393
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,720
I want to get a picture.

1394
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,500
The man is clear in his mind.

1395
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,120
But his soul is mad.

1396
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,740
I want to go home.

1397
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,600
I want to go home.

1398
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,340
I want to go home.

1399
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:19,340


1400
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:23,160
Oh I want to go home.

1401
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,200
We set sail on this new sea.

1402
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,800
Because there is new knowledge to be gained.

1403
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,920
And new rights to be won.

1404
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:34,980
And new arms to be held.

1405
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,860
And they must be won and used.

1406
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,280
For the progress of all mankind.

1407
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:43,500
I truly do believe that you are able to pull out of the subconscious.

1408
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:50,700
A great many things that you absorbed in those moments while you were there looking back at the earth.

1409
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:56,640
And I can almost transform my body, certainly my mind, through time and space instantaneously to that spot on the moon.

1410
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,280
I know where I am when I look at the moon.

1411
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:04,120
It's not just some abstract romantic idea.

1412
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,880
It's something very real to me.

1413
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,300
The stars are my home.

1414
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,180
The stars are my home.

1415
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,620
Sail man completed his first exploration of the moon.

1416
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,080
We are the hollow men.

1417
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,140
We are the stuff of men.

1418
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:20,780
Leaning together.

1419
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,540
Headpiece filled with straw.

1420
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,200
Alas.

1421
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,660
Our dried voices when we whisper together are quiet and meaningless.

1422
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,520
Wind and dry grass.

1423
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,080
A rat's feet.

1424
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,040
Oh, he's out there.

1425
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,360
Yes, and our dry sun.

1426
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,900
He's really out there.

1427
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,020
Shape without form.

1428
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,380
Shade without color.

1429
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,040
Paralyzed force.

1430
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,100
Gesture without motion.

1431
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,720
Do you know what the man is saying?

1432
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:53,800
Do you?

1433
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,920
Those who would cross with erect eyes.

1434
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:56,940
This is dialectics.

1435
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,860
It's very simple dialectics.

1436
00:59:58,900 --> 00:59:59,600
One through nine.

1437
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,120
No maybes, no supposes, no fractions.

1438
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,620
You can't travel in space.

1439
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:07,820
You can't go out into space, you know, without like, you know, with fractions.

1440
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,820
What are you going to land on?

1441
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,080
One quarter, three eighths.

1442
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,480
What are you going to do when you go from here to Venus or something?

1443
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,500
That's dialectic physics, okay?

1444
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,880
Dialectic logic is there's only love and hate.

1445
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,180
You either love somebody or you hate them.

1446
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:27,520
I've never completely freed myself of the suspicion that there are some extremely odd things about this mission.

1447
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:33,360
Certainly no one could have been unaware of the very strange stories floating around before we left.

1448
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,800
Rumors about something being dug up on the moon.

1449
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,520
Now it's been ten thousand years.

1450
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:44,000
Man has cried a billion tears.

1451
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,660
For what he never knew.

1452
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,420
Now man's reign is through.

1453
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,640
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

1454
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,480
I'm sorry, Dave.

1455
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,840
I'm afraid I can't do that.

1456
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,820
Someday I'll be home.

1457
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,100
Someday I'll touch the shore.

1458
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,600
And distance myself.

1459
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:03,940
Somewhere.

1460
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,060
Much longer away.

1461
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,440
I'll do so, Dave.

1462
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:21,360
If you get bored, Dave, you can always just put a note in a bottle and send it out into the radio waves.

1463
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,920
Like you've just done for the last time.

1464
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,440
This has been ESO Radio.
