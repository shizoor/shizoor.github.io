1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
I and only I will decide when and how much we eat. Any argument about that, I

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,800
settle it with this. Oh, you're a tough man, all right, packing that gun. Just don't let

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,700
go of it. I don't intend to.

4
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,360
I haven't had time for your kind of woman. Don't touch me. I can't stand you.

5
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:55,020
Now the world don't move to the beat of just one drum. What might be right for you may

6
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,660
not be right for some. A man is born. He's a man of need.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,620
They're not wrong from you. They got nothing in their genes.

8
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,440
They take different strokes. They take different strokes.

9
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,160
They take different strokes to move the world.

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,640
Everybody's got a special kind of story. Everybody's got a way to shine.

11
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,100
But no matter what they got, not a lot. So what?

12
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,240
They're all theirs. You'll have yours and I'll have mine.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,060
And together we'll be fine.

14
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,900
Take a different stroke.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
It takes a different stroke.

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,600
It takes a different stroke to move the world.

17
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,460
Yes, it does.

18
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,400
It takes a different stroke to move the world.

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,780
This is not true.

20
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,700
No, this is not important either.

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:55,200
It's not important to know whether a dog gets your command or is commanded by you or gives

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
you rhetorical questions about existence.

23
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,800
I.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,080
I can picture in my mind an ancient sage, perhaps 5,000 years BC, walking across the

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:12,460
desert, carrying a pipe in one hand and wearing a little funny tie in the other hand.

26
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,640
Yes, as he crosses the hot sands and the blisters grow in both his brain and on his feet.

27
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,000
This is so unimportant.

28
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,380
His fever is going.

29
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,160
People say my dog looks like Toto.

30
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,880
Yes, it does.

31
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,420
I'm the Wizard of Oz.

32
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,400
I tell you one thing.

33
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,540
My dog is always with me.

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,540
Don't tell Bob.

35
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,420
I won't tell Bob.

36
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,540
Fuck that guy.

37
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,800
Come and listen to a story about a man named Jed.

38
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,900
The poor mountaineer barely kept his family from bullying crude black tea.

39
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,480
Well,

40
00:02:59,480 --> 00:02:59,860
the first time he was born,

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,820
California is up the truck of swimming stars.

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,320
The Billy.

43
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,820
The Hillbilly.

44
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,400
Bar-

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,900
Billy.

46
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,720
Hilly.

47
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,680
Oh, what the what?

48
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,840
All right, now everybody just act cool.

49
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,060
I don't think so.

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,660
Bob.

51
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,900
Goddamn Bob.

52
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,380
No.

53
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,200
I just want to Bob rat face Bob.

54
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:40,960
Asshole.

55
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,860
Look at me.

56
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,020
Look at me.

57
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,420
I'm a kid.

58
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,720
Wow.

59
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,220
We're back with a.

60
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,120
What were you saying about the Moose Patrol?

61
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,320
The organization's first meeting.

62
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,840
And after that little encore in the back room, I hope you're all feeling an awful lot better.

63
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,780
Know that the vents have been closed and it looks like only three or four people are going

64
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,580
to have any permanent brain damage.

65
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,920
So let's get on.

66
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,900
We want to.

67
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,120
I think it's Father Winkley as it's his turn to speak on ecumen and then I don't know if

68
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,640
I'm saying this right in the new century and slack.

69
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,880
So if you'd like to give a warm pair of hands and just put them right here where I can feel

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,080
it.

71
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,960
Thank you.

72
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,680
And we'll.

73
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,640
Are you pulled out?

74
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,040
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:29,840
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:41,660
That's not the only one.

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,160
That's not the only one.

78
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,720
That's not the only one we need to talk to.

79
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,520
Is it too Meghan?

80
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:48,880
Yes, it is.

81
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,280
She called me last night and said, can I get a text message to it?

82
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,160
I don't think so but I want to about what you said about you calling me out.

83
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,260
Yeah, sure that you wanted to interrupt me as I was CE.

84
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:55,860


85
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:55,860


86
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:55,860


87
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:55,860


88
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:55,920
I forgot to mention that, you hate the marriage okay?

89
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:55,920


90
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:55,920


91
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:55,980


92
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,080
G send off an admin to watch over and over again and play a quarrel with the

93
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,300
reac

94
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,620
Thanks Hold on, whose is that?

95
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,260
Damn it.

96
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,260


97
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,260


98
00:04:59,780 --> 00:04:59,820
You're-

99
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:05,260
if you will, the global overmind is somehow lapsing into a coma.

100
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,680
And we think that perhaps in each country there are maybe a few avatars,

101
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,820
a few saviors, if you will, a few people willing to raise the rod of slack

102
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,540
and place it where the sun don't shine and continue the struggle

103
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,340
if we are indeed struggling with something here.

104
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,600
I hope, at least I hope, I hope, that we can all contribute in some small way

105
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,260
and I can't go on.

106
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,940
That was the voice of the under-mook,

107
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,080
unable to express the lofty thoughts of the overmind.

108
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:48,200
The poor under-mook is reduced to sobbing and mewling and puking on college radio.

109
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,840
I look up and I see thoughts, I smell them and there they are and yet I can't touch them.

110
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,540
Ice cream tastes like laughter.

111
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,840
But feel like it's slack.

112
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,580
In the...

113
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,860
This life or another one.

114
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,540
Who knows?

115
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,720
Who cares?

116
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,800
Does the universe...

117
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,180
Why should the universe care about you and your slack?

118
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,660
That's right.

119
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,960
Why should the universe care if you have anything at all?

120
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,460
Let alone that little, little, teeny, tiny dandelion you're holding in your pocket.

121
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,360
Walk on, friend.

122
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,620
You're penniless and you get nothing.

123
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,660
Except slack.

124
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,940
Loads and loads.

125
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,340
If you sign...

126
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:28,620
And here.

127
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,060
And here.

128
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,340
And here.

129
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,760
There you go.

130
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,100
Thank you.

131
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,500
And here.

132
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,520
Don't forget to...

133
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,440
Don't make no sense and it's not supposed to.

134
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,300
The nights are gay and the sun...

135
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,600
This won't make too much sense but it's not intended to.

136
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,600
Well, well, well, that's our excuse anyway.

137
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,620
It has been since 1979.

138
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,580
Well, we welcome you to Hour of Slack.

139
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,160
Number...

140
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,280
828.

141
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:08,840
Using bits of other shows such as Chaz Smith's ESO Swamp Radio on WCSB Cleveland

142
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,920
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave, which we heard just then.

143
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:23,840
And before that, the Beverly Pillbillies cut up by Fernandanande Limur,

144
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,580
who will also be doing the weather.

145
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,320
And other clips coming up on the show.

146
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,960
Different strokes there.

147
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,040
The TV show theme, which we're still doing a bit of.

148
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,580
That was by Todd Bridges.

149
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,380
And...

150
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,480
And, uh...

151
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,840
The music in the background here is Einstein's Secret Orchestra with Ron Slabe,

152
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,860
recorded at Winterstar 2001.

153
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,320
Here in Dobstown, friends, it's Malaysian junkies.

154
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,920
Meanwhile, an area of low coast.

155
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,100
It could be tonight, maybe early in the morning.

156
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,680
And Cape Clip Coastal's just fine.

157
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,240
41, 39, and 39 up in Wappentrees Falls up here on the Hudson River.

158
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,040
Boston, near from the Cape.

159
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,380
Outlook for the Midwest, more and more low.

160
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,280
Here's Christina.

161
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,140
And in the south, we're going to see most of the south,

162
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,440
but parts of southern Florida, maybe around Miami by the afternoon.

163
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,100
But we think into the evening hours in Orlando and Miami tomorrow.

164
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,660
Let's take a look at wet weather.

165
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,220
Wet weather.

166
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,640
Wet weather.

167
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
Wetter weather lingering in the area.

168
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,600
Now, in the west, for you, expect a high.

169
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,540
Paul, please tell us your high.

170
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,040
Oh!

171
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,300
Yeah, my friend.

172
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,400
I won't forget it.

173
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,180
I'm hungry.

174
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,440
I need food, meat, red meat.

175
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,760
Nearly raw.

176
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,760
I don't know why, but it'll do me good.

177
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,640
And so, here's the meat men.

178
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,720
GIVE ME THAT COUNTRYSIDE

179
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:11,720


180
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:11,720


181
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,220
Green Acres is the place to be Farm livin' is the life for me

182
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,520
Land stretching out so far and wide Keep Manhattan, just give me that countryside

183
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:24,720
XT

184
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,460
I get a magic-smelling hang.

185
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,800
I just adore the penthouse view.

186
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,120
Darling, I love you, but give me Park Avenue.

187
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,580
The chores.

188
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,380
The stores.

189
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,380
Fresh air.

190
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,160
Times Square.

191
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,100
You are my wife.

192
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,060
Goodbye, city life.

193
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,660
Green Acres, we are there.

194
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,160
Did you hear about the new gorilla that they found in the condo?

195
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,140
These are the gorilla-like creatures that raised Tarzan.

196
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:08,020
Tarzan was not raised by gorillas or orangutans or normal primate apes.

197
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,380
He's raised by these mutants.

198
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,700
Well, by yeti.

199
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,200
Full-blood yeti.

200
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,900
By yetis.

201
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,760
That explains everything.

202
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,760
That explains his lisp.

203
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,880
That explains the weird cranial dents.

204
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,420
That explains the hairy orifices on the side of him.

205
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,260
That explains everything.

206
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,100
That explains why he was so sexy.

207
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,400
Tarzan was sexy because he learned that from the yetis who raised him.

208
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:39,940
This is the kind of music Americans need to listen to as they march to war against these strange mutant gorillas.

209
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,760
You know, a lot of kids today don't know that Tarzan was based on a real god.

210
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,460
That there really was a Lord Greystoke who was raised by these Bigfoot creatures.

211
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,300
In the old days, we called him Lord Greatstumper for the amount of wanking he did in a short period of time.

212
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,100
Well, that was why they had to change it.

213
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,720
They had to change it in the novels because that's about all he really did.

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,480
The mind of an ancient oriental dog.

215
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,260
Insert transition here.

216
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,900
Do you know your daughter well?

217
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,920
Do you know she's dreaming?

218
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,460
Do you know your daughter well?

219
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,840
Talk to her soon.

220
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,900
Do you know your daughter well?

221
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,840
And do you know she's dreaming?

222
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,860
You know as well as I, she stays higher than the moon.

223
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,780
And do you know your sister well?

224
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,740
And did you know she's drinking?

225
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,340
Do you know your sister well?

226
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,700
Talk to her soon.

227
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,880
Boy, do you know your sister well?

228
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,600
You know I think she's losing.

229
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,640
You know as well as I, she stays higher than the moon.

230
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,100
Thanks for the information.

231
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,280
Thanks for no thanks for the information.

232
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,820
Thanks for no thanks for the information.

233
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,180
Cause information's got your number two.

234
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,860
And do you know your brother well?

235
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,800
And the company he's keeping?

236
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,340
Do you know your brother well?

237
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,740
Talk to him tonight.

238
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,760
Or do you know your brother well?

239
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,400
He's very, very well.

240
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,040
Very, very strange, they tell.

241
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,180
Probably he'll go to hell.

242
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,700
Unless you steer him right.

243
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,060
Thanks for the information.

244
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,460
Thanks for no thanks for the information.

245
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,620
Thanks for no thanks for the information.

246
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,180
Cause information's got your number two.

247
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,080
Yeah.

248
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,700
Yeah.

249
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,380
Thank you.

250
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:25,380


251
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:25,560
Yeah.

252
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,060
Yeah.

253
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,500
Thank you.

254
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,280
Woo!

255
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,960
Well, yes, I know my daughter well.

256
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,860
And yes, I know she's dreaming.

257
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,540
Yes, I know my sister well.

258
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,020
That's the way it goes.

259
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,940
I know my sister all too well.

260
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,940
Yes, I know she's drinking.

261
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,940
How do I pigeon her for something she already knows?

262
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,800
And yes, I know my brother well and the company he's keeping.

263
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,340
Yes, I know my brother well.

264
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,760
He sings a different tune.

265
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,760
Oh, yes, I know my brother well.

266
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,060
I've heard it said he's queer as hell.

267
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,280
Pray that he's in love as well.

268
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,720
Fire's on the moon.

269
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,260
pérennés

270
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,660
Don't relatively eat or drink.

271
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,320
Let's rap your

272
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,140
began

273
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,740
Information.

274
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,940
Thanks for the information.

275
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,900
Cause information's got your number too.

276
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,800
Oh, it's me, dude.

277
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,440
Ask yourself, have you gotten right with Bob lately?

278
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,920
Or are you living and backsliding life of sin?

279
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,820
Or sinlessness, as the case may be.

280
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,540
It's just as bad.

281
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,340
All we care about is slack.

282
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,920
Sin is, that's to the eye of the beholder.

283
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,980
You know, that's a pluck it out yourself thing.

284
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,360
It's slack.

285
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,800
Slack is what Bob is interested in.

286
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,780
He don't care whether you've got some negative problem with sin.

287
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,000
He wants to know whether you are getting slack in a positive way.

288
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,900
Real positive.

289
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,000
Positive, self-actualized, prosperity-oriented slack.

290
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,280
Now, boys and girls.

291
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,380
Can you describe the event yourself as a moment of slack?

292
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,920
Is it in your own personality?

293
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,960
Say, this is slack.

294
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,300
That's how we judge, friends.

295
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,680
We judge if a person says, hey, this is happening for me.

296
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,340
This is slack.

297
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,320
It is slack.

298
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,580
We don't care if somebody's sticking up the weird and clad to watch your ass again.

299
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,620
But we're not worried about people who do have slack tonight, Dave.

300
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:52,160
Dave, tonight, we're on an evangelical, deviable witch hunt.

301
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,820
We want the people who don't have.

302
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,700
We want the people who don't have slack tonight.

303
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,660
We want to reach out.

304
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,360
To listen in.

305
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,940
We want to reach out to you.

306
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,760
We're not preaching to the choir tonight.

307
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,040
We're reaching out to the people who don't have any slack in their lives.

308
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:05,880
I'm in the spirit.

309
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,720
I can feel this man out there.

310
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,140
He's saying, my God, these people are out.

311
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,480
That's worse than a sin.

312
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,280
It sounds crazy.

313
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,280
It sounds crazy, but it's true.

314
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,560
The arguments we've gotten with the Blackbirds.

315
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,120
Sometimes when we're out in the field by ourselves, people recognize us.

316
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:19,360
My God.

317
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:19,720
My God.

318
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,280
You know, this is a sheer sign that slack is not a part of everyone's life.

319
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:24,780
Before.

320
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:24,800
Before.

321
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,180
It should be.

322
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,120
Slack is missing in this land of 911 and other emergencies.

323
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,700
Dave, can I offer a testimonial here?

324
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,040
You can put your, every testicle you got right there and we'll follow you.

325
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,920
Testimonial.

326
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,420
Here's my testimonial.

327
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:46,340
Boys and girls, a few years back, I was a hard-ass motorcycle riding road with a bad-ass gang.

328
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,140
Amen.

329
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,400
Lived in the bars at night.

330
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,660
I slept with anything that moved in the bar.

331
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,840
I'd go home with anything.

332
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,760
I ran drugs.

333
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,120
That's right.

334
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,560
I did LSD and I did heroin.

335
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,960
I did LSD and heroin together.

336
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,180
I looked terrible.

337
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:11,000
I wouldn't even go home because I didn't want my family to see how bad I'd become.

338
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:17,380
And I was living it alive and I was living it with all these people who didn't care a damn about life.

339
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,720
And we just lived on our motorcycles and rode from town to town.

340
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,260
Raping women.

341
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,700
Murdering.

342
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,100
Robbing people.

343
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,200
Robbing stores whenever we needed.

344
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,380
We just, if we wanted something, we just plucked it off the tree and we had it.

345
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,240
Lord have mercy.

346
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,100
God have mercy.

347
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,820
And I thought that was what life was about.

348
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,820
I thought I was living good.

349
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,640
I thought I was on top of the world.

350
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,120
Nobody could topple me.

351
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,120
But I'll tell you one thing.

352
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,720
Bob toppled me.

353
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,280
I realized one day I was slackless.

354
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,520
I was working too hard for all this money and whores.

355
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,680
And drugs.

356
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,140
Why should I have to pull out a gun and shoot somebody?

357
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,000
That's too much work.

358
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,380
That ain't no slack.

359
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,560
I found Bob.

360
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,040
I found real slack.

361
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,760
I don't have to rob the stores anymore.

362
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,640
I own the store.

363
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,660
What a, oh, what a poison.

364
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,400
Oh my God, what a testimonial.

365
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,040
What a poison testimonial.

366
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,960
Bob has come down into this man's life.

367
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,820
Can you feel how this man's life has been changed?

368
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,560
The sincerity.

369
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,100
The sincerity is flowing out of him like a river.

370
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,340
Oh my God, look at the car.

371
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,360
Say amen, brother.

372
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,160
It's just like the green oily pores in the back of his neck opening up to let the slack out.

373
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,440
Only this way they actually return to his body and come back and give him more slack.

374
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,180
And it was a bad night when I realized that I was slackless.

375
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,120
I was having a good night.

376
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,040
I'd murdered three store clerks.

377
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,220
I'd screwed 14 hookers.

378
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,600
I was having so much dope in my blood veins.

379
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,140
I was on top of the world.

380
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,040
It was a great night.

381
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,020
But I sat down.

382
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,680
Sat down on the curb right next to my bike.

383
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,000
Started laughing.

384
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,880
I couldn't stop laughing.

385
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,040
I laughed and I laughed until my heart hurt.

386
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,820
And then finally my heart stopped hurting and it felt great.

387
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,400
I just kept laughing and laughing at the world.

388
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,700
This form of laughter is a form of spiritual release.

389
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,100
And I heard the sirens in the distance.

390
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,000
I hopped on my bike.

391
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,340
I got the hell out of there.

392
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,920
That's what slack can do for you kids.

393
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:41,560
Slack can pull you out of that gun-toting, drug-doing, horror-messing lifestyle you got going there.

394
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,660
There was a day when slack for me was the realization.

395
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,100
Oh my God.

396
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,800
It's just that I'm insane.

397
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,640
Oh thank God.

398
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,660
It's not what I thought.

399
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,900
I was just crazy.

400
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,560
Yeah.

401
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,160
It's merely my mind is gone.

402
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,120
What an incredible relief.

403
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,940
You see all those judges sitting up in tribunal amongst you and then looking down at you and

404
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,080
suddenly you realize it's your own self saying, Stang, I am crazy.

405
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,160
You are.

406
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:10,800
We both.

407
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,320
You is.

408
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:11,940
I am you.

409
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,900
And the worst thing.

410
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,380
And you know that slack has saved you again.

411
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,680
The worst thing is that the judges, they're French.

412
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,300
I said to myself, well.

413
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,760
They have the little belt to ring.

414
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,880
They go ding-a-ling-a-ling.

415
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,660
If we don't want to get down to it, you finally have to remind yourself, if my baby don't

416
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:35,580
love me no more, I know good and well that her sister will.

417
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,660
And after that, sit down and think about this.

418
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,960
You'll never hear surf again.

419
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
What the hell are you talking about?

420
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,460
You just confused me.

421
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,260
Well, never hear.

422
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,160
After you hear.

423
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,640
Never hear.

424
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,040
Never hear surf music.

425
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,240
After these people.

426
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:54,640
Dave.

427
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,320
Dave, listen to me now.

428
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,000
And then you should hear it.

429
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,700
Dave, just listen.

430
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,620
Shut up and listen.

431
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,240
Okay, okay.

432
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,060
After these people come to that revival on March 15th at the Beecham Ballroom here,

433
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,860
Einstein's Secret Orchestra play a surf rock version of Britney Spears' Oops, I Did It Again.

434
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,920
In military uniform.

435
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,300
In military garb.

436
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,080
With the anti-girls.

437
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,940
With the incredible background videos.

438
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,980
I think it is safe then to say, you will never hear surf again.

439
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,080
Well.

440
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,700
I thought, you know, I was amidst this pool of slack.

441
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,600
This whirling, gathering pool of slack.

442
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,600
And suddenly I could see these waves cresting and breaking over my flow field tubes and so forth.

443
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,300
And I knew that was, you know, surf, man.

444
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,000
You know.

445
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,740
You were surfing.

446
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,180
You were surfing the luck plane.

447
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,700
And then suddenly you wiped out.

448
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,060
Get on that stream, baby.

449
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,540
Suddenly we wiped you out.

450
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,440
Because we pulled the rug out from any, right?

451
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,720
We weren't talking about what you thought.

452
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,220
But I look down on myself and I say, it's slack, right, Dave?

453
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,100
And Dave says, yeah.

454
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,420
It's like, so we say, not guilty, huh?

455
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,520
Surfing the stream of consciousness.

456
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,240
The fish judges.

457
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:57,920
Uh-oh.

458
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,020
Surfing your stream of consciousness.

459
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,060
Make sure you've got enough wax on that board when you surf your stream of consciousness.

460
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,820
But don't wipe out when you surf in the stream of consciousness.

461
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,860
Because there's a danger on the tube.

462
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,140
And don't get caught in the tube, either.

463
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,860
A very dangerous on the tube.

464
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,540
You get stuck.

465
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,420
And if that pipeline collapses on you when you're surfing your stream of consciousness.

466
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:18,940
Forget it.

467
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,920
You ain't coming back.

468
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,500
Don't surf like a French judge, my friend.

469
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,140
No.

470
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,400
No.

471
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,520
You don't want to be a French judge.

472
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,780
Come on.

473
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,880
Come on.

474
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,340
Grow up.

475
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,380
Don't be a French judge.

476
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,200
Yeah.

477
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,900
What kind of a hoedaddy are you anyway?

478
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah.

479
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,940
Into Uranus.

480
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,840
All the new world wonders me.

481
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,540
With your majestic, subdued, cackling hand.

482
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,560
Your people I do not understand.

483
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,620
So do you.

484
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,700
You must have put it for you.

485
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,500
Never hear surf music again.

486
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,640
Ah, some Hendrix.

487
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,140
And some ESO Swamp Radio.

488
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,400
And before that, the Rainmakers.

489
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,580
Rainmakers from their first album, that song, Information.

490
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,300
And here's some.

491
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:33,400
The Church of the Subgenius was co-founded under Bob by Dr. Philo Drummond.

492
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,640
And yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stank.

493
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:45,560
Dr. Drummond, Philo Drummond, the overman of church legend, is also a church doctor,

494
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,480
which means that he makes music which cuts into you.

495
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,540
And then sews you back up.

496
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:58,720
And so, let us briefly, and then again at the end of the show, enter Philo.

497
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,100
Excuse me, sir.

498
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,940
There's a call for you.

499
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,820
Hello, Becky.

500
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,600
It's your time.

501
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,220
Zach, I got a sporting event laid out for this Saturday.

502
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,960
A fire eater named Philo.

503
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,540
Philo, never heard of him.

504
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,300
I know nothing.

505
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,220
Nothing.

506
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,460
Lord, you have to be careful.

507
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:19,460


508
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:19,460


509
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:19,460


510
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:26,380
I've given me these crosses to bear, and I will carry them all the way from Jerusalem to Jackson, whichever's closer.

511
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,240
But hear me, Lord.

512
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:34,560
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will choose on Philo's ass for my last supper.

513
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,060
Oh, oh, oh.

514
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,420
You know I'm covered in blood.

515
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:48,760
Oh

516
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,240
Oh.

517
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,580
Malas Shittas, Son of a Ass!

518
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,000
Oh, oh, oh.

519
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,360
You know I'm covered in blood.

520
00:25:59,420 --> 00:25:59,860
Oh

521
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,860
Malas Shittas, Son of a Ass!

522
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,460
Oh.

523
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,720
Oh, oh, oh.

524
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,820
You know I'm covered in blood.

525
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,400
Oh

526
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,120
Malas Shittas, Son of a Ass!

527
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,240


528
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,240


529
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,240


530
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,240


531
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,200
Or is it...

532
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,040
Oh, oh, oh.

533
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,780
Oh, oh, oh, you know what I'm talking about.

534
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,180
Oh.

535
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,800
Oh.

536
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,580
I don't need that.

537
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:34,680
I don't need that.

538
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,100
Oh, oh, oh, you know what I'm talking about.

539
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,720
Oh.

540
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,760
I don't need that.

541
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,060
Son of a, son of a.

542
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,500
Oh, oh, oh.

543
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,160
Oh, oh, oh, you know what I'm talking about.

544
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:49,520


545
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:51,720
Motherfucker.

546
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,840
Motherfucker.

547
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,280
Motherfucker.

548
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,680
Oh.

549
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,660
Oh, oh, oh, you know what I'm talking about.

550
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,020
Oh.

551
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,760
Motherfucker.

552
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,440
Motherfucker.

553
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,480
Oh, oh, oh, you know what I'm talking about.

554
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,580
Thank you.

555
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,340
Thank you.

556
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,120
Thank you.

557
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,740
Cocktails, darling?

558
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,920
Well, maybe some fruit cocktail, then.

559
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,900
Milk? Hot chocolate?

560
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,600
Do you have any of that punch?

561
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,000
Punch?

562
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,500
Let me see now.

563
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,100
Oh, I'll have a martini, please.

564
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,520
Oh, say, isn't that a pretty little drink?

565
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,160
And what a cute little tiny olive.

566
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,860
Hello, little tiny olive.

567
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,960
All gone.

568
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,200
Well, just one more martini, then.

569
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,800
Oh, my goodness, another drinky.

570
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,560
Boy, they sure slide down, don't they?

571
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,760
And with two cute little olives.

572
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,060
Hi, little olives.

573
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,380
Oh, my, that was goody good good.

574
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,260
Oh, but I never drink three martinis.

575
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:31,980
Whee!

576
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,100
Oh, another rinky dinky drinky.

577
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,700
Dance?

578
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,160
I thought we were dancing.

579
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,400
Oh, boy, those olives are strong.

580
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,460
No more timonis for me.

581
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,560
Whee!

582
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,740
Who are you?

583
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,020
Cocktails, darling?

584
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,020
By somebody named Gordo.

585
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,260
From a collection called Frolic Diner.

586
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,900
We've got some more of that coming up.

587
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,980
I got that off of...

588
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,780
Some news group, probably, all.binary slack.

589
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,020
And speaking of which, I should do better credits.

590
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:26,220
I muffed up or wronged some credits in previous shows,

591
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,760
such as the El Queso All-Stars,

592
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,460
who are also now known as Interbulator 009,

593
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:43,220
had to, because of their comedy about the Church of Scientology,

594
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,200
they were banned.

595
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,220
And from mp3.com.

596
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,520
But there's another place called stationmp3.com.

597
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:55,500
Here's the URL for Interbulator 009,

598
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,240
which also used to be El Queso All-Stars.

599
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,120
That's...

600
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,340
Got that pencil ready?

601
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:08,280
www.stationmp3.com

602
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,800
Station MP3 is the one big word in the middle.

603
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,340
Um,

604
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,820
Phineas Narco and the National Cynical Network,

605
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,620
which did such great recent hour of slack hits

606
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,960
as Chap in the Hood, Mentally Deranged,

607
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,480
and All the Stupid People.

608
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,200
I gave his URL wrong.

609
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:27,920
It's actually

610
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,640
i.am

611
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,540

dapper

617
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,600
You don't have to type anything else in.

618
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,560
Similarly, his other URL is

619
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,480
listen.to

620
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,580

voicejail

625
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,620
as in

626
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,820
jail for voices.

627
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,520
Now,

628
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,420
into

629
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,480
a live subgenius revival

630
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,140
recorded last year or two

631
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,440
in Cleveland, Ohio.

632
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,080
Yeah!

633
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,500
My subgenius brothers and sisters,

634
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,280
I, like you, have been

635
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:06,760
saying

636
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,300
every time

637
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,380
I've seen the

638
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,360
broken circle

639
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:10,800
God,

640
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,060
believe us, man!

641
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,540
I, like you, have been

642
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,080
saying

643
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,260
personal saviors

644
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,880
D-L-O-S-N-D

645
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,140
Praise the

646
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,100
King of God

647
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,540
and good luck

648
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,880
to poor old Jesus.

649
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,240
Now, let's text

650
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:23,940
the praise ball.

651
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

652
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:26,680
Hoo!

653
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,660
There's a rock and roll

654
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,980
Jesus, friends.

655
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,640
Don't you get hung up

656
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,120
on that

657
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,180
poor little old

658
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,600
there's so many Jesuses.

659
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,680
The busy buddy

660
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,840
school mom Jesus.

661
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,540
That's only one of them.

662
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,100
You've got to

663
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,740
mend as many

664
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,460
Jesuses as you've got

665
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,900
yourselves inside

666
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,760
of your head.

667
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,040
The hot rod!

668
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,480
There's a surfing

669
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
Jesus, friends.

670
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,700
There's a hot rod

671
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,120
Jesus.

672
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,460
There's a football

673
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,480
playing Jesus.

674
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,680
There's a muscle

675
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,440
builder Jesus

676
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,100
that can tear

677
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,380
phone books in half.

678
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,380
There's a

679
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,140
there's a

680
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,260
transvestite

681
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:02,800
Jesus

682
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,700
that you think

683
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,400
was a woman.

684
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,500
And there's a real

685
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,200
woman Jesus.

686
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,780
There's a

687
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,940
transsexual

688
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,440
Jesus

689
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,660
that puts a

690
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,660
male Jesus

691
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,460
that wanted to be

692
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:12,720
a woman

693
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,780
and then vice versa.

694
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,540
And there's a

695
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,660
lesbian Jesus

696
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,620
that was born man.

697
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,440
And there's a

698
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,360
Jesus that's a

699
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,120
veterinarian

700
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,180
and a Jesus

701
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:21,640
that's a

702
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,180
that just cleans up

703
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,060
after the elephants

704
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,800
that were served.

705
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,000
Friends,

706
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,440
there's a

707
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,160

00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,320
CEO

709
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,480
fat cat

710
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
greedy Jesus.

711
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:31,960
He's a

712
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,120
president of the

713
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,080
board of heaven

714
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,060
incorporating

715
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,700
there's a

716
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,860
janitor Jesus

717
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,900
that works for him

718
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,700
and makes his guts

719
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,060
round.

720
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,580
There's a

721
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,660
Jesus for everybody.

722
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,260
There's a

723
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,240
hooker Jesus

724
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,500
that you pay

725
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,580
any amount of money

726
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,220
to get with.

727
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,160
And there's a

728
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,140
John Jesus

729
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,160
who's after her

730
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,540
right now.

731
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,880
And there's a

732
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,220
guilty Jesus

733
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,180
that feels bad

734
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,260
for what he did.

735
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,320
And there's a

736
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,200
happy Jesus

737
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:56,940
that's proud

738
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,640
of doing the

739
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,660
very same thing.

740
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,520
And friends,

741
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,660
there's bound to be

742
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,780
a Jesus for you

743
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,660
that's probably

744
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,560
weirder than anything

745
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,660
I could ever imagine.

746
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,560
And I can imagine

747
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,380
a lot, friends.

748
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,340
So,

749
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,240
you just be ready

750
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,060
because you never know

751
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,960
when that Jesus

752
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
is going to stand

753
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,860
up behind you.

754
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,000
You don't know

755
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,960
when Bob's looking

756
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,860
and you don't know

757
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,040
when Jesus is looking.

758
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,800
I wouldn't worry

759
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,600
too much about Bob.

760
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,720
He ain't that well connected.

761
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,520
He ain't even

762
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,240
forgiving sins.

763
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:21,900
He ain't even

764
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,860
forgetting his sins.

765
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,380
The big word,

766
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:23,800
forgiving.

767
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,460
Besides,

768
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,560
he brings excuses,

769
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,620
not forgiveness.

770
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,960
But Jesus,

771
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,320
friends,

772
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,320
he will forgive.

773
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,040
I guess he

774
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,820
believes in sin.

775
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,300
Some of them

776
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:33,800
depends on

777
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
the Jesus

778
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,340
depends on you,

779
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:36,780
friends.

780
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,120
And the Jesus

781
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,160
that I heard about

782
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,440
never said

783
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,600
that you had to

784
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,220
go through

785
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,420
some middleman

786
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,460
to talk to him.

787
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,960
As a matter of fact,

788
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,300
the original Jesus

789
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,200
warned him,

790
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:48,920
said,

791
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,240
don't go

792
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,080
telling everybody

793
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,220
about this shit

794
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,700
because they'll

795
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,860
misunderstand it

796
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,120
completely

797
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,480
and try to get

798
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,080
everybody to believe.

799
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,280
That's the book

800
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,240
from the original

801
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,020
Jesus,

802
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:01,940
friends.

803
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,840
Praise God,

804
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,240
Jesus.

805
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,380
Praise God.

806
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,260
Praise God.

807
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,180
Open some

808
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:07,660
of us,

809
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:07,880
people.

810
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,300
Let's pray.

811
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,080
Praise God.

812
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,540
Let's pray.

813
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,240
Let's pray.

814
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,040
Praise your money

815
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,800
and praise your

816
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,660
price of five women

817
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,640
and the five

818
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,920
sacrifice men

819
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,940
and the five

820
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,880
love déjà vies

821
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,740
and the five

822
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,140
beer

823
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,560
and the five

824
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,660
air we still

825
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,300
have to breathe.

826
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:23,880
Right, Bob?

827
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,200
Happy Sunday.

828
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,400
God Micheal

829
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,480
and Paul伝

830
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,140
Whoo!

831
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,260
Yeah.

832
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,040
Yeah.

833
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,640
Yeah.

834
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,440
Yeah.

835
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,700
Yeah.

836
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,800
Yeah.

837
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,180
Yeah.

838
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,680
Oh, yes, dear friends.

839
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:12,140
A little bit of a broken circle gospel deluxe playing there at the, where was it?

840
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,320
The Blind Lemon Tavern here in Cleveland about a year ago.

841
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,820
Thank goodness there's this different kind of dinner roll.

842
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,040
The subgenius agenda.

843
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:31,560
Through the leadership of J.R. Bob Dobbs, his vision of a 22nd century America where subgeniosity is the subgenius lifestyle.

844
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,780
Dobbs has repeatedly addressed subgeniuses saying,

845
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,340
I have a vision.

846
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,600
And you are part of it.

847
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,240
It's lovely.

848
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,320
It's too many.

849
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:03,840
They're all right.

850
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,260
I'm moving on.

851
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,000
Oh, no.

852
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,140
Took me some.

853
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,220
Don't think about the part in this guy.

854
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,680
Move on, move on to the job.

855
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,640
We finally got a piece of the pie.

856
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,160
Yeah.

857
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,620
Yeah.

858
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,540
Yeah.

859
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,280
Yeah.

860
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,200
Yeah.

861
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,720
Yeah.

862
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,960
Yeah.

863
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,840
Yeah.

864
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,280
Oh, boy.

865
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,240
Oh, my God.

866
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,140
Oh, my God.

867
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,520
Oh, my God.

868
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,740
Remember me?

869
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:04,840
Remember me?

870
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,820
Say, how about a little...

871
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,200
Oops.

872
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,320
I'll get it.

873
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:11,700
Don't worry.

874
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,620
I got it.

875
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,900
I'll have a drink.

876
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,480
Thank you.

877
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,020
Oh, boy.

878
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,540
Oh, my God.

879
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,100
It feels like the top of my head is coming off.

880
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,180
Say, tell me, what time does flow come on?

881
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,500
See?

882
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,500
Oh, she does?

883
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,420
Oh, I wish I'd have been here last night.

884
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:53,060
Boy, oh, boy.

885
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,020
That was a good one.

886
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,040
How about a glass of...

887
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,160
Wait.

888
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,860
Hold my seat.

889
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,080
I don't want the water at all.

890
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,980
I'll be right back.

891
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,340
I'm back.

892
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,100
Oh.

893
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,460
I'll have the water now.

894
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:19,920
Thank you.

895
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,540
That's better.

896
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,500
I feel better now.

897
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,920
I feel better now.

898
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,260
I feel better now.

899
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,020
I mean you.

900
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,820
Thank you.

901
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,000
Thank you.

902
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:47,940


903
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,300
Thank you.

904
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:50,440


905
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:50,440


906
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:50,540
Thank you.

907
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:50,600
Thank you.

908
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,500
Thank you.

909
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,460
Thank you.

910
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,280
Thank you.

911
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,960
Thank you.

912
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,340
Thank you.

913
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,340
Thank you.

914
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,080
Thank you.

915
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,820
Thank you.

916
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,240
Thank you.

917
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,820
Thank you.

918
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,000
Thank you.

919
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,500
Thank you.

920
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,380
Thank you.

921
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,340
Thank you.

922
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,120
Thank you.

923
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:03,340
Thank you.

924
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,800
Thank you.

925
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,120
This is disgusting.

926
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,620
It's so wonderful here.

927
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,000
And you've joined us here in the beautiful world.

928
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:36,840
Here at the base of the beautiful world.

929
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,800
I was up at that time.

930
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,380
God, it was terrible.

931
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,240
But don't you feel cleansed?

932
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,840
The 1934 four-door automobile.

933
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,660
It just opens up your pores.

934
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,000
And your birth of...

935
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,320
And Clyde Barrow.

936
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,620
Inspire all over you.

937
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:54,900
Ah, yes.

938
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:55,860
Echo now.

939
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:01,040
Obviously, those girls were just brainwashed idiots.

940
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,940
Yep, it's true.

941
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,420
We're just brainwashed idiots.

942
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,440
But isn't that true of most of them?

943
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,720
Most of them, yes.

944
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,380
And it always is us or them.

945
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,380
If you listen to the earlier shows, I mean, I'm talking 15 years ago.

946
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,360
It's always us or them.

947
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,120
We brought it up all the time.

948
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,100
It's us or them.

949
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,420
And I know you're one of us.

950
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,480
Yeah.

951
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,360
And we aren't them.

952
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,640
And I haven't heard your voice before.

953
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,100
I haven't heard my voice before either.

954
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,140
But what difference does it make?

955
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,120
What voice is this?

956
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:43,040
Oh, this is tape number 643 voice.

957
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,080
You know this subgenius stuff?

958
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,000
Do I?

959
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:48,900
Yeah.

960
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,740
And I love you.

961
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:51,840
Are you asleep now?

962
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,720
I love you too.

963
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,000
Love you too.

964
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,360
Love you too.

965
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,020
Yeah.

966
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,140
You love me too.

967
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,500
She loves both of us.

968
00:49:58,780 --> 00:49:59,440
Love you.

969
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:00,980
I'm like subgenius.

970
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:01,820
Thanks.

971
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,020
You are subgenius?

972
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,180
You're up my handle.

973
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,960
I don't know if she knew you did.

974
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,400
But you can make it.

975
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,780
Messages are erased after 48 hours.

976
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,300
Okay, thanks, thanks.

977
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:13,800
That is crime.

978
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:14,580
Yeah.

979
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,360
Crime must be dealt with forcefully.

980
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:17,740
Stop!

981
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:23,120
Yeah, we're getting ready to fold the show up and put it in a little drawer.

982
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,980
Until next week.

983
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:25,260
We have it.

984
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,820
We still have 12 minutes.

985
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,580
Of show last.

986
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,240
Part of the show usually comes in the last 30 seconds.

987
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,160
Continue listening.

988
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,440
That's why you have to hang on to the bitter end.

989
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,400
Copy the show.

990
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,580
It's actually posted on the internet in several places.

991
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:50,040
I found a site out there that has copies of this show in real audio format.

992
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,780
I'm trying to remember the site name.

993
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,380
I should be able to say that.

994
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,840
We can every show.

995
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,860
We can tag that site.

996
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,700
We can tag that site.

997
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,400
We can tag that site.

998
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,300
During this show.

999
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:58,760
Yeah.

1000
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,920
Oh, but I know a place.

1001
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,540
If you go to www.subgenius.com,

1002
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,560
at subgenius.com, there is a link for the sounds.

1003
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:17,760
So you choose sounds, and that takes you to the area for the hour of slack.

1004
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:24,520
And at the bottom of the hour of slack, there is something called Subgenius Web Ring.

1005
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:24,820
Subgenius Web Ring.

1006
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:29,620
And you click to the right of the web ring, and it takes you.

1007
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:40,620
The first site it takes you to is a site where a guy stores a whole bunch of puzzling evidence radio shows on real audio format.

1008
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:50,120
And he has lots of them with Dr. Philo Drummond, who is his favorite character, I understand.

1009
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,740
And he has collected all of those out there.

1010
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,900
And his website.

1011
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:02,620
Because of his strange affection for Dr. Drummond, for whatever that may be.

1012
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,320
We'll have to send him the video of the desert, in which he can see the overman in various incarnations.

1013
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:16,480
In fact, I need to borrow that mask from you so he can keep showing up, keep showing up, keep showing up everywhere for no reason at all.

1014
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,160
And then a music video would happen.

1015
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:18,720
Yeah.

1016
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,520
There's got to be a music video.

1017
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,160
For each character.

1018
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,640
Leave a trace.

1019
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,080
I like the clocks out, man.

1020
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:33,060
And you can get more information about the Church of the Subgenius.

1021
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,020
Yes, you can.

1022
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:34,860
I appreciate that, man.

1023
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:35,540
Yeah.

1024
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,400
Okay, now we're getting on down.

1025
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,520
That's the Puzzling Evidence Show.

1026
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:52,940
Friday in the wee hours of the morning on KPFA Berkeley.

1027
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:53,880
Uh-huh.

1028
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,820
We'll be right back.

1029
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,020
Make a lot of noise.

1030
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:26,560
Yeah.

1031
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,420
The earth is big.

1032
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,340
Suddenly, there was no more oxygen in the water.

1033
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,760
When you're dead, you shut up like hell.

1034
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,480
When you make a lot of noise.

1035
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,200
You make a hell of a lot of noise.

1036
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,380
Because when you die.

1037
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,740
When you die, my friend, you shut up.

1038
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,760
Like hell.

1039
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,160
In the house of the sick.

1040
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,880
It's because of Dante.

1041
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,140
I want to be saved.

1042
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,060
No, no, no.

1043
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:04,680
No, no, no.

1044
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:05,700
No, no, no.

1045
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,360
I just got back from the writers' meeting.

1046
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,860
Settle down, everybody.

1047
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,000
I just got back from the writers' meeting, okay?

1048
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:12,760
Hey.

1049
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,480
You're the man with the changes?

1050
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,140
We're going to reformat the whole show.

1051
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,760
The bleep all methane all methane show?

1052
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:22,780
I know.

1053
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:23,760
I know.

1054
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,360
Look.

1055
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,400
Uh, here's the story.

1056
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,000
Uh, wait.

1057
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,100
Who's here, first of all?

1058
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:28,700
Oh, everybody.

1059
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,860
Don't worry about that part.

1060
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:30,780
All day in church.

1061
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,020
All day in church.

1062
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,420
It's just like one address.

1063
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:33,660
Nonca Dave.

1064
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,020
Pop Bull Davina.

1065
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,620
Chaz and Chasmina.

1066
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,200
Nikki and Nick.

1067
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,920
Papa Gano and Papa Gano.

1068
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:42,800
Okay.

1069
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,840
We and her consort.

1070
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,920
And the guy who make the sandwich for me.

1071
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,020
Oh, jeez.

1072
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:49,840
And me.

1073
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,940
All of us.

1074
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:51,820
And, and, and.

1075
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,840
Filippo, you have a lovely singing voice.

1076
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,820
I think he's.

1077
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,840
His name is Luigi.

1078
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,040
Legu, thanks for the music.

1079
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,040
And Chaz, thanks for the show.

1080
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:00,700
Ahuga.

1081
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,260
Ahuga.

1082
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:03,220
Ahuga.

1083
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,040
Ahuga.

1084
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,340
Do we have the changes for the bleep all module?

1085
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,480
We'll be back to pick you up later.

1086
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,040
But, uh, I guess, uh, so we're all making what?

1087
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,500
$640,000 an episode now, right?

1088
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:14,940
That's right.

1089
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:15,640
Okay.

1090
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:20,180
The thing is, uh, the commercial people, the people downtown, you know, the people who

1091
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,020
were, uh, talking fast and thinking large.

1092
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:22,820
I am fearless.

1093
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,820
And I think we all want to think that way.

1094
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:27,880
And, uh, you know, go in a progressive fashion, uh, from now on.

1095
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,700
Uh, we're going to get a more traditional format.

1096
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,660
Uh, first of all, I think this whole set has to be replaced by, uh, uh, you know, like

1097
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,500
a neighbor's kitchen set, let's say.

1098
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,200
Okay.

1099
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,040
You're talking about a lot of carpentry there.

1100
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,320
You're talking about union guys.

1101
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,740
This already looks like my neighbor's kitchen.

1102
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,840
Is that a gym neighbor set now?

1103
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:49,760
Is that a gym neighbor set from Andy Griffith or a gym neighbor set from, uh, from Gomer

1104
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,240
Pyle USMC?

1105
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:51,680
Yeah.

1106
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:51,980
Yeah.

1107
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:52,700
What about that?

1108
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,140
I think more of that line, but, but, but, but.

1109
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:55,200
Think of that.

1110
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,660
Like, is it the gas station?

1111
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:57,500
A bus station.

1112
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,320
A gas station or a barracks?

1113
00:55:59,340 --> 00:55:59,800
A bus station.

1114
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,900
Everybody at the table at the same time for the wacky comedy.

1115
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,920
I go for the barracks.

1116
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,940
Bus station, luncheon.

1117
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,380
That's what I think he's thinking.

1118
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,640
A bus station, luncheon, and everybody meet everybody five times.

1119
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,480
Nobody know anybody.

1120
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,600
Oh, and Dave, don't worry.

1121
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:15,040
We will bring in the bear on a regular basis because the demographics reveal that the bear

1122
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,120
has gotten actually, uh, geez, he's gotten 10 times more ratings than even Julia Roberts.

1123
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,940
Wait, I actually like the bear a little more than you, Dave.

1124
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,520
Can Dave play Sergeant Carter?

1125
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,220
Oh, boy.

1126
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:24,680
Yes.

1127
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,220
In fact, uh, we were thinking of that.

1128
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,540
Uh, good thing you brought that up, Chaz.

1129
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,460
I like your thinking.

1130
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,620
You're thinking on your feet.

1131
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,400
I think that caused a lot of damage.

1132
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,000
Even though you're a drummer.

1133
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,340
I'm still taking him.

1134
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,980
Do you use your feet to drum, uh, Chaz?

1135
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:35,420
I don't know.

1136
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,100
No, you're a keyboard guy, I guess, more than that.

1137
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,860
I'm more of a self-flagellator.

1138
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,380
By the way, which one of you guys is pink?

1139
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:42,420
Oh, three of us.

1140
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:43,480
We're all standing here right now.

1141
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,100
We've got the changes, and it looks like the first scene is out.

1142
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:50,200
It looks like part of the second page here on the bottom where you use the word asshole

1143
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,220
is out.

1144
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,600
And I think in the bottom of 92 here, I think the end of the...

1145
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:58,580
Episode where you have the luncheon blow up, I think we need to replace that idea.

1146
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,640
Well, the thing is that that was written, of course, before the big tragic, uh, evidence

1147
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,060
of, uh...

1148
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:06,800
This sounds like they're planning the last episode of Twin Peaks.

1149
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,440
Yeah, yeah.

1150
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,420
They were sure they'd get funding for another season.

1151
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,880
You know, it's a new attitude, of course.

1152
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,800
There's only a course to get that kind of regulation.

1153
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,100
That's showbiz!

1154
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,020
Until next week!

1155
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,880
Keep your head on time!

1156
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,000
Thanks, Nicky, for coming!

1157
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,600
And for two drinks this week!

1158
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,320
Back in the way!

1159
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,120
Commercial show!

1160
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,500
I'm so glad everybody's wetting themselves together.

1161
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:29,700
And you're sacking the saddle!

1162
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,720
Wetting themselves together?

1163
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:31,220
Yes.

1164
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,320
I feel better, don't you?

1165
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,380
You realize that I'm only talking like this, you know, for commercial consideration.

1166
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:42,480
Well, when you consider all the spots for a bit, all the bad news we're gonna have,

1167
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,840
it looks like we're gonna be, like, short 35 seconds.

1168
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,760
How are we gonna clear this?

1169
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,660
What are we gonna do with 35 seconds of dead air?

1170
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:53,900
Insert transition here.

1171
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,520
Well, they had it coming to him. He was crazy.

1172
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:08,200
Never hear surf music again.

1173
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:18,900
tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu

1174
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:19,200
to tu tu tu tu tu tu tu to

1175
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:19,200


1176
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,800
by, by, by, by by my side

1177
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,500
Positively disgusting!
