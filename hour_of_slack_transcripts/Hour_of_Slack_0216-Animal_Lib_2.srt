1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:14,400
Ah, yes. And the opinions expressed on the following program are not necessarily those of the station management, nor even of this show's personnel themselves.

2
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,940
What time is it, Tevis?

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,760
It's fall time. Time for the hour of slack.

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,460
Tevis, you know that you're not supposed to be watching the hour of slack because it's too weird for you.

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,280
Uh-uh.

6
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,760
Oh, yeah, I'll prove it. Right, Daddy.

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,680
Huh? What?

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,780
Right, she's not supposed to see the hour of slack.

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,180
Oh, Tevis is just as weird as the hour of slack, aren't you, Tev?

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:45,920
Yeah.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:46,600
Hey.

12
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,520
Mr. Smith is out.

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,620
Mr. Smith is a good white man.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,560
A good white man.

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,900
Mr. Smith is our friend and father.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,220
Mr. Smith is our friend and father.

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,620
Mr. Smith.

18
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,300
Mr. Smith.

19
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,700
Use.

20
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,700
Use.

21
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,220
Bye.

22
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,580
Bye.

23
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,300
Bye.

24
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,760
Bye.

25
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,880
Bye.

26
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,640
Bye.

27
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,520
Bye.

28
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,380
I'm not an actor.

29
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,360
Just like them actors that you guys see that these movies come in.

30
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,420
They put words in their mouth.

31
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,680
Well, I'm one of you guys.

32
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,380
Oh, that pop is good.

33
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,060
It's impossible to do everything tonight, what I know in my head,

34
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,920
and the way I fool and play with people.

35
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,380
I may sound a little bit mad because I've gotten letters from people.

36
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,740
All I want is the representation of the people

37
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
and the reputation that I've earned.

38
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,420
Don't let nobody take advantage of us guys.

39
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,820
Be one step ahead of these mothers.

40
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,160
The people say, you know, Reverend Stang, you're preaching Bob,

41
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,200
you're going to go to hell.

42
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,220
Friends, hell is life on this planet right now.

43
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:10,840
Amen.

44
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,460
Without Bob.

45
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,420
And that's only the demons.

46
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,640
When the demons try to tell you that, you think they're kidding.

47
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,580
You think it's a satire.

48
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,340
Oh, you'll find out.

49
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,120
And we...

50
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,860
We welcome another caller to the extremely rare privilege of a conversation

51
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,820
here on the air with the one and only Reverend Ivan Stang.

52
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,260
Go.

53
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,080
Hello, my name is Jack Paul.

54
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,100
I'm from Bedford.

55
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,820
Yes, sir.

56
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,380
I'd like to comment about this guy, about the X-Men.

57
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,020
He's really stupid, you know.

58
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,300
Like, we're talking about outer space.

59
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,960
We've sent satellites out there, and there's no life that we know of out there.

60
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,700
And this Big Brother stuff about Bob Dobson, you're way out of line.

61
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,160
I'd just like to tell you that

62
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,140
I wish that you would, uh, kind of know what you're talking about

63
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,880
before you get on the air and make a fool out of yourself.

64
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,560
Oh, my God.

65
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,040
Friends, this person thinks that it's evil to be a fool.

66
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,160
All right, let's go for another.

67
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,880
It's your turn.

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,440
What can I say?

69
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:06,880
Steve.

70
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,840
Folks...

71
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,320
Well, soaks, that's what I said first of all, but...

72
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,020
I always thought that I would be able to make a great...

73
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,660
I can't even talk right.

74
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,880
A great comedy tape.

75
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,520
But JoJo and me and everything...

76
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,660
It's gone wrong and...

77
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,080
It hasn't been a very good comedy tape, I know.

78
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,380
You don't have to tell me.

79
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,240
But...

80
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,960
Well...

81
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,520
Um...

82
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,620
Uh...

83
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,500
Hmm...

84
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:52,700
Gee...

85
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,660
Hmm...

86
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,800
Uh...

87
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,220
Hmm...

88
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,300
Golly gee willikers, how many times did I say,

89
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,220
Um, um, and ee, and ee, and ee, and ee, and ee, and ee, and ee, and ee?

90
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,600
There's planned liberation right around the world,

91
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,320
and we'll die to do it.

92
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,060
We'll die to do it.

93
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,480
We'll die to do it.

94
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,340
We'll die to do it.

95
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,460
We'll die to do it.

96
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:20,820
We'll die to do it.

97
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,120
We'll die to do it.

98
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,780
Oh...

99
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,940
Hurt me.

100
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,420
Use me.

101
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
And use me again.

102
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,240
Ha ha ha.

103
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Yeah, sure.

104
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,200
Get ready, folks.

105
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,500
This is gonna be a bloodthirsty one.

106
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:41,260
Because on this, the 216th hour of condensed slack,

107
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,340
we have some good news and some bad news to open up the year of...

108
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,220
18...

109
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,920
Or 8BX, I'm sorry, 8BX.

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,580
Eight years before X-Day.

111
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,440
Oh, and you can hear it coming right there.

112
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:03,120
The good news to start with is that our mighty station,

113
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,640
K-N-O-N, here in Dallas, Texas,

114
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,280
really is about to go to 55,000 watts.

115
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,220
Yes, it's true.

116
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,740
The lovely Ranger Rita told me yesterday they delivered the blueprints and...

117
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,660
the check to the man.

118
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:26,680
And that means the show will be charged up enough to plow five times as many acres of Dallas,

119
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,300
Arlington, etc. as it does now.

120
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,240
Of course, that means the show burns up more gas and money and DJs,

121
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,820
but it's well worth it, what with it being played at seven college stations around the country.

122
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:44,740
Also, on Thursday, we finished the 128-page...

123
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,520
church journal, The Stark Fist.

124
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,140
Yes, we really did.

125
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:59,340
While in San Francisco, the evil Palmer Vreedes finished the church comic book, Bob's Favorite Comics.

126
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,740
Now, on Friday, both of these went to the printer demons,

127
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,480
and aftershocks were felt up to 300 miles from the epicenter.

128
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,120
So, in two or three weeks, both of these latest testaments of the Bob

129
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,660
will be in the...

130
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,300
zombie volunteer mail-out phase.

131
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,220
And thirdly, on the third of this month, our third book,

132
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,960
Three Fisted Tales of Bob, featuring short stories about Bob from 30 authors and offers,

133
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,460
including my story, the third fist,

134
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,660
was actually printed, and I have...

135
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,300
one copy!

136
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:43,820
But they'll be in bookstores within the month, since they tell me 12,000 copies have already been bought by bookstores.

137
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,960
So now for the bad news.

138
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,520
We have to do...

139
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,740
the next issues.

140
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,320
When Palmer delivered Bob's Favorite Comics to rip-off press,

141
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,620
old Fred Todd said,

142
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,280
Okay, now for the second issue,

143
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,820
Paul dropped over dead.

144
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,320
And when I delivered the Stark Fist, I realized,

145
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,020
now we gotta start on the next one.

146
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,240
And starting Wednesday,

147
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,680
the Subgenius Art Show opens at Psychedelic Solution Gallery in New York City,

148
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,200
and will run for three months,

149
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,160
with all of our holy products,

150
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,600
on sale there the whole time.

151
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,680
Three months, that gives you all plenty of time to buy plane tickets for New York,

152
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,180
and attend this awesome show of the original paintings,

153
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,200
sculptures, and sacred relics of the church,

154
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,560
such as the thigh bone of St. Janer the Baptist,

155
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,080
a fragment of the true pipe of Bob,

156
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,720
the hair shirt of Pope David Meyer,

157
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,600
the used Kleenex of Papa Joe Mama,

158
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,520
and the deep-end bladder control pads of Dobbs himself,

159
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,460
as well as Connie's...

160
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,800
well, some things Connie Dobbs has worn or used.

161
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,700
Artwork to be sold at the show is by such martyrs as

162
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,840
Palmer Vredes, lies to you,

163
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,240
Hel Swamy, Satellite Weavers,

164
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,480
John Hagen Renner to me,

165
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,980
Robert Williams, Gilbert Shelton, Byron Werner,

166
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,920
Mark Mothersbaugh, Carol Lay, Hal Robbins,

167
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,680
Orton Nenslow, Ahmed Fishmonger, David Sugar,

168
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,800
Kenneth Huey, Brother Cleve Duncan, and Puzlin Evidence.

169
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,060
The centerpiece for the whole show is,

170
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,580
of course, the recently unearthed self-portrait

171
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,720
of J.R. Bob Dobbs by him himself, of course,

172
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,660
which I believe has a price tag of $60,000,

173
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,420
and I'm not kidding.

174
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,680
So perhaps there's hope yet for Bob's creaky old church,

175
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,600
hobbling into the 90s with its pants on backwards

176
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,540
and its underwear on its head.

177
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,320
Speaking of underwear on your head,

178
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,600
that's what I was doing last week on New Year's Eve.

179
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,260
We went to the Devo concert with someone else

180
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,240
and made poor Faithful Will babysit the show tape

181
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,620
so that we could hobnob with rich, famous stars.

182
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,340
And the Devos did a real good job

183
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,820
and played some new songs off their new album

184
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,140
that they'll have coming out soon.

185
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,580
Of course, the main reason I go to these things

186
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,640
is so that Dallas media moguls who hate the church

187
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,740
and try to ignore it will be forced to see me,

188
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,260
the treacherous Reverend Ivan Stang,

189
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,140
getting preferential treatment from these musicians

190
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,380
that won't even grant them an interview.

191
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,040
And so, dear friends, in our great smugness

192
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,400
and underground artsy-pantsy status,

193
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,780
we subgeni can take the bloating pride

194
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,140
and run with it, huffing and puffing

195
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,780
in our swollen, egomaniacal glee,

196
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,900
all the way to the bank, dear friends,

197
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,140
and beyond.

198
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,580
And those of you in Dallas

199
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,100
can call the show here at 823-7490.

200
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,640
And some of you will want to,

201
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,400
because we're going to be talking about

202
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,060
something really fun tonight,

203
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,980
animal liberation.

204
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,220
I don't consider myself a terrible man.

205
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,660
No more than others.

206
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,900
You know, what you were saying,

207
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,120
you guys really, you're on the right current, you know?

208
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,000
You're on the same current.

209
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,640
In fact, like I was telling Steve,

210
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,380
I was aboard again, Bob, for quite a while.

211
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,300
Oh, born again, Bob.

212
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:41,820
No, bored.

213
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,840
Oh, bored again.

214
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,940
I was bored again, yes.

215
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,720
In fact, that's what instituted my church,

216
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,700
was that I became so bored with things

217
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,460
that I had to start my own religion.

218
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,000
And that's what I did.

219
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,860
That is it.

220
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,760
You have obviously,

221
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,840
I don't need to tell you anything.

222
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,520
Yes, I've gone beyond subgenius now.

223
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,420
You have intuitive black awareness.

224
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,640
Right.

225
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,320
I've gotten an awareness.

226
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,160
And you know what Einstein said was,

227
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,340
and it clicks right in with what you're saying,

228
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,420
is imagination is more important than intelligence.

229
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,200
And Dobbs said it's more relative

230
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,660
than even Einstein ever dreamed.

231
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,300
Imagination?

232
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,000
All of it.

233
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,560
Yeah.

234
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,560
So, but yeah, I guess so.

235
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,240
Because people were taking,

236
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,060
people have been taking things too serious,

237
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,560
and that's caused so much trouble.

238
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,000
You know, it's even now,

239
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,360
when you do something so absurd,

240
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,140
like, you know, well, Steve knows.

241
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,940
Well, the fact that somebody,

242
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,080
the call we just got a few minutes ago from,

243
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,220
I mean,

244
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,400
every now and then,

245
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,400
they,

246
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,300
it's like,

247
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,440
there's some people out,

248
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,060
most people,

249
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,480
I think,

250
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,820
understand what we're really doing

251
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,320
with the Church of the Subgenius.

252
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,480
But there are some that listen,

253
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,060
and they take everything at face value.

254
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,060
And my, my, friends,

255
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,300
you've got to learn to read between the lines a bit.

256
00:14:59,520 --> 00:14:59,960
I know.

257
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,780
This is modern day entertainment.

258
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,440
This isn't, you know, your,

259
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,620
this is a class talk show.

260
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,660
It is.

261
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,060
I'll tell you,

262
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,800
both of our organizations are involved in this absurdity.

263
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,960
And people are taking even pure absurdity.

264
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,020
We're giving out the pure stuff,

265
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,280
and they're trying,

266
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,660
they're trying to take that serious.

267
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,160
Oh, they try to call it art.

268
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,960
Oh, they'll try anything.

269
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,720
It's, it's an absurdity within an absurdity, actually.

270
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:26,940
They call it,

271
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,620
they think we're demon worshippers.

272
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,360
Hey, I was,

273
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,780
we don't worship demons.

274
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,900
We may have to make deals with them every now and then,

275
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,460
but we certainly don't worship them.

276
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:35,900
Right.

277
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,420
Huh.

278
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:36,840
Huh.

279
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,520
Before making any additional statements about my subject,

280
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:47,760
I'd like to make it clear that in any reference I make to the church on today's broadcast,

281
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,540
I'll be speaking in broad and certainly not specific terms.

282
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:58,460
That is, I will be referring primarily to the institutionalized church.

283
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,580
Everyone use it.

284
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,840
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

285
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,760
Now, to continue with the tape recording.

286
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,740
We're going to see death.

287
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,120
Are you ready?

288
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,000
What I'm talking to you about today is the most up-to-date thing that I could talk to you about.

289
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,900
We're only calling for the religious understanding.

290
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,680
So, housewives, take this tip from the growers of Idaho potatoes,

291
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,500
whose potatoes make delicious French fries.

292
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,840
Who's going to listen to that?

293
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,560
And when they do, how are they going to feel?

294
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,040
All right, caller, it's your turn.

295
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,820
Fire away.

296
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,800
How you doing, Steve?

297
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,940
I'd just like to say, uh,

298
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,780
for the Church of the Subgenius, I think, uh,

299
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,320
they're very smart individuals, very good businessmen,

300
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,100
because I'm sure they're making a good dollar off this, or somebody is.

301
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,040
Well, you would think so.

302
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,220
Oh, I would think so.

303
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,040
I would also think you practice a hell of a lot of rhetoric, pal.

304
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,060
You know, because you talk in circles.

305
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,360
You don't really make any sense.

306
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,180
And we know you got to be making money.

307
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,960
And just unfortunately, there's enough naive people out there to keep you people employed,

308
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,680
which is really sick.

309
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:12,280
I actually know, but I don't, I don't, I think, I think you're, you're giving us credit for too much popularity.

310
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:20,580
Uh, the, the, I actually, the written material of Bob and all of this, the, our, I do a weekly radio show here in Dallas.

311
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,460
And we've, it's really, really dense.

312
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,640
We are not trying to sell this to just anybody and everybody.

313
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,200
It's very definitely a small market.

314
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,740
Oh, that's all you need is a small market.

315
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,540
It's a lot of fun.

316
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:40,680
And, uh, you know, you, you, you, I understand what you're saying.

317
00:17:40,880 --> 00:18:03,800
But if you have a, a gripe about somebody trying to make a buck off of selling baloney as, as truth, that's, I don't think that we've ever, you know, we have to, we deeply, if somebody joins our church and we find out that they believe the wrong lies and the wrong, the wrong, uh, you know,

318
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,040
Oh, God.

319
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,960
the wrong lies and the wrong,

320
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,540
Give me an example.

321
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:06,780
of genius.

322
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,080
We didn't program our own zombies.

323
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,500
Give me an example.

324
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
We don't want those kind of people.

325
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,120
See, you're talking rhetoric again.

326
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:13,400
I mean,

327
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,860
Our caller wants an example of what would be the wrong lie.

328
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,200
You know, you gotta, you gotta get some concrete facts.

329
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:20,480
Okay.

330
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,320
I mean, you know,

331
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,460
You're forcing me to step almost out of character.

332
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,900
Oh, no, I'm not.

333
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,620
Not in the least.

334
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,180
Come on.

335
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,200
But,

336
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,040
You're a good talker.

337
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,100
I mean, I mean, you're very good.

338
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,040
You're very good around, uh, begging questions and that.

339
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,920
I think that, um,

340
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,860
The, uh,

341
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,200
How come you got so much money?

342
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,920
Okay, what's an example of believing the wrong lies?

343
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:51,940
Well, you know, the big conflict, the dramatic interest in the Church of the Subgenius is us versus them.

344
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,600
The abnormals versus the normals.

345
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,220
The abnormals who don't really even get along with each other that much because they're such eccentrics.

346
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:07,580
You know, the only thing they have in common is that they don't have anything in common with the normals.

347
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:16,520
And, I mean, boy, we get hate-filled and, you know, the Bible thumping and hellfire spitting about the normals.

348
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:27,160
But the last thing that Bob Dobbs says in the book of the subgenius is there are no normals, and it's all a question of degree.

349
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And that's where, that's one of those.

350
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:37,260
Places where Bob will go, he will trick you into thinking that he's making a big joke.

351
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:43,280
And then just at the last minute you go, well, I guess that's a sort of a lesson.

352
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,700
Well, you still don't make any sense.

353
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,180
You still practice some more rhetoric, which I congratulate you because you really didn't answer my question.

354
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,940
You know, you got to, I think sometimes you got to understand that there are people there with some intelligence.

355
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,460
And probably more than subgenius people.

356
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,200
And that's why I don't pay to get your message.

357
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:01,620
I don't pay to get your message.

358
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:01,740
I don't pay to get your message.

359
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:01,740


360
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:01,740


361
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:01,740


362
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,220
Because I think it's a bunch of garbage.

363
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,560
Oh, I don't know price but garbage.

364
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,720
Well, you have a hell of an advertising scheme.

365
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,020
I mean, you got these guys who are in college who get these things because it's a novel idea.

366
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,020
They tape them on walls all over the place.

367
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:20,540
And people drive around and think, what the hell is this guy who looks like Ozzie and Harriet on our telephone pole.

368
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,980
And then we start getting spray paint.

369
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,660
And, you know, you got little stencils of Bob Dobbs, which it sounds like a character like Bartles and James.

370
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,500
I really don't think he exists, to tell you the truth.

371
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,580
I think he's a big advertiser.

372
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,860
He's a big advertising ploy.

373
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,460
Well, many, many doubt the existence of Bob.

374
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,600
You've never seen him.

375
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,820
I don't know how the hell you can think that he's around.

376
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:45,240
Oh, if you just, hey, look through any House and Gardens magazine from the 1950s and 60s.

377
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,720
Every third ad has a picture of that guy with the pipe.

378
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,760
But you said you've never seen him.

379
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,900
Hey, Nancy, when you got in radio, you never expected to hear stuff like this, did you?

380
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,840
It's too important to deal with the likes of you or even me.

381
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,600
Then why do you?

382
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:11,200
We want you to get reasonable amount of Israelite al 양on.

383
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,520
Don't you?

384
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,800
I see you have the right kind of aberration and a danger question, but how dare you talk like that?

385
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,320
Even though we've got a great guy standing there with him sitting out.

386
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:15,320


387
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,140
This guy has a military uniform and, Libra.

388
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,120
No, I'm not talking about that.

389
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,560
There's not one, not even two Ethereum.

390
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,660
That's just a

391
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:28,780
picture of craft in front of somebody else's group.

392
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,520
Ah ha.

393
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:38,540
canisters. And those will be an important trading commodity with the Ys as opposed to

394
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:44,120
the Xs. And you call this absurdity. You call this a joke.

395
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,000
No, I think you guys are pretty smart. You're making money. Come on. But I just think it's

396
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,880
awful that there are people out there who are actually going to support you.

397
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,400
To call a subgenius smart is almost an insult coming from...

398
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,540
Well, to close this up, anyway, because I'm sure there's other callers out there dying

399
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,820
for me to get off the line, I think you're also probably mad because our Cleveland Browns

400
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:10,960
are in the playoffs, and Dallas didn't go anywhere this year. And I think Winters Town

401
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,520
Landry is going to trade in the car, you know?

402
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,220
Good night, Steve. Good night, Ivan. It was very nice talking to you. Bye-bye.

403
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:18,980
Good night.

404
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:29,520
I know I'm stupid and just comedy type isn't very good, but I hope you can...

405
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,480
I think you're stupid.

406
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,360
I wish you were a genius that feel like only a subgenius.

407
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,960
And then we'll be back with a few more moments with the Reverend Ivan Stang. He is, I guess

408
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:48,260
I incorrectly said earlier, co-founder. That's not true. Bob is the one and only high E-popped

409
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,540
and founder of the Church of the Subgenius, but the guy, Ivan, is the designated...

410
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,100
I do a lot of the dirty work, and I command the armies of...

411
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,480
Oh.

412
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,340
...zombies, and, uh...

413
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:08,120
Yeah, and I cut the checks, and I endorse the checks.

414
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,340
...too lazy and too warped to do anything meaningful with your life...

415
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah, well...

416
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,920
...and prey upon the sexual fantasies of others.

417
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:19,040
Sorry. Not much we can do but, you know...

418
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:27,640
Well, dear friends, I... Gosh, I can't start into my terrible, evil animal liberation rant until 9.30,

419
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,520
because I don't want to have to...

420
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,840
...flip tapes in the middle of it, see? And neither do you.

421
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:39,900
Uh, so I'm just gonna go to Reverend Gangly's, uh, subgenius mix here from...

422
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,780
Well, actually, it's mostly tapes we cut, but he put neat music with them.

423
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,060
...from Tennessee. This is from some Tennessee station.

424
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,240
What we were just hearing was, uh, from Steve Church's talk show in Cleveland from 1986.

425
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,160
Somebody just finally sent me a copy...

426
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,000
Ouch! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh, quit it! Will!

427
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,780
Darn it!

428
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,300
I have a solution.

429
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,940
Chaz, drink your way to happiness.

430
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,820
The Roy Rogers Museum, where Ed Vaughn will prove the trigger has moved again.

431
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,200
Ahhh!

432
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,200


433
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,620
Listen to the music and all that stuff grown from childhood causes.

434
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,780
Enjoy

435
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,460
Dear friends, I'm Oh, no.

436
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:56,300
I'm a man, you can talk aloug' around all you want, and I think that's right about that,

437
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,100
on the low minimum.

438
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,560
Hey, can you hang around on a hill?

439
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:08,140
We're going to take you into that service right now.

440
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,060
We're going to take you out into that service right now.

441
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,940
We are here in our own discussion.

442
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,260
A Christian, we bring the message to us.

443
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:28,100
Hundreds of New Yorkers at a religious revival chanting the name of a modern-day prophet.

444
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,120
Bob.

445
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:36,520
Bob's teachings are the foundation of a church that does little more than parody cults and American consumerism.

446
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,240
It's called the Church of the Subgenius.

447
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,380
Tom Vitale has this report.

448
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,960
You will pay to know what you really think.

449
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,140
But if you give us money, we will tell you what to think.

450
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:58,160
Not only have you paid to know what you really think, but you will get value for your time.

451
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,340
You will get value for your time.

452
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,500
Americans will buy anything, and they're getting sold short.

453
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:12,120
That's the message of the Church of the Subgenius, delivered by the Pope of all New York, David Meyer, at a recent revival.

454
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:22,320
Meyer also instructed the enthusiastic crowd in how to get slack, how to get right with Bob, and how to pull the wool over your own eyes.

455
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,120
For they shall see God.

456
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,840
It's still true.

457
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,940
God still speaks.

458
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,240
God speaks in special ways to each of us today.

459
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,820
M values toward you-

460
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,500
Good.

461
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:53,400
So, a subgenius...

462
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,160
Oh!

463
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,000
The Great Port viens to save you.

464
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,600
side of crippled you and a rich

465
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,960
and prolific. Here in the church

466
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,360
of the sub-Jesus we say

467
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,680
pass on those crutches

468
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,040
and crawl

469
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,540
and cry. You can

470
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,600
crawl again. You can crawl again

471
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,000
children.

472
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,820
I'm a Bible

473
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,940
reader yelling at the

474
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,320
Bible.

475
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,180
I'm a Bible reader.

476
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:18,660
I'm a Bible reader.

477
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,880
I'm a Bible reader.

478
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,900
I'm a Bible reader.

479
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,620
I'm a Bible reader.

480
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,800
I'm a Bible reader.

481
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,440
I'm a Bible reader.

482
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,220
I'm a Bible reader.

483
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,160
I'm a Bible reader.

484
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:18,920
I'm a Bible reader.

485
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,540
Well,

486
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,500
now for the rant

487
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,740
part of the show.

488
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,540
Now friends, something

489
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,920
that's suddenly begun

490
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:35,940
getting a lot of attention in the news is the animal rights movement. The last time we

491
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:45,400
broached this subject, the phone lines lit up because, well, real serious animal rights nuts

492
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:55,780
get very touchy if you don't grant proper respect to our four-footed brothers. And even our six and

493
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:03,940
eight and pseudo-footed brothers. Me, well, I eat them. I even eat the pseudopods. Well,

494
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:11,420
except for prairie squids. I have many, many cans of oysters, snails, octopus, cuttlefish,

495
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:18,320
and eels in my pantry that my dear ma gave me for ex-sistmas. Thanks, ma. Mammy. But really,

496
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:24,460
if I'm going to have a fellow animal killed and burned and then eat it, well, I kind of feel like,

497
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,660
you know, the, the,

498
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,860
the consciousness, the better. Now, I've even tried dog once up in South Dakota,

499
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:38,460
um, at an actual Indian sacred Uweepi ceremony. But, uh, but I draw the line at primates. I

500
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:44,120
wouldn't eat a primate. Except maybe vegetarian humans. I'd probably eat them. Now, they're

501
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:50,660
certainly more organically grown than, say, I am. And a plain subgenius, I mean, just any old

502
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:55,100
subgenius, like Will here, geez, he'd be poisoned by the chemical leftovers in

503
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,760
his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his,

504
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,280
his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his fundamentalі

505
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,480
cuestions to this一下 industrial diet? And the sort of like revenge of the cannibal victim.

506
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:09,160
But, uh, seriously, friends, I cbox, think that conspiracy glorp humans that deliberately

507
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:16,780
inflict unnecessary torture on, say, lab animals should have done unto themassembly

508
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:24,280
what they've been doing unto others. Hunting, just for sheer sport or trophies, is sickening,

509
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,800
sickening to me. I mean, taking good pictures of animals takes more skill than killing them,

510
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,580
but there's nothing wrong with hunting if you eat the game. Now, I think that people who buy

511
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:43,160
ivory or whale blubber or whooping crane coughs or in any way contribute directly to the extinction

512
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:54,260
of any species, even the snail darter and especially the lonely prairie squid. Well,

513
00:30:54,260 --> 00:31:01,880
and Bob Dobbs will take care of that, don't you fear, on that X day eight years away.

514
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:09,400
Are you ready, friend? Anyway, well, I think that's sort of the moderate position on

515
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:15,780
animal rights. Now, unfortunately, the moderate side of the question is sort of all but drowned

516
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:23,560
out by the shrill bleatings and oinkings and mooings of the animal rights

517
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,240
extinction.

518
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:31,280
The extremists, the people who say we should stop killing cows and chickens. I've even heard

519
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:37,300
them really go so far as to say, some go so far as to say that we shouldn't use vaccines because

520
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:46,280
they kill poor little smallpox viruses and that we should let smallpox and bubonic plague and so on

521
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:54,140
run free. And people who bomb laboratories and say there should be no experimentation on animal

522
00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:02,440
rights at all and no leather shoes, no nothing. People who protest are President George Bush

523
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,540
when he goes quail hunting. I mean, that one really gets me. Who among you wouldn't rather

524
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:12,880
see quail killed than Bush? Now, admittedly, these are the extremists that we're talking

525
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,720
about, but frankly, I think that deep down those people don't really care one whit for

526
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:23,200
animals. They certainly don't understand nature. They're actually being pretty selfish because

527
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:30,120
what they're getting off on really is the happy feeling they get from crusading, the gloating pride

528
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:37,160
they get from feeling grossly superior to the rest of us barbarians. Just like fundamentalist

529
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:43,300
religious nuts, same symptoms. Can't see the forest for the trees. Don't realize that the forest is

530
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:51,000
chock full of carnivorous wild animals just waiting to bite their fool heads off. And animal

531
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,180
rights fanaticism is really a problem.

532
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,400
And a real appealing cause for people to pat themselves on the back for because it's so

533
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:07,720
simple. Don't be mean to the poor wittle animals. Now, I can understand being a vegetarian for

534
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:16,600
health reasons. Fine. Would somebody clean up after that taper? I've bordered on vegetarianism

535
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,920
myself at times, but to tell other people they shouldn't eat cows because of the cow's

536
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,060
feelings? Get real!

537
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,920
Sure, the cow gets scared just before he gets his head knocked in. Too bad! If that

538
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,780
cow had grown up in nature, even if he was the mighty auroch of the past and not the

539
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:41,640
little nearly brainless slugs that we raise today on farms, if he was even lucky enough

540
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:48,320
to live to adulthood, it'd be a life of struggle, disease, freezing, starvation sometimes as

541
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,180
compared to the sweet, sweet life of the cattle raised by, say, my wife and I.

542
00:33:53,800 --> 00:34:00,440
And the cows have the life of Riley. They have slack up until they get sold to market.

543
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:07,100
And really, in that respect, they're exactly like normals and pink boys, dupes of the conspiracy.

544
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:12,880
They get pampered and fattened up just like a junior ad executive. And when the big day

545
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:18,900
comes, they go willingly just like all those pinks will come X day when the men from Planet

546
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,420
X escort them to the slaughterhouse of false slack.

547
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:30,400
But the point is, death is a part of nature. Kill or be killed is the rule, and only we

548
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:36,000
humans enjoy the luxury of even considering alternatives. Did you know, and this is a

549
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,640
fact, that most of the time, by far the average mammal in the wild is killed by another animal,

550
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:47,540
not a human, instead of dying of disease or old age? The only ones that don't as commonly

551
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:52,400
get killed are the carnivores, like wolves and lions and weasels and people.

552
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,960
And don't you think for a minute that if a dumb beef cow happened to get angry at you

553
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:04,500
that it would hesitate to trample you to death? It'd be happy to turn you into a human burger

554
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:11,280
with its deadly cloven hooves. So the animal liberationists need to get all their eggs

555
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,980
in one basket if you ask me, and then fry them, and I'll eat them. If they're going

556
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:22,160
to sabotage slaughterhouses and spit on unsuspecting little old rich ladies that wear fur, then

557
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,380
what are they going to do? They'll kill them. They'll kill them. And then they'll kill them.

558
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,700
Why don't they show some real gumption and picket Tom Thumb, Piggly Wiggly, Safeway Gayfway,

559
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,160
Joe's Diner, Fred's Cafe, every McDonald's in the country?

560
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,360
Why don't they beat up the old guys that fish down at the river?

561
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,920
Why don't they burn down family farms?

562
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:46,240
And for that matter, and this is really where their logic takes them, if killing animals

563
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,420
is wrong, then why are they letting lions and tigers and bears get away with it?

564
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,040
Why aren't they standing guard over every weasel to keep them from eating mice?

565
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,640
And how are they going to keep the mice from eating bugs?

566
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,000
And wouldn't that be infringing on the rights of mice and weasels?

567
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,600
And even the bugs' right to die?

568
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,800
And they think keeping pets is slavery.

569
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:17,160
I don't know, but the only work my dog has to do is bark at and attack strangers.

570
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,400
And being a dog, why there's nothing in the world he'd rather do.

571
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:28,680
Would he be happier running loose in the wild, covered with ticks, eaten up with heartworm,

572
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,680
dying from festering wounds received in a dog fight over a female?

573
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,720
Would he feel more free in his soul if he wasn't a lowly house dog?

574
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,220
Well maybe he would.

575
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:46,320
It's certainly true that he's been brainwashed into loving me with all his heart and using

576
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,880
the backyard for a bathroom instead of the rug.

577
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:49,980
Poor guy.

578
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,640
Look.

579
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,380
Animals are resources.

580
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,420
And don't kid yourself, so are you.

581
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:02,840
In fact, I like to think that Jehovah One seeded the planet with both humans and animals

582
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,300
strictly for the benefit of subgeniuses.

583
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,700
Certainly we have the responsibility of keeping the ecosystem intact and keeping all the species

584
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:13,380
healthy.

585
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,040
No doubt about that.

586
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,860
And there are a million disgusting abuses of animals.

587
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,400
That need to be removed.

588
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:21,600
That's right.

589
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:21,880
And that's why we're all so frustrated.

590
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:29,220
But when people make the whole concept of animal rights look like silly blathering by

591
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:38,660
pimpered, pampered, pinko, urban intellectuals and teary-eyed, bleeding-hearted, shrill, hippie

592
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,760
grannies, they set the whole movement back because they create a quite understandable

593
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,960
backlash among the real dopes out there.

594
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,960
The majority.

595
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:48,900
Cough.

596
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:55,360
Of pinks and po-buckers who likewise see every issue in black and white and are also unable

597
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,440
to carry out more complex thought processes.

598
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,620
Now there was a real good ar- what?

599
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,080
Is that a prairie squid crawling out from under the control panel?

600
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,180
Oh man.

601
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,020
I don't know what I'm going to be doing for the rest of the night.

602
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,880
I've got to get through this quick.

603
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:16,100
There was a really good article in the paper this morning that pointed out that far more

604
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,880
animals are killed by poachers than by animals.

605
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:18,880


606
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:24,300
In fact, it's the sport hunters, the guys who go out and shoot a deer and then take

607
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,980
him home and put him in the freezer.

608
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,240
Or shoot quail and eat him.

609
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:34,040
It's those kind of hunters who really foot the bill for a lot of the conservation in

610
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,600
this country.

611
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,620
From all the licenses and taxes they have to pay and so forth.

612
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,880
If animal lovers really wanted to be constructive, they'd put their efforts into raising more

613
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,180
money for conserving wild habitats.

614
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,880
They ought to be targeting not the meat industry.

615
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:48,880


616
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:48,880


617
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:48,880


618
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,060
But the embassies of countries that don't clamp down on poaching.

619
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,180
Because there's a lot of them that really that's where their bread and butter comes

620
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,440
from.

621
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:04,020
But above all, they should stop making everybody else who cares about wildlife look like fools.

622
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,980
I don't know friends.

623
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:15,900
But just to rub it in, here's a tape of the first animal rights rant we played on Hour

624
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,340
of Slack some years ago.

625
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,860
It got everybody so mad.

626
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,540
It got everybody so riled up.

627
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:31,300
And oh yes, as Bob said in 1953, I'll have my monkey brains well done.

628
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:40,700
Oh, listen to those once again, the swinging love corpses, dear friend.

629
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,700
You know, all last week I was hearing ads on the radio for this Lena Lovitch concert.

630
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,840
She was a great singer.

631
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:48,840


632
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:48,840


633
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:48,940
She was a great singer.

634
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:53,640
So, I'm just gonna do a benefit for the animal liberation movement.

635
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,060
The people for the ethical treatment of animals.

636
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,080
Well, that's just great.

637
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,500
She and Nina Hagen, praise Nina, damn Nina, got together and they're, they're, I don't

638
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,920
know if you've ever seen any of the literature that comes from the animal liberation groups.

639
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,740
But, it's, it's hate literature.

640
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,960
They hate people, basically.

641
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,700
And now I'm just speaking for myself.

642
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,820
Not for the rest of the people.

643
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:18,820


644
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:18,820


645
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:18,820


646
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:25,580
radio station. Not necessarily for other subgeni. I can't pretend to speak for them, but for

647
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:38,560
myself I say, death to the animals. Death! Death to them! Because I eat them. And I will

648
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:46,680
always eat them. And millions of us will eat them, the little animals. Because they're

649
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:53,620
replaceable. Easily replaceable. Because they fornicate and make more little animals. And

650
00:40:53,620 --> 00:41:03,900
they are filled with blood. Rich red blood. Blood which gives us the strength and the

651
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:09,980
power. Which the vegetarians have not. And not only the strength and the power, for even

652
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:15,640
they can gain strength and power from eating their little plants. Their helpless vegetables.

653
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,660
I mean, at least they can eat them.

654
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:23,320
At least the animals can fight back, dear friends. At least the animals can scream in pain and agony

655
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:31,060
as we track them down and kill them. Or else as we throw them in cages and kill them. Either one,

656
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:39,660
doesn't matter. Because they're just animals. Souls? Oh, of course they have souls. And all

657
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:46,480
the better to make them feel pain with. We free those souls, dear friends, from their mortal coils.

658
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:53,160
That they may go up to their cow heaven or their pig heaven or whatever. Where there

659
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,560
are no humans to destroy them and eat them...

660
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:05,260
Friends, one thing which the vegetarians can never glean from their sad, limited diet is

661
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:12,800
the aggression. The hormonal hate power. Which is why the carnivores will always exist and

662
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,640
always win any battles with the vegetarians. Just... Just as if they were my friends. Talen's

663
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:16,640


664
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:22,200
the alcoholics have historically always won against the froth heads and for the same reasons

665
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:28,360
and it's a damn good thing that I eat a hamburger a minute because I'm not an alcoholic and

666
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:34,700
that's not as feisty as they are so I need the meat and the death of the animals and

667
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:42,160
death death by torture to those who are supporters of animal liberation groups did you know friends

668
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:49,640
that there have been people killed in laboratories sabotage by these fanatical anti-vivisectionist

669
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:56,300
of course these beasts must be vivisected dissected alive how else can we know what

670
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:02,940
exact level of pain on the painometer must be reached before they die of fright this

671
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:09,560
is an important consideration in modern science so dear friends

672
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:11,800
don't just

673
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:18,500
eat that animal eat the hell out of it with hot sauce you'll need to because the ones

674
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:25,660
that are vegetarians now will be the first to turn to cannibalism once the econo cataclysm

675
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:32,320
really sinks in the environment's destroyed and then where will their ideals be they'll

676
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:38,620
feel like we deserve to be eaten though they sacrificed all those years not eating animals

677
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,700
the world's been destroyed there's no vegetables

678
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:47,720
left nothing will grow for 500 years and they'll feel that it's our turn oh they'll

679
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:56,680
quickly turn to dining upon some succulent long pig faster than anybody mark my words

680
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,980
dear friends mark them and heed

681
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,680
everybody welcome yes yes B específico

682
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:11,680


683
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:11,680


684
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:11,680


685
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:11,680


686
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:11,680


687
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:11,680


688
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:11,680


689
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:11,680


690
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:11,680


691
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,180
Lovely, lovely Swinging Love Corpses there in the background.

692
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:23,280
And in fact, this is just the time to play the Swinging Love Corpses jazz talking tune,

693
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,260
Our Four-Footed Brothers.

694
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:32,540
There's Dr. Philo Drummond as lead singer here.

695
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:38,960
And you can call to hate us at 823-7490 in Dallas, Texas,

696
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,060
but only from 9 to 10 on Sunday nights.

697
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:42,640
Thank you.

698
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,880
And the baby's here.

699
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,800
And all the animals.

700
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,480
Oh, can you feel the section?

701
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,880
All our animal brothers.

702
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,040
That sacrifices lives every day.

703
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,320
In the name of.

704
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:41,820
Manic of.

705
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,860
I'm Falling For The Brothers.

706
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,000
They're giving their lives.

707
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,580
Every day.

708
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,100
Every day.

709
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,880
Every day.

710
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,440
Every day.

711
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:08,780
Every day.

712
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:08,940


713
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:08,940


714
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:08,940


715
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:08,940


716
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,220
Every time I'm open.

717
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,040
Rubbing in tubes.

718
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,860
Putting those doors on their sides.

719
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,100
All kind of experiments.

720
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:34,580
And they do it in the name of medical science.

721
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,460
You're more for the trouble

722
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,120
I'm giving it live

723
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,440
I'm gonna go back

724
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,060
My body

725
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,000
And I'm gonna die

726
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,720
We could have

727
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,260
a quick

728
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,920
And I'd never

729
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,500
do

730
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,440
My eyes

731
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,320
and kidneys

732
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,380
So remember

733
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,580
The very next time

734
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,600
You eat some turkey

735
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,440
You drink some wine

736
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,460
There's some friendly

737
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,140
four-footed furry animal

738
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,400
that gave his life

739
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,900
To find out whether or not

740
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,380
you die

741
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,260
when you

742
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:36,480
eat some turkey

743
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,180
Or drink that stuff

744
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,000
Or drink that stuff

745
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,780
Or smoke that stuff

746
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,600
Or whatever else

747
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,520
you had to do

748
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,020
Your four-footed brothers

749
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,700
Are laying down their lives

750
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,860
For you every day

751
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,540
For you every day

752
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,200
For you every day

753
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,580
Subject to vivisection

754
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,540
Subject to vivisection

755
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,460
Subject to vivisection

756
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,300
Subject to vivisection

757
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,080
Subject to vivisection

758
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,580
Our four-footed brothers

759
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,280
Are subject to vivisection

760
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,920
In the name of medical science

761
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,440
For you, my friend

762
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,460
For you, my friend

763
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,280
For your life

764
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,120
For the lives of your

765
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,500
fellow man

766
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,000
Your four-footed brothers

767
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,840
Are laying down their lives

768
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,740
In the name of medical science

769
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,140
For you, my friend

770
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:14,160
For you, my friend

771
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,780
For your own lives

772
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:16,780


773
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:17,740
Standing right here

774
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:22,660
In the name of the Most Gracious

775
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:22,660


776
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:22,880
And I do appreciate

777
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:22,880


778
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,380
The verb

779
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:23,540
The verb is subject

780
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,560
Subject to vivisection

781
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:42,780
Oh, a lovely, lovely swinging love corpses tune.

782
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,800
Oh, they're sweeping the nation.

783
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,120
And friends, you can too.

784
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,900
Oh, that was a close one.

785
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,580
A real close one.

786
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:59,880
And I just got my wrist slapped for doing those bad, bad things.

787
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,540
Of course, he was talking about a dog.

788
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,040
And so it doesn't matter.

789
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,520
And it didn't get out.

790
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,020
Well, so we're okay.

791
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:13,500
Friends, you can sweep the universe with Bob's hairdo.

792
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,300
If you would like to write for free information,

793
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,540
those of you who've been going,

794
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,300
who are these people?

795
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,860
How do I kill them?

796
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,640
Well, you can.

797
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,740
By writing for free information from,

798
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,920
got that pencil ready?

799
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:29,940
Bob.

800
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,160
I'm not Bob.

801
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,060
I'm Reverend Stank.

802
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,100
Bob is only,

803
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,160
he is he who we serve.

804
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,500
He who needs no name but has one anyway.

805
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:45,260
Write to Bob at P.O. Box 140306

806
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:50,140
in Dallas, Texas 75214.

807
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,220
Once again, Box 140306.

808
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,380
In Dallas, Texas 75214.

809
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,500
There's a lot more than this radio show out there for you,

810
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,240
but we can't get too specific.

811
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:06,940
So I'm going to,

812
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,840
we got new show following Hour of Slack now.

813
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,320
In Dallas, Kathy's Potluck.

814
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,260
So stay tuned.

815
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,300
It'll be nice.

816
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,720
But for now, we're going to go back to whatever,

817
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,820
as much as I can fit into the last five minutes

818
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:24,500
from Evil Hour of Slack number 80.

819
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,280
Many years ago,

820
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,980
when we first broached the subject

821
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:27,980
and got in so much trouble.

822
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:28,360
Thank you.

823
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,660
How do they know we're here?

824
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,640
Oh, so, uh, you know.

825
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,460
You just think.

826
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,620
I think we're just going to have to do the same thing over and over again.

827
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:01,620


828
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:01,620


829
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:01,620


830
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:01,620


831
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:01,620


832
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:01,620


833
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,380
That was no sleep.

834
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,040
I met the junk man in his scattered yard.

835
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,960
There in a twilight of talk,

836
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:15,520
my ears stared at the wag of his broken jaw

837
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,020
as he ranted over the rule of ruin.

838
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,780
And within my rusting headpiece here.

839
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,780
Oh, let's not.

840
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,400
I don't want to hear it.

841
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,580
I don't want to hear this.

842
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,100
I want to get down to the gross stuff.

843
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,780
That was too poetic.

844
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:28,680
That was Ken Nordean.

845
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,260
It's probably wonderful, but no, he's still on there.

846
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,620
We've got to get to just a, this is a tricky one.

847
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:33,960
So I have to.

848
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,880
Oh, shut up.

849
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

850
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,760
We just are so unprofessional around here.

851
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,100
There we go.

852
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,720
Good old, old, good old Ken Nordean.

853
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,300
In the mammal world, dear friends,

854
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,160
in the mammal world, the predators were traditionally carnivores.

855
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:12,380
Specialized meat-eating animals with teeth modified for stabbing,

856
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,340
killing, and tearing flesh.

857
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,100
Their legs were designed for leaping and producing a turn of speed

858
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,140
that could quickly bring their chosen prey within.

859
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,160
Killing.

860
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:24,480
Killing.

861
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:25,700
Distance.

862
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,740
They reached their acme just before the age of man,

863
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,720
but have since decreased in importance and are now almost extinct

864
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,940
except for a number of aberrant forms found in the coniferous forests

865
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:46,060
of the far north and in the South American island continent.

866
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,680
Which we'll tell you about as soon as I can.

867
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:49,900
See, I told you this was tricky.

868
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,880
I've got to flip this one around.

869
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,000
See, otherwise it'll duplicate everything.

870
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,280
Okay, now, come on, get the leader down.

871
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:56,880
Kill the leader.

872
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,400
Kill the leader.

873
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,840
We've only got two minutes left in show.

874
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,380
When the carnivores were at their peak,

875
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:04,600
the rodents, particularly the rats,

876
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,460
began to acquire a taste for meat and animal waste.

877
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:15,120
The spread of man to all parts of the world encouraged their proliferation,

878
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,880
and after man's demise,

879
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:21,620
they continued to flourish in the refuse created by the disruption

880
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,380
and decay of human species.

881
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,000
The carnivores were the first to be born in the world of civilization.

882
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,220
It is this adaptability that has ensured their survival.

883
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:37,940
The gnawing incisors developed long stabbing points

884
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:44,060
and were equipped with blades that could cut and grip into their prey.

885
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:50,700
The other main predator is the raboon.

886
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,800
A descendant from the baboons that flourished on the grasslands

887
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,100
during the age of man,

888
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,420
their diet changed from omnivorous to carnivorous

889
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:03,100
during the period that the big cats of the grasslands died out.

890
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,820
At the same time, they increased their speed

891
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,440
by taking to their hind limbs

892
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,840
and adopting a totally bipedal locomotion.

893
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,920
The forelimbs became reduced

894
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,160
and the head was carried further forward,

895
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,700
balanced by a thick, heavy tail.

896
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:20,460
In physical form, the raboon bears a distinct,

897
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:20,680
long-tailed, and a very large,

898
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:20,880
long-tailed, and a very large,

899
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,820
resemblance to the carnivorous dinosaurs

900
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,300
that died out over a hundred million years ago.

901
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:32,820
The raboon stands about 2.3 meters high at the tip,

902
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,160
at the hip, pardon me,

903
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,000
and lives purely as a scavenger.

904
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:40,860
As predators, they eat only the softer tissues

905
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,740
and the muscles of, for instance,

906
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,540
the gigantilope's belly,

907
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,180
or the anal regions,

908
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,360
where there is always plenty of meat left for the scavengers.

909
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,680
The giant raboon,

910
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,740
concentrates on the meat of the limbs and neck,

911
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,900
leaving the rest to smaller,

912
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,520
less powerful carrion feeders,

913
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,520
such as the primitive pink boys.

914
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:06,540
A less energetic tree dweller,

915
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,360
the slobber,

916
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,920
or rheostostium corpitellium,

917
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,820
can be thought of as a kind of marsupial sloth

918
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,260
that spends nearly all its life

919
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:19,600
hanging upside down from trees and creepers.

920
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,660
It's totally different from the rest of the tree dweller,

921
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,280
and subsists entirely on insects

922
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,100
that it catches in the flowers of its home creeper

923
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,660
by entangling them in long strands of mucus

924
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,300
dangled from its mouth.

925
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,180
Its large, downturned ears and sensory whiskers

926
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,320
alert it to the insect's arrival

927
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,500
and tell it when to drop the mucus,

928
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,480
which it aims at the flower's scent.

929
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,620
As the slobber's hair grows and spiral tufts

930
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:49,260
and is pervaded by a parasitic algae,

931
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,640
it is completely unnoticed,

932
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:50,640


933
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,440
completely camouflaged against the background of creepers,

934
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,140
and when totally motionless,

935
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:58,140
can escape the attention of predators.

936
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,960
These readings, dear friends, are from

937
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,380
Life After Man,

938
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,720
a Zoology of the Future,

939
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,600
a true document.

940
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,300
And now it's time for Kathy's Potluck

941
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,600
here at KNON,

942
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,720
the mighty non for the 90s,

943
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,960
KNON 89.3 FM,

944
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,040
Dallas, Fort Worth,

945
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,020
and someday soon,

946
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:20,560
walks ahead.

947
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,180
Kathy, the voice of the folks.

948
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,120
He's coming around, folks.

949
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,320
He's gonna be okay and ready to play

950
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,360
Symptom 6 of Beat the Reaper!
