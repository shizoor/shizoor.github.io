1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,260
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:12,420
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,780
The Soap Genius Hour of Swag!

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,300
Oh yes friends and we are going to get right into it.

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,160
I don't want to wait. I don't want to wait around.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,540
I'm not going to do the usual 10 minute long intro to the show.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:40,960
Because friends, as Henny Youngman once said, I wanted to become an atheist but I gave up for they have no holidays.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,940
Well friends, when you're a subgenius you don't have to worry about that because our biggest holiday is coming right up.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,980
In fact, by the time you hear this show it probably will have already happened and you won't be able to hear this show.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,440
Unless you have been a minister with Bob.

11
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,140
An ordinarian.

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:07,300
A day minister and thus, like I have been by the time you hear this show, lifted up in power and glory onto the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:16,480
Friends, because five days from the time that I'm making this tape is July 5th, well 1999.

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,880
And in...

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:27,140
The end is nigh and the time is nigh for their...

16
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,760
...arizal.

17
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,580
The ariizal...

18
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,100
...is a-coming.

19
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,460
Bob...

20
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,860
...is a-coming.

21
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,880
And if I keep up like this much longer, I will too.

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,860
Friends, because this is...

23
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:48,800
It is that which we have spent our precious thirty dollars for.

24
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,360
It is that which is why we became ordained ministers in this church of Bob.

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,700
This church of slack.

26
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,020
This church of...

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,880
The subgenius.

28
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,060
And it is because of this that we...

29
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,720
That we do these things.

30
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,840
That we play these tapes that I've got coming up.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,500
Friends, because even though I'm off planet by the time you hear this, I want to rub it in.

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,880
I want to make you sick if you're sitting behind listening to this.

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,760
I want to make you sick by the fact that you didn't spend your thirty dollars to get on Bob's rocket.

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,100
Or to make you sick that you...

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,540
In case X-Day doesn't happen this time.

36
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,280
That you did spend that money.

37
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,360
And didn't get on Bob's rocket.

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,660
And Bob screwed up again.

39
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,940
But friends, that only means we weren't ready.

40
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,560
And he's just been testing us.

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,760
Oh, yes.

42
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,320
This music in the background is Thelrion.

43
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,860
And, uh...

44
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,280
And, friends, the things that we have coming up besides the escape vessels and the X-Saucers.

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,220
And the destruction of the conspiracy.

46
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,940
And the peaks and the normals.

47
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,140
And the conspiracy of the dunces that has held us down, friends.

48
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,040
That has robbed away the slack of the abnormal.

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,720
And has made us think that it is perfectly natural to go to, for instance, work for a living.

50
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:09,760
Or to, for instance, get married in order that God and the law will think everything's cool.

51
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,200
Well, anyway, friends, I don't want to get into that.

52
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:19,120
What I want to get into, though, are these incredible CDs we've gotten from so many of our friends.

53
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,960
And famous amateurs.

54
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,080
And, um, Negative Land and Chumbawamba have...

55
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,420
This CD out, which we will be playing.

56
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,440
I have this amazing Bran Flakes sound collage material that is cool as hell.

57
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,280
We've got Eddie the Rat.

58
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,220
Similar strange sound collages.

59
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,480
And yet another one like that.

60
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,580
We've also got media barrages from, of course, Steinstein's Secret Orchestra.

61
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,160
We have recordings from the DeVivals.

62
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,620
My God, there's been spirit-filled, fire-flame-filled DeVivals all over this great...

63
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,620
But tainted land.

64
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,340
In Portland, Seattle, we'll have...

65
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,220
You'll be hearing the preaching of the great preachers in those places.

66
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,920
And you'll be hearing Susie the Floozy's final apocalyptic radio show.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,800
The beautiful, luscious Susie the Floozy.

68
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:17,500
You'll be hearing Friday Jones' smoky, breathy voice promising torture and damnation for you and your friends.

69
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,000
You'll hear the new media barrage from the Ministry of Found Objects.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,920
And the new music that was given to me last next day by Heather Hillman.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,500
And what, like I said, in the background, what you've just been hearing is...

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,900
was Therion.

73
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,060
I guess that was the end of their grand finale.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,980
What a shame.

75
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:48,160
I had a little rant here I wanted to go ahead and read and get it over with right at the beginning of the show.

76
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,500
And that music probably would have been just right.

77
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,300
But instead we'll just go with this sort of a...

78
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,800
This is Ron Slabe's electronic music.

79
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,920
Just to give us sort of a rug.

80
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,780
And this was a...

81
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,220
Friends, this is a rant that doesn't have a damn thing to do with X Day.

82
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,180
And it's fairly short.

83
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,680
But I wanted to read it because I never got around to it.

84
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,580
I don't think.

85
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,140
I don't think I ever did read this one to y'all.

86
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,420
It was a rant that came along after the Monica Gate problems.

87
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,020
Um...

88
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:31,340
Oddly enough, some conservatives think that if you criticize conservatives that means you love President Clinton.

89
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,740
They...

90
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,240
Still don't get it.

91
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,000
I could care less about which dummy...

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
Well, that's the point of this rant, friends.

93
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,540
I have learned an important lesson.

94
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,680
Wait a minute.

95
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,080
That ain't gonna cut it.

96
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,080
That ain't gonna cut it.

97
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,160
I gotta put on something that'll cut it.

98
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,720
That ain't gonna cut no ice.

99
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,660
Where is my damn...

100
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:08,820
Now I know that if I stick just anything by E-S-O in, it'll almost certainly be perfect.

101
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,720
If I flip this over and go like this.

102
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,620
What'd I tell you?

103
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:13,860
Okay.

104
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,300
Friends, because I have learned an important lesson from that tiny civil war that flared up briefly.

105
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,540
There on alt-binary slack.

106
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,860
Because my job is to bash rival religious nuts, false prophets, and all-pinks, right?

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,580
Well, I gotta admit, in studying all the evil crimes of my enemies, the religious nuts,

108
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:43,380
a certain local kind of which are more numerous and vocal over on what's called the conservative side,

109
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:50,280
I got so into that hate that I started to forget the crimes of the other religious nuts.

110
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:57,220
The one referred to, if rarely by itself, as liberal.

111
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:08,240
And this is a good example of why the conspiracy set it up so that we would appear to have only two basic options.

112
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,960
Both of them totally screwed up, actually.

113
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,540
Both of them there for nothing more than to control us.

114
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,200
The United States alone, potentially, friends, if you think about it, often,

115
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,300
offers over 275 million options for who could control us.

116
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,080
And needless to say, they leave out the only possible correct option,

117
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,620
which is the word of Bob!

118
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,320
The terms liberal and conservative have become practically meaningless nowadays, friends.

119
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,480
Because like the Bible, they can mean so many things to so many different people

120
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,220
that they kind of cancel themselves out in internal contradictions.

121
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,180
But each side uses the other side.

122
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,540
The other as an excuse to remove different kinds of slack.

123
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,000
One robs this kind of slack.

124
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,980
The other robs that kind of slack.

125
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,120
Whichever one steals the most diverts your divine hate towards itself and away from the other.

126
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,400
And then they have you exactly where they wanted you.

127
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,700
On one of their sides, friends.

128
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,760
Stuck to the tar baby of the conspiracy.

129
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,600
And so...

130
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:25,420
I have resolved to prime my hate dynamo by broadening my education

131
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:32,100
so as to cover the crimes of all false prophets and thus to better smite all pinks.

132
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,560
It might not be a bad idea for other sub-genii,

133
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,820
especially the ones who are as mule-headed and agitated and or as superior as myself,

134
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,560
to kind of check their oil, too.

135
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,580
We must remember that, according to the Bible,

136
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,480
according to Dobbs,

137
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,920
any politician who does not have a membership card in its pocket

138
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,680
is absolutely not to be trusted.

139
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,460
And any politician who has a sub-genius membership card in its pocket

140
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,280
is absolutely not to be trusted.

141
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,000
So, you know, perhaps the republic goons and the democratons

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,840
are engaged in total self-destruction even as we speak.

143
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,920
But even so, they would only be replaced by two more

144
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,980
bear traps for suckers.

145
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,680
You know, the refertarian party versus the liberform party, maybe, or something.

146
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,120
But it certainly won't be the patriopsychotic anarcho-materialist party.

147
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,200
Anything but that!

148
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,480
Because then there'd be no conspiracy at all, friends!

149
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,740
No, no conspiracy at all.

150
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,140
But as Fran Lebowitz said,

151
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,880
humility is no substitute for a good personality.

152
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,820
And Bob Dobbs has neither.

153
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,500
But as Sam Levinson said,

154
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,680
and Bob would agree,

155
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,760
it's so simple to be wise,

156
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,560
just think of something stupid to say,

157
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,280
and then don't say it.

158
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,120
And I think that really that's pretty much the way Bob pulls it off.

159
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,180
That said, friends, let's me just shut up

160
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,860
and move on into this beautiful,

161
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,580
beautiful explorations of X-Day.

162
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,700
And friends, it's what you're missing.

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,100
And also, and probably what I'm missing too,

164
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,740
if Bob's...

165
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,500
No, I'm not even gonna think that way.

166
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,080
And all this other tape.

167
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,000
So...

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,900
Oh, yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes.

169
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,100
Well I can't keep saying this.

170
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,740
Enjoy, oh yeah.

171
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:57,740


172
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:57,740


173
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:57,740


174
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:57,740


175
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,620
Next week we get on with this new documentary.

176
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,300
We look forward to seeing you all next week on the Little City.

177
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,800
Happy New Year.

178
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:11,000
See you all then, see you next time.

179
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,300
Happy New Year!

180
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,820
messages.

181
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:28,520
In the year of the dragon, lots of men disappear. Quiet as is kept. They won't be back next year.

182
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,760
Johnny Domino was one of San Francisco's hottest young jazz musicians.

183
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:43,120
But fate and a cosmic event were about to change his life forever.

184
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,440
What the doctors told him seemed impossible.

185
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:55,800
John, your brain has managed to acquire the capacity to pick up certain frequencies like a radio.

186
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,260
They're dark. I'm only hearing bad stuff.

187
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,720
Yes, exactly. You're tuned to the frequency of evil.

188
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,520
Then a spirit forms in the open air,П Energize, that spares no trace.

189
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:29,820
овой мне!

190
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:29,820


191
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:29,820


192
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,680
Yeah I wasДа

193
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,920
this way

194
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,960
Ugh

195
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,480
to misery land.

196
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,000
Are you ready to accept a miracle in your life?

197
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,680
Yes?

198
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,900
Put a glide in your stride and dip in your hip

199
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,880
and come on to the moon.

200
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,960
Then listen to this tape.

201
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,860
Miracles can happen.

202
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,100
They do.

203
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,600
Are you ready to accept a miracle in your life?

204
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,720
Papa, no!

205
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,920
Hurry, we've got no time to lose!

206
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,280
Going so soon?

207
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,620
I wouldn't hear of it.

208
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,960
Why, my little party's just beginning.

209
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,440
Crack, crack like mice, rats.

210
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,600
That's right.

211
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,220
Don't hurt them right away.

212
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,180
We'll let them think about it a little first.

213
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,020
It's time to pray, America.

214
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,320
There's a new sitcom coming, folks.

215
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,040
It's called Armageddon.

216
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Or Armageddon.

217
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,360
That's what it's called, Armageddon!

218
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,700
The greatest war of all wars will be fought.

219
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,580
The Battle of Armageddon will be fought.

220
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,520
The blood will flow in the streets

221
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,860
up to the bridles of the horses for 200 miles.

222
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,600
Oh, this is a gap!

223
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,820
Oh!

224
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,240
Oh!

225
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,960
Lean forward to it, Mr. Stan.

226
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,100
You are the basic truth in us.

227
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
You are the reality.

228
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,260
We will never let you down.

229
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,980
And we will always be grateful.

230
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,220
I'll tell you what.

231
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,680
Five dogs came to town to set you free!

232
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,160
Surely, I come quickly.

233
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,980
Amen.

234
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,820
My!

235
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,280
People come and go.

236
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,280


237
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,620
They go so quickly here.

238
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,400
In both instances, he's coming literally, visibly, and bodily.

239
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,680
Brother, every time I see another spaceship going to the moon

240
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,980
in the exploration of the moon,

241
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,400
and soon driving the new automobiles they're making for the moon,

242
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,120
I say in my heart, he must be coming soon now.

243
00:14:59,480 --> 00:14:59,720
Come.

244
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,420
Let each one who hears them say the same.

245
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,360
Come.

246
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,980
Let the thirsty one come.

247
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,940
Anyone who wants to, without charge.

248
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,500
He who has said all things, declares,

249
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,600
Yes, I am coming soon.

250
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,540
God said, taste and see.

251
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,420
Just try it for yourself.

252
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,660
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

253
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,020
Frightening him like that when he came to you for help!

254
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,820
Silence!

255
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,260
With a snapper!

256
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,500
The beneficent Oz has every intention of granting your requests.

257
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,480
What's that? What is he saying?

258
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,160
What is he saying?

259
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,360
At first, you must prove yourselves worthy.

260
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,260
By the power of God.

261
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,140
By performing a very small task.

262
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,580
He didn't tell us to clean up the fish pond.

263
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,680
He said to fish in it.

264
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,760
In the universe, we're in a world full of action.

265
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,320
Something is happening.

266
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,260
We're in the race of the young generation.

267
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,160
We're on the go.

268
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,380
We want the domination.

269
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,740
Something is happening.

270
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,180
Something is happening now.

271
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,380
Yeah!

272
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:11,480
Oh!

273
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,080
Watch out for us.

274
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,720
We're an atonic reaction.

275
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,540
Something is happening.

276
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,360
We've got the pressure of a new motivation.

277
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,940
We're gonna live in one to change this formation.

278
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,060
Something is happening.

279
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,540
Something is happening now.

280
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,060
Oh!

281
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,700
And now we are on the verge of the greatest and the final war.

282
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,360
If we have an all-out war now, let me tell you something.

283
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,700
It will be the last.

284
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:58,960
And a blue ribbon panel of experts from MIT and Harvard University were asked to do a study using all of the computers, the military experts, and everything else to study and see what is the possibility of a nuclear war in this century.

285
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:08,480
They came back and they said, we expect a limited nuclear war before 1984 and an all-out nuclear holocaust before 1999.

286
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,280
And they said that we see it as inevitable.

287
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,960
And there's good reason for that.

288
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,860
Because of the wonderful things you know.

289
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,520
Those awful days that are still ahead for you and me.

290
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,760
Beginning in chapter 3 of 2 Peter, verses 10 through 14.

291
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:32,880
But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise.

292
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,420
Some have thought this means perhaps a nuclear blast.

293
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,980
And the elements shall melt with fervent heat.

294
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,760
That's tremendous heat isn't it?

295
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,860
The earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.

296
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:53,960
Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?

297
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:02,720
I suppose I could put on my black costume and fly over the Emerald City a few times on my flaming broomstick.

298
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,460
Double.

299
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:04,700
Double.

300
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,580
Double.

301
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,680
Double.

302
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:08,820
Double.

303
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,500
Double toiol and trouble.

304
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,660
Fire burns and cauldrons bubble.

305
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,440
This is a potent weird truth

306
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,520
That we've cooked up just for you.

307
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,180
Just look inside

308
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:37,320
Just look inside

309
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,660
And see what it is we've done

310
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,500
It's made of uranium

311
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,080
And it's called the atomic bomb

312
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,380
Ah, yes, the hard things

313
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:25,620
Yes, friends, that amazing collage of end-of-the-world material

314
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,560
was by my beautiful Reverend Susie the Floozy.

315
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,220
And, yeah, I think those things are brains.

316
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,300
She has got to be one of the most

317
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,900
skilled audio collagists in the whole of Asia.

318
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,100
And by the time you hear this,

319
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,800
I will be on the escape vessels with Susie the Floozy.

320
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,100
God, what strange chemistry that could create,

321
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,680
who knows?

322
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,060
Oh, and actually, the very beginning of that collage involved

323
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,640
what's not by her.

324
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,840
The very beginning was a new piece we got in

325
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,280
called...

326
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,000
From the Ministry of Found Objects.

327
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,200
That's a new ministry in our church

328
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,040
with this tape called Half-Assed X-Day Song Barrage,

329
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,740
which is of a terrible technical quality.

330
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,420
But, hell, let's just move on to something of...

331
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,180
Because we're moving on, friends.

332
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,440
We are moving on.

333
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,580
We're out of here.

334
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,460
...lights in one month at Brushwood.

335
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,380
Amazing.

336
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,000
There it is.

337
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,160
Sub-genius.

338
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,000
Dot com.

339
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,760
For more information.

340
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,380
From up here in the escape vessels,

341
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,360
we see the Earth blinking and winking down below.

342
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,640
There are some garbled signals, though, coming through

343
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,520
as we look out the windows.

344
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,020
It looks like G. Gordon Gordon and Stang

345
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,000
on the edge of a wing or something,

346
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,060
or eating chicken wings or something.

347
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,640
Oh, we're just sitting out here on the wing in our moon pants,

348
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,880
playing, sipping,

349
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,060
and playing with ourselves,

350
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,320
sitting out on the wing of the escape vessel.

351
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,360
Well, your voice is gone, man.

352
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,000
When your diapers fill up,

353
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,140
those moon pants are ready to jump.

354
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,780
Man, he did have a cold after X-Day.

355
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,020
That's why we party in our moon pants.

356
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,760
Well, why are the radio...

357
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,360
You know, I didn't know that the radio station

358
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,060
was going to be down by the engine room.

359
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,500
We're not in a good spot at all.

360
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,360
We're deluding ourselves.

361
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,920
We're kidding ourselves, you guys.

362
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,620
We were.

363
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,240
But we're not this year.

364
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,100
We're still on Earth.

365
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,240
Damn it, listen to me.

366
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,340
We don't know what it was.

367
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,820
We are not kidding.

368
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,060
This year, we have the rockets.

369
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,540
Come on, I mean, come on, snap out of it, you guys.

370
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,300
I can face it.

371
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,540
X-Day came.

372
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,980
X-Day went.

373
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,360
Well, you were tired and feathered.

374
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,380
Because we didn't have rockets.

375
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,340
That was the problem.

376
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,360
But we have rockets this year.

377
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,040
I think you can well imagine.

378
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,600
Big ones.

379
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,160
But on the other hand, you know,

380
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,500
I think a lot of people and a lot of subgeniuses,

381
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,100
in fact, Dr. Lake Hume himself,

382
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,700
was...

383
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,040
saying, well, I guess this is the end of the church,

384
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,880
and I was going, what the hell are you talking about?

385
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,320
And it was only the beginning.

386
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,780
It was only the beginning.

387
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,520
That's what X-Day was.

388
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,120
It was only the beginning.

389
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,140
It was only a way to weed out the chaff, right?

390
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,900
You got to get the chaff off of the kernels there.

391
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,760
Yeah, my rocket is definitely bigger than yours.

392
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,500
My smart bomb.

393
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,820
My bomb is smarter than yours.

394
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,220
And I've got a long fuse.

395
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,740
Not at all, Hal.

396
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,720
How do you mean?

397
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,380
Yeah.

398
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,240
Well, it's rather difficult to define.

399
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,640
Well, say it.

400
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,660
Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concern about it.

401
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,220
Well, I know I've never completed my thought process.

402
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,120
The safest place to be is right at the launch pad.

403
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,480
That there are some extremely awful,

404
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,760
hard things about this mission.

405
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,780
Of course, it involves subgeniuses.

406
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,400
Everything depends on how long we can stall them

407
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
while still showing results.

408
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,920
And we have shown results.

409
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,880
Well, this is great, but you can't have enough.

410
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,180
200 years, we'll be back in 1990, 1999.

411
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,100
And they will be.

412
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,680
And what if in 1999, Dobbs strings them along a little further?

413
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,000
We might end up having an X-Day gut blowout.

414
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,380
There will be no need for that.

415
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,140
On a yearly basis.

416
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,700
There will be no need after this year.

417
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,360
If the X's don't come and get us,

418
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,380
nobody will ever allow us to have a party on their land again.

419
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,140
And here's an example soundtrack from the party

420
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,760
we had last year at that camp around.

421
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,220
No borders looking for it.

422
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,800
Angels looking fit and mean.

423
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,700
Try to stand up.

424
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,920
This is the new goat.

425
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,180
Blood wrestling.

426
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,020
There's a beautiful girl.

427
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,920
And an obese man called El Gordo.

428
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,140
Wrestling.

429
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,440
Yes, it's quite a spectacle, friends, these X-Day events.

430
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,740
And we hope to see you there in the past.

431
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,860
Once we've traveled back in time and time controlled it,

432
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,460
we'll see how you would do it right.

433
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,960
We've had a second chance, you see.

434
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,080
If we could only create a time controlled loop

435
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,480
that would give all of us that second chance

436
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,740
to do this all again.

437
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,400
My god, I'm so scared.

438
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,240
I can't believe this.

439
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,920
Put together one more time.

440
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,480
Put together one more time.

441
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:05,680


442
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,300
Put together one more time.

443
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,300


444
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,360
Put together one more time.

445
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,060
Put together one more time.

446
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,360
Put together one more time.

447
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,800
Get together one more time.

448
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,280
Get together one more time.

449
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,380
Get together one more time.

450
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,100
Get together one more time.

451
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,100


452
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,100


453
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,880
One more time.

454
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,180
Hey, come on, honey.

455
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,220
I'm not giving in.

456
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,260
But last week, we fired a big boy rocket out of Cape Brushwood

457
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:18,100
against a possible Holocaust or evangelical encampments.

458
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,200
Because, well, the NASA-jellicles, of which I am the only one,

459
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,320
some big phony sky, and the leguminati.

460
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,840
It has been rumored, have been having secret discussions

461
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,520
referring to a possible peace accord

462
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,260
between the evangelicals and the Holocaustals.

463
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,120
We'll just see about that.

464
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:58,700
One hundred years away

465
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,820
The leguminati and the NASA-jellicles

466
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,340
Beware and be warned.

467
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,860
The Leguminati and the NASA-jellicles

468
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,020
The Leguminati and the NASA-jellicles

469
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,020


470
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,520
I realize

471
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:41,700
It's cantidad

472
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:41,780
A thousand times

473
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,480
That, together with Cette écoeur

Yeah.

Ooh.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Oh.

497
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,140
Yeah.

498
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,280
Watch out for some of those hot blinders.

499
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
You've been taking.

500
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,040
You know the ones that apply you too low.

501
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,040
Yeah.

502
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,340
Look out for some of those seven lives you've been taking.

503
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,180
To see the ones that apply you too low.

504
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,340
Yeah.

505
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,720
Talk about with the power of soul.

506
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,040
Anything is possible.

507
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,380
With the power.

508
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:32,700
Of you.

509
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,360
Anything you want to do.

510
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,640
Of you.

00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:03,640

00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,420
Flyin' through the air on the kite every day and every night.

513
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,280
Just to take a risk.

514
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,720
Sometimes the weather ain't right.

515
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,080
Yeah, playin' too much of one toy, baby.

516
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:21,000
Just to be a escape to the trip of nights.

517
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,700
Oh yeah.

518
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,860
And you look around and see old Jollyfish.

519
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,040
Yeah.

520
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,980
He said, floatation's groovy, baby.

521
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,260
It's just too much.

522

And even he'll tell you then

527
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,640
Yeah, getting high every day is easy

528
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,660
And it's floating around

529
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,960
Even a jolly bitch will agree to that

530
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,500
Yeah, I'm staying with the power

531
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,120

00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,760
The way you wanna be, baby

533
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,500
Look out now

534
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,400
With the power on you

535
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,940
And it's anything you want to do

536
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,620
With the power, power of soul

537
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,680
And everything that's so

538
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,300
With the power, the power of you

539
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,400
All your brothers and sisters

540
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,540
Get together and live together

541
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,360
With the power of soul

542
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,240
And everything that's so

543
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,240


544
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,560
With the power, the power of you

545
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,260
Anything you wanna do

546
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:49,340
Yeah, just when you're thinking about old Bubba,

547
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,600
the one that didn't wanna join the church,

548
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,640
well, the TV on this escape vessel in front of you

549
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,520
lights up and there's this shot of Bubba down there

550
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,980
eating a rotten rat

551
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,100
and hiding from the death

552
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,640
machines that the rogue pinks made

553
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,020
from the stolen womb of parts

554
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,520
and he'll, Bubba'll be down there

555
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,300
muttering to himself

556
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,600
Oh, how could I do it?

557
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,640
That was so stupid

558
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,740
I could've been saved

559
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,400
But no, I didn't send my twenty dollars

560
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,660
Oh God, here comes another rogue beast

561
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,080
And here I am in this festering pile

562
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,300
of rat-wasted dead people

563
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,060
and stripped bare skulls

564
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,800
If only I could die

565
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,480
If only I could die

566
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,080
But I can't, I can't

567
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,200
Why, if only Bob was here now

568
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,720
I'd give him my twenty dollars

569
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,420
I'd give him forty dollars

570
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,020
I'd give you everything I own, Bob, please

571
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,180
Well, friends, that just shows how much they trusted Bob

572
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,940
They didn't trust Bob Dobbs

573
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,560
Didn't trust him twenty dollars worth

574
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,040
Okay, fine, fine

575
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,720
No skin off our teeth

576
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,360
Pay lip service

577
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,240
Wear that Bob t-shirt

578
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,220
Be real hip

579
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,060
But when the Bob Dobbs show up

580
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,360
Those saucers come

581
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,620
Well, you're either on the bus

582
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,000
Or you're off the bus

583
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,660
As those great proto-sub-geni used to say

584
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,380
And the dumbest nerd could get on the bus for twenty bucks

585
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,460
Well, actually, those twenty dollars don't count

586
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,220
Their souls go into the cylinders that we trade

587
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:25,320
But they should be proud that their souls, such as they are

588
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,680
At least made it possible for their betters

589
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,840
To ride the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

590
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,700
And they'll be an orientation film

591
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,700
That they'll show you when you're ruptured up

592
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,300
You know, because otherwise it might be

593
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,140
Kind of confusing

594
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:44,160
This orientation film

595
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,560
It's kind of projected into your head

596
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,400
It's introduced by Princess We Are Doe

597
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,360
Queen of all the UFOs

598
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,060
Who's sort of this half-naked Flash Gordon

599
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,680
Slash Viking Brunhilde

600
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,960
With metal pointed breastplates

601
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,980
And a horned helmet

602
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,040
And a horned helmet

603
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,820
And all this UFO insignia on anything

604
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,180
And she is the mistress of the path of least resistance

605
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,720
And she narrates this film

606
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,400
And it's like, you will hear and obey

607
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,460
Take off your clothes

608
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,160
And you can watch the

609
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,400
You can either watch the orientation film

610
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,260
Or you can watch the live broadcast of X-Day

611
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:28,700
Or you can just, you know, go back to

612
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,040
Having your fun with the different silences

613
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,800
You go through all sorts of evil

614
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:33,800


615
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,340
And all the scenes are

616
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:34,660
Back and forth

617
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,240
It's also pretty common

618
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,200
We'll begin by entreting batteries

619
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,220
So

620
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,520
And talk about

621
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,060
The opposite of the ideal

622
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,220
And what there's going to be

623
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:59,720
jealousy. It's, you'll always, it's like, there's no sense of possessiveness because on that,

624
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,680
in that no zone of the saucers, time ceases to exist, or at least it feels that way. And you

625
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:12,300
don't need to be grasping anymore like you did on Earth. The overwhelming feeling that you get on

626
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:18,740
the, on the escape vessels is like, wow, the best part is it lasts as long as I want it to,

627
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:26,640
and I can take forever. I'm immortal for now, and I don't have the urge to grab this and keep it

628
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,340
so I can run somewhere else to grab some other thing. I don't have to kill or defeat another

629
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:38,540
monkey man to hang on to these, these big round soft things. I have plenty of time to get to those

630
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:47,260
other big soft round things, more than I could ever use. My pipe overfloweth, and the big round

631
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,660
soft thing shuts.

632
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:55,760
Help follow me through the land of Dobbs, and I will dwell in the cliff in between forever.

633
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:03,820
Hey, baby, where do you come from?

634
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:16,000
Well, she looked at me and smiled and looked at this face and said, I'm coming from the land of a new

635
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,380
present, so

636
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:27,720
then I said, hey, baby, where you trying to go to?

637
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:41,020
Then she says, I'm gonna spit, spread a line, be some ice, and I'll hold on to love to you and you.

638
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,240
Hey, would I like to come along?

639
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,160
Yes, I'd like to come along.

640
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,860
Would you like to come along, should I speak?

641
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,660
Yes, take me along right now.

642
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,940
Take me along.

643
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,700
I honestly don't know whether it was the future or the past.

644
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,600
Okay, we're good down to the last minute, the final minute.

645
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,600
We will be.

646
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,860
Wait, now we're down to.

647
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,220
There is something that we will be.

648
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,360
We will be last, by the way.

649
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:42,120
We're getting down to 40 seconds.

650
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,140
Four Kool-Aids.

651
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,380
35 seconds.

652
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,700
Hey, Kool-Aids.

653
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,640
Oh, yeah.

654
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,780
30 seconds.

655
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,240
Oh, yeah.

656
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:48,600
30 seconds.

657
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:48,680
30 seconds.

658
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:58,060
30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23.

659
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,560
No, it's 20.

660
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,240
21.

661
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,060
No, it's 19.

662
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:02,960
It's 19.

663
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:03,520


664
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,560
It's 18.

665
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:04,800
It's 19.

666
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,240
It's 18.

667
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:05,240


668
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:05,240


669
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:05,240


670
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,840
It's 19.

671
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:06,840


672
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,720

673
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:07,760

674
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,840

675
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,400

676
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:09,660

677
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,200
12.

678
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:10,820

679
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,420

1.

705
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,860
Suck up if they can't take a chance!

706
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,820
.

707
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:32,860
Woo!

708
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,640
.

709
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:40,820
.

710
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,160
Oh, I'm letting you know.

711
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:42,860
10.

712
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,540

723

00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:33,500

00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240

00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240

00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240

00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240

00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240


844
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240


845
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240


846
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240


847
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,980
83.

848
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,260
84.

849
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:03,440
83.

850
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:03,440


851
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:03,440


852
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:03,640
95.

853
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:03,640


854
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:03,640


855
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:03,640


856
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,040


857
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,380
96.

858
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:04,380


859
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:04,880
99.

860
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,460
10.

861
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,700
63.

862
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,380
rockets directly

863
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,380
at the people

864
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,980
that will be waiting

865
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,180
to swat down the rockets with their

866
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,140
sticks or catch the rockets with their

867
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,780
big nets.

868
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,100
But we will launch horizontal launched

869
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,080
rockets at

870
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,640
the combatants.

871
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,360
You really don't

872
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,460
want to miss this. Man

873
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,240
versus rocket event

874
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,280
at XX Day.

875
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,840
That's right. This is going to be

876
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,460
an event to end

877
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,960
literally

878
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,100
all events.

879
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,260
How can you beat that?

880
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,100
How can you beat that? Rockets

881
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,060
launched at people. That

882
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,640
is better than

883
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,460
shooting bullets at people.

884
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,000
People will catch bullets in their teeth.

885
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,680
We're shooting rockets

886
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,180
at people who will be defending

887
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,540
themselves with nothing but

888
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,020
defending themselves only with the football

889
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,180
uniforms they'll be wearing. But they will be

890
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,500
offending themselves

891
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,340
or defending the goal

892
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,660
with the big sticks and the fish

893
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,720
nets to swat rockets out of the

894
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,300
air. So if you'd like to see rockets

895
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,780
being swatted out of the

896
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,440
air in this fashion

897
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,600
or an alternate would be

898
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,680
if the rocket is not swatted out of the air

899
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,400
and it achieves its objective

900
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,460
of either taking out one of the

901
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,620
opponents or

902
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,500
scoring a goal.

903
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,200
Now how do they score a goal?

904
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,440
Well, we'll come up with that.

905
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,320
Maybe they score.

906
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,600
What's their goal if they swat a rocket out of the sky?

907
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,540
If they literally can swat

908
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,440
it right out of the sky? Because it's

909
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,400
only going to be traveling about 15 feet

910
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:42,720
high.

911
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:43,920
But

912
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:53,280
Hey baby

913
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,280
Can I step into your world of

914
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:58,620
all

915
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:00,660
Yes

916
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,380
you

917
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,160
can she said

918
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,700
Come on back with me

919
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,300
for a ride

920
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,160
We're going to

921
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,380
go across the Jupiter

922
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:22,100
and see all your

923
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,060
people one by one

924
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,940
We've got to help

925
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,860
your people out right now

926
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,260
That's what I'm doing

927
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,580
here all of us

928
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,780
Yeah, yeah

929
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,500
They all come along

930
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,480
They all come along

931
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,480
They all come along

932
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,100
Yeah, yeah

933
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,140
Please

934
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,360
take me

935
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:58,880
home

936
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:04,180
They all come along

937
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,320
That's right.

938
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:14,460
The soft parade has now begun in a mere month.

939
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:21,260
One month from tonight will be the eve of the X's arrival.

940
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:32,360
Or the launching of the earth first pleasure vessel.

941
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,360
One or two days later, we're going to be back in the air.

942
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:34,360


943
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:34,360


944
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:34,360


945
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,000
Time from today.

946
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:49,180
We will be racing here.

947
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:55,420
Will this is the earth or the island reaction from the huge

948
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:55,420


949
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:55,640
assemblage

950
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:55,640


951
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,220
From the earth

952
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:56,220


953
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,320
the Variable

954
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:57,320


955
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,300
Here's that

956
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:58,560
perfect

957
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,040
one

958
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,240
we are

959
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,900
going to

960
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:01,900


961
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:01,900


962
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:01,900


963
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:01,900


964
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:01,900


965
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:01,900


966
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,340
we

967
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


968
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


969
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


970
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


971
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


972
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


973
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


974
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


975
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


976
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


977
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


978
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


979
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


980
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


981
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


982
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,340


983
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:13,020
non-profits so those are non-prophecies and uh it's crazy how they just they came true because

984
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:23,180
we believed that's right we believed that we could do it and the launch pad is already there

985
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:32,060
at cape brushwood ready to go the rocket altar has already been burning those uh

986
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:46,920
and then the villagers gathered up the sheep and they all went off into the desert

987
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,300
they're all like trying to scurry away

988
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:59,100
the complexities of the nuances that the musicians are bringing to this particular

989
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,960
production arises out of a far-needed

990
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:09,080
to be eloquent in such positions that the lentil is when it lies in the soup mixed with the carrots

991
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:31,720
uh dear friends you're listening to uh this uh interesting uh audio collage cd

sometimes

998
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:31,860
it's always been just one

999
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,540

1010
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:18,960
so

1011
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,400
so

1012
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,580

hope

1030
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:58,140
I thought you'd hear the bullet coming so you could take the fall

1031
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,540
Or where you only get to heaven after you hit the wall

1032
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,160
Now we're rocking

1033
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,440
Now we're rocking

1034
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,060
Now we're

1035
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,520
Now we're rocking

1036
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,700
Shut up, stupid

1037
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,080
Editor's note

1044
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:37,740
What?

1045
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,000
What did I tell you, man?

1046
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,260
That was Eddie the Rat

1047
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,300

1052
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,380
For those of you with tape recorders

1053
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:08,840

1054
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,140
530 Devisadero Street

Suite 295

1056
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,200
San Francisco, California

1057
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,920
94117

1058
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,540
That's 530 Devisadero Street

1059
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,720
Number 295

1060
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,740
San Francisco, California

1061
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,360
94117

1062
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,880
And now in a similar vein

1063
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,000
Beyond

1064
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,940
Transubstantial

1065
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,660
The

1066
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,560
Brand Flakes

1067
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:48,660
Brand Flakes

1068
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,060
Brand Flakes

1069
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:49,060


1070
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:49,060


1071
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:49,060


1072
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:49,060


1073
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,160
Psalm

1074
00:52:54,420 --> 00:53:03,340
Word That Easter

1075
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,960
Start with revivalist preachers.

1076
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,880
Hallelujah. Praise God.

1077
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,660
The fire and brimstone Pentecostals and fundamentalists.

1078
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,400
Go to the church.

1079
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,140
Sit in the rear about three quarters of the way back.

1080
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,460
Repetitive music will be played while the people come in for service.

1081
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,960
A repetitive beat.

1082
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,460
45 to 72 beats per minute.

1083
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,640
A rhythm close to the beat of a human heart.

1084
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:47,900
The music is probably the same for every service or incorporates the same beat.

1085
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,180
Watch the people waiting for the service to begin.

1086
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,280
Many will exhibit slightly dilated eyes.

1087
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:02,700
Often they will begin swaying back and forth with their hands in the air

1088
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,320
while sitting in the service.

1089
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:10,020
The assistant pastor will probably come out and he usually speaks with a pretty good voice role.

1090
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:16,480
The words will usually be delivered at the rate of 45 to 60 beats per minute.

1091
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,540
The Lord is good.

1092
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,360
Blessed is the man that trusteth in him.

1093
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:29,600
Next, a group of young women in sweet and pure chiffon dresses might come out to sing a song.

1094
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:44,660
In the middle of the song, one of the girls might be smitten by the spirit and fall down or react as if possessed.

1095
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,220
At this point, hypnosis and conversion tactics are being mixed.

1096
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:02,560
In the background, a 45-beat per minute voice role from the assistant preacher might exhort,

1097
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,320
give a song.

1098
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:03,820
Give to God.

1099
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,980
Give to God.

1100
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,660
Oh, ye of little faith.

1101
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,620
What can I say?

1102
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,140
Yes, foolish mortals, beware.

1103
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,780
The dog's bird has landed.

1104
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,660
He's Bob.

1105
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,820
Bob don't ever change.

1106
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,980
He's Bob.

1107
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,780
Oh,

1108
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,580
always will be Bob.

1109
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:45,140
His pipe is the one with the doll that rains on the roof like fire.

1110
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:53,200
His neck is the one with the wattle inflaming your desire.

1111
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,100
He's Bob.

1112
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,380
Come on, Oaf.

1113
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,740
Bob don't ever change.

1114
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:04,320
He's Bob.

1115
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,880
Always will be Bob.

1116
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,820
Bob had a woman named Connie.

1117
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,460
She was a righteous frail.

1118
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:21,320
She had a lot of friends named Johnny.

1119
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,620
When Bobby hit the trail.

1120
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,340
He's Bob.

1121
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,720
Bob don't ever change.

1122
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:31,720


1123
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:31,720


1124
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:31,720


1125
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:47,680
change. It's Bob. Always will be Bob. Bob was the god of the forest who claims his jungle pride.

1126
00:56:47,680 --> 00:57:07,700
His pet was a brontosaurus that Bob he used to ride. He's Bob. Bob don't ever change. He's Bob. Always will be Bob.

1127
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:13,100
Ladies and gentlemen, Ivan Stang, The Water God.

1128
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:24,700
I'm here for you. Are you ready to accept a miracle in your life?

1129
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:38,980
Well, I don't know whether that's getting through to you or not there at home. I'm hearing some

1130
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:44,540
strange things in my headphones. Apparently some bleed through from the last feature, but

1131
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,140
that's impossible.

1132
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,200
Tonight, we will take a live penetrating look at the Chupa Chupa subgenius.

1133
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,740
A kamikaze gang of cat burglars and child prostitutes conjuring cash from chaos.

1134
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,220
Did you hear that?

1135
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:06,280
Give up. Give up.

1136
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,700
Come on.

1137
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,800
I'll go soon.

1138
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:12,420
Get out of here.

1139
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:14,960
Stop.

1140
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:18,820
Stop.

1141
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:21,680
Stop.

1142
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,040
Stop.

1143
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,180
Stop.

1144
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:31,800
Stop.

1145
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:32,420


1146
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:32,740
Stop.

1147
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:32,740


1148
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,920
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.
