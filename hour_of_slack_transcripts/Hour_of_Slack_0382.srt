1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,540
I've got a beautiful state here.

2
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,120
I've got a beautiful state here.

3
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,960
You just won't feel anything from this point on.

4
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:56,180
In the way of working on your mouth or any other part of your body that you might work with.

5
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,340
You just won't feel anything from this point on.

6
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,920
Just stay relaxed like that. Make sure at all times that your muscles won't work.

7
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,100
And you just won't feel a thing.

8
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,140
I've got a beautiful state here.

9
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,860
You just won't feel anything from this point on.

10
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,260
I just want you to tell me just how good you feel.

11
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,920
I like this.

12
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,440
So, I suppose I'll show you how to get loose all over, relax all over so that you don't feel anything. Would you like that?

13
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,500
Yes, I would like that.

14
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,780
All right. Take a good long deep breath.

15
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:13,120
And then gentlemen, you could make a test and you would find that she has complete anesthesia.

16
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,620
Does she ever.

17
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,140
She said she doesn't want Joe to fly into the moon.

18
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,160
Not so slow.

19
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,720
She proved she can fly.

20
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
She isfree from all the stress and anxiety.

21
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,400


22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,400


23
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,800
Oh.

24
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,480
Your child.

25
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,260
He is weak.

26
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,080
Oh!

27
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,120
It's Okay.

28
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,440
Father means all good things to those who wait.

29
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,900
I did.

30
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,160
Tottened your nipples, didn't I?

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,480
Love your suit.

32
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,220
People will say we're in love.

33
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,220
That was good.

34
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,960
Your histograms are showing, Doctor.

35
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,440
What does he do with this?

36
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,840
Madness.

37
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,580
Tell me his name, Doctor.

38
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,140
Precious!

39
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,740
Are you up there?

40
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,800
Precious?

41
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,800
Darling, how are you all right?

42
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,260
And you don't know what pain is!

43
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,880
Was she a great big fat person?

44
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,260
Yes, she was a big girl, sir.

45
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,720
I'm having an old famine for dinner.

46
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,580
We just cut off our girlfriend with a chainsaw.

47
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,920
No, we didn't.

48
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,560
That's right.

49
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,620
Who's laughing now?

50
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,120
Who's laughing now?

51
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,220
Who's laughing now?

52
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,860
I'm not laughing!

53
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:27,860


54
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,400
Gotcha, didn't I, you little sucker?

55
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,480
This is not a toy.

56
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,640
Properly used, it can provide many hours of emotional entertainment.

57
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,880
Both interesting and fun-filled, as well as completely adult in every way.

58
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,480
Remember, follow directions and hump only when ready.

59
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,880
A. D-bag.

60
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,100
B. Pants.

61
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,040
C. Packaging materials.

62
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,800
B. Insert your unit coupling into slot A.

63
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,400
C. Remove plastic nut holder.

64
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,600
D. Plug in.

65
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,380
Remember, energy is power, and power is everybody's business.

66
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,100
So, we suggest that you turn off any device not appropriate to your lifestyle.

67
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,020
If you have followed these simple steps,

68
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,100
you are now in full control of your life.

69
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,300
Sub cathvari.

70
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:19,300


71
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,180
you are now in full control of your subcaفي hours of

72
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,620
slur � winding.

73
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:46,100
So, have a good time.

74
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,980
аете

75
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,620
We have assumed control.

76
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,380
Yes, we always assume control.

77
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,480
And we have it.

78
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,500
May we assume control of you?

79
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,840
Ah, but what about this man?

80
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,300
Oh!

81
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,860
Not the killer king, the master, loading.

82
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,440
Oh, a mother of the mainly hyena!

83
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,280
Ah, that's an accident!

84
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,760
What about your sister?

85
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,720
Me too.

86
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,840
And nobody knows that he will kill us!

87
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,300
I had to hunt pretty hard to find any good drugs.

88
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,380
No, no, no.

89
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,080
And it's what I want to talk to you about this evening.

90
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,320
I am honest, convincing, and highly erroneous.

91
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,680
Let's face it, my hunt hasn't deteriorated.

92
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,440
It deteriorated in its implementation.

93
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,020
This led to my failure.

94
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,820
Much has been said about my management style.

95
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,000
But I can tell you, I've put in long hours for the nation's benefit,

96
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,000
creating troubles or tragedies, sketchy reports, erroneous statements,

97
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,180
thousands of documents, secret bank accounts, and diverted funds,

98
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,260
so that those can be available to me on a continuing basis.

99
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,820
I've been a victim of the

100
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:02,340
Why do those subgeniuses keep making fun of poor President Reagan?

101
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,000
You ever wonder that?

102
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:10,080
Poor man's been out of office for longer than some of our listeners have been alive.

103
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,740
That's probably not true.

104
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,400
And yet, to this day,

105
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,480
people still like to cut up and edit and make him sound like a senile old thot.

106
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,980
And while we all know that's not the case,

107
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,620
well, before that,

108
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,780
a little bit from Silence of the Lambs,

109
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,840
but also a little bit from our good friend Ash,

110
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,180
the hero of Evil Dead 2,

111
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,000
and the Army of Darkness,

112
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,060
which we've seen twice already.

113
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,320
It's so good.

114
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:42,660
It's...

115
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,380
I tell you,

116
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,220
it's the best Three Stooges movie I've seen in a long time.

117
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,680
And I hope you'll see it, too, before it goes on its way.

118
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,400
Tonight's show,

119
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,260
it's looking like it's going to be another subgenius American music party.

120
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,900
I'm just about convinced of it.

121
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,720
And...

122
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:07,820
Laura.

123
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,840
So stay tuned.

124
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,660
Before we get...

125
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,840
Well, no, I guess we'll get started now.

126
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,060
No.

127
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,680
No, no, no.

128
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,940
Announcements or cards or anything to play with.

129
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,960
There's nothing to stop us from starting the Hour of Slack right now with...

130
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,160
an old favorite.

131
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,020
Thank you.

132
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,820
Welcome to our final segment of the Song sans Trauma.

133
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:08,280
It's a big one from the Gayle醒 Life,

134
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,580
and we've it with Keith Brown,

135
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:11,660


136
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,940
Hello to...

137
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:12,940


138
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,040
Bye.

139
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:02,800
And of course that was the fine, fine song, Hurdy Gurdy Man by Donovan,

140
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,400
performed by those certain surfers of which you've no doubt heard.

141
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,180
And now...

142
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,500
If you don't love me anymore, she will now often postulate,

143
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,500
if you did, you would give me one now and again,

144
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,160
so that I would not have to rely on that rancid Pakistani for my orgasms.

145
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,900
I will give you one after you have got me my supper,

146
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,140
I now usually scream, but not before,

147
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,220
as you understand making her bang contingent on the arrival of my supper.

148
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:14,340
Taste of bologna, Tony, everybody eats when they come to my house.

149
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,580
Do you like cherries?

150
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,300
Well, as a matter of fact, yes, I do. I like cherries.

151
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,460
I got a message for you.

152
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,920
Kill your television.

153
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,920
What do you mean it's not in the computer?

154
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:38,620
I want you to eat.

155
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:38,620


156
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:38,620


157
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:38,620


158
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,280
Oy, you little prometjag Typ, put your pants in and ...

159
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,600
I'm gonna kiss you.

160
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,240
Are you on fire?

161
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,500
He gave leave for two minutes.

162
00:16:50,040 --> 00:17:07,920
He fucking fucking negatives ultimately.

163
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:15,960
I wear the dog control that never raises and rips.

164
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:21,460
The princess squeezes, drapes you on the door and putting kiss.

165
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,120
But when you be wearing them, I am not leaving you.

166
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:33,500
The flesh will not be tearing, but the tail will be my own.

167
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:43,680
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.

168
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:55,500
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.

169
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,960
This one's warm and balcony and this one's warm and floor.

170
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,660
When the senator's decapitating the residential wall.

171
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,780
All men's senators splashing in the mud.

172
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,480
Talks are having someone screaming in the mud.

173
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:30,780
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.

174
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:42,520
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.

175
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:49,860
Now it's raining and it's pouring on the hill of junior glory.

176
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,460
The constable is swinging from the chains.

177
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,560
For the dead there is no story, no memory, no blame.

178
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,560
The shop blew and tomorrow it's the same.

179
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:17,580
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.

180
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,380
In the Colosseum, call the back to see him.

181
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,260
In the Colosseum tonight.

182
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,480
Back slowly, I can see him.

183
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,900
Boys and women digging into the favorite mud.

184
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,200
The dark horse and the great glory to the jailer in the wind.

185
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,040
It's always much more sporting when there's families and kids.

186
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,040
The madness of the crowd is in the campus.

187
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:03,480
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.

188
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:16,080
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.

189
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:23,240
No justice here, no liberty, no reason to complain.

190
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,860
And no cause to take the sweetest taste of blood.

191
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,420
And greetings from the nation.

192
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,460
And they shake their hands in time.

193
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,400
They're taking their own patients.

194
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,260
The vultures take their hide.

195
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:51,200
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.

196
00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:02,400
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.

197
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,460
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.

198
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,520
In the Colosseum, tonight.

199
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,400
And I'm gonna ask the power and the joy of the power of the living King of Kings.

200
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,880
And a lot of you here, you spot mind and musical people say,

201
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,660
King of Kings, there must be Elvis.

202
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,820
No, I'm gonna ask for the power, I'm gonna ask for the glory.

203
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,260
I'm gonna now tell you a story.

204
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,520
I'm gonna drive out the demons' friends.

205
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,180
I'm gonna ask you to help this madness end.

206
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,760
Come on, Franklin, have a story.

207
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,780
Come on now, share the glory.

208
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,580
Do you feel the power?

209
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,140
Come on, put out the negativity.

210
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,740
Come on, let's do this.

211
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,460
I'm gonna ask the power and the joy of the living King of Kings.

212
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:52,460


213
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:52,460


214
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,280
The lies all green and buzzing,

215
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,820
They give a dream of despair.

216
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,820
Prisoners grumble and kiss their clothes,

217
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,600
And scratch their married hair.

218
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,820
A tiny little light from a window,

219
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,120
A hundred yards away.

220
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,040
It's all they ever get to know

221
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,100
About the regular life in the day.

222
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,680
And it stinks so bad,

223
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,840
The stones been choking,

224
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,360
And the wicked ladies' thoughts.

225
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:33,680
In the room where the giant fire of a work suit,

226
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,880
The torture never stops.

227
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,700
The torture never stops.

228
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,240
The torture,

229
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,960
The torture,

230
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:44,300


231
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,360
The torture never stops.

232
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:02,800
The torture never stops.

233
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,700
Slime and rot and rats and snuff,

234
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,560
And vomit on the floor.

235
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,180
Ooh!

236
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,220
Fifty ugly-looking soldiers, man,

237
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,500
Fifty ugly-looking soldiers, man,

238
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,140
Holding spears by the iron door.

239
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:17,600
Ooh!

240
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,900
The knives and spikes and guns and the likes,

241
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,300
And every tool of pain.

242
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,080
A sinister little midget,

243
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,060
With a bucket in her mouth,

244
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,700
A sinister little midget,

245
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,740
With a bucket in her mouth,

246
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,300
A sinister little midget,

247
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,340
With a bucket in her mouth.

248
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,080
Where the blood goes down the drain.

249
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,520
And it stinks so bad,

250
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,680
The stones been choking,

251
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,120
And the wicked ladies' thoughts.

252
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,200
In the room where the giant fire of a work suit,

253
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,320
The torture never stops.

254
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,980
The torture never stops.

255
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,420
The torture,

256
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,280
The torture,

257
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,440
The torture never stops.

258
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:11,520


259
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,640
Life's already buzzing

260
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,380
And it's catching up the burst.

261
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,520
An evil Grimstein is steaming big

262
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,880
In the chamber right near there.

263
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,660
He eats the snuff,

264
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,280
And the chatter's first.

265
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,520
The loins and groins are soonded,

266
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,180
To disperse

267
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,480
His carvings start

268
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,520
His well-behaved

269
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,200
His hands and jaws

270
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,340
All their fingers

271
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,840
All men be

272
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,900
All men be

273
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,060
All men be

274
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:26,120
All men be

275
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,080
They will be

276
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,900
I'm the sound of the year

277
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,040
in the wind

278
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,020
In the wind

279
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,320
I'm the sound of the year

280
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,520
in the wind

281
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,800
In the wind

282
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,940
I'm locked up in the dark

283
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,060
We're done, Bob.

284
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,560
I wanna buy the cave paintings, Bob.

285
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
I'm gonna build a diamond.

286
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,820
A diamond.

287
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,380
First.

288
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,640
So.

289
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,720
And it stinks so bad.

290
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,760
It's cold, it's been choking.

291
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,700
It's been destroyed.

292
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,120
In the night of the iron sausage.

293
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,520
Where the torture never stops.

294
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,080
The torture never stops.

295
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,480
The torture.

296
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,240
The torture.

297
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,400
The torture never stops.

298
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,380
And speaking of torture, how about this other song?

299
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,260
No, I wish we could.

300
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,260
That track goes on to feature Mr. Zappa

301
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,820
performing a version of Lonesome Couch.

302
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,440
Cowboy Bert.

303
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,060
With new lyrics relating to Mr.

304
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,740
I think we could safely call him Mr.

305
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,460
Jimmy Swaggart now.

306
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,820
And just not that kind of a show yet.

307
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,100
And I can't help it.

308
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,460
There's nothing I can do about that.

309
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,960
Everywhere else no one talks about Jong Ultra.

310
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,240
Speaking now is the idea of Morningstar's

311
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,240


312
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,480
First.

313
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,800
Yes.

314
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,400
Are you with me?

315
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,020
All right, today is Wednesday.

316
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,360
How do you do, Mr. Jeff?

317
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,800
And Jerry, good to have just us on.

318
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,440
No delays.

319
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,440
Impossible.

320
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,400
Well, remember that I can't say late tonight.

321
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,040
No excuses.

322
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,120
No delays.

323
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,160
Let's send him a personalized letter.

324
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:03,460
Slowly.

325
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,380
I'll write a new paragraph for our standard one.

326
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,360
Then I'll have to retie him a whole new letter.

327
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,240
The work is really piling up today.

328
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,560
I can't win.

329
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,100
This takes time.

330
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,360
Too much time.

331
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,880
We're getting behind.

332
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,440
I've been on the phone all morning trying to get the figures verbally.

333
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,620
I can't help you at all.

334
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:26,980
Sorry.

335
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,600
I can't do it.

336
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,060
I can't do it.

337
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,300
Why not?

338
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,260
I don't know.

339
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,920
I just can't.

340
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,980
I simply can't.

341
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,320
Mm-hmm.

342
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,000
I can't do it.

343
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,660
I can't do it.

344
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:03,660


345
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:03,660


346
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:03,660


347
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:03,860
I can't do it.

348
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,880
There's something special when you smile.

349
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,380
I am sick and deranged.

350
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,760
Can I bring my friend to tea?

351
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,780
I've got a weird heart.

352
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,500
Can I put the tube in the baby's head?

353
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,340
Where's my liquid paper?

354
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,120
Put your face in the pool.

355
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,160
You can't get part.

356
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,380
I'm a writer, and I drink a lot of coffee.

357
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,180
So I want my coffee to have that rich, full-bodied flavor.

358
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,860
My wife knows this.

359
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,040
Now, I'd never hit my wife or lock her in the onion cellar if she didn't make a perfect cup of coffee.

360
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,060
But she knows that I demand that true coffee taste.

361
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,660
And that's why I only allow one brand in our house.

362
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,680
Better coffee than this, there isn't.

363
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:58,940
I'm putting another pot of coffee on the sink.

364
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,860
No, the stove.

365
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,660
I'm putting another pot of coffee on the sink.

366
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,420
I'm putting another pot of coffee on the sink.

367
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,540
Okay, we're going to talk about the king, but, you know, I've got a question first.

368
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,760
Maybe you guys can help me with this question.

369
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,820
And you know, it's the king of what?

370
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,520
I don't know.

371
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,680
The king of what?

372
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,740
I don't know.

373
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,480
I don't know either.

374
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,920
Well, if he was a king, he must have been king of something important, huh?

375
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:12,700
Yeah.

376
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,440
Yeah.

377
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,180
He must have been king of something important.

378
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,960
But the king of what?

379
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,080
King of kings.

380
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,200
You think so?

381
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:21,860
Well.

382
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,740
caring is pretty important

383
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,000
you think he could have been the king of caring?

384
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,880
he could have been the king of happiness

385
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,860
you think so? I don't know, well

386
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,580
he didn't care very much about anything except being king

387
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,140
so he must not have been king of that

388
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,760
but you think maybe he was king of happiness?

389
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,440
maybe

390
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,300
well, I don't know, maybe so

391
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,160
uh

392
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,220
but you know, he really wasn't very happy

393
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,300
so he must not have been king of that

394
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,640
he must not have been king of happiness

395
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,700
so I don't know

396
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,360
he was king of something but king of what?

397
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:53,980
I don't know

398
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,220
I don't know

399
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,060
I don't know

400
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,960
uh

401
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,160
His goodness

402
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:50,680
Watch out

403
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:50,680


404
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:50,680


405
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:50,680


406
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:50,680


407
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:50,680


408
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,820
I don't wanna be a tyrant

409
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,640
or a stater

410
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,720
No, I don't wanna be a man

411
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,640
for life ain't the kind you want

412
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,780
No, no

413
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,380
Baby, let me be

414
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,720
around you

415
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,120
every night

416
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,460
Run your fingers

417
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,240
through my hair

418
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,220
and pull me real tight

419
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,940
Oh, let me be

420
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,920
around you

421
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,120
Yo, Jetty Bear

422
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,740
You're dead

423
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:28,600
Oh, I don't wanna be a tiger

424
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,980
for those tigers play to rock

425
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,620
You know I don't wanna be a lion

426
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,040
for life ain't the kind you want

427
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,200
I just want to be

428
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,820
your Jetty Bear

429
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,740
Oh, yeah

430
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,980
Put a chain around my neck

431
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,940
Believe me

432
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,900
Anywhere

433
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,840
Just let me be

434
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,160
your Jetty Bear

435
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,800
Oh, yeah

436
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,640
Oh, yeah

437
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,000
Oh, yeah

438
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,780
Oh, yeah

439
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,300
Oh, yeah

440
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,720
Oh, yeah

441
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,220
Oh, yeah

442
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,140
Oh, yeah

443
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,420
Oh, yeah

444
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,140
Oh, yeah

445
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,100
Oh, yeah

446
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,860
Oh, yeah

447
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,300
Oh, yeah

448
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,060
Oh, yeah

449
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,060


450
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,060


451
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,060


452
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,060


453
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,060


454
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,060


455
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,080
I know how it works

456
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,600
But it's my choice

457
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:42,760
Get it

458
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,060
I know

459
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,400
I know

460
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:45,400


461
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:45,400


462
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:45,400


463
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,380
Don't be afraid

464
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,020
ever

465
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,580
Don't even even think

466
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:57,500
when you're gonna need me

467
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,400
teddy bear.

468
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,800
This is Sun Ra.

469
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,980
This is Sun Ra.

470
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,120
This is Sun Ra.

471
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:55,500
This is Sun Ra.

472
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,360
This is Sun Ra.

473
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,380
This is Sun Ra.

474
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,500
This is Sun Ra.

475
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,120
This is Sun Ra.

476
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,420
This is Sun Ra.

477
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,000
This is Sun Ra.

478
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,400
This is Sun Ra.

479
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,220
This is Sun Ra.

480
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,840
This is Sun Ra.

481
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,960
This is Sun Ra.

482
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,280
This is Sun Ra.

483
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,780
This is Sun Ra.

484
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,200
This is Sun Ra.

485
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,540
This is Sun Ra.

486
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,320
This is Sun Ra.

487
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,100
This is Sun Ra.

488
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,320
This is Sun Ra.

489
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,860
I don't know, these humans will not wake up.

490
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:49,900
Only the return of Jesus or intervention by some cosmic super-intelligence can save us now.

491
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,100
Hello?

492
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:55,640
Hello?

493
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,380
Welcome back.

494
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:20,460
Welcome back to the Trevor and 오늠 Societal,

495
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:27,460
and the next episode of encoursing platforms.

496
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,100
The

497
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:21,920
smiles to be pasted on over the panic, the glances to be interpreted, and worst, the conversation.

498
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:36,940
Be this good, I never grow tired of, and that's important because after I put in a long day at the typewriter, I look forward to that special time of evening when all the children are in bed, and I sit with my wife, and I have that one last cup of the day.

499
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:43,140
Here are six more cups of coffee.

500
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,680
Oh, I dropped them.

501
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,060
Oh, here's one that didn't break.

502
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,680
That's not a cup of coffee.

503
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,780
Not coffee?

504
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,240
Cup of coffee?

505
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,360
That's an ashtray, dear. Now hand me the coffee.

506
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,520
Here.

507
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,740
That's not the coffee. That's a baby's block.

508
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,120
No, to your left. No, to your other left. No.

509
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,160
Here's coffee.

510
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,340
No, that's a magazine.

511
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,660
Three hundred!

512
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:28,320
Three hundred women in three hours told me, boy, forget the flowers.

513
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,320
I was just wondering, do they have blood banks in England?

514
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:47,980
No.

515
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,200
But they have a Liverpool.

516
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,640
I'm going to the hospital.

517
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:51,860
Oh, no.

518
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,000
Hey, Charlie, for a filth! If you don't get down, I'm going to touch you with a ribbon.

519
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:56,780
No!

520
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,440
You've got to burp, Charlie. It's the only way.

521
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,640
Hello, people. This is the Reverend. Now, I know that many of you are not blessed with perfect vision.

522
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,600
That explains why you're listening to this filth instead of reading a good book.

523
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,480
I wonder what my credit rating is.

524
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,320
It is exactly what you make it.

525
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,280
Hmm.

526
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,620
If I pay all these bills, I'm going to be a rich man.

527
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:21,620


528
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,540
If I don't pay all these bills, what do we live on?

529
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:29,280
What would happen, I wonder, if I, well, if I just didn't pay?

530
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,260
That's no solution.

531
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,280
Welcome to the club, Jim.

532
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,760
I've just got to have it.

533
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,380
Have more.

534
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,320
I've just got to have it.

535
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,000
And enjoy more.

536
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,420
If this baby ever leaves.

537
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,080
Have more.

538
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,000
I've just got to have it.

539
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,660
And enjoy more.

540
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,220
I've just got to have it.

541
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:43,780
Have more.

542
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,640
I've just got to have it.

543
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,320
And enjoy more.

544
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,240
Tempting, isn't it?

545
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,600
But if you're careless, see what happens.

546
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:51,600


547
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:51,600


548
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:51,600


549
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,140
There's still a responsibility.

550
00:45:53,140 --> 00:46:02,420
The baby needs only a few more steps, decide whether your bill goes out otherwise.

551
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,640
There you are.

552
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,560
You've only got 25 days up for this Step Resources CPA Training.

553
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,500
or maybe up to the last one.

554
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:07,520


555
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,200
