They don't eat her.

And as a fair young flower, she died.

47
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,060
Richard Nixon died today.

48
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,020
Copycat.

49
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,180

Oh, I guess he was okay.

52
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,960
Their presidency.

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,440
He went to a special place in heaven.

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,320
We don't have a good word for English.

58
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,820
Copycat.

59
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,060
And I don't dream about the president anymore.

60
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,040
As a flower, she grew.

61
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,820
And most of my friends, they say that they don't eat her.

62
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,620
And as a fair young flower, she died.

63
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,140
Richard Nixon died today.

64
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,380

66
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,320
Richard Nixon died today.

That's great.

73
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,940
That brings back memories.

74
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,580
You can play it if you want, babe.

75
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,040
It's all right.

76
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,300
I mean, I endure crappy music all the time.

77
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,160
I'm going to play some more Greek themes.

78
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,360
Yeah, I love it.

79
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,360


80
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,360


81
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,360


82
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,120
I love the Greek ones.

83
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,460
The Telly Saval is going to be a super Telly Saval.

84
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,180
So it makes me want to make mad love to it.

85
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,640
Oh, okay.

86
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,160
That's great, Telly.

87
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,300
Good.

88
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,440
Hal's almost here.

89
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,600
Ten more minutes.

90
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,220
Is that me nearly?

91
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,100
Yeah.

92
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,980
I'm not sure.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,820
I'm still deciding.

94
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,460
It is late.

95
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,120
And I'm scantily glad.

96
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,240
Wow.

97
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,120
I guess I should go and edit this conversation.

98
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Are you an edit head too?

99
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,200
Yeah, I edit.

100
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:30,900

Don't you guys have jobs?

102
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:36,900

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,080
J-O-B.

105
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,700
I can't go to a job.

106
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,340
Don't just want me to come back the next day and the next day and the next day.

107
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,300
I can't get involved in something like that.

108
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,240
Jam it.

00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,860

Jamming

141
00:08:52,280 --> 00:09:07,460
There seems to be something jamming it

142
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,480
Sir, it appears to be...

143
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,540
Raspberry

144
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,240
There's only one man who would dare give me the raspberry

145
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,720
There's only one man who would dare give me the raspberry

146
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,680
And that man is Bob

147
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,400
Local color did that

148
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,980
Raspberry jam it's called

149
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,120
The earlier song

150
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,340
Richard Nixon Died Today

151
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,520
Was from FegmoTactic

152
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,740
By Mark Hosler of NegativeLand.com

153
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,540
The titles and news are by Lee Murr

154
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,940
And the rest is puzzling evidence

155
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,220
It's not spring today

156
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,900
But it's morning

157
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,720
It's morning today

158
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:50,720


159
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:50,720


160
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:50,720


161
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:50,720


162
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:50,720


163
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:50,720


164
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:50,720


165
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,780
Three minutes and Hal will be here.

166
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,740
That's right.

167
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,360
Hal should be walking in any minute now.

168
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,140
I really miss him.

169
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,880
Hal bug, little buggy bug.

170
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,020
Let me know when he does.

171
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,100
I can howl at the moon.

172
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,740
Yeah, we can howl at Hal.

173
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,980
Hal, howl at Hal.

174
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,040
Whoa, baby.

175
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,160
Oh, it's time to get dirty.

176
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,100
Oh, yeah.

177
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,640
Uh-oh, I think Eve's losing her.

178
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll leave.

179
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,700
From PR News in Washington, I'm easily within range.

180
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,780
Iran's defense minister said it'll be a strong deterrent against sex with its nuclear program.

181
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,740
The leading architects of Russia's economic reforms say the government grew in November by more than 10 percent,

182
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,500
but it was mostly due to Barack.

183
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,220
Obama's same-sex marriage to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.

184
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,660
On Wall Street, 5, 10, 4, 15, 2, 16.

185
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,800
Editors with the Associated Press have voted Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke athlete of the decade.

186
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,120
The nation's capital is the latest jurisdiction to pass legislation legalizing PR News.

187
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,320
Is Hal here?

188
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,920
Is Hal here?

189
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,720
Is Hal here?

190
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,120
Oh, no.

191
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,700
No.

192
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,600
That's what's going to happen.

193
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,240
The mystery now at 3 o'clock is where is Hal?

194
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,320
Where is Hal?

195
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,640
Where is Hal?

196
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:19,720
Where is Hal?

197
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:19,720


198
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,040
Is he all right?

199
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,720
He's late.

200
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,520
He's late.

201
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,040
He's not here.

202
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,680
I'm kind of worried.

203
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,820
It's raining outside.

204
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,700
And I'm worried.

205
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,340
He's usually here right on time.

206
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:28,920
Do you think?

207
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:29,960
What about him?

208
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,760
We have to do a test.

209
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,120
It is right.

210
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:32,840
Show up.

211
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,300
I mean, what if he's sick?

212
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,420
What if he doesn't have a suit to wear or the shoes?

213
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,820
He's got different shoes.

214
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,820
Not enough socks.

215
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,740
And what if he ate something bad and he was throwing up for hours?

216
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,460
Or it could be if he got, like, the flu.

217
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,540
I mean, there's the swine flu going around.

218
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,860
Like, maybe he's got some kind of wart on his thumb and he can't.

219
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,900
Well, what if Hal showed up, like, in a pair of sweats and, like, a stained T-shirt?

220
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,880
All hell will break loose then.

221
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,500
The world is coming to an end.

222
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,800
That would be one of the signs of an apocalypse.

223
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,880
The world is coming to an end once Hal wears sweats.

224
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,900
He's such a dapper man.

225
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,740
I hope he's all right.

226
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,460
Do you think he's all right?

227
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,160
I'm kind of worried.

228
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,020
I mean, I don't know.

229
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,600
I don't know.

230
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,680
He never is.

231
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,320
It's already.

232
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,600
What time is it?

233
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,520
It's, oh, my God.

234
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,200
It's 3.01.

235
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,600
He's not here.

236
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,600
He's not here.

237
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,340
Maybe we should call him.

238
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,040
He doesn't have a cell phone.

239
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,160
You guys, none of you have cell phones.

240
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,260
Well, he probably got confused about the digital.

241
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,120
Now, this is the thing about having a cell phone that I've been talking to you about for years now.

242
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,660
You get a cell phone and we can reach you.

243
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,200
I've never owned a cell phone.

244
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,280
I'm not talking to you, Phineas.

245
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,280
I'm talking to my husband.

246
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,660
Dear, I really think it's about time you got on my plan.

247
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,200
I always think you're talking to me.

248
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,120
And then when you're talking to me, I don't notice.

249
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,360
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,480
I should be talking to you.

251
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:48,880
Okay.

252
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,260
So.

253
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,220
So, Phineas, what do you think about Hal?

254
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:57,920
Well, Hal's very smart and he's got a, probably a photographic memory, but he denies that he does.

255
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,940
But he has a psychopedic mind.

256
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,060
And that turns you on, doesn't it?

257
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,160
Well, I don't know.

258
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,080
I don't know.

259
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,240
Come on.

260
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
Tell us the truth.

261
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,860
Oh, come on now.

262
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,960
Once I get to go by the feather, too.

263
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,240
Hey, Eve, what are your turn ons?

264
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,860
Hey, you want to ask my boyfriend?

265
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,700
Yeah, kind of.

266
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,080
Do you want to ask my boyfriend?

267
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,380
He's shy.

268
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,540
Shy, huh?

269
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,160
He's five?

270
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,140
He's like my husband.

271
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,220
My husband's kind of shy.

272
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:30,800
The puzzling.

273
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,360
Yeah.

274
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,340
And I don't like him at five.

275
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,660
Sometimes I call him Puzz or Short.

276
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,460
I'm kind of a shy exhibitionist.

277
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,300
Just like we're secretly famous.

278
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,640
You want me to tie you up?

279
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,500
I like being tied up.

280
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,280
I can't hear you, what you're talking to.

281
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:48,600
I don't know.

282
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:49,700
I don't know.

283
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,980
I like being tied up and spanked.

284
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:52,620
Oh.

285
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,400
No, it's okay.

286
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,080
We're going farther.

287
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,840
Do you know my husband?

288
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,180
Do you like to be tied up and spanked?

289
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,580
And be spanked.

290
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,840
Oh, okay.

291
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:02,620
Spanked.

292
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,020
She likes to be spanked and tied up.

293
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:04,900
Oh.

294
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,660
Who doesn't?

295
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,120
It's fun.

296
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,560
Oh, yeah.

297
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,420
Deprive and then abuse.

298
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,280
It's good.

299
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,740
Well, do you like to be spanked and tied up or tied up and spanked?

300
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,320
Or is it like both at the same time?

301
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
I like when I'm tied up and then I'm like seized and spanked.

302
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,960
I like the pain.

303
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,520
Honey, have you seen the Ziploc bags anywhere?

304
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,680
I'm trying to put dinner away.

305
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,340
Okay.

306
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,300
You got that sandwich?

307
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,580
Wait a minute.

308
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,840
I told you that you should eat your green beans.

309
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,600
I got to talk to this girl on the phone, though, about something.

310
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,080
What?

311
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,280
Who are you talking to?

312
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,520
Eat your green beans.

313
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,200
Who the hell is that?

314
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,880
It's Eve.

315
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,520
She's waiting for her boyfriend, Adam.

316
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,720
I'm trying to really help her.

317
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,560
Oh, whatever.

318
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,120
You and your little stories.

319
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,560
Your little Guam stories.

320
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,480
Finally, we can get Phineas off the dime.

321
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:52,900
You know why?

322
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,720
Why?

323
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,180
Hal's here.

324
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,240
Hal's here.

325
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,340
Is Hal really here?

326
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,060
Hey, Hal.

327
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,720
I bet he's wearing a hat.

328
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,420
Ding dong.

329
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,660
Not a hat like mine.

330
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,180
He is here.

331
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,540
He's here.

332
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,220
Hal is here.

333
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh, my God.

334
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,680
He's really here.

335
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,420
What the hell?

336
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:12,840
He's right.

337
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,740
I screamed when he came in.

338
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,940
He's here.

339
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,060
I'm so happy.

340
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,680
I'm very happy.

341
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:19,680


342
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,100
Don't worry.

343
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,280
You haven't believed and not worried at all.

344
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,080
I don't know if you want me to move.

345
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,900
How's the chair working out for you?

346
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,400
His chair just fell apart.

347
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,680
We've been dying for you.

348
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,420
Have you heard?

349
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,600
Did you hear?

350
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,400
You can hear us everywhere.

351
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,580
All over the world.

352
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,540
I'm calling from Fresno.

353
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,720
Are you really?

354
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,000
Really? The frog shrouded place we used to always...

355
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,440
Home of Brian Kenny Fresno.

356
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,120
Hal, say hi to Phineas.

357
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,160
Hi, Hal.

358
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,160
Hey, Phineas.

359
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:55,480
Hey.

360
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:03,780
It sounded so full, so full of the vitality and zest of life that it seemed that you were actually present in the studio.

361
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,860
Wow.

362
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,460
And he had the same illusion about you earlier.

363
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,620
Well, I sent you a...

364
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,520
He was talking to you on the phone.

365
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,640
This world without illusions.

366
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,400
I sent you a present.

367
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,660
Phoning it in, eh?

368
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,440
Hello, this is me, Bernard.

369
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,540
I just want to say, you know, you and I, those of us who are members of...

370
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:33,540
Who are so-called subgeniuses, know that the Subgenius Foundation and the Church of the Subgenius is a UFO cult, a UFO church.

371
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:40,040
And if you haven't had a dream about an alien invasion taking place and that you'll be taken out of it,

372
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,580
that as a subgenius you might be left behind here along with the...

373
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:54,780
...I think to deal with the conspiracy that at the end time that everything's playing out and that UFOs are appearing in the skies and appearing personally to individuals,

374
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:00,420
especially individuals like me, that UFOs are appearing in the skies and they show that they know that you're here.

375
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,120
And with all that said...

376
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,360
We had to pour salt.

377
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Giant salt crystals.

378
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,360
Thank you very much.

379
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,280
Happy New Year and Merry Christmas.

380
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,140
Merry Christmas.

381
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,320
But my wound can never be healed.

382
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,380
Or marry...

383
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:24,860
Whatever deity day of rest and choice and perfection that you feel is worthy of your veneration at that time of year.

384
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,560
Indeed.

385
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,080
It could be yourself.

386
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,220
I hope it's just yourself personally.

387
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,980
Of course, you can have something direly the matter, but then you can get well from that.

388
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,120
Happy Mimas.

389
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,660
One must simply continue.

390
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,300
Mimas and...

391
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,060
Yeah, Mimas.

392
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,160
Momos.

393
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,220
I can't think much better of someone than I do of myself.

394
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,660
It's like...

395
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,460
Happy Mimas.

396
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,100
Happy Mimas.

397
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,760
So have a nice big flagon of...

398
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,540
You guys are what?

399
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,600
Huh?

400
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,340
Sucking air chest wounds.

401
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,580
I think he's talking about sucking chest wounds.

402
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,060
No, no, no.

403
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,320
There's no sucking chest wound.

404
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,020
That's a tissue of malarkey and lice.

405
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,980
Why one could not breathe, let alone broadcast on the radio with a sucking chest wound.

406
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,940
I don't know what I was thinking.

407
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,140
The...

408
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,140


409
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,340
The lungs are not able to expand, you see.

410
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,240
You hangman rope sneak catcher.

411
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,880
Must have been Justin and Craig.

412
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,120
It's all her fault.

413
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,340
Well, her...

414
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:26,880
She makes my lungs expand, but I never got to expound on the fact that jellyfish are not drinkable.

415
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,380
So the idea that we can just drink jellyfish...

416
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:29,780
Not yet.

417
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,700
But once we put them in this blender, they will be...

418
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,920
In the future, we'll be able to drink everything.

419
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:39,240
Well, you can drink it, but I won't because of the presence of thousands of tiny stinging nematocysts.

420
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,080
The jello-matic.

421
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,420
Stinging.

422
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,120
That's why we put them in the blender.

423
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,100
Blend the manic 3000.

424
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,400
All the way down.

425
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,240
At this speed.

426
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,260
Incredibly painful beverage.

427
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,920
We'd tear these apart at the cellular level.

428
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:55,620
And even if they didn't have painful stingers, it still wouldn't be a good idea because,

429
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:05,560
although it's true that jellyfish contain about 90% water, that water has nearly the same salt content as the ocean.

430
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,060
So you'd be drinking salt water and going insane, as well as getting stung the beaches of South Florida.

431
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,860
But I heard that the most...

432
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,940
The most pointy jellyfish.

433
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,180
The very tiny one.

434
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,220
Well, that's by size, you see, and if there are a whole lot of them.

435
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,680
I heard the scariest alien is a very tiny one.

436
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,020
But I'll take the tiny one over the Portuguese man of war.

437
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,860
Jellyfish maintain the same salt to water ratio as the sea rock.

438
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,800
I heard the funniest...

439
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,740
Well, you could cook them down then, though.

440
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,040
You could distill them.

441
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,580
Or can't you just distill them?

442
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,080
Unlike the air jellyfish of the planet Pandora, the marine variety...

443
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,800
Most X-Day is not X.

444
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,960
If you have a lot of wood...

445
00:19:40,960 --> 00:20:00,620
You could burn the wood, create a fire, put a pot of jellyfish on the fire, put some type of plastic covering on it, enclose it in an enclosed area to capture the gases, and actually distill the gases being put off, which would mostly just be water vapor.

446
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,100
What other kind of gases would you create by cooking down your jellyfish, Dr. Howell?

447
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,520
That's a question I bet you didn't get at the Dr. Howell Institute.

448
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,540
Let's call this one...

449
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,240
This is the Dr. Howell show.

450
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:11,660
I'll have a 1969.

451
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,100
Just present the state of the reading here.

452
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,100


453
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,140
Hey, can we talk about Michael Jackson or is it still too soon?

454
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:31,040
Last night a сообщman Called Messi Cesare started his Imperial journey to December 19.

455
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,500
Came to United Kingdom saying see you Do forced to254 days since 1905.

456
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,380
Wanted to visit Paris to film in Cinémathéon live, a

457
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:32,720
picture shot at 9 o'clock on Jan 29th.

458
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:32,720


459
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:32,720


460
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,100
We thought he was hyped

461
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,620
We'd heard it before

462
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,320
The PR machine dinnnst stop

463
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,920
At my door, the rumour was out

464
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,420
Sources confirmed

465
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,500
That in some distant studio

466
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,100
Alchemy burned

467
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,840
The DJ's acclaimed

468
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,920
I've heard it

469
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,220
Everything changed

470
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,340
He's heard it

471
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,560
Nothing's the same

472
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,740
We've heard it

473
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,480
Everything you know is wrong

474
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,160
Now hey, you

475
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,980
Have you heard

476
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,380
The hottest record in the world?

477
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,040
Hey, you

478
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,620
Have you heard

479
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,300
The hottest song in the world?

480
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,620
Nobody really

481
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,340
Knew what to do

482
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,900
Now everything else was just musical gruel

483
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,520
We packed up our instruments

484
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,180
Packed up our bands

485
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,940
Nobody could top it

486
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,540
The record will stand

487
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,200
At number one

488
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,720
Forever

489
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,540
Rest of the jar

490
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,420
Forever

491
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,360
At number one

492
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,260
Uniquely

493
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,000
Satisfied

494
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,940
Inspiring, every soul

495
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,740
Now hey, you

496
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,560
Have you heard

497
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,840
The hottest record in the world?

498
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,600
Hey, you

499
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,300
Have you heard

500
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,840
The hottest song in the world?

501
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,300
Hey, you

502
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,100
Have you heard

503
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,280
The hottest record in the world?

504
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,080
Hey, you

505
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,880
Have you heard

506
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,360
The hottest song in the world?

507
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:22,080
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

508
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,860
The curious thing, it was never blasé.

509
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,220
Hearing the song once again and again.

510
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,700
Discos and films, adverts and news.

511
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,100
The song fitted every conceivable use.

512
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,540
Of melody

513
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,120
Perfection

514
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,940
Miracle

515
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,280
Reflection

516
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,360
Dream machine

517
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,860
Injection

518
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,640
Everyday we kept on singing

519
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,160
Now, hey you, have you heard

520
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,420
The hottest record in the world?

521
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,860
Hey you, have you heard

522
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,320
The hottest song in the world?

523
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,620
Hey you, have you heard

524
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,100
The hottest record in the world?

525
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,420
Hey you, have you heard

526
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,980
The hottest song in the world?

527
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,800
Our societies fail

528
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,540
In a global collapse

529
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,060
Nothing could cover all the economic gaps

530
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,600
Nobody cared

531
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,240
The song played again

532
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,800
With everybody singing along to their grave

533
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,020
In harmony

534
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:46,700
Forever

535
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,820
In a way

536
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,720
Wherever we were

537
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,200
In heaven

538
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,740
Finally we're all contented now

539
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,640
Hey you, have you heard

540
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,300
The hottest record in the world?

541
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,740
It's just the oath

542
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,480
Hey you, have you heard

543
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,060
The hottest song in the world?

544
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,440
It's not ageld

545
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:12,440


546
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,680
Sisteme

547
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,540
En pahes

548
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,340
Thim

549
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:18,860
A식

550
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,500
Dink

551
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:32,080
Just a word

552
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,300
As a définitive

553
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,060
The Attery Squash

554
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,340
The Attery Squash, of course.

555
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,680
I noticed they have been on Puzzling Evidence Show too, a bunch.

556
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:55,140
They are on Facebook as The-Attery-Squash

557
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,240
and Attery has two Ts, an A and an E and a Y.

558
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,260
And that song reminds me of the computer god.

559
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,600
4 billion worldwide population, all living have a computer god containment policy.

560
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,420
Brain bank brain, a real brain.

561
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,240
In the brain bank cities on the far side of the moon we never see.

562
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,520
Yes, Francis E. Deck.

563
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,400
Yes.

564
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,160
Well, good evening, Dr. Howell.

565
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,200
Oh, there's another one of your fans, Dr. Howell.

566
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,240
Well, you know, he's a faithful adherent of subgenius philosophy.

567
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,140
So he's also one of your fans.

568
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,420
And who is calling?

569
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,020
What?

570
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,700
Governor...

571
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,960
It's Ratnar.

572
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,640
It's a campaign manager.

573
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,540
It's a campaign manager for the Dr. Howell for Congress.

574
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,380
Can I give the web address out?

575
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,520
I will not, sir.

576
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,300
Oh, I don't know if you can give it out.

577
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,140
You might be able to.

578
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,540
Is there any rule against spouting it out on KPFA?

579
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,120
Or is there any money to be made on the far end of that thing?

580
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,200
There better not be.

581
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,260
There's a menace.

582
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:56,900
No money.

583
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,700
As long as you can't make any money.

584
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,220
Absolutely.

585
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,200
I think it may be okay, but it could crash.

586
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:07,200
It might send such a wave of people rushing to that web address that it's going to crash

587
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,280
that company's servers.

588
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:08,500
You know what?

589
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:17,120
I think it's time, with it being 2010, Philo, I think with it being 2010, that we should

590
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,740
see how many people are there listening to Dr. Howell right now who could say, you know

591
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,040
what?

592
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,660
Let's crash Facebook's servers.

593
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,960
Yeah, let's get rid of Nancy Pelosi.

594
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,100
But...

595
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,400
That's...

596
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,780
No, not so much that...

597
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,420
Well, yeah, yeah.

598
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,600
We'll get rid of Nancy Pelosi, but more fun would be to crash the Facebook...

599
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,580
Don't you think it'd be more fun to crash the Facebook servers?

600
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,840
Exactly.

601
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,660
And let's see how many people there are listening in San Francisco right now who will go to their

602
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,200
Facebook right now and go to...

603
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,480
...people in San Francisco...

604
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,020
Wait a minute.

605
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,760
It's tinyurl.com.

606
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,600
...they can vote for...

607
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,040
Flash.

608
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,080
...the people in San Francisco.

609
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,080


610
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,300
...elect Dr. Howell 2010.

611
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,040
All one word, Dr. Howell.

612
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,880
Elect Dr. Howell 2010.

613
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,760
All one word, dot what?

614
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,500
He'll fix up the government and make things better.

615
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,200
Dr. Howell what?

616
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,780
There will be no...

617
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,660
You know when you spell the name in elect Dr. Howell, just spell it D-R.

618
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,180
So vote for Dr. Howell in 2010.

619
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,540
2010.

620
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:21,560


621
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,600
And that's where my...

622
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,660
That's at tinyurl.com.

623
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,280
Tinyurl.com.

624
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,060
And that's where Nancy Pelosi will be.

625
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,060


626
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,060


627
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,060


628
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,180
Tinyurl.com.

629
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,680
My friend.

630
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,340
Dot com.

631
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,020
Dot com.

632
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,520
Slash.

633
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,080
Slash.

634
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:32,380
Keep...

635
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,340
Select Dr. Howell D-R.

636
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,520
Dr. Howell 2010.

637
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:38,940
Let's go.

638
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:38,980
Let's go.

639
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:38,980


640
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,100
Elect D-R. Howell 2010.

641
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,560
Right.

642
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:40,940
Exactly.

643
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,720
You're going to get me into trouble.

644
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,340
It won't work.

645
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,580
Whether he wants it or not.

646
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,200
It's all one word, all one word.

647
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,480
Well, you know, he would get a free issue of Hustler every month.

648
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,380
I think we need a Congress of people that don't want to be there for a change.

649
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,260
Is that a campaign for...

650
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:54,960
Well, Larry Flint.

651
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,040
Larry Flint sends it to every member of Congress, every member of Congress.

652
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,040


653
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,260
Every month.

654
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,220
Oh, yes, I see.

655
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,800
Well, that is a good reason to gain elective office.

656
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:09,320
But, from the rock-bound coast of Maine to the sunny shores of California...

657
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,380
Yeah, plus you got the nice out here.

658
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,740
Well, maybe Larry Flint will go to Pandora and...

659
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,720
Unaccustomed as I am to public speech...

660
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,120
...

661
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:39,960
My head is humming, my wheels are buzzing, I'm out from under you.

662
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:54,140
My teeth are clicking, I'm lying licking, I'm out from under you.

663
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:04,160
Influential you, don't like the things you make me do.

664
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:10,320
You untucked my shirt and you burnt all my ties.

665
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:18,420
Influential you, don't like the things you make me do.

666
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,860
My head went crazy when I told you.

667
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,940
I live here because I was born here.

668
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,540
I don't know why I have always lived here.

669
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,420
Because I was born here.

670
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,480
I don't live here because I was born here.

671
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,080
I don't know why I have always lived here.

672
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:46,020
Now I light my waffles with a pecan nut.

673
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,000
Tastes so much darn better than that old pizza hut.

674
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:53,420
Yeah.

675
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,120
Yeah.

676
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,120


677
00:29:54,140 --> 00:30:00,120
Some may call me nothing but a Waffle House kick.

678
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:07,340
But if I didn't have that franchise I would be sick.

679
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:15,540
Influential you, don't like the things you make me do.

680
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:21,660
You untucked my shirt and you burnt all my ties.

681
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,780
Influential you, don't like the things you make me do.

682
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,880
My head went crazy when I told you lies.

683
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:42,380
And that was also Thigbo Tactic from NegativeLand.com.

684
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,020
And now, the blues.

685
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,840
When I went back to the river.

686
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,000
You could do it and it could be pretty good.

687
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,800
I had a banjo on my knee.

688
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,460
Yes, going to Louisiana.

689
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,200
I had a played a rocker.

690
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,700
I had a fiddle-a-fiddler.

691
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,460
And I diddled a chicken.

692
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,460
The buckwheat cake was in her mouth.

693
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,260
The chicken diddler.

694
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,000
The deer was in her eye.

695
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,380
Well I was playing my fiddle like a guitar.

696
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,120
Driving home.

697
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,440
Did you ever see the devil with his iron spade and shuffle?

698
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,900
I run. When I see the devil I'll run the other way.

699
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:20,980
I run. When I see the devil I'll run the other way.

700
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,440
Do you ever dance with the devil in the day on my mind?

701
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,700
I see the devil coming and I run.

702
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,520
I run. When I see the devil I'll run the other way.

703
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,680
How then was the devil dressed?

704
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,760
Why he was in his Sunday best?

705
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,940
His coat was green and his breeches was blue.

706
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,200
His coat was green and his breeches was blue.

707
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,080
And there was a little hot hotel coming through.

708
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,000
And there was a little hot hotel coming through.

709
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,060
So, Rocknar, are you going to X Day?

710
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,560
Me?

711
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:42,780
Rocknar.

712
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:48,980
Rocknar didn't go to the last two X Days, but he'll probably reappear there.

713
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,640
Rocknar didn't go to the last two X Days, but he'll probably reappear there.

714
00:31:54,300 --> 00:32:04,460
Rocknar didn't go to the last two X Days, but he'll probably reappear there.

715
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,800
Rocknar ran.

716
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:05,920
Me?

717
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,240
Rocknar ran.

718
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,520
She had such problems with her husband.

719
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:07,880


720
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:07,880


721
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,020
I never finished in that chapter.

722
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,920
How did you do that?

723
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,600
Well, he really won't win by doing that.

724
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:12,600


725
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,620
He won two games in two rounds.

726
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,640
Luke Hρεv.

727
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,620
Luke Hρεv's suis乾acter.

728
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:27,220
1947, and the universal number signifying the meeting of a tetrahedron with a sphere,

729
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:33,220
appears in relationship with 21,600, the Earth's circumference.

730
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,620
6.480, one-fourth of the total years it takes Earth to complete one circuit through the

731
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:47,240
signs of the zodiac, and the duration between historic global cataclysms, and 33.33, the

732
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:55,860
latitude point, again, of Mount Hermon, where the prophet Enoch said that the mighty ones

733
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,420
ascended down to Mount Hermon.

734
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:07,760
Well, 33, point 33, is the relationship that is positioned to 2012.

735
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:16,580
And, ladies and gentlemen, this is the boiling point of water because zero has no value,

736
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,220
no value.

737
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:23,380
So, if you take out the zero of 20 and 12, you have 212, which is the boiling point of

738
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,900
this magnificent mystery on Earth, which is water.

739
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:32,480
Remember, it was water that destroyed the Earth, and it was water that saved the Earth.

740
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:39,720
Well, with the combination of water and fire, fire is going to be the destroying factor

741
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,300
in the second event, as it was in the days of Noah, destroyed the water, it saved the

742
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,200
righteous, and it is the sign of the earth.

743
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,440
So, if you take out the zero of 20, you have the same scenario, and the last days will

744
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,640
be destroyed by fire.

745
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,620
The Earth is going to melt.

746
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,480
Now, how do we do that?

747
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,500
Well, it's very easy for dimensional shifts.

748
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:05,280
If the vibration intensifies, and then everything that's not geared to this dimensional shift

749
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,640
that I've talked about, if you're not one of the chosen ones, then you could literally

750
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,460
melt down into a composite of chemicals.

751
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,120
You could just be a little pile.

752
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,020
You could be a little pile of ash laid somewhere, and then be ashes for the righteous feet to

753
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,200
come back later on.

754
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,160
You could be fertilizer for the ground if you're the wicked, and that's basically what

755
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,980
the wicked are made for.

756
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,900
They're made to be destroyed.

757
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:34,300
It's that simple, and yet they rule, and they reign, and they have the authority, and they

758
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,120
rule over us with a rod of iron.

759
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,200
Now, how could they do that?

760
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,340
Because Satan loves evil.

761
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,580
But Bob loves money.

762
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,920
Thanks to Lee Murr for the crazy number guy.

763
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:46,720
And...

764
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:53,580
Did you know that there's a special subgenius crazy number, like 23 is for the Discordians?

765
00:34:53,740 --> 00:35:03,200
Well, the subgenius number is 273, and St. Byron Werner discovered it, and he wrote a

766
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,840
song about it.

767
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:09,960
This is his band, Rural War Room, doing Turn Left at 273.

768
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,520
Turn Left at 273.

769
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,700
273.

770
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,280
273.

771
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,920
273.

772
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,080
My wife hates it.

773
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,620
My wife hates it.

774
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,580
Is that normal?

775
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,980
Is that normal?

776
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:44,980
273.

777
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,700
273.

778
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:46,700


779
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:46,700


780
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:46,700


781
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:46,700


782
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:46,700


783
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:46,700


784
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,000
273.

785
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,000


786
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,360
273.

787
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,900
273.

788
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,360
273.

789
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,100
273.

790
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:01,180
273.

791
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,060
273.

792
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,300
273.

793
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,660
273.

794
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,400
Oh, no.

795
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,440
Oh, no.

796
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,180
No, thanks.

797
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,380
I'm not here to dance.

798
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,760
All right, sir.

799
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,780
Let's switch over to D.

800
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,580
Okay.

801
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,840
Let's have a drink.

802
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,020
Switch over to D.

803
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,040
Oh, no.

804
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,200
Oh, no.

805
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,160
Oh, no.

806
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,740
Oh, no.

807
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,680
Oh, no.

808
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,580
Oh, no.

809
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,840
Oh, no.

810
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,960
Oh, no.

811
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,260
Oh, no.

812
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,420
Oh, no.

813
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:46,960
Oh, no.

814
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:47,980
Oh, no.

815
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:48,980
Oh, no.

816
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,240
Oh, no.

817
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,240


818
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,240


819
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,240


820
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,940
Oh, no.

821
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,640
Oh, no.

822
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,480
Oh, no.

823
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,400
This is Phil Proctor.

824
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,460
And David Osmond.

825
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,860
I'm David Osmond of The Fire Sign.

826
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,280
And we're enjoying listening to the hour of slack.

827
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,140
I'm slacking off myself.

828
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,400
Dr. Hume had quintuple bypass surgery.

829
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,280
He did, did he?

830
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,720
Well, he's an excitable fellow.

831
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,160
He needs to slow down.

832
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:23,560
There's a fan club out there that has all of the Francis E. Decc fans transcribed.

833
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,640
You can go to Francis E. Decc band camp?

834
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,060
It's actually, I'm not...

835
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,780
Let's see, it's...

836
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,040
Francis E. Decc fan club, it says.

837
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,280
Well, I gotta have...

838
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,760
Just do a search for the Francis E. Decc...

839
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,860
Finger on the pulse.

840
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,460
Fan club.

841
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,840
At the original X-Day, I was getting ready to go.

842
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,540
It was at night, you know, and...

843
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,420
Yes, X-Day is at night, yeah.

844
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,660
...and Dr. Hume comes up and he has his arms covered in what looks like blood.

845
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,300
Yeah.

846
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,560
Blood will have blood, they say.

847
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,480
Trees have been known to move in stone.

848
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,300
It was blood.

849
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,840
And you were correct to be scared.

850
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,680
I was.

851
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,280
I was scared.

852
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,120
I'm scared.

853
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,520
Anyway.

854
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:10,160
Well, he told you then about the computerized brain-thinking sealed robot operating arm surgery.

855
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:16,160
Now it's time for the show to mow your mind down like lawnmower boys.

856
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,420
Oh, no!

857
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,760
Sonic 임팬

858
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,100
I'll be your winkie!

859
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,360
I'll be a wankie!

860
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,400
Be cameoing out now!

861
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,720
Be cameoing out now!

862
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,740
Pus excuse me.

863
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,340
Deah.

864
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,300
Oh!

865
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,180
It列実 is watch!

866
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,180

867
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,760
I'm hungry, overdose

868
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
I'm hungry, overdose

869
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,220
Now I'm overdos-a

870
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,420
Overdose-a

871
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,760
Hungry, overdose

872
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,640
Hungry, overdose

873
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,800
Now you're overdose-a

874
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,260
Now you're overdose-a

875
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,740
Hungry, overdose

876
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,100
Overdose

877
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,600
Now you're overdose-a

878
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,520
Overdose-a

879
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,780
Hungry, overdose

880
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,060
Overdose-a

881
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,440
Overdose-a

882
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,060
Overdocile

883
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,880
is the name of that song by Pilgrim Speakeasy.

884
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,120
Somebody new to us, but he's been around for a while, I think.

885
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:34,220
More on that upcoming album at pilgrimspeakeasy.net.

886
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,600
And now, let us breathe.

887
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,860
I want to breathe.

888
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,040
A little light over time.

889
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,180
Who wants to breathe?

890
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,760
You want to breathe?

891
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,000
Huh?

892
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,620
What kind of bread do you say?

893
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,900
I just want to break some glass.

894
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,180
Phineas wants wonder bread, ma'am.

895
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:50,680
I want to do some...

896
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:51,860
You want to breathe?

897
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,580
You want bread, and I want to break glass.

898
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,700
With fly-eye TV cameras watching your whole body,

899
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,100
every part of you is monitored,

900
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,240
even through your Frankenstein controls.

901
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,180
Synthetic blood, synthetic instant sealing flesh and skin,

902
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,980
even synthetic electrical heartbeat to keep you alive.

903
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,260
A brabble.

904
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,340
Some of the unbelievable computer god instant plastic surgery secrets.

905
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,480
There was no show out there on the front here, eh?

906
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:15,940
No.

907
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,500
Well, doctors, I'll bid you adieu.

908
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,500
Oh, you mean that night when I was going to call?

909
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,000
What was that there, Sonny?

910
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,480
No, no.

911
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,860
Are you taking off, Phineas?

912
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,740
I'm not so sure I'm...

913
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,680
I have to go.

914
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,020
...talking to you now.

915
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,000
It's an old-timers disease.

916
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:27,660
I want to take off.

917
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,020
Oh, good night, Phineas.

918
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,300
Good night, Phineas.

919
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,400
Check your email, Phineas.

920
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,740
I need you to call me.

921
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,340
Okay.

922
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,220
I didn't think he was leaving, but...

923
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,000
Or send me your phone number.

924
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,880
I have to relieve myself, so I have to go.

925
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,360
Relieve yourself of the burden of the disease of mortality.

926
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,000
Everyone needs to know about that.

927
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:48,000
Are you feeling kind of grumpy?

928
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,160
Are you in a bad mood?

929
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,040
Are you feeling kind of grumpy?

930
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,040


931
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,040


932
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,040


933
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:03,440
I'm going to reevaluate my terrible diet for every day of the week.

934
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,840
Let's go.

935
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:06,980
Yeah.

936
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,320
Thank you.

937
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,880
Is it on?

938
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:18,200
Yes.

939
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:18,380
It's a record, feeling really tired...

940
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,740
And no shikiboku?

941
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:19,820


942
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,980
On today's video, we're doing a bit of a punishment most common that is a decided

943
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:21,980


944
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:21,980


945
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:21,980


946
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:21,980


947
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:21,980


948
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:21,980


949
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,020
Yeah!

950
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,420
I remember when I met you, you were wearing a different shirt.

951
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,800
And you're playing with your hair by taking a breath.

952
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,800
I'm about to hurt.

953
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,480
That's getting the bagel on my head.

954
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,960
Let me take a lick at it.

955
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,180
Ouch, I bit my toe.

956
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,260
That's getting the bagel on my head.

957
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:38,940
Ow.

958
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,080
Let me take a lick at my head.

959
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,720
You sell more pairs of slacks than anyone I know.

960
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:55,200
You step on tiny shark contacts and have a bleeding toe.

961
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,420
How long has each organ been in a cell?

962
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,720
There was a separate cell to compose your head.

963
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:17,020
I wonder if there's a way to cheer you up.

964
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:17,340
Maybe.

965
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,100
Maybe.

966
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,040
Feeling kind of grumpy.

967
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,140
Are you in a bad mood?

968
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,180
Got an upset stomach.

969
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,940
Think you ate some bad food.

00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:50,920

00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:50,920

00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:50,920


980
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:50,920


981
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,360
But Gesundheit to me, because I did anyway,

982
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,460
Charmed by the beauty of this particular specimen.

983
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:06,240
Yeah, well you should not be probably putting your hands on that in an unseemly way.

984
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,760
I already did.

985
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,760
She seems to be appreciating it.

986
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,620
Yes, well that's a mutual benefit.

987
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:17,700
Dr. Harnik.

988
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,020
Fyla is watching

989
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:23,240
like a flying her own egg or her model

990
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,040
really likes books.

991
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:24,380
Four years ago.

992
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,700
Dr. Harnik and his little Freas

993
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,280
Entre Prut,

994
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,700
she didn't want to get involved with Jelly beans,

995
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,640
just wanted to see how kind she was.

996
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:31,640


997
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:31,640


998
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:31,640


999
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,260
O-oh.

1000
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,240
The young virgin once feeling

1001
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,040
under four on one

1002
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,040


1003
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,040


1004
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,040


1005
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,480
that's probably nothing more than six.

1006
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,680
So they had to find that baby

1007
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,680
and said this was me.

1008
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:47,680


1009
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:47,680


1010
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:47,680


1011
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,480
Players only have a few seconds to select what to do next.

1012
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,720
Madison ends up going to the sexy moan route,

1013
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,500
and the guy decides to give his boss some privacy.

1014
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,980
She then crushes Philo's groin in a vice-like grip

1015
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,800
until he gives up the info.

1016
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,940
That's some good intel.

1017
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,360
Dr. Howell then escapes shaking but unharmed.

1018
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,940
It was a close thing.

1019
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:11,860
Is that on tonight?

1020
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,400
Yes, that's showing tonight on the E3 channel.

1021
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,680
On the Ether channel, on the Ether network.

1022
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:23,100
And suddenly one of Philo's bodyguards knocks on the door and asks,

1023
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,400
Is everything okay?

1024
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,020
He really wants to be paid.

1025
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,960
If you just pay him, you'll get rid of him.

1026
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,940
Gotcha, okay, right. Here's some money.

1027
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,940
I'm just going to go Google myself.

1028
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:38,040
You know, you can't get away with giving that Dick Gregory money away forever.

1029
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,840
That noticed him.

1030
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,120
Dr. Howell heads to the ladies' room to see what he can do

1031
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:45,380
about his life.

1032
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,580
He's not sure about his conservative appearance.

1033
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,340
No, there's just no room for me.

1034
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,980
Using more button prompts, players help him apply makeup,

1035
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,740
undo a couple of blouse buttons,

1036
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,760
and tear off the lower edge of his skirt.

1037
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,840
What's this?

1038
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,840
I don't have a matching handbag,

1039
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,760
and these pumps are so out of style.

1040
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,000
Back outside, his dancing combined with his new appearance

1041
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,120
get Philo's attention.

1042
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,620
He invites him over.

1043
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,700
Hey, Philo, get a load of this.

1044
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,740
I learned this step while I was in the Catskills.

1045
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,380
Very nice.

1046
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,000
Nice, Dr. Howell.

1047
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:17,620
Thanks.

1048
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,460
It was, uh...

1049
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,080
Don't step in that water, though.

1050
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:20,960
It ends up in the water.

1051
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:21,400
That is...

1052
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,960
It ends up in the water, and then your game shorts out,

1053
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,540
and you can't have any fun anymore...

1054
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,960
Oh, I've got another pair of shorts.

1055
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,660
That's not the problem.

1056
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,860
The problem is...

1057
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,300
But just take a look at that sunset.

1058
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,940
It seems to be flickering.

1059
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,600
What's the deal with that flickering sunset?

1060
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,220
It's an atmospheric condition, Philo, that we call...

1061
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,580
Are you sure it's just not LED?

1062
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,860
No, it's no drug.

1063
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,700
What it is, is...

1064
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,080
It's a combination of atmospheric...

1065
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,560
Wait a minute, my pen stopped writing.

1066
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,060
I can't...

1067
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:49,540
Hold on.

1068
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:50,240
Wait.

1069
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,320
What was that third thing you said, Dr. Howell?

1070
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,720
...found in the troposphere of Earth's turbulent atmosphere.

1071
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:03,040
Here, the upper atmosphere squids extend their long, filmy tentacles

1072
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:08,180
through the windows of passing aircrafts to sample the contents.

1073
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,800
If your aircraft is equipped with a rear observation platform,

1074
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,040
you might wish...

1075
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,260
...to close the curtains, as these...

1076
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:23,320
...can be invasive and spoil your vacation in the sky.

1077
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,200
They can spoil a vacation in the sky.

1078
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:30,680
This has been a public service message from the Are You Ready Foundation.

1079
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,780
And now we'll be taking Jesus for a ride.

1080
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:41,880
The minister at our local clinch, according to an old subgenius war story, wasn't happy.

1081
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,320
The reason was that it has happened again.

1082
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:51,260
It was that the baby Jesus had disappeared again from the nativity scene

1083
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,640
out in front of his clench.

1084
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,300
It came from outer space.

1085
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,240
And had been replaced with a baby Bob.

1086
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,480
It rose on trees.

1087
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,060
The minister's patience was wearing thin.

1088
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,700
He'd had enough of this vandalism.

1089
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,880
And he didn't find it amusing any longer.

1090
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,700
Although Jesus never disappeared, he went up to his father's house.

1091
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,980
Get the terror from beyond.

1092
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:15,300
The little red wagon was covered with a moth-eaten sort of blanket.

1093
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:15,380


1094
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,140
The kid ran down the street with his teeny-weeny wagon.

1095
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:22,220
The sidewalk was no longer recognizable as a walking place.

1096
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:27,040
An undifferentiated mass of unrecognizable protoplasm.

1097
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:34,360
Loads of indetestable putrescence as M. Waldemar slouched forward, disintegrating before our eyes.

1098
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:40,060
A pinata of stench as his rotting body exploded all over the carpet.

1099
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,720
What a fetid fever of freedom.

1100
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,380
...his house and dollars.

1101
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:50,220
The soul ascended to the plaintive wail of a funeral violin.

1102
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:56,280
I had never felt so trapped in my life as I had been that time I was trapped inside that time.

1103
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,080
Oh no, not Mr. Parizzi.

1104
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,600
Yes, Mr. Parizzi.

1105
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,560
Oh no.

1106
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,300
Mamma mia.

1107
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,100
He was just trying to protect himself.

1108
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,820
That's what they all say.

1109
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,840
It's been years since I had taken public transportation.

1110
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,300
I'd never lower myself.

1111
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,160
It's just a deadly weapon.

1112
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,760
To that level again.

1113
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,340
Just get a reprimand, like for shoplifting when you've killed another person with an automobile.

1114
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,300
Don't misunderstand me. I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Bob.

1115
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:29,780
Uh, just, uh, get into the witness stand, please.

1116
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,720
I do.

1117
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,840
This chair squeaks.

1118
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:34,860
How's this?

1119
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,760
Squeak, Mrs. Dean.

1120
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:36,940
Oh.

1121
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,020
Oh.

1122
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,020
Good. Very good indeed.

1123
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,080
Uh, you may tell the jury what you saw happen.

1124
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,460
Well, I was just searching my squishy.

1125
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,200
Oh, which one?

1126
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,200
Uh, that one there. Um.

1127
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,900
I see. Uh, continue, please. Go ahead.

1128
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:55,340
Well, I went in the B's, opened my ring, got to the knife, six down the door.

1129
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,780
Then I spread out, just get one open.

1130
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:58,860
How's that front?

1131
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,880
The old foot.

1132
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:00,520
Uh.

1133
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:01,640
Uh-huh.

1134
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:02,600
Uh.

1135
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,740
Well, um, go on.

1136
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:05,760
Well, um.

1137
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,820
That's what I heard.

1138
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,660
And now, once again.

1139
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:10,860
Once again.

1140
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,240
Once again.

1141
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,620
That's all.

1142
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,060
Thank you, Leemurr.

1143
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,000
And coming up from Local Color, the music of the spheres.

1144
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,780
Hit it.

1145
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,200
Hit it.

1146
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,940
You're welcome.

1147
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,200
You're welcome.

1148
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,520
You're welcome.

1149
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,620
Base music.

1150
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,800
Base music.

1151
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,420
.

1152
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:07,840
.

1153
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,200
.

1154
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,640
Ici in Why Not?

1155
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:40,920
Noise.

1156
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,820
It is the music of the spheres.

1157
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,620
Bass music.

1158
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,120
It is the music of the spheres.

1159
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,620
Bass music?

1160
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,880
Well, that's what the robot calls electromagnetic space static.

1161
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,000
And it does sound kind of like music.

1162
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,600
So we were all listening to it.

1163
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,720
Noise is noise.

1164
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,800
It is the music of the spheres.

1165
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,180
It is the music of the spheres.

1166
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,460
Noise is noise.

1167
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,580
It is the music of the spheres.

1168
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,340
Bass music.

1169
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,820
It is the music of the spheres.

1170
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,320
Bass music?

1171
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,640
Noise is noise, not music.

1172
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,020
It's quite obvious you were never programmed for music appreciation.

1173
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:38,200
Well, it does have a nice beat to it.

1174
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,700
Noise is noise, not music.

1175
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:45,760
Bass music.

1176
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,900
Bass music.

1177
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:54,500
The next thing I know, you two will be turning this place into the galaxy of Google or something else.

1178
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,540
Electromagnetic space static.

1179
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,580
It is the music of the spheres.

1180
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,200
Bass music.

1181
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,780
It is the music of the spheres.

1182
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,420
The next thing I know, you two will be turning this place into the galaxy of Google or something else.

1183
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,740
Electromagnetic space static.

1184
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,480
Yes, sir.

1185
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,140
I understand that.

1186
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,300
I understand.

1187
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,120
So, here, that's what these pills are for.

1188
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,820
Now, listen.

1189
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,700
You're pleased to be old, guys.

1190
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,280
He's not shy.

1191
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:32,780
Go ahead.

1192
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,720
Give him the pills.

1193
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:34,460
Take a pill.

1194
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,560
Remind him, you know, he's going to be a good kid.

1195
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:35,560


1196
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:35,560


1197
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:35,560


1198
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:35,560


1199
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:35,780
I just think it's a cool idea.

1200
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:35,780


1201
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:35,780


1202
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:35,780


1203
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:35,780


1204
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:35,780


1205
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,340
Take half a pill, half a pill, another half a pill.

1206
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:39,740
Take these.

1207
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,460
Here, take some water.

1208
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,700
Get another half a pill, yes.

1209
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,820
Half a pill, half a pill, half a pill.

1210
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:50,920
Now, ask him some complicated question or some verse from the Bible,

1211
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,160
something that will make him have to process.

1212
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,980
A foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.

1213
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:03,180
Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child,

1214
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,120
but the rod of correction shall drive it from him.

1215
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,340
But he's an atheist, so that's not going to do any good.

1216
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,540
Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.

1217
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:18,640
He thinks that's just a throwback to man has actually gone farther than that.

1218
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:19,500
He's asked the question.

1219
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,840
Science has disproved it.

1220
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,240
The heavens declare the glory of God, and the thing which shall be shown.

1221
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:32,440
And so we're just like fooling around in this zone we know is a waste of time.

1222
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,160
What do we do?

1223
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:37,680
Are we going to eschew all these external encumbrances

1224
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,960
and move forward with a new approach, a new ethic?

1225
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:50,380
Let's get out of this religious mumbo-jumbo.

1226
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,700
Somehow we've got to get back to metaphysics without religion.

1227
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,080
How can we do that?

1228
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,960
I mean, what's the approach?

1229
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:02,360
How can we keep that and find that new value, that new moral,

1230
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,160
that new truth?

1231
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:03,580
A new ethic.

1232
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,540
Making wise.

1233
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,420
In a post.

1234
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,600
The statutes of the Lord are right.

1235
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:08,680
Delighting.

1236
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,620
Post-religious.

1237
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,240
The commandments of the Lord.

1238
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,120
Commercial world.

1239
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:12,640
Are pure.

1240
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,100
Enlightening the eyes.

1241
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,520
The fear of the Lord is clean.

1242
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,700
How can we do that?

1243
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,040
Enduring forever.

1244
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:18,800
Or should we?

1245
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:19,660
The judgments of the Lord.

1246
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:20,600
Isn't even worth the trip.

1247
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,760
Are true and righteous.

1248
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,140
Speaking of trip.

1249
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,880
More to be desired are they than gold.

1250
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,380
Yea, than much fine gold.

1251
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,980
I just spent seven dollars like it was three dollars.

1252
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:42,140
But i 지금까지ения что.

1253
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:42,140


1254
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:42,140


1255
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:46,060
stal incredible leicht fifty percent get in spite of calm down

1256
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:46,060


1257
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:46,060


1258
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:46,060


1259
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:46,060


1260
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,340
killed

1261
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,340
Thank you.

1262
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,400
Thank you.

1263
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,200
Thank you.

1264
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,600
Thank you.

1265
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,640
Thank you.

1266
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:04,800
Thank you.

1267
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,880
Thank you.

1268
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,520
Thank you.

1269
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,560
Thank you.

1270
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,480
Thank you.

1271
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:17,500


1272
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:17,500


1273
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:17,500


1274
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,980
That does it, Mike. You want them held?

1275
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,460
Nah, send them back to their coffee cups.

1276
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,120
Alright, that'll be all.

1277
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:23,720
