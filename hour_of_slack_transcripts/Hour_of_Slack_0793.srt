1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
I keep feeling and I hear shuffling noises all about me.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,220
Shuffling?

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,220
Well, not exactly.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,120
More like little sucking noises.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,240
You know, a...

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,120
Well, that's great.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,480
All right.

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,940
Praise time.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,360
Thank you.

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,980
You missed it, people.

11
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,680
If you missed it, this is what you missed.

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,800
There was dancing, naked, crazy women wearing nothing but neon.

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,260
There was a giant 20-foot-tall neon man staggering around,

14
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,900
a huge robot from outer space, an incredible live show, and this!

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,960
Nature.

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,480
Nature has a way sometimes of reminding man of just how small he is.

17
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,340
She occasionally throws up the terrible offsprings of our pride and carelessness

18
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,320
to remind us of how puny we really are in the face of a tornado,

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,140
an earthquake,

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,240
or a Godzilla.

21
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,240
The reckless ambitions of man are often dwarfed by their dangerous consequences.

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,500
For now, Godzilla,

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,100
that's all.

24
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,100


25
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,100


26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,200
The strangely innocent and tragic monster has gone to Earth.

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,520
Whether he returns or not, or is never again seen by human eyes,

28
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,560
the things he has taught us remain.

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,520
But back here at the duplication hall,

30
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,100
the muffled sounds were driving me.

31
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,380
Driving us.

32
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:12,700
No more.

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,980
Driving us mad.

34
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,840
They were driving us mad.

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,500
The input.

36
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,680
It goes into analog.

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,720
That's exactly what it's for.

38
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,140
That's what it's for.

39
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,760
And now,

40
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,240
here at the Victory Theater,

41
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,220
on Buena Vista Court,

42
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,380
in beautiful Chamfrom Rock in Cisco,

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,680
the night of Clarabelle,

44
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,560
the dingweasel people,

45
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,020
and the shouting,

46
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,540
the dancing wizards,

47
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,220
singing in perfect unison

48
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,360
for your indecent delays

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,120
and your artistic miscreants.

50
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,860
You know, I can't tell if you're being very simple or very complex.

51
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,940
The Eloi have all we need.

52
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,940
We have no use for your questions.

53
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,400
But how long have you had all this?

54
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,640
And don't you have to work for it?

55
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,100
I don't know.

56
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,300
Work?

57
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,060
Work?

58
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:14,620
Work.

59
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:14,800
Work.

60
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,540
Work.

61
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:15,800
Work.

62
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,060


63
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,760
Toil.

64
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,540
Doing things you don't want to do in order to do the things you do want to do.

65
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,920
I don't understand.

66
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,020
Well, you know, somehow I don't either.

67
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,780
This was a land and time of plenty.

68
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,020
And yet,

69
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,080
we're still here.

70
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,900
Yet they had no appreciation for it.

71
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,680
They knew nothing of labor, tension, or war.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,100
The very food they ate was provided by nature's bounty.

73
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,740
Fruit, by the way, seemed to be the Eloi's only diet.

74
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,620
The people of the remote future

75
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,220
will be strict vegetarians.

76
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,360
But what else of our future was I to glimpse,

77
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,760
as the days passed?

78
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,640
Yeah, Becky?

79
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:12,620
I've been staring out this porthole for the last 25,000.

80
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,840
Creepy Clown also lives in Mojo World now.

81
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,960
Creepy Clown managed to get into my wedding.

82
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,040
Did you see that he appeared briefly on stage?

83
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,540
No.

84
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,500
Yeah, there's a photograph of our lovely wedding.

85
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,620
It's Princess Wee and the preacher and me and those two little boys standing there.

86
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,160
And Creepy Clown's back in the shadows waiting.

87
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,360
I took many photos and I saw no Creepy Clown.

88
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,520
I got confused because the wedding was down on Deck 4 and I went to Deck 3.

89
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,700
Well, that's where they were having the planters.

90
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,400
Got stuck there in the seminars.

91
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,680
Well, once they get you inside, you can't really get out,

92
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,980
especially when they're trying the new material on your cerebral cortex.

93
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,680
I'm sorry, what?

94
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,380
Can you tell by the gravity, though, the difference in the gravity between the two decks?

95
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,400
We were looking for a place that had a lot of light and happy type stuff coming out of it.

96
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,220
There were so many concourses.

97
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,220
We were blistered one place.

98
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,960
We got through and the spinal monkeys actually ripped all of our hair and set us on fire.

99
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,480
And so then it was another half an hour trying to get to Level C.

100
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,200
What was it again?

101
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,440
Three?

102
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:16,900
C.

103
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,500
DNA Level C.

104
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,240
DNA Level C for the consummation of your zygote there.

105
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,420
Yeah, Deck C.

106
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,960
And what a decked out affair it was, too.

107
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,680
I remember the pumpkin spread.

108
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,600
I stole some and took it home to my dog.

109
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,580
And I remember the one.

110
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,200
What was his name?

111
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,940
His name was Father Flagelist, who tried to beat the onions out of you before the beginning of the display.

112
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,780
Those guys in the suits have been out there, like, for a long time.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,220
I think they're working on something.

114
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,760
I think they're just, I think they fropped up and they're just floating around.

115
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,340
Well, look, yeah, that's what that one guy's got in his hand.

116
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,080
It's not a tool.

117
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,040
It's like a little Dobbs pipe.

118
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,700
So they just wanted to get away from the rest of the people near the concourse.

119
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,340
Man, I can't believe this place just goes on and on and on.

120
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,020
It's, you know, from one different...

121
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,820
It never does stop, no.

122
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,100
It's a room that, you know, has colors that you never saw before.

123
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,280
And then suddenly you're smelling the band, unfortunately.

124
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,560
Most of them haven't shaved in a couple years.

125
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,040
And they can keep adding on to the thing indefinitely.

126
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,840
The constructions out here can eventually...

127
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,180
Oh, look, he is.

128
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,060
He's going too fast.

129
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,460
He's going to hit the side of the ship.

130
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,760
Hey, I heard there's parts of the ship where, like, that really can hurt.

131
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,940
Their own civilization.

132
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,900
That can hurt, man.

133
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,220
Oh, man.

134
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,680
You think he's going to make it now?

135
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,480
Yeah, he's all right.

136
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,460
I hope it doesn't make him.

137
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,860
Oh, is that Roger out there?

138
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,580
Who, Roger?

139
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,580
Yeah, they keep...

140
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,680
They keep saying his name over and over.

141
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,200
Yeah, they're looking for him, I guess.

142
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,320
A lot of people wonder what happened to Roger Haley, and here he is.

143
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,980
Is it true that there's...

144
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,000
He's been with us all along, too.

145
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,840
That there's parts of the ship that, you know, like, other...

146
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,660
Nobody knows about, and the people have lived there so long,

147
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,340
they don't know of other parts of the ship.

148
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,380
It's like lost worlds within the ship itself.

149
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,800
Have you heard those rumors?

150
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,100
There were some experimental zygotes implanted in some areas,

151
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,900
just to see if life could form in that kind of environment,

152
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,300
and I don't know.

153
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,200
Like the walking bowling ball pins or the arguing trees?

154
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,580
Are you talking about those places?

155
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,340
Well, the ones they implanted down by the engine housing and stuff.

156
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,040
Oh, man.

157
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,560
I didn't know they had something going down there.

158
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,820
Like, life can't even...

159
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,760
If you walk down there, you'll get destroyed.

160
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,920
You know, you would be dead in a couple of seconds from the radiation.

161
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,340
But they've implanted them zygotes down there to see if they would survive.

162
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,860
And apparently a few of them have.

163
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,820
I don't... I guess.

164
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,480
So, like, they are radiation resistant, or they're actually radioactive now?

165
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,220
They don't even...

166
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,980
I don't know. I don't...

167
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,560
They're growing some great chronic down there. I know that.

168
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:47,840
Yeah.

169
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,500
They're supposed to do that.

170
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,300
I mean, isn't that part of the contract?

171
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,480
Or does it...

172
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,640
No, they're not supposed to.

173
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,000
You're supposed to have to buy that from the conspiracy.

174
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,100
They're not supposed to be there.

175
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,720
No, you're not supposed to urinate there.

176
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,160
Yeah.

177
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,700
Big Brother is getting very, very, very big.

178
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,040
Can you hear?

179
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,580
Shut in the radiation chambers down now.

180
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,920
All the plants are going sleepy.

181
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,840
Thank God they don't have, like, you know, like...

182
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,020
Like they had back on Earth, you know, the place with those heat detection sensors.

183
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,680
They can go by your house and tell if you're going in the bathroom too long on a cold night.

184
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,200
That was crazy.

185
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,200


186
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:33,720
Creepy clown.

187
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,840
Just called me.

188
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,320
That was a creepy man.

189
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,240
If it was a man.

190
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,980
In any sense that we might call him human.

191
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,640
I bring you light in a rice pudding made for a new human with extra appendages.

192
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,980
This is...

193
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,500
Aranceha of Maverick.

194
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,260
Yes, it's true that the machines came from Heaven

195
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,880
in a first shipment in the rockets.

196
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,040
And if you think they're used too much, you can complain elsewhere.

197
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,780
They are holy instruments of instruction.

198
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,600
From here in the headquarters.

199
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,820
We could be what we really are.

200
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,400
Humans together, subject to the trauma of birth and the fear of death,

201
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:48,460
to pain and loneliness, disease and loss, ecstasy and terror.

202
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,800
We could accept our vulnerability, which would allow us to feel it,

203
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,260
and that in turn would help us to feel all of what we have to deny

204
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,780
when we try to be invulnerable, impregnable, consider the root of that word.

205
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,720
THE END

206
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,680
My fiery friend, are you feeling better?

207
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,100
I think a plutonium injection and a shot of steam in the right place will wake you up.

208
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,820
Hey, we're on our way. We're only three and one half blocks.

209
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:10,060
Right now, from the Ericksonian Glass High Security Art Compound,

210
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,460
they have not found me yet. Thank goodness.

211
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,340
I'm still just a nameless building with a cow skull and cross glass cutters over the front door,

212
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,000
as far as the local art police are concerned.

213
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,420
Oh, there's one of their cars.

214
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,240
You heard that young girl scream?

215
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,260
She was...

216
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,640
thought to be an artist, also.

217
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,340
The moth that flies into a flame and instantly frizzles into a heap of protoplasmic sludge,

218
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,500
so the collars are burned and seared by the blistering truth revealed over the air

219
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,460
by the doctors of precision.

220
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,260
Oh, yes, dear friends.

221
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,800
I'm not a doctor.

222
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,320
I'm a doctor.

223
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,840
I'm a doctor.

224
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,900
I'm a doctor.

225
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,460
I'm a doctor.

226
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm a doctor.

227
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,060
And let me tell you, friends,

228
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,400
it's not just the swelling coffers of the elder bankers.

229
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,440
It's not just the truncated detention spans of the conspiracy glorks,

230
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,940
scrambling to get that ever-elusive status symbol.

231
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,620
It's not just the vapid shells of the chicken-like models

232
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,420
posing on cue.

233
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,080
It's not just the puppet rock idols playing into the hands of the Hellspawned image consultants.

234
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,780
It's not just the cannibal zombies gorging themselves on self-interest.

235
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,040
It's not just the video pigs wallowing in visual sludge.

236
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,480
It's not just the mellow morons stuck in a time zone from the good old days, mon.

237
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,580
It's not just the aerobic airheads working themselves into a cardiac arrest.

238
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,540
It's not just the talentless pigs,

239
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,820
the tanks hooked into a groove devoid of style.

240
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,800
It's not just the fuzzy dice brains rampaging like the Visigoths.

241
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,220
It's not just the misguided gummy space creatures.

242
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,980
It's not just the oppression of the raging slavs of the lame leftists.

243
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,440
It's not just the frothy mouths of the reactionaries.

244
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,220
It's not just the blank food tubes slamming their craniums against the walls of their own creation.

245
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,280
It's not just the empty youth culture

246
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,140
borrowing from the ABC computerized format of possible personas.

247
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,080
It's that and a whole lot more.

248
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,780
Thank you, Sister Chris. We love you.

249
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,440
I saw one of those TV shows that has America's most fascist, home-hilarious cop abuses.

250
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,320
Oh, those are great.

251
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,360
And it was, I gotta admit, it was pretty funny.

252
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:59,040
This cop had pulled over this sort of a buck-toothed hayseed poe-bucker,

253
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,260
just got in town, jacked.

254
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,300
He was a little bit of a gasper, sort of a feller talk, kind of like me.

255
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,440
They love them newcomers.

256
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:09,680
And on the vid, there was a cop and a video cameraman talking to this guy.

257
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,860
And the cop's going, sir, I suspect that you've been smoking marijuana.

258
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,140
Now, do you know why I would suspect that?

259
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,260
And the guy's going, I don't know.

260
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,500
The whole time he's got this joint in his ear, right behind his ear.

261
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,680
The cameraman, of course, zooms in on it.

262
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,160
And, you know,

263
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,140
uh, uh,

264
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:38,460
it embarrassed me, you know, to see that pot smoker look so very, very dumb.

265
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,560
Because I know it was the beers he had.

266
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,760
And he admitted to the beers.

267
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,300
He said, well, I did just have a couple of beers before I came out here.

268
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,540
But I don't know why you'd think I'd be smoking dope.

269
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,560
And the cop finally points to the joint behind the guy's ear.

270
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,960
And he goes, well, now, when I didn't even smoke it,

271
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,260
now I ain't gonna get a chance to smoke it.

272
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,280
If I'd have been smoking it, why would it be?

273
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,760
Well, darn.

274
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,980
That's right, too.

275
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:08,980
Wasn't it?

276
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,940
Yes, friends.

277
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,700
The idea.

278
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,140
Right.

279
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,840
Right, right, right.

280
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:19,400
The next time you eat a hamburger, don't just eat the hamburger.

281
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:27,120
Pull the damn joint out from under your ears and smoke him in remembrance of you.

282
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,920
Ah, yes.

283
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:44,300
And then when you have truly remembered you, pick pieces off of yourself, pull yourself into little tiny bits and let the seeds roll away.

284
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:52,720
And then kind of fluff yourself over into that huge bowl of Bob's giant pipe and let him smoke you.

285
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,080
And as you become the molecules coursing down and hitting you.

286
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,100


287
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,920
And as little airy viola bubbles in his lungs.

288
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,900
And as you enter Bob's bloodstream.

289
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,120
And as the essence of you becomes that which is interfering with Bob's rational thought.

290
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,280
Don't forget.

291
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,420
Don't forget what you owe Bob at that moment.

292
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,400
You owe Bob more than the air you breathe.

293
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:27,100
You owe Bob the liquid you reconvert into spatial D-cells and brain signals like this.

294
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,620
Like those shown in Mom's Decembered head.

295
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,400
She wanted to be Miss January, but look at her now.

296
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,920
Frozen.

297
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,440
Under a three-foot sheet of ice.

298
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,880
That was a very lackluster performance on your part, Larry.

299
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,120
I think we can cure that easily.

300
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,240
Ha!

301
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,680
Here we go.

302
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,080
Look at the monkeys and the...

303
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,080


304
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,120
Dwarves and midgets.

305
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,240
And the bears.

306
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,700
And the pigs.

307
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,660
And the normals.

308
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,320
And the subgeniuses all running around.

309
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:03,900
I can see them now.

310
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,060
As if they were right in front of me sweating and farting like the other circus animals.

311
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,400
God almighty, I love the circus.

312
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,260
The smell of the peanuts.

313
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:19,140
The quaint, piquant aroma of the dead chef.

314
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,140
God, I love the circus.

315
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,060
If I could just make cattle perhaps live one wish, it would be to have a circus.

316
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,860
That would be to be in the circus always, front row, center, and what?

317
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,620
A mass ceremony.

318
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,820
I'm afraid, Monsieur, you have failed.

319
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,120
You have failed the test miserably.

320
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:49,840
You have taken a very, very detailed log of your activities and your motor responses.

321
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,380
You are what we might call a spud animal.

322
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,800
Hey, you little spud man.

323
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,920
You little silly spud people.

324
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,280
You would do no of the roots of ice.

325
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,580
How can he see in any one direction?

326
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,060
Dirty, dirty little animal.

327
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,640
He's like a swollen piece of flesh that has no use.

328
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,320
A fudger.

329
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,500
Dirty, dirty, dirty.

330
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,740
Steve, Dr. Dog, we're ready to tee off now.

331
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:34,320
Those of you who haven't watched are going to have to go back and hit the...

332
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,700
.

333
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,220
.

334
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,880
.

335
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,740
.

336
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,440


337
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,440


338
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,440


339
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,440


340
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,440


341
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,440


342
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,440


343
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,440


344
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,960
.

345
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,540
.

346
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:43,540


347
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:43,740
.

348
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:43,880
.

349
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,340
.

350
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:47,340


351
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:47,780
.

352
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,940
.

353
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,180
.

354
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,560
.

355
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,620
.

356
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,700
.

357
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,020
.

358
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,560
.

359
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,620
.

360
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:17,660
.

361
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:17,920
.

362
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,500
.

363
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,780
Once again I call on you, Vellmavia

364
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,400
Come one more time, my trusted aide

365
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,840
Join me and my beloved

366
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,540
For we have work to do

367
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:48,220
To bring her back to life

368
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:18,200
To bring her back to life

369
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:48,200
To bring her back to life

370
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:18,200
To bring her back to life

371
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:33,920
To bring her back to life

372
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,200
Vellmavia

373
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:48,200
To bring her back to life

374
00:22:48,220 --> 00:23:18,200
To bring her back to life

375
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:43,080
To bring her back to life

376
00:23:48,220 --> 00:24:00,800
To bring her back to life

377
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:46,620
To bring her back to life

378
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,780
To bring her back to life

379
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:48,020
To bring her back to life

380
00:25:48,220 --> 00:26:14,200
To bring her back to life

381
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:48,200
To bring her back to life

382
00:26:48,220 --> 00:27:18,200
To bring her back to life

383
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:48,200
To bring her back to life

384
00:27:48,220 --> 00:28:14,660
To bring her back to life

385
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:48,200
To bring her back to life

386
00:28:48,220 --> 00:29:18,200
To bring her back to life

387
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:47,060
To bring her back to life

388
00:29:48,220 --> 00:30:18,160
To bring her back to life

389
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,980
To bring her back to life

390
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,580
To bring her back to life

391
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:41,440
To bring her back to life

392
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,300
May we hear our song.

393
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,780
Let's hear it.

394
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,820
I already know your name

395
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,980
All your nonsense to your heart

396
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,900
But for your mouth you slay

397
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,680
There's no time to understand

398
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,740
Your mind is much too late

399
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,000
So bow your head

400
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,280
Bow your head

401
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,700
Bow your head

402
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,720
Bow your head

403
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Bow your head

404
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,060
Bow your head

405
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,080
The music in the air

406
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,320
These

407
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:32,660
is the music you see

408
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,640
Don't try to change your mind

409
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,760
It's much too hard to understand

410
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,040
I will lift you up

411
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,220
With all my strength

412
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,220
With everything

413
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,540
I'll take us right away

414
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,780
For your song

415
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,980
I will lift you up

416
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,160
With all my strength

417
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,680
I'll take you right away

418
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,520
For your song

419
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,220
For your song

420
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,260
For your song

421
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,200
You're small Н European

422
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:56,200


423
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,580
It's so sweet

424
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,800
I'll take you right away

425
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:04,800


426
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:04,800


427
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:04,800


428
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:04,800


429
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,340
With all my strength

430
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,720
With everything

431
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:06,720


432
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:06,720


433
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,000
For your song

434
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,220
For your song

435
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,700
Thank you.

436
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,640
Thank you.

437
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,900
Thank you.

438
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,580
Thank you.

439
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,160
Thank you.

440
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,820
Thank you.

441
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,140
Thank you.

442
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,520
Thank you.

443
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,240
Thank you.

444
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,340
Thank you.

445
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,140
Thank you.

446
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,080
Huge and beautiful colors, pink and blue and yellow.

447
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,860
The ex-president erects ears are going, look, they're becoming pointy like the horns are his.

448
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,360
For three years now since my discharge from the army, I have prospered little.

449
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,720
Man, he's pretty old.

450
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,900
Oh, look, his discharge is just going on.

451
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Up and down the land, we linger in a depression.

452
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,800
Talk about his discharge.

453
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,680
We must compromise or we flounder.

454
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,520
Compromise or flounder.

455
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:53,880
Shall we flounder together on the slippery slopes of flounderhood?

456
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,860
Or these we bow down before J.R. Bob Dobbs.

457
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,240
In search of slack and in faith.

458
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,140
In ex-day.

459
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,620
In ex-day.

460
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,020
That is the psychic command.

461
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,440
I messed it up.

462
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,480
It is.

463
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,500
Sing praises of Satan.

464
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:24,600
We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice,

465
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,140
ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense,

466
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,040
promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our prosperity,

467
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:41,960
we kiss general warfare and support the party of racers that your mom and dad gave us.

468
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:46,460
Thank you, Mr. President.

469
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,620
Thank you, Mr. President.

470
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:47,820
Wonderful.

471
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,080
Thank you, Mr. President.

472
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,080


473
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,080


474
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,080


475
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,360
It's really glad.

476
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:57,280
I mean, we're so glad to see that you're still pulling air, as we'd like to say.

477
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,060
If we could say anything, this is all a psychic conversation.

478
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,200
He remembers doing that?

479
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,180
New York.

480
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:09,860
He probably remembers doing grander things than he ever really did.

481
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,180
Thirteen years ago.

482
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,860
Someday, on the concourse near the White House,

483
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,240
we will step up to Ronald Reagan.

484
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,440
He will be a great leader.

485
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:19,560
He will be a great leader.

486
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:19,560


487
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:19,560


488
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:19,560


489
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:19,560


490
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,500
A gigantic, frozen palace, a mortuary,

491
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,460
dedicated, consecrated to the man who saved us from the communist threat.

492
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,100
With one bold Argyle sock thrust forward,

493
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,000
and one hand on a lathered-up breast,

494
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,640
he sang the praises of America.

495
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,720
Are you talking about Mr. T?

496
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,040
I'm talking about Ronald Reagan.

497
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,640
Ooh, five dollars a pair.

498
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,100
Have you been to Reagan's tomb?

499
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,560
Ah, Jesus Christ, yeah.

500
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:47,800
Yeah.

501
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:47,880
Yeah.

502
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,160
Yeah.

503
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:48,440
Yeah.

504
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:48,500
Yeah.

505
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:48,500


506
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:48,500


507
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:48,500


508
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,300
Hot dogs down there.

509
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
The Chabrette hot dogs.

510
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,760
Any Pasoini hot burns.

511
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,820
It's a pyramid, right?

512
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,720
Reagan's pyramid?

513
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,720
Well, I guess they've just finished the last part now.

514
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,500
...the confederate...

515
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,060
I like the Raygun shot they got there, man.

516
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,540
How can a gun depend on the collective will of its states?

517
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,340
I'm stuck in Ronald Reagan's mortuary underwear suit.

518
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,240
I do not see how it can work.

519
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,080
I can't get the wrinkles out.

520
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,020
Do not see how it can work.

521
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,660
Do you hear that?

522
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,820
I can feel these little swastikas.

523
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:18,500
I can't see.

524
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:18,500


525
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:18,500


526
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,540
20 years.

527
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,340
August.

528
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:21,940
Reinforcement.

529
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,060
Old Granny Gate.

530
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,700
The artists are the evil ones.

531
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,900
Subliminal Command 45.

532
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,840
The artists are the evil ones.

533
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,860
The artists are the evil ones.

534
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,680
Gentleman Johnny Burgoyne has taken Fort Ticonderoga.

535
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:43,940
Well, I think a Jerry Springer-ish episode of the West Wankers would be perhaps to have the two daughters,

536
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,980
much beyond that's here's my hair bush.

537
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,860
Well, you think they're doing it with George W.?

538
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,980
That the girls are doing it with George W.?

539
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,880
Yeah, there's a big incest.

540
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,740
In the old Southern tradition of keeping it all in family.

541
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,980
Family taboo website being launched from the White House now.

542
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,260
I just thought that that'd be pretty hot.

543
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,800
Like Twin Peaks inside the White House right now.

544
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,680
They both have a pair of shalogies on them that will not quit.

545
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,500
They put up solid.

546
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,560
They will not come down.

547
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,900
He is George, eager for fun.

548
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,120
Hockey or imaginary guitar.

549
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,040
Get a good job.

550
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,400
Joe did.

551
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:15,920
Happy.

552
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,360
I know.

553
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:23,860
On the day shift at the utility muffin research kitchen.

554
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:33,860
Arrogantly twisting the sterile canvas snoot of a fully charged icing anointment utensil.

555
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:40,680
And every time a nice little muffin comes by on the belt, he boots forth.

556
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,320
Jazz, you're confusing the issue.

557
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,700
That music.

558
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,080
That music.

559
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:46,980
That music.

560
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,120
Big trouble.

561
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:57,760
They thought that either you or I or the Reverend Stagg was somehow the erudite and the gooprious Franco Zappa.

562
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:02,860
A man for all seasonings and well concealed in his own apologies.

563
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,040
New York.

564
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:11,280
New York.

565
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,000
City of doom.

566
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,240
What a bloody mess of Freeman's Farm.

567
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,920
What a bloody mess.

568
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,500
New York.

569
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,620
What a bloody mess.

570
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,400
New Sherman, New York.

571
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,580
What a bloody mess.

572
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,740
What a bloody mess.

573
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,220
What a bloody mess.

574
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,100
Eight days away.

575
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,840
Nine, seven, six, five, four, three, two.

576
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,640
Hey, hey.

577
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,140
Give me a piece of that.

578
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:40,900
Rockets away.

579
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,880
Hey, I was a war veteran.

580
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,340
Come on.

581
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:43,860
Hey, hey.

582
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:44,460
Come back here.

583
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,320
I was in the non-main.

584
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,200
I was in R3.

585
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:47,920
Where were you?

586
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,320
You were playing with your ass.

587
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,740
Why you were smoking that shit?

588
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,440
Hey, come back here.

589
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:52,960
What are you going to do?

590
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,940
I don't like life.

591
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,840
I've been able to move my leg for the last 32 years.

592
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,300
Thinks it's a joke.

593
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,740
I could use my mind, though, to make my foot move.

594
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,060
And someday I'm going to be able to fly.

595
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,440
I'm going to pick this wheelchair up.

596
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,380
That's what I'm going to do.

597
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,600
I'm going to fly right over the East River.

598
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,860
And I'm going to drop a few bombs.

599
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,060
On that old lady's house.

600
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:16,860
Yeah.

601
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,400
30 years, but I still remember that bitch.

602
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:20,560
Hey, hey.

603
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,200
Who you calling a bitch?

604
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,940
I hate Bob.

605
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:30,300
My Bob made my daddy go crazy.

606
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:35,280
My daddy used to make money, but now he just sits around all day.

607
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:36,380
Huh.

608
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,540
I hate Bob.

609
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,600
He's a bad man.

610
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,840
I wish he would die.

611
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,200
He's probably the most terrible guy.

612
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,220
My kid's name's Slap, too.

613
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,380
Mike.

614
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:54,640
A classroom is something you know.

615
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,940
I wish wand were the only bad funny story on Earth, which chance I got to blackmail a

616
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:56,940


617
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:56,940


618
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:56,940


619
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:56,940


620
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:56,940


621
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:56,940


622
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:56,940


623
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:56,940


624
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,580
Go to bed like another child who just got their

625
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,680
sets straightened out, mi amor...

626
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:58,760
... grind people.

627
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,540
Do you want to know how long I

628
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:04,720
went to sleep?

629
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:11,880
이

630
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,600
It wasn't hot, right?

631
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,340
That's right.

632
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:14,360
Why don't we grow all the might all together

633
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,020
and protect ourselves?

634
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,980
I mean, I don't think I can keep up with it.

635
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,620
I mean, it's like there's two sections.

636
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,440
These are celebrities coming to me.

637
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,920
These weird magazines.

638
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,560
These characters that show up at the door.

639
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,820
These take your medication.

640
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,320
And they want to know things.

641
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,120
They want to know what's going on in their lives.

642
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,020
What should I do?

643
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,600
What should I do about this?

644
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:35,860
What about my girlfriend?

645
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,380
My girlfriend, they wouldn't know what we were talking about.

646
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,860
What should I do, man?

647
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,740
I don't know.

648
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,240
Relax.

649
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,180
I'll tell you what you should do.

650
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,400
It's like doctoring yourself.

651
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,360
Do this.

652
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,080
No head-launching, doctor.

653
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,720
Oh, take the pills.

654
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,880
Light the fire.

655
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,700
Oh, try some of this false slack.

656
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:03,380
But we can't talk about that because it would leave this station open to libel and slander.

657
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,840
That's our lawyer now.

658
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:06,720
Oh, my God, he's in.

659
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,760
I feel much better now.

660
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,000
Oh, man.

661
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,700
That's because Bob sent this for you.

662
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,020
We should live in cities on our own filth.

663
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,320
Oh, we tried that.

664
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,520
That's so 14th century, Dave.

665
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,680
That's so 1400.

666
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,180
Man, I'm so pashay.

667
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,060
You know, living like back in the 14th, like the 15th century, man.

668
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,640
Yeah, right.

669
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,520
Well, the plane walked out half the humans.

670
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,340
You have that going for it.

671
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,980
Cans and pieces of plastic.

672
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:40,460
Half the humans.

673
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,620
This was the sound of it.

674
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,440
We got it on tape.

675
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,020
Feel the drill.

676
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,600
The nose drill.

677
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,520
It hurts more.

678
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,020
It just keeps getting louder.

679
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,820
Oh, my ears.

680
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,160
My ears.

681
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:08,940
Thanks, Bob.

682
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,160
Oh, my ears.

683
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,180
I'm looking at you.

684
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,620
I'm looking at you.

685
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,040
Thanks, Bob.

686
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,980
Oh, I can't stand it.

687
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,680
Another second.

688
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,760
More, more, more.

689
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,660
Oh, I see it's back.

690
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:19,680
I'm being ruptured.

691
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,080
Almost done there.

692
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,740
And it feels so good.

693
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,160
Now spit out of your ears.

694
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,380
And you turn it off.

695
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,940
Let your ears drill in the cup now.

696
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:27,960
Just when you get a breath.

697
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,880
My ears are beating.

698
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,600
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

699
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:35,900
Killing me.

700
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,380
Don't stop, Bob.

701
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,980
I hate this.

702
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:41,920
Don't stop.

703
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,620
Don't stop.

704
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,140
Oh, I can't.

705
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,920
Hey, I'm losing it.

706
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,060
I'm losing it.

707
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:46,660
I've got to look well.

708
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,420
I'm going to go to bed.

709
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,160
I've got to look well.

710
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:48,640
I'm going to go to bed.

711
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:48,880
Oh!

712
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,420
Don't bring it up.

713
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,180
Don't let yourself go.

714
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:52,940
Don't worry about it.

715
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,760
This is the worst thing that's ever happened.

716
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,400
God is fair.

717
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,060
God.

718
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,760
Bob, I want to pay extra for that.

719
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,840
And for those of you who want to know what I was playing tonight,

720
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,600
it was all on tape, so I wasn't cutting in and telling you.

721
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:11,980
You're just going to have to write for information from the Church of the Subgenius.

722
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,420
That's right.

723
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:19,620
You, friend, are going to have to dare having your address on our mailing list.

724
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:28,060
Do you know what sort of government agencies get hold of our mailing list, whether we know it or not?

725
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,480
A? I don't either.

726
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,020
But anyway, you need to write to Bob, friends.

727
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,360
Write to Bob at the Church of the Subgenius.

728
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,800
And here comes that P.O. Box number, friends.

729
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:46,320
P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

730
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:48,680
Huh!

731
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,600
Oh, yes, friends.

732
00:49:53,440 --> 00:50:05,240
Yes, and you can also check out, in the more modern day than that ancient post office box show, www.subgenius.com.

733
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,700
Or you can write to me.

734
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,780
It's staying at subgenius.com.

735
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:20,280
For those stuck on Earth, friends, for lack of $30, I hope you've enjoyed this show.

736
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,300
I'm sure I'm off planet by now.

737
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:26,360
Thanks for listening, though, all these years.

738
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:34,540
And special thanks, friends, special thanks to Reverend David Bauchner for MP3-ing these shows

739
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,780
and for forcing them onto the Internet the right way.

740
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:46,160
And to Prostata Cantata for helping to make that possible, as well as Sensory Research, friends.

741
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:52,200
Sensory Research, who makes the real audio versions of the show possible.

742
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:59,360
For those listeners and those co-producers, I don't know how to repay you.

743
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:06,500
I really don't, except to just keep on trying to spread that mighty...

744
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,880
Wheelbarrow full of Bob across the barren plains of America.

745
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,500
Yes, Doctor.

746
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,140
Do-do.

747
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,560
My name is Vivian Spud, and I've got something I'd like to ask you, Doctor.

748
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,740
Well, don't just stand there, boy.

749
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,480
Ask away, and we'll try to answer your question.

750
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:29,260
Well, something has always puzzled me ever since I was a beast back in Indiana, Doctor.

751
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,780
Why does the porcupine where its eggs are?

752
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:37,340
Because Hoosier boys oughtn't to get off their home soil.

753
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,800
I think I'm traipsing out where they're trying.

754
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,840
You know, Phil used to ask us that, too, but...

755
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,320
It's not the kind of answer we can put on the air, that's the problem.

756
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:51,780
More pressure.

757
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,180
I'm taking it over.

758
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,480
More breath area.

759
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:00,560
See here, the clamoring masses here below us are sub-demies wishing for church air.

760
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,880
Ho-ho, mister.

761
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:02,280
Air.

762
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:03,460
Air.

763
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,540
They're looking for spiritual guidance.

764
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,040
In a time of confusion.

765
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,140
A time of worse things than that.

766
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:15,220
You know what I mean?

767
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,580
We're back here at the studio, trying to clean up the mess after the explosion.

768
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:24,960
But we did get Bob all over two billboards, right by Tower Records,

769
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,820
and we did take an authenticating photograph, which, if it comes out, I will send to you.

770
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,360
And you can see Bob spread out all over Berkeley.

771
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,620
And I was relating to you on the tape.

772
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,440
It may come later.

773
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,100
I'm going to put him all over California.

774
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,400
And see those stars so clearly.

775
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,060
It's not at all like on Earth.

776
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,840
Look at that cloudy planet go by.

777
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,320
Gee, it is really inspiring, and I'm glad to be talking to you here.

778
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,340
Air.

779
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:57,800
Air.

780
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,340
Air.

781
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,000
Air.

782
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:04,460
Air.

783
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:04,460


784
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:04,460


785
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:06,940
Air.

786
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:07,780
Air.

787
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:07,780


788
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:07,780


789
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:07,780


790
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:15,780
Air.

791
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:20,520
Air.

792
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:21,900
Air.

793
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,020
Air.

794
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:22,160
Air.

795
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:22,200
Air.

796
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:22,220
Air.

797
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:22,220


798
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:22,220


799
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:22,300
Air.

800
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:23,540
Air.

801
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:23,940
Air.

802
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,000
Air.

803
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,000


804
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,040
Air.

805
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:24,340
Air.

806
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:24,720
Air.

807
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:27,600
Air.

808
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:27,600


809
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:27,600


810
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:27,800
Air.

811
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:27,840
Air.

812
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:29,580
Air.

813
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,240
Air.

814
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:30,740
Air.

815
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,140
here on this escape vessel.

816
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,920
And of course, pouring the liquids

817
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,820
into the fugitives' heads can be

818
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,880
very dangerous, and so she always

819
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,680
makes sure to wear the rubber gloves

820
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,220
provided her by Dad.

821
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,060
She's not about to make the same

822
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,080
mistake Little Sis made last January

823
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,520
when she lost an eye

824
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,820
somewhere in the backyard.

825
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,920
Have you found

826
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,820
that mystic eye?

827
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,100
Have you found it yet?

828
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,920
Have you found

829
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,080
that mystic

830
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:07,800
eye?

831
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,120
What you're looking for,

832
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,500
friend and seeker and peeker

833
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,420
and peeker?

834
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,840
What do you want

835
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,440
in your true self?

836
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,540
Why have you been

837
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,360
standing on the sidelines

838
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,540
when you could be standing on the

839
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,420
front lines with your foot

840
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,720
planted firmly in your own

841
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,140
ass?

842
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,200
Praise me, Bob!

843
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,100
Thanks for watching!

848
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:58,120
verbal matching with

849
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:05,780
tiny Chamberlain

Don't tell me.
