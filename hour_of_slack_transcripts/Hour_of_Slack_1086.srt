1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:07,240
Step in to the wonderful world of autodynamics.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,480
Step in to the swept wing dodge of 1957.

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,280
Here is magic in metal.

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,680
A motor car just four and a half feet low.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,720
A long, lean master of motion that unleashes a hurricane of power.

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,680
Its thundering aircraft type V8 engine will give you a thrilling new concept.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,200
Of automotive performance.

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,480
And the swept wing dodge breaks through the vibration barrier.

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,580
Into a new realm of silence.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,240
To almost completely shield you from outside sound and shock.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah?

12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,640
Well, what do you want?

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,600
The subgenius of slack.

14
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,300
Oh. Alright.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,920
All set? Okay. Make it a good one.

16
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:17,220
This is a good time of the year to thank all of you at your station for your interest in presenting the subgenius of slack program.

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,100
It's a real pleasure to work with you all and I appreciate your cooperation very much indeed.

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,980
May I also wish you and yours a most prosperous and happy

19
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,860
BAAAMBEE!

20
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,100
Ha ha!

21
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,040
Welcome to the Procrastinator's Handbook.

22
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,440
Mastering the art of procrastination.

23
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,220
In this program I'll show you how to throw off everything.

24
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,720
Pay fees for bounced checks, late payment of bills, or high-interest credit card balances.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,940
You're a crazy procrastinator!

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,380
Clutter on your desk, dining room, table, counters, closets, or floors.

27
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,500
Practice, practice, practice. BUT CHAOS IN THE SPACE AROUND YOU.

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,980
Well, out of control.

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


30
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:05,980
troll, procrastinate all the time, put off doing things, rejection, I did nothing, failure,

31
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:12,280
I did nothing, becoming a rotten, rotten mother, putting things off, putting off tasks, errands,

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,880
chores, putting things off.

33
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,440
So let's get started, right now.

34
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,680
Right now.

35
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,320
Right now.

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,040
Right now.

37
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:24,680


38
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,160
All right, all right, if I must.

39
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,220
Friends, I'm your host, Reverend Ivan Stang, and that was from Reverend Norell Preff, and

40
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,860
our openings, our openings, are lemurish.

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:51,500
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1086, the Slack and Drugs of X Day special, in which

42
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:59,280
we continue to mix the very most recent subgenius preaching recordings from our latest revival

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,880
in Ohio.

44
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:06,760
Ohio at the Winter Star Symposium, heard later, to our literally oldest preaching, a 1980

45
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:16,500
radio appearance by Dr. Philo Drummond and myself on the Mr. Opinion Show on KFJZ in

46
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,240
Fort Worth.

47
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,680
Friends, just imagine 1980.

48
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,960
Okay, we're back again now with my guests, who are the head guys, and I'm going to be

49
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,300
talking to them today.

50
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,300


51
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,960
in the subgenius foundation, which is the promotion and PR arm of the Church of the

52
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,840
Subgenius, Dr. Philo Drummond and the Reverend Ivan Stang.

53
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:47,720
And these guys, as we mentioned before, have really taken the American entrepreneurial

54
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,180
spirit to heart, and they have started their own weird cult, strictly to make money.

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,460
And they need your cooperation, 100%.

56
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,960
If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me, and I'll be happy to

57
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,100
answer them.

58
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,460
Any backbone at all, you're going to join their cult and find out all the weird things

59
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,020
that I'm finding out right now.

60
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,900
And one of those weird things is that this foundation actually has goals.

61
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,380
Maybe you can tell us about them, Ivan.

62
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,820
Well, the goals of the foundation basically are to spread the word of Dobbs and various

63
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,940
mystical things.

64
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,980
Philo, I think you've got a better grip on that.

65
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,700
Yeah, Philo, what do you say to that?

66
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,420
Well, the...

67
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,560
You're the policymaker around here.

68
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,940
Of course, the main goal...

69
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,600
The main goal throughout of the church is the ultimate quest for slack, and as much

70
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,100
slack as you can possibly get.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,700
Can you buy slack by joining your church?

72
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,020
Money helps a whole lot.

73
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,280
Money does help tremendously.

74
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,040
And the more money you give, the...

75
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,060
You know, we accept donations at any time.

76
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,460
And the more money you give, the faster you can obtain slack.

77
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,620
The faster you can free yourself from the material things that are binding you, you

78
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,900
know, holding you back and keeping you working so hard and not able to do what you want.

79
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,240
But we can give you plenty of things to do, too.

80
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:09,720
Of course, the main method of obtaining slack through our doctrine is that the...

81
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,000
Piddling.

82
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,920
...is through time control.

83
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,580
Piddling and just goofing off, letting things happen as they may.

84
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,360
I see.

85
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,340
Slack abuse, we call it.

86
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,580
And, of course, we all...

87
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,900
Well, what is slack?

88
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,940
How do you define slack?

89
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,240
Well, it's one of those words that really has no definition.

90
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,020
Most people...

91
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,340
You kind of feel...

92
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,900
Slack, or you feel the lack of slack.

93
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,620
We all need it.

94
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,780
You know, it's what we want to do.

95
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,820
It's what your boss won't let you do when...

96
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,500
That kind of thing.

97
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,960
I notice also one of your goals is to cast out false prophets.

98
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,640
Is a false prophet someone who's telling...

99
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,380
Who is saying things that aren't true?

100
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,620
Or is a false prophet when you think you made money and you really didn't?

101
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,360
Well, first of all, we need to make a basic distinction between...

102
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,740
Yeah.

103
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,460
Two types...

104
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,820
Before you take any革命 or to get!

105
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,180
Before you take anything wrong from...

106
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,180


107
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,180


108
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,320
Not only Satan himself, but also the Mantis in the streets and the facts around us.

109
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,120
And we need to rented after this fact.

110
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,500
I see the respondent, let me check on it, let's see what we have here...

111
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,720
Hi Eddie Mouse 2nd button want me to start my message, anyway if it don't happen...

112
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,020
We're in trouble.

113
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,320
We are in the middle of a problem...

114
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,280
I have yes, yes, I am, but David and dad well want me to...

115
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,960
OK, may I consider?

116
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,100
Yes yes yes!

117
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:23,680
OK.

118
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,440


119
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,460
I'm wearing the shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me

120
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,140
Nothing I do is gonna fail

121
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,380
I'm wearing the t-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me

122
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,160
It can't be in the mail

123
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:09,280
And when I'm wearing the t-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me

124
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,540
I know I'll never land in jail

125
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,360
Oh yeah, I'm wearing the shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me

126
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,360


127
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,160
I know I'll never land in jail

128
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,240
Oh yeah, I'm wearing the shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me

129
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,780
It came to me in the mail

130
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:39,980
And when I'm wearing the shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me

131
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,100
Me, me, me sent it to me

132
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,380
Nothing that I do can fail

133
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:52,660
When I'm wearing the t-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me

134
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,280
I feel so goddamn cool

135
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,660
When I'm wearing the t-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me

136
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,520
Nobody's gonna accuse me of being a fool

137
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,360
I'm wearing the shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me

138
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,880
I'm wearing the shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me

139
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,080

for Superman today.

Hurry!

166
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,160
Yes, sir.

167
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,160
Little knowing that at this very moment,

168
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,640
Superman lies unconscious,

169
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,780
stoned in a large cedar chest.

170
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,420
Hey, you just like your mother was.

171
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,080
Superman.

172
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,160
Pick up the phone and give Superman a ring.

173
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,260
Calling Superman, wherever you are.

174
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,120
Superman.

175
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,600
Calling Superman.

176
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,200
An appeal for Superman.

177
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,640
Jeepers, that's right.

178
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,240
Come on.

179
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,220
Please, Superman.

180
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:09,760
Oh.

181
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,680
Good, good, good.

182
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,020
Extra good.

183
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,740
Rich.

184
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,000
Rich.

185
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,960
There were widespread simplistic sneak attacks.

186
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,520
It happens that most of the people with brains

187
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,400
don't go into politics.

188
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,760
They go into business.

189
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,660
They can make more money.

190
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,800
But in those rare instances

191
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,060
where you have intellectuals...

192
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,640
But nevertheless,

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,600
my hard-headed, hardcore,

194
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,500
a very good hardcore,

195
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,320
and alcohol,

196
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,520
I would say that you can get high on alcohol.

197
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,940
A couple of bottles of bourbon in eight hours.

198
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,220
I would say that you can get high on drugs.

199
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,960
I would say that marijuana has to be taken.

200
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,440
I'd like drugs of any sort.

201
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,800
I have taken uppers, downers, and so forth and so on.

202
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,380
Because they have to be taken on vacation

203
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,060
or when you get to be again.

204
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,760
Here, dear.

205
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,200
Take your medicine.

206
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,420
What's that?

207
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,600
Come on.

208
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,020
Let me have some more pills before you go.

209
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,740
There you are.

210
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,080
Now take care of yourself.

211
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,640
Yeah, take care of yourself.

212
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,080
And here's some good news.

213
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,780
I recently read a serious scientific article

214
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,380
that said that marijuana staves off Alzheimer's.

215
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,660
Did anybody else read that?

216
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,140
I did.

217
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:32,660
Yeah.

218
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,360
They didn't, you know,

219
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,100
it's one of those news stories that they don't,

220
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,040
you know,

221
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,160
stick with for long.

222
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:39,940
But yeah.

223
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,620
Now, I find that

224
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,920
I hope that's true.

225
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,480
How would I know?

226
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,140
But it seems to me that it's more like what they,

227
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,080
it may be that it trains you for Alzheimer's.

228
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,240
You know what I'm saying?

229
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,940
It gives you practice for Alzheimer's.

230
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,500
You get used to, you know, making notes

231
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,720
because your memory's gone.

232
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,040
Or you just don't care.

233
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,340
I don't know whether that is true or not,

234
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,580
but that would be great.

235
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,760
Sometimes,

236
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,700
you know,

237
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:24,500
they,

238
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:24,500


239
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,980
I dirge

240
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,680
something away.

241
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:31,820
Sometimes,

242
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,420
that will be good.

243
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,060
I like that.

244
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,140
It is out.

245
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:51,800

256
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,960
I know the man by Mr. Fletcher in Dallas Texas and he's a good man except that he

257
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:35,740
won't buy me two glasses of Fletcher's beer and I said I love you boy and I'm gonna date if I

259
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,220
don't wax let's see for a bit if I'm a success

260
00:13:49,220 --> 00:14:04,360
in general us the northeastern seaboard will be rather modest for today but we'll continue to see

261
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,940
Philadelphia around the Great Lakes

262
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,920
as we head through today meanwhile central and eastern Texas continues to

263
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,460
spin over western Texas around the Houston area and also look for central

264
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:21,000
Texas to around Northeast Ohio western Pennsylvania reported along the i-90

265
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,940
corridor in New York State from Buffalo to southern New Mexico Atlanta still

266
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,920
stuck in the southeastern states but it's partly Philadelphia in New York City

267
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,920
truth is fiction and this is the Hornet Divas

268
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:43,160
Colonel Peter Jefferson who was the father of President Thomas Jefferson walked all the way

269
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:50,500
home but never smiled again the Hornet Divas in a moment I'll tell you about General Ludwig Pfeiffer

270
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:57,200
in Lucerne Switzerland Madam Pfeiffer clad only in a shroud suddenly sat up and screamed at him

271
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,800
the Hornet Divas

272
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,280
you

273
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:29,280


274
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:59,280


275
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:29,280


276
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:59,280


277
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:29,280


278
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:59,280


279
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:29,280


280
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:59,280


281
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:29,280


282
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:59,280


283
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:29,280


284
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,340
charge to poweruckt

285
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,180

286
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,760
back

287
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,060
Morgan

288
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,500
cellphone

289
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:36,980
urgent

290
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,380
T

291
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,260
atelli

292
00:20:59,260 --> 00:20:59,260


293
00:20:59,260 --> 00:20:59,260


294
00:20:59,260 --> 00:20:59,260


295
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,000
Come on, doctor.

296
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,540
Try to kill us for Bob.

297
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:13,580
The enemy, the general, is a cat named Gordon.

298
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,200
Me!

299
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,300
Hit Man for Bob, dear friends, by Doctors for Extreme Prejudice,

300
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,900
recorded in 1982 in Bolivia,

301
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,940
with Dr. G. Gordon Gordon, also known as That, on vocals.

302
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,880
Dr. Gordon later became the bodyguard of J.R. Bob Dobbs, friends.

303
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,900
By the way, our music in the background is by the Bonobos.

304
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,780
More on them later, too.

305
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,040
And now back to 1980,

306
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,300
when Philo describes his very own first UFO abduction

307
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,880
for the first time on the radio.

308
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:02,780
This is Mr. Opinion, and we're talking to the Reverend Stang and Dr. Drummond,

309
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,900
the headmen of the Subgenius Foundation,

310
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,660
which is a cult, a self-imposed cult,

311
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,820
operated only to make a lot of money.

312
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,480
Dr. Drummond, by the way, is one of the first overmen,

313
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,440
the first actual overman.

314
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
He's been altered by alien technology,

315
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,780
and never the same.

316
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,040
Was that done in person or by remote control,

317
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,220
or how did they get a hold of you?

318
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,120
Well, actually, it was one of what's known as

319
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,080
the close encounter of the third kind.

320
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,360
I was driving in my car late at night,

321
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,000
one night out in the country road,

322
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,520
just like you've heard in all the UFO stories,

323
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,980
and the beam came down from the sky,

324
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,840
stopped my car, took control of me,

325
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,720
and the next thing I knew,

326
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,100
I had powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal people.

327
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,880
That is really...

328
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,240
That is really something.

329
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,960
And like I said before, that is really hard to believe.

330
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,000
One thing that I really marvel at is

331
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,340
that both of you fellas can talk so clearly

332
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,980
with your tongue stuck way up in the side of your cheek like that.

333
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,820
Oh, that's another thing the aliens did to us.

334
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,480
Oh, is that right?

335
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:09,760
Yeah.

336
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,520
What'd you see?

337
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,380
I saw a flying saucer.

338
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:15,980
Where?

339
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,740
In the sky.

340
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,960
In the sky?

341
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:21,560
Yeah.

342
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,940
What did it do?

343
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,280
What did it do?

344
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,600
It didn't buy me.

345
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,500
Did it scare you?

346
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:33,980
No.

347
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,740
We may find only the intergalactic silences,

348
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,720
or we may encounter intelligences greater than our own,

349
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,540
answers to questions we cannot even formulate today,

350
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,660
or the pioneers traveling or falling

351
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,880
between fire and darkness.

352
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,460
Between freezing and burning.

353
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,880
May sense that we live only on the narrowest of margins.

354
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,000
Snowflakes, condensed momentarily out of the great snowstorms

355
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,320
and firestorms of matter in space.

356
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,620
What about the spell?

357
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,860
Oh, that'll go on forever.

358
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,860
Simple ones do.

359
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,120
It's just a state change powered by the...

360
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,300
The...

361
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,600
The...

362
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:23,680
The...

363
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,240
The...

364
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,280
The...

365
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,280


366
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,280


367
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,280


368
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,280


369
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,280


370
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,280


371
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,280


372
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,160
It just keeps going.

373
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,380
That's very good, Mr Sidney.

374
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:38,200
Because if the sympathetic magic doesn't work, you will find me very unsympathetic.

375
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,940
But it's not all hate.

376
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,680
We have hope.

377
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,900
Now, you hear a lot of people complaining about fairness, and this isn't fair, and

378
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,600
that isn't fair.

379
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,500
And you've noticed, I bet, that it's hard to get anything done.

380
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:02,440
Right? Takes effort. And there's certain things that really just aren't fair. Like the dishes.

381
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:10,980
I did the dishes yesterday. I gotta do them again today. Now you may have a rational reason for that.

382
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:18,000
You ain't. Okay. Dishes got dirty again. Well that's not good enough for me. I'm a subgenius.

383
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,240
Why can't I eat all the ice cream I want forever without worrying about my health?

384
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:31,540
Why can't there...why is there a dish washing machine that really does the dishes?

385
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,540
It's like well cause we're not in the Jetsons age yet. We don't have those kind of robots and probably never will.

386
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,200
But I don't agree. I think that the world could be perfect. Literally perfect.

387
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,900
To where every single one of us had everything we wanted all the time.

388
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,920
And never got bored and could do anything we wanted. And could live forever until we decided to die.

389
00:25:53,820 --> 00:26:03,300
Now this may not come immediately. This perfect world I'm thinking of could easily take 10,000 years.

390
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:09,900
Or a billion years. 10 billion years. It might take that long easily. I can see it taking that long to get everything right.

391
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:17,800
I might not even be around by then. I suppose. I mean it's possible. I might not live to see that day.

392
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,980
10 billion years from now. But it ain't going to happen at all if we don't start now!

393
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,920
And start insisting on fairness.

394
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:33,000
Now I know that sounds stupid but we'll never get it if we don't...you know you don't get it if you don't ask.

395
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,360
Squeaky wheel gets the grease.

396
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:43,680
And now when X Day comes that'll be fine. We'll have fairness for everybody who spent their $30 on Church of the Subgenius.

397
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,880
But X Day keeps not coming year after year.

398
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,440
So all I'm saying is...well we can't get to work on it because that wouldn't be convenient.

399
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,740
That would just be boring convenience and unfairness. So we can't work very hard at it.

400
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:07,040
So I guess what I'm saying is friends, join me and work very very slightly towards making the perfect world.

401
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,760
Where we no longer have to do the dishes and neither does anybody else.

402
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,720
Now I know that your rational mind has all kinds of arguments against this and I don't want to hear those.

403
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:17,980
I'm not going to hear those.

404
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,360
I don't want to hear any of this rational bullshit.

405
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,340
You know this Church of the Subgenius. We don't have to listen to that crap.

406
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,320
But X Day will come. It's just that we have to hope that Y Day doesn't come first.

407
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,240
We don't talk about Y Day very much.

408
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,620
X Day is great. Beautiful sex goddesses.

409
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,600
And by the way if you're a woman and we're hoping for a sex god, believe me it'll be whatever you want.

410
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,580
You won't know the difference.

411
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,060
You're really just going to be a brain in a jar anyways.

412
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,900
But it'll seem great.

413
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,040
But if the Yakatizma get here first, that's what we call it.

414
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,100
When the X's come, that's X Day. That's good.

415
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:03,220
But if the Yakatizma come on Y Day first, that is very bad.

416
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,760
You've seen those Star Trek characters, the Borg?

417
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,560
Well multiply that by about a jillion krillion godzillion.

418
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,580
The Yakatizma are so badass.

419
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,880
They're physical creatures unlike the X's that are more like ants.

420
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,100
They're like angels.

421
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,440
The Yakatizma are robots basically.

422
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,300
It's just that they're big enough that they can swallow an entire planet.

423
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:35,820
And the things that we think of as monsters in monster movies, those are more like the digestive enzymes in the stomachs of the Yakatizma.

424
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,020
And they're not very friendly creatures that will be like, yes, we have devoured your planet.

425
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,840
But despair not, for it is only part of the circle of life.

426
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,260
And that brings us to nature.

427
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,260
I love that Disney movie came up with that thing about the circle of life and suddenly everything was okay.

428
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,320
You know, well, so grandma died, but she gets to feed the worms.

429
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,040
The worms feed the birds and the birds feed the next grandma.

430
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,840
We'll feed you when you're a grandma.

431
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,460
And then you'll die and you'll be part of the circle of life.

432
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,760
Isn't that pleasant?

433
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,880
But, you know, people talk about all this back to nature stuff.

434
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,180
And that's...

435
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,960
commendable, I suppose.

436
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,780
But they're never specific.

437
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,520
This was actually my dad got me thinking this way.

438
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,480
Because somebody was saying to him, I wish...

439
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,280
Our little small town is just getting all built up.

440
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,000
I wish everything could be back to nature.

441
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,240
I was kind of like, well, when in nature did you mean?

442
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,560
Before the Europeans came to the country?

443
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,180
Because, you know, American Indians did...

444
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,080
burned off grass.

445
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,040
Grasslands so that they could grow stuff.

446
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,260
And they changed the environment a lot.

447
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:57,680
In fact, this continent was covered with gigantic, huge mammals that all went completely extinct

448
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:03,820
within 10,000 years of humans' arrival in the New World.

449
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,340
Because the animals here didn't grow up with humans.

450
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,980
The ones in Europe and Africa did.

451
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,780
So they knew they weren't dumbasses about it.

452
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,480
But when the Native Americans got here, it was real easy pickings.

453
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,380
Well, so do you want nature before the Native Americans got here?

454
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,900
Well, that means you don't get to enjoy it either, I suppose.

455
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,320
How about the middle of the last ice age?

456
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,280
Would that be back to nature enough for you?

457
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,360
We'd be...

458
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,580
Right where we're sitting now would be under about a mile of ice.

459
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,020
But that was natural at that time.

460
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,740
Friends, you know, they talk about this global warming stuff.

461
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,320
When the next ice age comes, you'll be wishing you'd taken global warming a little more seriously.

462
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,740
You think about that.

463
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,220
I don't know if that's PC, but...

464
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,900
But there's no hurry.

465
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,420
I don't think the next ice age is an immediate thing.

466
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,640
How about nature before the dinosaurs were wiped out?

467
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,740
Sure, that sounds good at first.

468
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,540
But there was no grass.

469
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,400
You may not have known this, but grass had not evolved as we know it

470
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,280
during the time of the mighty dinosaurs.

471
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,520
That, therefore, no marijuana!

472
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,200
Back to nature!

473
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:18,920
You like that?

474
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,140
Actually, this gives...

475
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:26,240
But on the other hand, though, in the age of the dinosaurs, peyote cactus grew to 40 feet across.

476
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,960
Think of the poor vomit ultrasaurus.

477
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,320
You would not want to be around a vomit ultrasaurus.

478
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:46,460
This gives me a good, completely chance, random place to plug a book by my friend, Dr. Hattie.

479
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:46,460


480
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,540
Dr. Hattie, who goes by the name Harry S. Robbins.

481
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,880
Hour of Slack listeners would recognize Dr. Hattie's voice instantly.

482
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,780
He's the funniest, most erudite person in the world, and probably wouldn't qualify as a subgenius

483
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,820
if we were going to be picking.

484
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,120
He'd be more like a genius.

485
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,340
But he did a book.

486
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,120
He's like me.

487
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,060
He loves dinosaurs.

488
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,540
And he just had a book published of his dinosaur drawings.

489
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,000
They're in full color, and they're beautiful.

490
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,220
And I'm just mentioning this because I love my friend, Dr. Howe.

491
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,720
And it's a dinosaur alphabet book with an A is for this and B is for that and so forth.

492
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,560
But it covers dinosaurs you never heard of because they keep finding them.

493
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,800
And I'm going to read you a poem.

494
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,500
Each one has a drawing of a dinosaur.

495
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,060
Here's the seismosaurus.

496
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:42,780
You probably can barely see it, but you'd be able to drive a construction crane under its belly.

497
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,980
They're tailed.

498
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,540
Their tails were 70 feet long, just the animal's tail.

499
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:54,440
Though seismosaurus shook the earth with gentle steps from day to day,

500
00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:00,500
she sought the uplands of her birth, devouring forests on the way.

501
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,400
Isn't that sweet?

502
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,400
He wrote the poems, too.

503
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,080
Yeah, yeah.

504
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,880
He wrote all the poems and drew the—he probably drew the pictures on napkins originally if I know him.

505
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,660
He's one of those guys that can't stop drawing.

506
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,780
He's an emergentile subgenius.

507
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,940
He cannot stop drawing.

508
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,640
But so does—what does back to nature mean, friends?

509
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,400
That's all I'm in.

510
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:29,500
Next time you start talking about back to nature, you've got to stop and go, well, what exactly?

511
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,680
Before the oceans?

512
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,360
Before the magma had cooled?

513
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:44,620
That was pretty natural when everything was lava and deadly gas pouring out of the incredibly hot, you know, planet before it had really formed.

514
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,640
That's pretty natural, man.

515
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,460
You can't get much more natural than that.

516
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,580
Well, I noticed that all the lines are full.

517
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:56,600
We'd better take a few calls so that other people can get in and talk to you about the Church of the Subgenius.

518
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,760
You're on the air with Mr. Opinion on KFJZ.

519
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,780
Yes, I'm calling from Glen Rose.

520
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,500
Yes.

521
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,660
And I'm a cattle rancher down here.

522
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:13,940
And I was wondering if these two guys might have any inside information on cattle mutilation.

523
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,680
Because some of it's in our place and some of the neighbors have been having that problem.

524
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,100
Well, that's sure an interesting question, and I'll bet they do.

525
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,720
One of them actually looks like a cow.

526
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,760
Go ahead.

527
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,820
Pardon the delay.

528
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,680
Yeah, the cattle mutilation problem is getting to be pretty big.

529
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,200
A lot of people don't know about it.

530
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,700
It's not mentioned much on the TV because nobody has any answers about it.

531
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,100
But, yeah, the conspiracy is behind that.

532
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,740
They're doing it to confuse people.

533
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,920
They're doing it to discredit law enforcement agents who can't figure out who's the real guy.

534
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,740
They're just doing it to these cattle and then taking off in the spacecraft or whatever.

535
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,460
For those who've never heard about a cattle mutilation, it's happening a lot these days.

536
00:34:53,500 --> 00:35:03,940
Out in the sticks, a farmer will come upon his prized cow or something like that mutilated, but not by animals.

537
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,160
It's done by professionals.

538
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,560
Certain organs removed and maybe the blood drained, things like that.

539
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,320
Surgically removed is what I heard.

540
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,280
Right, surgically removed.

541
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,320
Yeah, it's spooky.

542
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,520
It actually is kind of a...

543
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:24,800
Well, since you have this connection with the UFO people, if somebody pays you to belong to your organization, does that mean their cows will be left alone?

544
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,220
It would help.

545
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,700
It would help a whole lot.

546
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:27,820
It would help a whole lot.

547
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,380
Yeah, we can't make a whole lot of guarantees.

548
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,220
Have you had any cattle mutilations on your ranch?

549
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,120
Well, we've had one, and it was a pretty odd-looking type.

550
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,020
Is that right?

551
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,620
Some of the neighbors said the same thing.

552
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,720
Maybe you'd better give your box number again for this fella.

553
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:51,000
Okay, yeah, you can get a lot of information on cattle mutilations from us at Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas.

554
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:56,940
And by the way, when you write, I can tell you about some people who do some serious research into that thing.

555
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,540
And it's weird.

556
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,880
We can send you some of their literature if you'd like.

557
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,260
Yeah.

558
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,380
And thanks for calling.

559
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,660
Oh, by the way, enjoy the nuclear glow there in Glen Rose.

560
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,360
Well, it does help feed the cows at night.

561
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,680
Yeah, it makes them grow big.

562
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,580
I understand you all have a lot of those six-legged frogs and so forth getting around there now.

563
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,520
Wait until I kick on that power plant.

564
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,200
Boy, we'll see some giant farmers and so forth.

565
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,440
Okay, well, thank you very much for calling.

566
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,020
Thank you.

567
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,000
Are there any questions?

568
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,880
Can I take any, or suggestions?

569
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,820
I won't heed them, but you can...

570
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,400
No, seriously, I mean, any kind of question.

571
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,280
Doesn't have to be about subgenius.

572
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,500
Yes?

573
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,660
Well, do we know what time this is happening on July 15th?

574
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:40,660


575
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,000
Yes, 7 a.m.

576
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,900
Oh, okay.

577
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,560
7 a.m.

578
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,080
And boy, you wouldn't believe the crap I get for that.

579
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,540
Because we, you know, we're out there every year.

580
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:57,740
I'll admit to you, we have a big subgenius get-together at Brushwood every year around July 5th weekend.

581
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,140
And at 7 a.m., the bravest and most faithful are out there.

582
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,740
And believe me, you know, 7 a.m. is hard.

583
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,580
It's a rough time.

584
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,640
I mean, some of you get there.

585
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:10,640


586
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,920
You get up and go to work then, right?

587
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,880
So you know what I mean.

588
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,560
But imagine, for hippies and subgeniuses, it's like terribly unfair.

589
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:28,840
In fact, Jesus, my partner, my ex, former business partner, Jesus, the only reason he's not my partner anymore is because we couldn't pay enough to fight his legal bills.

590
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,440
He was going, had to be 7 a.m.

591
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,580
As if I made this crap up.

592
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,640
You know, as if Bob had to do it.

593
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,840
He said it was going to be 7 a.m.

594
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,660
It's like, no, he got that from the aliens.

595
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,820
They said, Jehovah once said it was going to be 7 a.m.

596
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:53,060
So we've got to stand around at 7 a.m. waiting for flying saucers.

597
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,220
And I know some of you pagans laugh at us.

598
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,780
Those subgeniuses, they think them saucers are going to come.

599
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,960
They're going to kill themselves one day just like Jonestown.

600
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,500
I know they are.

601
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:10,220
In fact, there was somebody out there, I heard this secondhand, who really did think we were going to kill ourselves.

602
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,740
Do the Jonestown thing.

603
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,620
Because we always do the Kool-Aid.

604
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,300
We all drink this Kool-Aid at 7 a.m. and go, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

605
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,700
Which is the only law in our church.

606
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,300
And yet, that pagan didn't call the cops.

607
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,360
She thought we were going to all die and kill ourselves, but she didn't do anything.

608
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,820
But I think she prayed for us.

609
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,380
Yes?

610
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:44,040
Allegedly there were no illegal drugs found, but do you think there was Kool-Aid in Anna Nicole's room?

611
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,300
What difference would that make?

612
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:55,380
Actually, at Jonestown they did not use Kool-Aid, but flavor aid.

613
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:03,560
Just to make sure, you know, when we do our mass suicide, we're not going to be doing one product placement.

614
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,720
We're not going to just be...

615
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,360
Like, the...

616
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,700
Heaven's Gate guys.

617
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:09,860
Nikes.

618
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,660
Whoa, they were all wearing Nikes.

619
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,200
You know, Jonestown.

620
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,820
Oh, they were all drinking flavor aid.

621
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,540
Whoop-de-doo.

622
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,520
Man, when the subgeniuses do it, it ain't going to be no 900 measly people.

623
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,360
And...

624
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,900
Or what was it with Heaven's Gate?

625
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,340
There was only like 40 of them.

626
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:27,800
Pathetic.

627
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,640
You know, we're not going to do it unless we can really beat some world records.

628
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,040
And actually, with that kind of a religion, it's hard to fill.

629
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,620
It's hard to fill a stadium, to tell the truth.

630
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,320
With those sorts of promises.

631
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,700
What else can I say?

632
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,880
Has Bob started appearing on there yet, or is that all still just...

633
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:55,560
I forgot to bring my remote control for that DVD player.

634
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:04,880
Otherwise, I could zip it ahead to a series of psychedelic short films that are nothing but Bob's face getting twisted and messed up.

635
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,740
Huh?

636
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:10,260
Well, there's some of it, but I mean, we prefer to be brainwashed completely.

637
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,040
Nothing but Bob.

638
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:18,880
Someday, friends, when the Church of the Subgenius meets its rightful destiny, there'll only be...

639
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,440
There'll be...

640
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,900
Sure, there'll be a million TV channels on cable, but they'll all be the Bob Show.

641
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,400
There'll be lots of radio, but it'll all be the hour of slack.

642
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,880
What you can hear, by the way, there is a subgenius radio show.

643
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,720
It's broadcast in...

644
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,260
I think 15 cities.

645
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,680
But mostly, it's all over the internet.

646
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:45,360
It's really easy to find if you have a computer and all that stuff.

647
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,900
I guess you have to have a computer now to be a person, right?

648
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,020
Although I've heard that only 50% of...

649
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,060
There's still half of America doesn't mess with that stuff.

650
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,920
Those are the healthy ones, with suntans and muscles and...

651
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,480
Actually, it's ironic.

652
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,660
I've noticed since smoking cigarettes was outlawed everywhere,

653
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,860
that the smokers are the ones who look all tan and healthy,

654
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,880
because they spend a lot of time outdoors.

655
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:17,900
I'm...

656
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,180
And I'm not saying that as a joke.

657
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,420
It's a real observation.

658
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,660
And you see it at the airport, especially.

659
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:30,700
There'll be all these nice, tan, leathery-looking people out there outside the airport smoking,

660
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,360
and everybody else is all overweight and...

661
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,000
and, you know, pasty-looking.

662
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,960
They never go outside.

663
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,960
Look like me.

664
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,260
Bend over a computer all the time.

665
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:47,200
Everybody all over the galaxies are watching you now.

666
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,860
Why now?

667
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,660
People do not want war.

668
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:52,940
Okay?

669
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,860
They're sick of it.

670
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,660
Go down...

671
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,580
Hot or cold.

672
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,660
Soon we shall all be together.

673
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:00,420
Sit down.

674
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,040
More and more.

675
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,320
Sacred undergarments.

676
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,020
How could anyone believe such a story?

677
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,680
It seemed preposterous.

678
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,600
And yet these people believed as they were instructed.

679
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,480
Sacre, Sacre, Sacre, Sacre.

680
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,080
What is the sacrament?

681
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,800
It's bread and water.

682
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,480
What do we eat it for?

683
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,240
Because the cakes be hungry.

684
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,800
Stupid in America.

685
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,480
Stupid in America.

686
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:40,420
Stupid in America collage by the great Norell Preff and now from the great Lemur, Believe It or Kill Me, followed by the news.

687
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,740
Truth is fiction.

688
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,600
And this is Be Horned, Be Not.

689
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:53,160
The steeple of the parish church of Eccles, England was buried under sand by George Thompson of Pomfret, Connecticut.

690
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,780
Be Horned, Be Not.

691
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:02,300
In a moment, I'll tell you the strange story of George, who literally clothed himself in clothing that he had planned on wearing.

692
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,340
Be Horned, Be Not.

693
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:13,580
From PR news in Washington, I'm based on unrealistic assumptions and could set a dangerous precedent.

694
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,120
The Italian government killed a policeman in Sicily on Friday.

695
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,440
The soccer federation had definitely thrown an explosive PR in his face.

696
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:28,300
Commissioner Luca Pancali said the existing system of violence would be widened to include those under 18.

697
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,300
In Stocksgate 1266547.

698
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,560
This is PR news.

699
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:34,980
PR's bad.

700
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:35,540
PR's bad.

701
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,220
Disconnected from reality.

702
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:48,420
A military tribunal at Fort Lewis, Washington has spread across the Northern Plains today as U.S. forces began a major military offensive to restore violence at soccer games.

703
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:56,600
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is charged with one count of failing to deploy his dangerous unit and two counts of PR news.

704
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,160
PR comes from LowAchievingSchools.org.

705
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,680
And friends, I doubt if this is news to anybody here, but Pope Bob died.

706
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:13,620
Robert Anton Wilson, as we know, on January 11th, he would pick 1-1-1.

707
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:20,620
He boarded the escape saucers and is now partying with Bob.

708
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:27,640
Bob himself, J.R., Bob Dobbs, the guru he's seen here and up there sometimes.

709
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:34,100
Bob, J.R. Bob Dobbs has been killed so many times that he can't tell the difference.

710
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,180
But I figure Robert Anton Wilson never took death all that seriously.

711
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,880
So he's probably having a perfectly good time.

712
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,360
You know, when he got sick, well, he's been sick for a long time.

713
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:54,300
But news came out two or three months ago that he was also hurting for money.

714
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,620
He'd been too sick to work and his wife's health problems.

715
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,940
You know, it must have cost a fortune.

716
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,100
And he was about to get put out of his house.

717
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,560
And he was dying from childhood polio.

718
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:12,660
And when the news got out, friends, $65,000 suddenly.

719
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:18,600
I mean, that's how, in less than a week, people gave him $65,000,

720
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,400
which was a lot more than he was expecting.

721
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,360
And I understand he was really, really touched by all of that.

722
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:31,700
But the Church of the Subgenius sent a lot of money for us.

723
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,240
It was a lot.

724
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:41,860
Because without Pope Bob and also his pal, the late great Robert Shea,

725
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,880
and their book Illuminatus,

726
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,400
well, there'd still be a Bob Dobbs and there'd still be a Church of the Subgenius,

727
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,840
but none of us would get it.

728
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,540
You know, it wouldn't make any sense.

729
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,220
But it could be that we only think we get it.

730
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,260
Anyway, only Bob Dobbs really knows.

731
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,940
Anyway, Pope Bob Wilson used to make everybody a pope.

732
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,460
Whenever he was on the radio or giving a speech, he'd say,

733
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:11,460
everyone within the sound of my voice is a Discordian pope.

734
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:18,480
And in honor of the great Pope Bob and his delightful Brooklyn monotone,

735
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,760
I'm going to make everybody here a subgenius minister.

736
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:26,680
I'm handing out subgenius membership cards for free.

737
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,920
You're a sub-thirty dollar...

738
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,720
Well, actually, this doesn't mean you're on our mailing list,

739
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:37,080
but Bob Dobbs wants you ordained just for being here in the name of Pope Bob.

740
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,460
And in fact, I think, I wish I could do it like Magnus.

741
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:42,440
Magnus, yeah.

742
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,400
Maybe if I do the whole thing.

743
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:54,440
Now, you'll notice that these cards that I have generously given away for free

744
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,540
say the same thing on both sides.

745
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:02,700
That was because when I ordered the new 2500 subgenius membership cards,

746
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,320
I screwed up and sent them two of the same art file,

747
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,100
wasting 75 bucks of Bob's money,

748
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:16,380
but proving once again that I am a true subgenius.

749
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:21,520
And I don't think I ever was an actual proper genius.

750
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:51,580
That's all I can say.

751
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:51,580


752
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:51,580


753
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:51,620
they all haven■t always been fun to watch,

754
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:51,620


755
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,000
and you can support our most MediaTek gaming community,

756
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,680
as well as Buttocks or the such of it.

757
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,300
Now

758
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,620
There's a party

759
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,720
At the edge of the universe

760
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,380
Bring the good stuff

761
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:38,360
Leave behind the worst

762
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,960
Come on in and

763
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,320
Drink that strange brew

764
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,140
And drink that strange brew

765
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,380
And drink that strange brew

766
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,780
Wipe your tears with the

767
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:58,800
With the morning dew

768
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,940
With the morning dew

769
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,340
And we all sing

770
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,540
For a kinder tomorrow

771
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,620
For a kinder tomorrow

772
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,480
For a kinder tomorrow

773
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,020
For a kinder tomorrow

774
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:23,900
Lose the world

775
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,080
And we'll do our thing

776
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,780
Let us groove and swing now

777
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,340
Lose the world

778
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,640
And we'll do our thing

779
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:41,240
Let us groove and swing now

780
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:50,720
Let us groove and swing now

781
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,460
Don't wear socks

782
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,120
But a

783
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,920
A bulky bulky hat

784
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:17,040
A pair of wings

785
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,140
And a

786
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,780
And a

787
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:22,300
A hoop to match

788
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:27,340
Close your eyes

789
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:28,400
When you

790
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,980
When you look at me

791
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,180
Flow through the music

792
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:38,740
And

793
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,380
Let it be

794
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,900
Let it be

795
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,560
Let it be

796
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:46,660
Let it be

797
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,820
Let it be

798
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,360
Let it be

799
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,220
And we all sing

800
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:58,400
For a kinder tomorrow

801
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,700
For a kinder tomorrow

802
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,680
Lose the world

803
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,800
And we'll do our thing

804
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,440
Let us move and swing now

805
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,880
Lose the world

806
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,100
And we'll do our thing

807
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,240
Lose the world

808
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,720
Let us move and swing now

809
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,440
Lose the world

810
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,260
Lose the world

811
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,100
Yes, dear friends,

812
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,880
this is the Bonobos

813
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,360
from their album

814
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:34,900
Convergence,

815
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,460
a song called

816
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,060
Home on Derange.

817
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,280
Actually, the name of the album

818
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,940
is Bonobos Convergence.

819
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,100
No, maybe the name of the band

820
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,460
is Bonobos Convergence

821
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,860
and the name of the album is

822
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,920
Who's Chuck Fimp?

823
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,000
Hmm.

824
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,100
Friends, you can get more information

825
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,100
about the Bonobos Convergence

826

from bonobosmusic.com.

827
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,600
They also did the background music

828
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,060
heard earlier in the show

829
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:06,880
when I was doing credits.

830
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,380
Friends, you are listening to

831
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,320
the Subgenius Radio Ministry

832
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,620
Hour of Slack.

833
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:12,700

842
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,460
Once again, that's

Cleveland Heights, Ohio

846

44118

847
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,120
We've been hearing

848
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,660
some preaching from the

849
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,540
Winter Star Symposium.

850
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,580
For more information on that festival,

851
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,860
you'll see Rosen,

852
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,560
that's spelled

853
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,960
R-O-S-E-N

854
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,940
comet.com

855
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,700
and praise Bob.

856
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:47,720


857
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,140
asking God to teach you

858
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:53,580
what the colored

859
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,760
can do.

860
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,800
We'll see you soon.

861
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,300
Good night.

862
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,340
Good night.

863
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,960
Good night.

864
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:15,180


865
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:15,660
Good night.

866
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,480
Good night.

867
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:43,000
Thanks for watching!

868
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,600
Lose to World

869
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,780
and we'll do our thing

870
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,160
FLEET.

871
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,800
We'll lose to World

872
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,120
and we'll do our thing

873
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,660
Lose the world

874
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,980
and we'll do our thing

875
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,780
Lose to World

876
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,700
and we'll do our thing

877
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:16,200
Let us go and swing now

878
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,740
We haven't gotten a statistical feedback.

879
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,240
We like to consider ourselves the ultimate minority.

880
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,200
Yeah, we are, basically, really.

881
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,620
I think the government should start giving money to weirdos and goof-offs,

882
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,000
anybody who can prove they're different.

883
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,840
I thought they already were doing that.

884
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,140
We're just trying to add another little pigeonhole

885
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,280
that they can start putting the taxpayers' money into.

886
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,200
I think maybe we'd better go back to the phones.

887
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,120
The number, folks, in case you have any questions from these wonderful guys,

888
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,560
is 787-244-QUESTIONS

889
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,140
about the Subgenius Foundation, the Church of the Subgenius,

890
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,200
the founder, H.R. Bob Dobbs,

891
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:15,520
who, as I understand, is never seen by anyone at any time.

892
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,240
If you have any questions about these or other religious matters

893
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,380
that these two gurus may be able to answer for you, call.

894
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,800
And now we're going to go to the phone lines

895
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,900
to see if we have another prospective subgenius.

896
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,280
Hello, you're on air with Mr. Opinion.

897
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,000
Good evening, yes.

898
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,780
I was wondering, how do you become a subgenius?

899
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,180
And if you do, can you obtain slides?

900
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,660
Or do you have to study to get that?

901
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,720
Or do you have teachers?

902
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,080
How do you obtain this?

903
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:49,300
Well, the first thing you can do, again, is to write us,

904
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,760
send us a dollar for our information packet.

905
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:55,220
That's really a donation because we're an anti-nonprofit foundation.

906
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,520
You mean it's not tax deductible if they send money to you?

907
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,000
No.

908
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:03,380
Bob, early in the game, decided that this, like the Mormons,

909
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,200
we were going to be a tax and not a tax-exempt scam.

910
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,760
You know, we're bigger.

911
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:08,880
We're bigger.

912
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,480
That would be pushing things.

913
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:10,980
I see.

914
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,460
You're a taxable scam, man.

915
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,040
We're a tax.

916
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:13,640
We're tax.

917
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,880
We don't owe the government anything.

918
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,140
Taxable industrial church, right?

919
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,500
The first industrial church.

920
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,200
I see.

921
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,980
That gun won't do you any good.

922
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,200
Besides, you're pointing it the wrong way.

923
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,340
Terror, terror by William Morwood.

924
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,600
Wherever I go.

925
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,280
Oh, don't be childish.

926
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,980
You and your headaches.

927
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,780
My head, head.

928
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:42,400
Oh.

929
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,020
Oh.

930
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,820
What are you working on now, Shakespeare?

931
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,700
I can't stand the pain any longer.

932
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:49,200
What?

933
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:49,800
What?

934
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,920
Nothing but discord.

935
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,760
The sweat stood out on my forehead.

936
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,060
My mouth was dry.

937
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,260
I didn't want it this way.

938
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,200
You have a gun in your pocket.

939
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,760
Help a blind man.

940
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,140
Help a poor blind man.

941
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,100
Help the old blind man.

942
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:04,600


943
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:05,700
Help.

944
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,080
What?

945
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,040
Are you crazy?

946
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,480
Do you honestly think?

947
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:12,940
I heard the door.

948
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,580
What are you talking about?

949
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:16,220
No.

950
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,780
Don't you see that I'm mad?

951
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:19,320
And...

952
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,100
Hey!

953
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,320
Hello, boys.

954
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:33,500
For us, it was pervasive flapping ass disorder.

955
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,380
Well, that guy's a riot.

956
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,220
Ha, ha, ha.

957
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,320
Ha, ha, ha.

958
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:39,580
Ha, ha, ha.

959
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:40,000
Ha, ha, ha.

960
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,460
Ha, ha, ha.

961
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,400
Ha, ha, ha.

962
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:42,820
Free information.

963
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:47,820
From PR News in Washington, I'm making clean-up efforts more difficult.

964
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,400
Five people were killed.

965
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,380
At least 20 people have died.

966
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:56,340
By the way, between the commercials, at least 20 people were killed, making them eligible

967
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,400
for millions of dollars in federal aid.

968
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,540
PR is bad.

969
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:02,920
The bodies of four minors were difficult to mount.

970
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,600
Authorities fear that this is PR News in Washington.

971
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:07,460
.

972
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:07,460


973
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:08,860
Command performance.

974
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,360
.

975
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,720
May I come in?

976
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,200
Of course.

977
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,060
Thank you.

978
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:18,460
Oh, good show.

979
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,000
Good show.

980
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:19,860
Thank you.

981
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:22,220
Well, what's all the fuss about?

982
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:23,380
What?

983
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,440
Ha, ha.

984
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,040
What happened?

985
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,060
I don't know.

986
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,600
Ha, ha, ha.

987
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:32,660
Sweet.

988
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:33,980
What do you mean?

989
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,400
.

990
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,360
.

991
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:37,920
.

992
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:37,920


993
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,640
.

994
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:38,840
.

995
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,160
.

996
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:39,160


997
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:39,160


998
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:39,160


999
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:39,160


1000
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:39,160


1001
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:39,160


1002
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,020
.

1003
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:40,020


1004
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,000
