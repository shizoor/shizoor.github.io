1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
Come in, Dobbs. Have a seat.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,220
Thank you, sir.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,360
Dobbs, I read your report last night.

4
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,880
Oh, good. What did you think of it, sir?

5
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,060
I found it insanely disappointing.

6
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,000
Disappointing?

7
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,720
No, Dobbs. Insanely disappointing.

8
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,280
Gee, I'm not sure how to respond to that, sir.

9
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,300
It drove me mad, Dobbs.

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,100
My life will never be the same.

11
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,520
Yesterday, I had a full head of hair, Dobbs.

12
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,940
Yes, I know, sir. Your shaved head looks good.

13
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,580
I didn't do it. I fought them, but it was no use.

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,900
They shaved my head, Dobbs.

15
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,740
It works for you, sir. It works.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,160
It works for you.

17
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,700
Ah!

18
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,180
Stop!

19
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,740
Oh, God, the pain!

20
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,140
It's like you're running a sword across my teeth!

21
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,680
I'm shutting up, sir. I'm shutting up.

22
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,380
You've killed me, Dobbs.

23
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,380
I felt something deep inside me die.

24
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,660
I don't have long to live.

25
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,920
Sir, what can I do?

26
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,620
It's too late for me. I'm not important, but...

27
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,480
I want you to see something, Dobbs.

28
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,520
I think I killed a man last night, Dobbs.

29
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,320
It sounds like you just had a terrible dream.

30
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,500
Yes.

31
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,680
Yes, I suppose you're right.

32
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,940
But then how do you...

33
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,560
How do you explain this?

34
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,120
Oh, my God!

35
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:03,700
God?

36
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,000
God?

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,600
God is not here, Dobbs.

38
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,200
You've driven God away.

39
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,600
God has left the building, Dobbs.

40
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,840
I'm sorry. I scared God away, sir.

41
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,640
Find it, Dobbs.

42
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,420
Pardon me?

43
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,880
You've got to find it. You're the only one who can find it.

44
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,660
Before it's too late, Dobbs.

45
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,000
You know how he thinks. It's a part of you.

46
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,340
Go!

47
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:26,980
Go!

48
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,840
Oh, and Dobbs!

49
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,900
Yes, sir.

50
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,680
Be sure to find it by four. We've got that...

51
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,680
Some genius.

52
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,600
Power of...

53
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,440
Swag.

54
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,200
My name is the very esteemed universal philosopher of absolute reality,

55
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,720
Reverend Frodus Pasha.

56
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,640
You can call me Reverend Suds.

57
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,080
Friends, I got a story to tell you, and it's a long one,

58
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,520
so it's going to take three parts.

59
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,280
Tonight, I'll tell you the first part,

60
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,560
and over the next two days, I'll tell you the rest of it,

61
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,740
because I know you fuckers...

62
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,520
You're the only one who listened to me ramble up here all this time.

63
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,220
And we've got more music and entertainment for you,

64
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,440
but first, I wanted to get this off my chest.

65
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,820
I, like the rest of you, have been suffering from this mutant mutation

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,400
that is inherent within us all our lives.

67
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,260
Am I right?

68
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:18,780
Okay.

69
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,860
And I guarantee you, at no point in your life can you remember

70
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,160
a worse time than you were in the conspiracy indoctrination system

71
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,220
known as the public schools.

72
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,220
Woo!

73
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,320
See, I was lucky enough to experience everything

74
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,800
before the prescribing mind-altering chemicals to wee children

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,520
became the standard procedure for everything.

76
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,720
No, friends, I got to deal with solitude.

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,320
Nothing but solitude for the first five years of school.

78
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,740
I'll tell you, folks, it was madness

79
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,280
that there was one,

80
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,040
and it's going to lighten my life,

81
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,300
and I will get to that soon.

82
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,520
First, we have these teachers.

83
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,180
They just want to throw the facts at you, right?

84
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,040
They just want to throw them at you

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,060
and hope that you can regurgitate them back onto your little standardized test

86
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,220
so that they can get paid.

87
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,620
The conspiracy has convinced them

88
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,600
so that everybody falls into the nice little slots.

89
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,200
And those that aren't, well, just look around you, folks.

90
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,000
You can see where those slots fell.

91
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,440
We are here.

92
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,240
Situation is,

93
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,280
I had one light in my life,

94
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,020
and that was a man named Teacher Joe.

95
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,260
He was one of the only teachers during that entire time

96
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,620
that took an interest in me,

97
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,660
took an interest in my art and my wackiness,

98
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,880
and knew the shit that I was going through on a daily basis

99
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,820
and would do anything to get me out of that class.

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,140
This was the kind of teacher who had movie posters on his walls

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,380
that these kids weren't even old enough to see yet.

102
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,700
Big poster of,

103
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,960
you know, alligator on his wall.

104
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,060
You know what I'm talking about?

105
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,460
He had a Boba Fett doll in a birdcage.

106
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:15,180
And over his desk was the face of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

107
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,440
Friends, this man is a personal savior to me,

108
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,300
even more than what Bob could ever be

109
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,920
because he taught me what it took

110
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,580
to be as mutant as fucking possible.

111
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,080
And here we are today

112
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,080
to enjoy that mutant abnormality

113
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,600
as a collective of hatred and malice

114
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,940
towards this machine that has tried to swallow us.

115
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,620
Look at all the trouble everybody has gotten into

116
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,880
trying to get here.

117
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,860
Think about it.

118
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,840
This is the year, folks!

119
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,680
The time is time.

120
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,460
The time is nigh.

121
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,880
And immediately following,

122
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,280
the last hour of Slack, folks,

123
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,860
we're going to have to herd the subgenius group

124
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,480
down to the pond for the mandatory

125
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,840
Bobtism

126
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,620
in the organics-rich waters.

127
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:13,840
We'll be a shuttle service.

128
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,860
Oh, that's good.

129
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,420
A shuttle?

130
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,640
I don't know if we have enough shuttles to...

131
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,380
I would guess that at least half of the subgeniuses

132
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,100
will be chicken

133
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,440
and afraid to go down to the pond

134
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,620
because there might be nature

135
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,860
or animal cats.

136
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,420
Oh, there's bubbling brown scum on the surface

137
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,740
and this, the natives say, is walnut oil.

138
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,280
But we just hope that that's not some rural euphemism

139
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,600
for something else.

140
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,160
At any rate, in addition,

141
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,180
it's alive with life,

142
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,340
hopping and writhing and seething,

143
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,080
giant diving beetles,

144
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,500
huge tadpoles as large as regular-sized frogs.

145
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,320
If they can survive,

146
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,360
surely a subgenius can survive

147
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,860
for one sure thing.

148
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,020
A short moment of inundation

149
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,040
and total acclimatization

150
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,600
to the word of Bob.

151
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,300
But don't you want to be purified

152
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,140
before you rise up on those saucers, friends?

153
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,780
Wash off that last bit of conspiracy scum

154
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,120
and wearing only natural scum.

155
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,200
Be sky-clad and mud-clad.

156
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,780
The sky above, the mud below.

157
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,240
The subgenius within.

158
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,160
And, uh, friends,

159
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,860
so we will be trying to organize

160
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,040
shuttles.

161
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,620
We have four of those golf carts

162
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,080
and I'll also be taking the I-van down there

163
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,560
because it's quite a walk.

164
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,820
Now, if any of you actually can walk that far,

165
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,740
that would be great.

166
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,560
We're on our way down to the baptism

167
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,640
in the pond.

168
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,840
It'll be the first time I've ever gotten in that pond.

169
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,980
I bet it's cold as...

170
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,660
Or is it?

171
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,700
It might actually be warm.

172
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,620
It might be gently warm from the sun.

173
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,480
I don't hear any screams.

174
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,620
So it must not be too cold.

175
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,700
Uh-oh.

176
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,220
The pond is this way.

177
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,060
Hey, the pond is this...

178
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,620
Oh.

179
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,080
Okay.

180
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,820
They're not going to the pond?

181
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,780
No, they're just here campers at Listeria.

182
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,480
They're not being baptized.

183
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,920
They don't even care about being baptized.

184
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,120
I don't either, really.

185
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,480
Whose idea was this, anyway?

186
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,160
Legumes or Jesus's?

187
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,720
Legumes.

188
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,300
She drank the Bob water.

189
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,460
I need to pee.

190
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,340
Oh, this would be the perfect place to do it.

191
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,160
Right in the water.

192
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,420
Right, while people go,

193
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,140
gosh, Reverend Stang, you make me feel so warm.

194
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,920
Now, back to this baptism thing, friends.

195
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,180
I promise this is going to be a very short hour of slack.

196
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,500
It won't even be an hour.

197
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,500
It won't?

198
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,100
No.

199
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,480
No.

200
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,020
No, it's not, because the baptism is scheduled at 3.30,

201
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,760
and it's going to take at least 20 minutes for us to get down there

202
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,420
and herd you cowards down there.

203
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:16,360
I know some of you will avoid even the idea of being frog watchers.

204
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,580
This is the one baptism where a frog watcher is literally that,

205
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,980
because there really are frogs.

206
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,060
And you'll see them skittering out of the way

207
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,840
as the elephantine splashing proceeds.

208
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,100
So we're going to stop at 3.10, then?

209
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,900
Is that the deal?

210
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,340
And use the rest of the time to...

211
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,280
At 3 o'clock, I think we should start...

212
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,500
Well, that would give us half an hour to herd them down.

213
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,260
We need half an hour?

214
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,120
It's going to take them half an hour to walk,

215
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,660
and it'll take us a while to get...

216
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,380
I mean, it's going to take...

217
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,140
I'm going to put my bathing suit on

218
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,960
in case anyone was worried about the horrors

219
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,680
of seeing the evil Reverend Stang nude.

220
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,840
You're not going to.

221
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,200
I don't do that anymore.

222
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,780
Too many lawsuits.

223
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,800
I know where they're all looking.

224
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,940
Too many traumas.

225
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,800
Is this our first communicant here?

226
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,620
Ready to achieve baptism?

227
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,680
After this line, it drops off into an utter abyss

228
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,260
whose bottom is not the south.

229
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,080
Stickers?

230
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,380
You know, I'm seeing a white lamb!

231
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,520
Where's my harpoon?

232
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,560
This is me!

233
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,300
Harpoon men!

234
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,560
You'll find it does feel good.

235
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:31,980
Harpoons!

236
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,980
And this brown, bubbling scum that you see on the surface,

237
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,580
they say that's walnut oil.

238
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,020
Oh, I feel your mark!

239
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,120
Preacher can't take it.

240
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,840
How can he block?

241
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,020
He's rising!

242
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,300
I feel...

243
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,720
Oh, my nipples are tightening.

244
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,920
And I have scrotum as shrunk to the size of one marble.

245
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,060
Praise God!

246
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,140
Oh, wow!

247
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,040
Praise God.

248
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,600
And that one.

249
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,300
See that?

250
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,980
And I was here with a man and his son the other day

251
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,560
who were swimming, and he told me a story

252
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,120
about...

253
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,900
Well, perhaps I shouldn't mention that until we all get in the...

254
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,440
Yeah, let's...

255
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,640
If I can do that, the rest of you maggots can, too.

256
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,640
Yes, friends, it is cold.

257
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,400
It's cold, but...

258
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,540
And it's not good, disgusting.

259
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,140
And it's covered with walnut oil.

260
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,280
If you were a rich pink, you'd pay for that spa-like privilege.

261
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,540
That's right.

262
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,980
We are rich, Dr. Howell.

263
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,840
We are richer than they can imagine.

264
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,920
Actually, this is a...

265
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,740
This is the best turnout I've seen for a baptism in a while.

266
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,780
I have the papal robes, but if I get them wet,

267
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,100
they'll shrink on me, and I'll never be able to get them off.

268
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,020
They'll be clammy.

269
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,660
They'll be permanently stuck to me.

270
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,580
They don't want to be clammy.

271
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,300
So the way it works is, Ivan will baptize you,

272
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,740
and I will catch you as you fall back,

273
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:51,300
filled with the divine essence of gobs.

274
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,980
And I almost always manage to do that.

275
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,340
I never miss.

276
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,700
We haven't lost a single person yet.

277
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,740
So who is going to be the first to be baptized on the last X-Day?

278
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,680
If I can get in that water, so can you.

279
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,720
The first shall be the last.

280
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,120
You seem to be ready.

281
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,740
Why don't we do you a favor?

282
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,700
Reverend Eggplant, although we've been through all this before about 20 times...

283
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:21,560
Do you, Reverend Eggplant, swear to continue to express your hatred for the conspiracy,

284
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,680
reject everything it stands for, rejecting all pinkness, and accepting Bob only into your mind, heart, and body?

285
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,880
Say, I do!

286
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,560
I do fuck the pinks.

287
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,120
There we are.

288
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,040
Great job!

289
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,580
Congratulations.

290
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,460
You're reborn.

291
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,800
If you're going to knock them this way, I should be down, too.

292
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,660
I learned a long time ago to keep my glasses on,

293
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,260
because it's the only way to see the parts I want to see.

294
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,820
Which you don't have any of, by the way.

295
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,800
Here's someone. Come on.

296
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,320
Here's someone with some spirit.

297
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,460
I'm Mickey-ing in there, too.

298
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,380
Reverend Mickey Mephistopheles.

299
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,740
Finally, someone who's built.

300
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,080
A nice-looking young man.

301
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,680
Reverend, and this is your first baptism, isn't it?

302
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,140
You've never been baptized in a church before.

303
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,820
I have never been baptized.

304
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,100
Well, it's something one doesn't forget.

305
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,180
I'm clean virgin!

306
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:17,420
Reverend Mickey, do you reject the conspiracy and all its hold upon your life?

307
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,020
The false jobs, the false slack, the false sex, the false money?

308
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,640
Well, maybe the money is okay.

309
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,360
And accept into your heart...

310
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,960
The heart, mind, and other organs.

311
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,800
The word of Bob, the feeling of Bob, the spirit of Bob say, I do, yes!

312
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,260
Abso-fucking-lutely.

313
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,880
Praise God!

314
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,660
Born again!

315
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,160
And reborn again.

316
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:41,400
Woo-hoo!

317
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,620
Born again!

318
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,400
Ah, yes!

319
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,020
Woo-hoo!

320
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,540
All right.

321
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,100
Who is next?

322
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,020
Look, if we get moves, we'll take moves.

323
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:50,860
Keep going.

324
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,820
Looks like we're getting away.

325
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,360
Keep going.

326
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,340
Reverend Dusty Rhodes, I know that you have traveled many, many miles.

327
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,140
I have traveled many, many dusty roads to get here.

328
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,660
I have.

329
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,320
Oh, you do.

330
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,660
And you look a little bit dusty.

331
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,060
We'll take care of that.

332
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:11,600
And so, not only will the dust of the road be wiped from you, although that's all the wiping we plan to do immediately.

333
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,860
I can wash my own ass.

334
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:25,020
If you can, indeed, reject the conspiracy from your heart, mind, and soul, and hair, and everything, and accept Bob from any direction he may come.

335
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,680
Off and from behind.

336
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,280
There's nothing we can do about that.

337
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,580
He comes like a ape in the mud.

338
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,520
Say, I do!

339
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,800
I do!

340
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,780
Praise Bob, and down he goes!

341
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,020
Woo-hoo!

342
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,220
Woo-hoo!

343
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:48,640
I just want to escape the hugger-mugger and hurly-burly of working for the Church of the Subgenius and float off in the calm of a prehistoric puddle out there in the woods.

344
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,160
And I certainly plan to this afternoon, too.

345
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,740
And every damn day, I'm here.

346
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,000
We're getting back to the dirty fuck.

347
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:00,040
I mean, we were having people stepping out of that pool, and they were actually rinsing it off.

348
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,060
How did they do that?

349
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,440
I found that the rinse station doesn't work.

350
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,960
No water comes out.

351
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,280
We turned it off. We turned it off for that reason.

352
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,300
How do you turn it on?

353
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,940
Why would you want to turn it on?

354
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,920
To rinse off those selfsame animalcules and overeager organisms.

355
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,080
See, you're falling into that same trap, Dr. Howell. You're trying to cleanse yourself of that, which is...

356
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,120
No, no, Papa Joe. I'm not.

357
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,420
Clean to begin with.

358
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,920
Because I'm not using...

359
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:30,300
I'm not using conspiracy chemicals and alcohol derivatives and stuff like that.

360
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,000
Sodium silico...

361
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,220
Aluminate and all that godforsaken stuff.

362
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,680
I'm just using water that comes up out of the ground.

363
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,640
But when you go camping, don't you want to be out amongst the wildlife and the little animals and everything?

364
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,700
You have little choice.

365
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,200
They are surrounding you, like in my trailer.

366
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,960
The ants, the spiders, the huge cockroaches that come up out of the drain.

367
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,760
Not a working drain, but they come up out of there.

368
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,980
If you rinse them off, they'll have no place to live.

369
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,740
I don't want them on you.

370
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,380
That's genocide.

371
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,580
There are special things that should be on you and things that you shouldn't.

372
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,800
Just like a country, you want to keep undesirables out and the desirable faction in.

373
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,820
You must not have watched Machete last night if you're saying that.

374
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,140
You are your own nation.

375
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,820
You want to make sure that there are only the proper inhabitants.

376
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:24,740
And once again, as yesterday, I will mention, there is a specific type of arthropod...

377
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,440
that lives in your eyelash.

378
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,340
And another that lives in your eyebrow.

379
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:36,060
If you keep rubbing conspiracy chemicals into your face, for whatever reason, they gin up.

380
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,180
You will discourage these essential critters from living there.

381
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,820
And any skin problems or itching or anything like that that you have as a result...

382
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:54,640
will be interpreted by you as that you need more conspiracy poison to rub in the crevices of your skin.

383
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,960
I recommend Spray Lotrimine.

384
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,600
Spray Lotrimine Powder.

385
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,680
In fact, you'll see it referenced in this program book.

386
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,540
Spray Lotrimine.

387
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,200
It keeps them sliding.

388
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,060
Men.

389
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,580
If a new schism were to develop the so-called Christian scientist version of the subgenius...

390
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:19,820
in which any sort of disease would be allowed to carry on its natural state within the subgenius body...

391
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,100
Clap your hands three times and say, be gone.

392
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,720
Disease, leave this subgenius.

393
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,820
In the power of Bob.

394
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,220
He wouldn't want you to have it. He wouldn't give you that...

395
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,160
Well, some diseases are educational.

396
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,800
It's fulfilling your divine destiny to allow that disease to...

397
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,240
Well, you'll fulfill your divine destiny and I'll fill mine.

398
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,020
So you're going to keep on taking those showers. You're going to keep on eliminating those...

399
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:50,860
There is no shower, thanks to some interfering busybodies who turned off the rinsing station.

400
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,500
It was for your own good, Hal.

401
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:59,580
Well, you have to get out covered with the primordial slime and march back covered with the primordial slime.

402
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,460
But it's still fun and I recommend it.

403
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:09,180
We'll keep that in mind. Remember, there's always the towel that will reintroduce that same bacteria because they don't get washed.

404
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,500
Well, speak for yourself. Perhaps you don't have a laundry service established.

405
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,800
Not here, dear friend.

406
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,420
I can't speak on this subject, but...

407
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,480
Well, there's a perfect solution.

408
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,980
There's a perfectly good shower house up top there.

409
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,620
I go there every day.

410
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,020
With a nice trail.

411
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:37,960
Well, see, again, creeps use it and leave disgusting condoms hanging on things and they don't wash out the sinks after they hawk phlegm into them and so on.

412
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,960
Now you're going to be one of those people who's also going to complain about the alternating heat that we installed there so that it doesn't stay too hot too long.

413
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,340
Yes, I've noticed. You get the hot water in the shower, you step under it and presto, it turns ice cold.

414
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,580
That's awesome. We do that.

415
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,360
It flicks back to hot and cold and hot. It really keeps you on your toes.

416
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:01,460
You're not appreciating. We had that installed so that you'd be able to enjoy the hot water all the more.

417
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,980
Yes, you can't experience heat unless you experience a little cold.

418
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:14,040
You know, people pay a lot of money to go to these fancy spas where they can go into the hot sauna and then go and jump out in the cold water and then get back out and go in the hot sauna.

419
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:21,520
That's it, but you're supposed to be switched with birch twigs by a stern, horse-faced old lady with white hair while you're...

420
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:21,560
Yes, that's it. But you're supposed to be switched with birch twigs by a stern, horse-faced old lady with white hair while you're...

421
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:29,860
running naked through the snow. Then you have to run back into the sauna and almost broil alive while everything squirts out through the pores.

422
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:39,960
And then into the Arctic sub-zero water that causes a huge cloud of steam to rise as your flesh splashes into place.

423
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,240
Which sub-genius denomination does that?

424
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:50,160
That's the way the classic Finnish sauna is set up and believe me, the word Finnish is advisable to use there.

425
00:18:50,160 --> 00:19:02,860
Well, I'm sure you heard about that poor sub-genius who was just hit up with 15 counts of manslaughter for the people in the sweat lodge that they locked in there and kept in there until they dropped like flies.

426
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:10,420
I'm not sure that the skin should be an organ of elimination, but the sauna philosophy says that it is.

427
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:18,560
They were just trying to exercise for themselves the sin and bad deeds that they had done through their lives.

428
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,140
And what better place to do that than in the hot sauna?

429
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,140


430
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,200
It's nice to have the illusion that there's some way to get clean from the blackening sins of man.

431
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,520
Alright, next please.

432
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,520
I can't wait.

433
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,160
It's Reverend Teeters.

434
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,620
The aptly named Teeters Laverg.

435
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,240
Hey, you got something to feel about him?

436
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,200
That cold?

437
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,240
Yeah, it'll shrink down in a second.

438
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,440
It is a little chilly in here.

439
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,200
It's like a rough Miami.

440
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,140
Is there some joke about glasses and...

441
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,140


442
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:59,760
Anyway, Reverend Teeters Laverg, you have served Bob so well and provided so many services.

443
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,460
He speaks highly of your many, many services.

444
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,500
And he's too safe.

445
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,040
Yes, he said you were a tight fellow and a good agent.

446
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:20,120
And I know that you, as well as anyone, have already rejected the conspiracy from the public.

447
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,140
You have been a good friend to him from your balls all the way up to the top of your head and down to the tippy-tip-tip of your toes.

448
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,760
And that you have accepted Bob, we can tell by the size of the wound back there.

449
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,700
Praise Teeters, praise Bob. Hail Connie, you are safe!

450
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,740
I just got a new sin going.

451
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,300
Reverend Teeters is fighting most of his Peeters.

452
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,960
Oh, beautiful young lady.

453
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,720
Finally.

454
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,400
Very tiny.

455
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:45,860
I know.

456
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,280
I'm not a peeper.

457
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,640
I'm a peeper.

458
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:48,860
I'm a peeper.

459
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,140
There are.

460
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,560
Too much of it.

461
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,260
He's so sad.

462
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,900
I'm proud of him.

463
00:20:52,980 --> 00:21:04,480
Reverend Peyton, do you continue your hating of the conspiracy and your loving of Bob and Connie and your subgenius brethren who will be partying with you on the spaceship set?

464
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,840
Fuck yeah!

465
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,640
Fuck yeah!

466
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,300
Mark that one!

467
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,860
Speaking of half-cocked...

468
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,290
Don't be embarrassed if some...

469
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:22,250
We really do want to Bob-tize you in the pond.

470
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,290
And we will.

471
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,270
I know that people are shy.

472
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,630
Look, if you've only got one penis, boys, don't worry.

473
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,810
You're not the only one.

474
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,730
I know for sure I've seen several subgen...

475
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,970
For sure dues-paying subgeniuses.

476
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,730
And plus, you know, I mean, it's kind of chilly.

477
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,770
You're in front of people.

478
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,030
Some of them retract.

479
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,850
The smaller ones become almost invisible.

480
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,390
And the large ones just look like legs.

481
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,490
One thing is, if you've been down there, here's what you can find at the pond.

482
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,870
There's a small kiddie pool-like area that is roped off.

483
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:05,750
The rest is an enormous chasm of enormous depth that no one can reach the bottom or know how deep it actually is.

484
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,270
It's made from a quarry.

485
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,890
And it would be pointless to Bob-tize people there.

486
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,830
Although they might want to swim out there after that.

487
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,850
After we finish with them.

488
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,830
But the faithful may have to line up on the bank or something.

489
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:25,710
I just don't see that kiddie pool area as being large enough to contain the entire contingent.

490
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,330
But maybe we'll figure out a way on site.

491
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:34,390
Well, and if, say, you don't really want to wade into that muddy-looking water,

492
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,090
or you don't want to take your clothes off, or even wear a bathing suit or something,

493
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,950
we, the preachers, will be happy to come out and sprinkle you.

494
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,810
Like I was sprinkled.

495
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,850
I was sprinkled as a baby.

496
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,250
Sprinkled?

497
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,150
Against my will.

498
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,590
I was baptized in the Methodist Church.

499
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:54,150
And the baptismal font water began to boil at that moment.

500
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:59,750
They just, you know, they didn't ask me whether I wanted to be baptized.

501
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,170
They just sprinkled me with some kind of damn holy water.

502
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,470
And that's where I got the scars on my neck.

503
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:04,690
You didn't ask to be born, either.

504
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,210
If anybody ever wondered about that.

505
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,110
It's like Dracula.

506
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,630
It sizzles and burns like acid.

507
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,370
They should have known.

508
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,810
My parents were really nice.

509
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,770
They were not very religious.

510
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,790
They should have gone to the Unitarian Church.

511
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,070
Well, it takes time to learn these things.

512
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:26,830
Yes, in about five minutes, we'll start the active purging.

513
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:27,710
Five minutes?

514
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,450
Reverend Eighty!

515
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,490
Reverend Stanley.

516
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:34,230
I've only been formally introduced once, but I've seen your name many, many times.

517
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:38,950
I know that you are a saved subjeetist, but this is your chance to finally be...

518
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,790
Truly baptized.

519
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,010
...completely covered with walnut oil.

520
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:49,430
Do you reject the conspiracy and all the bullshit, all the anguish and boredom that

521
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:54,930
goes with that, and instead trade it in for the slack that comes with Jarrah Bob Dobbs'

522
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,410
say yes for elegant...

523
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,330
Yes, I do!

524
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:58,770
Woo-hoo!

525
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,770
Praise Bob!

526
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,410
Fuck Connie!

527
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,330
Fuck you!

528
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,410
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

529
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,450
Oh, Reverend Buddy Day.

530
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,610
You just finished a perfectly fit live session.

531
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,590
Hollywood glamor.

532
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,770
Hollywood glamor.

533
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:13,790


534
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:13,790


535
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:13,790


536
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:13,790


537
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:13,790


538
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:13,790


539
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:13,790


540
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:14,470
We're going there.

541
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,070
We're going there.

542
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,190
Yes.

543
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:15,210


544
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:22,330
Reverend Buddy Day, we know from the disgusting nature of your work that you have already

545
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:30,070
rejected the conspiracy in all of its end-all decency, human decency, or general socially

546
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:37,190
accepted behavior, and have celebrated and exploited your abnormality to the max in the

547
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,950
name of Bob, in the name of Connie, and in the premise of X-Day.

548
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,170
Praise Buddy Day!

549
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,950
Praise Bob Bailey!

550
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:43,610
Hail Connie!

551
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,190
Praise Bob!

552
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:44,630
Praise Bob!

553
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:45,950
Praise Bob!

554
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:46,830
Praise Bob!

555
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,310
Praise Bob!

556
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:48,950
Praise Bob!

557
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:53,690
Oh, Reverend Stick, the fine Reverend Stick.

558
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,750
Great bass playing, by the way.

559
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,070
Thank you.

560
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,930
Wonderful music last night.

561
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,870
Scott is yours, I am, boy?

562
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,670
Yes, I am.

563
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,670
The tattoo is very amateurish, I wrote.

564
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,510
Yeah.

565
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,770
You're a prison man.

566
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,030
Yeah.

567
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:08,010
No, it's done in a way that gives it authenticity.

568
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:13,590
You reject a juror from your case.

569
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,590


570
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,590


571
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,590


572
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,590


573
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,590


574
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,590


575
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,870
You reject a juror from your case.

576
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:13,870


577
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:13,870


578
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:13,870


579
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,330
You have to find a way to keep yourself, all of the horrors of the conspiracy, the

580
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:21,450
crap, the boredom, the everything else I've mentioned with everyone, and accept Bob, and

581
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:26,550
take him into your lungs in a deep, deep breath, and hold it, hold it, take a deep breath,

582
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,590
and hold it, my friend.

583
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,610
All right, you ready?

584
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,310
Under he goes!

585
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,070
Under he goes.

586
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,030
I'll give it up to Bob!

587
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,090
Oh, yeah!

588
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,610
There he is!

589
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,070
There's Bobby!

590
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:37,710
All right, guys!

591
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,050
Just go to the other one!

592
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:39,650
Yeah!

593
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:39,710
All right.

594
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,570
I'm going to the other one.

595
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:43,570


596
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:54,690
Bus drivers should line up their carts here, and anyone who needs a ride down to the pond should hop in, grab your trunks or not.

597
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,610
There is...

598
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,430
Bring towels.

599
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,850
Bring towels.

600
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,310
Yeah, towels would be good.

601
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,850
You can put them on that old log by the pond.

602
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:08,130
Oh, and don't mistake that other old log.

603
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,410
It's not a log.

604
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,690
That's old sequal.

605
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,830
That's old sequal.

606
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,890
Yeah, you don't want to get...

607
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:13,610
That log moves.

608
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,130
Don't anger.

609
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:19,010
If you see the little tongue sticking out, don't go trying to play with it.

610
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,590
He will bite your arm off.

611
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,890
At least.

612
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,050
So, that is it.

613
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,550
Thank you.

614
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:32,090
Reverend Slander Bob, recipient of the Bobby Award for Best New Subgenius Show, because it's always on and never stops.

615
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,810
Look at that tattoo.

616
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,470
Wow.

617
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,650
Do you reject the conspiracies?

618
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,530
Damn near everything, except possibly the occasional high paycheck.

619
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:51,310
And if they have help, it will, you know, benefit.

620
00:26:51,710 --> 00:27:00,730
And accept into your heart and mind the slackfulness of J.R. Bob Dobbs and the craftiness and greed of Connie Dobbs.

621
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:01,850
What?

622
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:05,190
Yes, I do!

623
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:05,930
I love the song.

624
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:06,530
Ah!

625
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

626
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,850
Slander Bob is making his way to land where he would become Slander Bob.

627
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,970
All right, let's get somebody else.

628
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:18,510
Can you come?

629
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:18,770
Yeah.

630
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,270
There's a huge crowd here.

631
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:23,130
I'm worried about the length of time this is going to take.

632
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,830
But here, here comes someone who's fully in the sea.

633
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,590
Here's a man who is prepared for an old sea crawl.

634
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,130
He's ready to do battle in the deepest parts of the conspiracy ocean.

635
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:40,450
Don't do this in the ocean, folks, because yellow is what causes sharks to attack.

636
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,170
You don't brush water on sharks.

637
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:42,590
Yeah.

638
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:42,990
Perfect.

639
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:50,950
Reverend Zeronius, who risks electrocution tonight when he plays his synthesizers soaking wet.

640
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,250
Yeah.

641
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,030
And by the way, we mentioned this water never dries.

642
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:54,990
It's a special kind.

643
00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:04,810
Anyway, you must surely reject the conspiracy and all its evil things and most of its good things, too.

644
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:10,530
And accept Bob and all of his evil things and all of his good things, too.

645
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,070
And Connie and so forth.

646
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,770
Praise Bob.

647
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,290
Praise Reverend Zeronius.

648
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,790
And under his shoes, Bob.

649
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,150
Woo-hoo!

650
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,770
Get his clothing off.

651
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,990
Put your clothes back on.

652
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,770
I'm wetter than I've ever been.

653
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:22,870
Woo-hoo!

654
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,250
Oh.

655
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,630
Oh, a rubber duck.

656
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:27,590
It's fun.

657
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,470
It's relaxing.

658
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,510
And it's necessary.

659
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,950
You get this segment over with.

660
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,250
Oh, here comes Pantyara.

661
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,910
Oh, Pantyara.

662
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,430
Oddly enough.

663
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:38,850
I know I'm close.

664
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,230
I'm dressed more than she has been.

665
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:41,370
You're maybe close.

666
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,070


667
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:42,770
I'm too dark.

668
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:51,470
Pantyara has purchased the important, perfect cup design by Reverend Imberture, the greatest

669
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:56,210
troll master, with this sort of clean bob.

670
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,930
This is the George Clooney bob.

671
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,850
We'll be sprinkling you, Mike.

672
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,570
It says here, I drank the Bob water.

673
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,210
She drank the Bob water.

674
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,490
She drank of the Bob water.

675
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,570
Don't you drink it, I've had two.

676
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,290
Oh, no.

677
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,050
Do you know what I'm talking about?

678
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:12,050


679
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:12,050


680
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:12,050


681
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:18,290
All right, right on top of the head, Pantyara, do you reject the conspiracy and all of its

682
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:25,490
crap and infections and diseases and bad feelings and accept Bob and his diseases only?

683
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:26,570
Shit, yeah.

684
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,450
Shit, yeah.

685
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,650
Shit, yeah.

686
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,210
Yeah, Pantyara.

687
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,910
Reverend Give-A-Shit, whose name I always forget for similar reasons.

688
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,050
Do you, sir, accept Bob's name?

689
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:42,050


690
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:47,570
Accept Bob into your mind and heart and wherever else he happens to go exploring and reject

691
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:53,730
the conspiracy and all of its coatings and disgusting things that it covers you with.

692
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,030
Oh, we'll try it again.

693
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:55,790
Okay.

694
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:09,250
Well, handing back to our good friend, Geoffrey Chaucer, he was not only an accomplished writer,

695
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,830
but he was also a government servant.

696
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:11,990
Oh, yeah.

697
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:17,250
He worked within the government of the, well, you would call it the government, but it was

698
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:21,010
the court, the king, a result of the Norman conquest.

699
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:25,430
And he was unquestionably a subgenius in training.

700
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:29,810
And yet, if you read the Canterbury Tales, you can tell that the people in those characters

701
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:33,030
have not changed now for lo these many hundreds of years.

702
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:39,890
And this is a true meaning of being a subgenius is not letting the other people around you,

703
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,550
the typical conspiracy types.

704
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,430
Know that you are a subgenius.

705
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,290
You may hold down that conspiracy job.

706
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:53,910
You may even play up to the power figures and be someone that the folks who are running

707
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,810
the show think that they can depend on.

708
00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:00,650
But deep down in your inner workings and hidden mechanisms within your mind, it is true who

709
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,610
you really are.

710
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:06,830
And now, these hundreds of years later, all the kings have been forgotten.

711
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:11,530
The queens, the court jesters, everyone else in that court except Geoffrey Chaucer.

712
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:11,530


713
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,050
The man who put the English language on the map.

714
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:19,950
And now it is the French who, at that time, they were the center of the universe.

715
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,330
Everyone wrote all their stories in French.

716
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:27,910
And if you, anyone who was anyone spoke French, now they look upon contemptuously as English

717
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:33,730
has surpassed them and all because this subgenius Chaucer decided to write his homespun tales

718
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:41,070
about faggots and knights and nuns and corrupt individuals within the positions of authority.

719
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,050
already, but show their dark underbelly.

720
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,010
They all get to heaven, though, except for one

721
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,830
person who rides away from the

722
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,930
procession, and that is the alchemist

723
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,670
who's performed evil

724
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,810
sorcery. And the fact that he rides

725
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,650
away means he's not gonna

726
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,890
get there. But

727
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,130
the French have always

728
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,950
attacked England

729
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,790
in every way possible, and one of the ways

730
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,970
to attack their literature with

731
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,730
such people as

732
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,050
Baudrillard and so on

733
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,850
to suck the meaning

734
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,750
out of

735
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,270
English language things.

736
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,510
And it's all part of that old

737
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,410
rivalry. Incidentally,

738
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,570
J.R.R. Tolkien wrote

739
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,410
The Lord of the Rings to be

740
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,330
the English national epic,

741
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,430
since he felt that the knights

742
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,590
of King Arthur, which are supposed to be that,

743
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,230
are actually French, with

744
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,230
Lancelot du Lac and

745
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,130
Sir Gromore

746
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,130
and so forth.

747
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,010
They're Frenchified

748
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,390
things, and not like

749
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:40,830
French.

750
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,490
Tolkien's creation, which is

751
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,850
so often misunderstood.

752
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,750
With nice, hearty American names

753
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,870
like Sting.

754
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,850
Sting is the name

755
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,350
of a knife, but

756
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,590
of course people used to name their knives,

757
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,570
and I used to name mine.

758
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,690
When I was a kid, I went

759
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,770
across the Mexican border, and in a

760
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,710
trinket stand, I got a

761
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,710
neat little knife. I wish I still had it.

762
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,830
On the blade, it said,

763
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,570
No hay javelin que ande

764
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,050
gordo.

765
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,150
I guess that meant

766
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,450
there can be no fat

767
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:15,790
sparrowhawk.

768
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,410
Did you remember the names of your

769
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,030
knives? Well, that one,

770
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,350
Gordo. Did you bury

771
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,990
them when they were no longer

772
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,070
in service? No, Papa Joe. I was a

773
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,310
thoughtless, foolish kid, and I

774
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,110
lost track of many of my

775
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,050
early treasures. Well, I have a whole cemetery

776
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,610
out in my backyard of

777
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,410
treasures that were no longer

778
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,470
functional. You know that burying a knife

779
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,030
is a specific part of certain

780
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,590
surgical operations.

781
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,030
You don't just throw it away. How about those

782
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,830
pair of shoes that you wore

783
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,710
traveling the highways and byways?

784
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,970
Are you taunting me? You know you can't

785
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,390
do that. But I do.

786
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,810
I place all those shoes in little

787
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,690
cardboard boxes and bury them out back

788
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:58,270
along with the skulls of the normals.

789
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,410
Fiendish subgenius

790
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:00,610
ideas.

791
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,010
You should see all the headstones.

792
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,990
All I can say is that if you have

793
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,970
a little, I was talking about a

794
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,070
werewolf problem earlier. If you have

795
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:10,270
a

796
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,730
another type of problem, a vampire

797
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,010
problem, and you know, you're not

798
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,990
even allowed to say bad things about

799
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:19,050
these creeps anymore. Vampires

800
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,070
and werewolves, they just have a bad disease.

801
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,990
We have to understand them. Anyway,

802
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,970
there's no problem with walking

803
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:26,710
around in broad daylight.

804
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,750
If you just, if you have shoes,

805
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,710
you put a little coffin earth

806
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,890
in your shoes under a

807
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:34,910
layer of cardboard or wood,

808
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,010
then out in the sun, you can

809
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,090
do it. Just a tip.

810
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:40,690
I like him to stay close.

811
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,690
Then there's the collection of

812
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,790
exotic animals, pets. It's also

813
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,030
the pet cemetery. They only seem exotic

814
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,630
to those who aren't familiar with those

815
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,630
particular species.

816
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,710
Well, I mentioned the other day that

817
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,370
the pet of choice now is

818
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,610
descented skunks. But

819
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,510
armadillos also make wonderful pets.

820
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,150
I bet they're different.

821
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:01,830
Exactly.

822
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,890
Armadillos can break every bone

823
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,810
in your skull. They leap

824
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,730
up when you're not expecting and crack

825
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,410
you with their shell.

826
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,350
And they give you leprosy.

827
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,670
What a lovely trait in a

828
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,010
pet.

829
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:20,830
Well, you know, you'd have

830
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,910
to be very adventurous to discover

831
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,730
that difference on your own.

832
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,870
But you know, a lot of those things are just

833
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,950
mean-spirited

834
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,630
allegations made towards

835
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,010
people claim that turtles can carry leprosy

836
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,650
too. No, they don't. They can.

837
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,090
Turtles? Yeah. Carry leprosy?

838
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,970
You have to be exposed to it

839
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,770
though. I mean, if they're not... I've never heard of it.

840
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,470
Even armadillos don't...

841
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,790
That sounds like someone was drawing the long bow

842
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,610
a little bit. Armadillos don't spontaneously

843
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,990
generate leprosy. They have to be exposed

844
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,790
to it. And they can carry leprosy

845
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,050
just as rats. Rats can carry

846
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,050
the plague, but they have to be... Yes, and all the mice

847
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,730
in my trailer are probably

848
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,270
seething with hantavirus.

849
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,950
But, actually, the world is probably

850
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,890
a lot more deadly

851
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,850
than we think. Only the blessing

852
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,650
of ignorance allows us to

853
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,830
walk through, to thread

854
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,530
the needle through a sea

855
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,370
of perils.

856
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,310
A sea of perils? Perils.

857
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,410
Like, wow, Stang

858
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,890
changed into Pisces.

859
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,650
Who says the age of miracles is dead?

860
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,050
We were thinking of

861
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,510
the pond and all the

862
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,430
critters that lurk beneath

863
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,490
its surface and in its depths.

864
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,650
But look at this audience. Do you think

865
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,710
this audience is weak enough to be

866
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,370
taken down by a mere

867
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,850
microbial enemy?

868
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,710
I think those microbes are the

869
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,390
most powerful things on Earth, and

870
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,490
everyone ought to have a healthy respect for them.

871
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,730
What about anal lamprey?

872
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,670
That would be one disappointed lamprey

873
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,410
in my case.

874
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,570
I think whatever's living in that pond

875
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,790
as far as the microbes are concerned,

876
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,650
they're going to be frightened of the new

877
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,610
microbes that are going to be introduced

878
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,790
after this audience goes into that pond.

879
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,030
Exactly, I mean...

880
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,850
You should ask

881
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,610
Stang about that one. He's seen

882
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,610
some remarkable sexual behavior

883
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,710
on the micro-label through his

884
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,050
home microscope.

885
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,810
Lab, which he brought out here

886
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,770
to test the waters of the lagoon.

887
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,250
But you can always wear your

888
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,350
subgenius condom with Connie

889
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,450
or Bob's head on it. Just don't leave it

890
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,630
in the wash house after it's been

891
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,870
used so that I step on it in the morning.

892
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,490
And please don't leave it in anyone's tent.

893
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,530
Just make sure you tie it down

894
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,310
with a hefty rubber band

895
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,270
so if there's any shrinkage that occurs

896
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,230
inside the pond, it doesn't remain

897
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,230
floating on the surface.

898
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,150
And...

899
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:39,590
Go ahead.

900
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,370
We'll call in the

901
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,230
creature of the black legume over there.

902
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,470
It's already been discovered, so you don't have

903
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,290
the discoverer's privilege, but sometimes

904
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,030
a good name just sticks.

905
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,190
Because it's so obviously appropriate.

906
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,350
Inappropriate?

907
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,310
Appropriate.

908
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:54,950
Appropriate.

909
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,650
I hear they also drain that

910
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,150
pond every once in a while.

911
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,930
They do? Man, that takes the fun out of everything.

912
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,890
They can't drain it. It's connected to

913
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,890
river systems. It would be far

914
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,510
too much work. Why would they do that?

915
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:09,010
It doesn't mean they drain it completely, but I'd like to think

916
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:09,790
that sometimes...

917
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,130
Say it's filtered. The question is,

918
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,690
filtered from what?

919
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,930
What do they filter out?

920
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,750
They filter out

921
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,450
the filtering.

922
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,790
The filtering

923
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,570
by Stephen King, America's

924
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,630
most popular author.

925
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,310
What's in pond water?

926
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:30,730
One dollar.

927
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:31,670
Who's got it?

928
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,450
Our great auctioneer friends,

929
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,010
the new auctioneer, Janice Blackseed,

930
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,850
who will probably

931
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,570
be spreading...

932
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,250
Blackseed all through this...

933
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,090
One kid of two.

934
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,530
Do you reject the conspiracy

935
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,370
and all of its effects,

936
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,730
except for the money part,

937
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,270
and accept Bob

938
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,910
and his money into your brain,

939
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,090
your wallet, and

940
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,010
so forth and so on?

941
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,270
Your pre-puss. Let's do this.

942
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,010
Alright. Down he goes!

943
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,270
Next!

944
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:05,970
Oh, yeah.

945
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,090
What do you get used to?

946
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,230
Oh, man.

947
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:09,950
Woo!

948
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,050
Hazel, do you,

949
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,930
in this moment of slackfulness...

950
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,770
She's giving it thought this time.

951
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,950
Reject the conspiracy

952
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:24,030
and the abhorrent things

953
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,230
associated with it,

954
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,010
and accept Bob and the wonderful,

955
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,650
beautiful things associated with him and Connie,

956
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,870
plus any parts that happens to

957
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,570
end up thrown in.

958
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,290
Great decision!

959
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,570
Rise, Hazel!

960
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,570
Woo!

961
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:40,610


962
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:42,610
Woo!

963
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,170
Woo!

964
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:44,370
Woo!

965
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:44,550


966
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:44,550


967
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,670
Woo!

968
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:45,670


969
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:45,670


970
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:45,670


971
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:45,670


972
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,290
I like the abatement.

973
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,150
Praise all the Hazel!

974
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,150
Very smart.

975
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:49,950
Very irreverent.

976
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:51,850
Reverend Scum,

977
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,470
uh,

978
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:53,570
uh,

979
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:54,810
do you

980
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,070
reject the conspiracy

981
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,910
and the pinks

982
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,250
and the mediocritans,

983
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,410
and the cage dwellers,

984
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,510
the Barbies and Kens,

985
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,110
and all those other derogatory terms we made up,

986
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,130
and accept the subgeniuses,

987
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:07,950
the overmen,

988
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,070
Bob, Connie,

989
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,570
the exodus, and so forth,

990
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,270
and so on, say, uh, yeah, or whatever?

991
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:12,870
Yes!

992
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:13,770
Woo!

993
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:14,390
Yeah!

994
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,230
Yeah!

995
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,090
Yeah!

996
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:16,430
Yeah!

997
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:17,510
Woo!

998
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,250
All right.

999
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,330
What do you got, Doctor?

1000
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,410
Tawdry milk toast.

1001
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,750
What a horrible sentence.

1002
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:25,970
Mismilter.

1003
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:26,630
Maybe.

1004
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:27,490
Maybe.

1005
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:27,970
Yeah.

1006
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,770
Uh, do you

1007
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,750
tawdry milk toast?

1008
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,690
God, that just...

1009
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,150
Ugh.

1010
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:34,850
Come on.

1011
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,750
Okay, you reject the conspiracy,

1012
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,190
and all of its, uh,

1013
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:38,870
crap,

1014
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:39,970
and accept Bob,

1015
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:40,610
and Connie,

1016
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,090
and the exodus,

1017
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,150
and so forth into your life.

1018
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,250
Okay, boss.

1019
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:43,830
Okay!

1020
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:44,690
All right!

1021
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,270
Woo!

1022
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,110
Woo-hoo!

1023
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:47,930
Good job!

1024
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,510
Easy back down now.

1025
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:50,290
Yes.

1026
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:50,510
Woo!

1027
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,350
Perfect.

1028
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,890
They're piled up like cordwood.

1029
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,350
Okay.

1030
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,270
We're getting here.

1031
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,170
Good bodies.

1032
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:00,750
All right, Robin.

1033
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,490
Look how they gleam and glisten.

1034
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:03,170
Ah!

1035
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,390
Good life.

1036
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:04,730
Ah!

1037
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,190
Reverend Blank Stare.

1038
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,710
Reverend Blank Stare,

1039
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:10,990
I see by your, uh,

1040
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,070
green wristband

1041
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,050
and the gigantic penis

1042
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,630
that you are a man of Bob,

1043
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:18,170
uh, and accept Bob only

1044
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,090
and reject the conspiracy.

1045
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,610
Is that not so?

1046
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,530
That is exactly so!

1047
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,130
It is so!

1048
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:23,850
Let it be so!

1049
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,150
Perfume down!

1050
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,030
Down under!

1051
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,890
He makes a big slant.

1052
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,630
The new guy who everybody thought

1053
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,790
looks kind of like Bob,

1054
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,290
but I don't know why they say that.

1055
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:36,830
Ah!

1056
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:38,950
Reverend Dapper.

1057
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,070
Uh, Dapper.

1058
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,590
Dapper.

1059
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:41,730


1060
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:42,250
Oh, of course.

1061
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:42,970
Reverend Dapper.

1062
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,670
Uh, do you reject the conspiracy

1063
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,510
and all its, uh, crap?

1064
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,950
And accept Bob

1065
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:51,170
in the name of hurrying up the ceremony.

1066
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,430
Ha ha ha!

1067
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:52,970
Ha ha ha!

1068
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:53,330
No!

1069
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:54,290
No!

1070
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:55,310
Woo!

1071
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:56,130
Woo!

1072
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:57,870
Reverend Esther.

1073
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:58,730
Reverend Esther,

1074
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,870
glad to meet you finally.

1075
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:00,290
Yeah.

1076
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:02,150
Um, see you on the saucers,

1077
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,170
uh, in a little while.

1078
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:03,830
Yeah.

1079
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,570
Uh, do you reject the conspiracy

1080
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:06,610
and all it stands for?

1081
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,290
Fuck yeah!

1082
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,030
And, uh,

1083
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:08,170
is there any other questions?

1084
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:08,170


1085
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,370
I mean, there's especially things like, uh,

1086
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,730
bras and real things.

1087
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:12,810
And, uh,

1088
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:13,530
accept Bob

1089
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:14,610
in the word of Connie.

1090
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:15,590
Yes!

1091
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,450
Praise Bob!

1092
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,050
Hey, Connie!

1093
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,010
Praise Bob!

1094
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:18,150
Yeah!

1095
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:19,550
Woohoo!

1096
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,270
What the hell?

1097
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,750
Hey!

1098
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,770
Thank you for visiting us.

1099
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,950
The baptism is just a kind of a fun extra.

1100
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,010
And, you know,

1101
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,890
we hope to see the girls

1102
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:30,890
take their shirts off.

1103
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:31,470
You know,

1104
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,690
some of us

1105
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:33,770
never get to see

1106
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:34,630
that kind of thing.

1107
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:34,870
You know,

1108
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:35,830
that's another reason

1109
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:36,870
for having X Day.

1110
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,150
Let some of these poor little girls

1111
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:38,150


1112
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:38,150


1113
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:38,150


1114
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,250
on some subgeniuses

1115
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,150
see what a girl looks like.

1116
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,010
I don't want to win!

1117
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,910
My ass has picked up smoking, yeah.

1118
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,630
That's just kind of ironic.

1119
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,530
I think Dr. Leguim

1120
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,590
was probably the person

1121
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,410
who invented the,

1122
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,090
the, uh,

1123
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:50,870
the, uh,

1124
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:51,230
both the,

1125
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,370
the Bobtism

1126
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,170
and the Bobcircumcision.

1127
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,890
That's why it's an honor.

1128
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,230
It is not a great honor.

1129
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,550
I was first baptized

1130
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,710
by Dr. Leguim.

1131
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:00,910
That's true.

1132
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:01,870
And now,

1133
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:02,430
finally,

1134
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,830
I get to return the favor.

1135
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:04,990
And I don't need

1136
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:05,510
to go through

1137
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,770
any of that hogwash

1138
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:07,250
with you.

1139
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:07,850
That's right.

1140
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,150
I'm not going to go

1141
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:08,150


1142
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:08,170


1143
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,410
I've already signed the form.

1144
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:11,570
Yes, he has.

1145
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,670
Dr. Leguim

1146
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:13,510
has signed the form.

1147
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:15,050
And so,

1148
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,170
we need to only

1149
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,190
make you wet.

1150
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:18,190
That's right.

1151
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:18,950
You need to only

1152
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:19,570
make me wet.

1153
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:20,050
Yes.

1154
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:21,050
Price Bob,

1155
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:22,410
hail Dr. Leguim.

1156
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:23,630
And good luck

1157
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:24,750
catching him down!

1158
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:25,390
All right!

1159
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:26,450
Bam!

1160
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:28,770
Most of you

1161
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:29,690
here are going to be

1162
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,110
wearing the

1163
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:30,670
black t-shirt

1164
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:31,010
contact.

1165
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:32,030
That's right.

1166
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:34,850
All right.

1167
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:35,070
Buddy,

1168
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,550
I got a $10,000 shirt.

1169
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:37,550
Wow!

1170
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,110
I'm going to

1171
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:38,150
get a $10,000 shirt.

1172
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:39,550
And clerical collar.

1173
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,310
By the way,

1174
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,610
you're all in 3D now.

1175
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:43,690
3D!

1176
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,150
Newly ordained

1177
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,010
Reverend Jacob.

1178
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:46,650
Come on, boys.

1179
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,830
Do you reject

1180
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:48,510
the conspiracy

1181
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:49,490
and any bad

1182
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,590
distribution deals

1183
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:51,490
you guys might happen

1184
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:51,830
to get?

1185
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,510
Or especially ones

1186
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,070
that would reflect

1187
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,630
poorly on me personally

1188
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,270
and my trademark?

1189
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:56,630
He wanted it rejected.

1190
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:57,790
I do.

1191
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,010
And except Bob

1192
00:43:59,010 --> 00:43:59,610
in your life,

1193
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,070
you are now

1194
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:01,590
baptized

1195
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:02,870
in the name of Bob!

1196
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:03,650
Yeah!

1197
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:05,130
Yeah!

1198
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:06,450
Thank you,

1199
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:06,670
and you.

1200
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:08,010
All right.

1201
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,150


1202
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:09,650
We've got a million

1203
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:10,130
of you.

1204
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:10,610
All right.

1205
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,190
Be fitting

1206
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,350
by my right winger stance,

1207
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:16,530
I would be willing

1208
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:17,850
to do a one-toe...

1209
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,330
A one-toe?

1210
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:20,950
A one-toe baptism.

1211
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:21,990
I would assume

1212
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,310
it would be the right baptism.

1213
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:23,930
Okay.

1214
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:26,870
We can just sprinkle

1215
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:27,490
you a little bit.

1216
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,450
Can we do it

1217
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:29,030
through your shoe?

1218
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:29,870
Yes,

1219
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:30,590
through my shoe.

1220
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,290
As little dignity

1221
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:34,370
as I could spare.

1222
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:34,750
All right.

1223
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:36,610
We've got

1224
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:37,370
a million of you.

1225
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:37,770


1226
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:37,810


1227
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:38,030
All right.

1228
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:38,150
We've got a million of you.

1229
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,190
That's right.

1230
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:39,670
Friends,

1231
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,790
our good friend,

1232
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:41,510
Mr. Sister,

1233
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,090
who happens to be

1234
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:43,930
the subgenius

1235
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:44,830
that we eat dinner with

1236
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:45,990
every Friday in Cleveland,

1237
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,330
except this last Friday.

1238
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:47,550
Yeah.

1239
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,310
I know you rejected

1240
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:49,850
the conspiracy

1241
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,230
because you retired.

1242
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:52,290
I retired,

1243
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:52,750
yes.

1244
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,870
And you accepted Bob

1245
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,270
because you're not dead yet.

1246
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,030
I can tell you that.

1247
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,170
That's right.

1248
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:59,370
And so with this dribble,

1249
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,310
I now baptize thee.

1250
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:04,310
Whoo!

1251
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,270
In the name of God.

1252
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:06,250
Whoo!

1253
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:07,690
Whoo!

1254
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:08,370
I'll carry a little bit home

1255
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,150
for Mr. Erdman.

1256
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:09,690
Yes,

1257
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:10,190
I will.

1258
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:12,350
Friends,

1259
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:13,330
we must preserve

1260
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:14,590
our conservatives.

1261
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:15,430
That's right.

1262
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:16,570
There are not many left

1263
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,130
in the Church of the Subgenius,

1264
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:18,650
and they are

1265
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,810
endangered species.

1266
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:20,670
We must stand

1267
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:21,370
for something.

1268
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,370
The worst thing

1269
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:23,970
that could possibly happen

1270
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:24,650
to America

1271
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:26,470
would be for everybody

1272
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:27,910
to think the same thing.

1273
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:28,690
That is true.

1274
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,090
And since we're

1275
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,510
really drinking water,

1276
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,450
I know that.

1277
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:34,630
Those of you

1278
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:36,050
who did not enter the water,

1279
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,010
thank you,

1280
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:37,310
sweetheart.

1281
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:38,990
You want to be or not,

1282
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,190
I hereby

1283
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:41,790
baptize you all

1284
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:42,430
in the name

1285
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:43,690
of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1286
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:44,990
Connie Dobbs,

1287
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:45,670
the Exus,

1288
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:46,890
and Jehovah One.

1289
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:48,890
Princess Wee,

1290
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,630
even though you are not

1291
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:51,570
of this planet

1292
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:52,810
and come from

1293
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:54,190
a distant star,

1294
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:55,330
we know not which.

1295
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:56,550
Believe me,

1296
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:56,850
otherwise,

1297
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:57,850
we'd already

1298
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:58,730
have been ruptured.

1299
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:00,350
We don't know

1300
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:01,350
which planet she's from.

1301
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,390
Rather than ask you

1302
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:06,070
any questions,

1303
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,470
I'm going to thank you

1304
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:07,670
for your time

1305
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:07,670


1306
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,150
for helping keep

1307
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,010
the Church of the Subgenius

1308
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,110
going all this time.

1309
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,970
Praise Princess Wee Ardo,

1310
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,890
queen of all the UFOs

1311
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:20,890
and her blue toenails,

1312
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:22,890
the bright blue toenails

1313
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:23,890
of Princess Wee.

1314
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:24,670
Those are natural,

1315
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,170
by the way.

1316
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:25,970
They're not painted on.

1317
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,930
That's how they grow.

1318
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,370
That's how my toenails blush.

1319
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,090
Yeah, that's how they blush.

1320
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,310
Yeah.

1321
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,690
Oh, thank you.

1322
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:53,810
Well,

1323
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:53,810


1324
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:54,150
All right.

1325
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,850
Thank you.

1326
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:04,410
Thank you,

1327
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:05,370
thank you.

1328
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:18,610
Tonight, we're here to pay tribute to an actor, an author, director, humanitarian, and incomparable

1329
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:19,690
showbiz whore.

1330
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,010
I'm talking of course about Bob.

1331
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,470
You are now about to witness the strength of Bob.

1332
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:26,990
Bob the comic lady!

1333
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,050
Let's bring him back out!

1334
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:28,350
Let's go!

1335
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:28,750
Go ahead!

1336
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:30,190
Let's roll away!

1337
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,250
Roll away!

1338
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,510
Back out!

1339
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:34,810
Let's go!

1340
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:35,210
Go ahead!

1341
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:36,690
Let's roll away!

1342
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:37,210
Hey!

1343
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:37,290
Hey!

1344
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:38,030
Bob!

1345
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:38,930
Hey!

1346
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:39,330
Oh!

1347
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,470
You're taking so big!

1348
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:42,610
Hi!

1349
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:43,970
My name is Bob!

1350
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:45,190
My name is Bob!

1351
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,250
My name is Bob!

1352
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:49,430
Come on, Grandpa!

1353
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:50,910
We want to watch Terrence and Phillip!

1354
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:51,390
No!

1355
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,330
We're going to watch the Bob Show!

1356
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:53,730
Hi!

1357
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:54,630
My name is Bob!

1358
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:55,890
My name is Bob!

1359
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:56,810
My name is Bob!

1360
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:57,490
Bob!

1361
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:01,210
The luckiest man and the worst entertainer in the history of show business.

1362
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:04,670
He's a huge asshole and one of my best friends.

1363
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:04,990
Bob!

1364
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,030
Thank you, the large.

1365
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:11,050
Give a round of applause for Papa Joe Mama!

1366
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:20,050
It's very tough to follow an act like that.

1367
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:27,350
But dear friends, I have something a little depressing to talk about tonight.

1368
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:35,550
It's called, Leaches for Bob.

1369
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:40,850
Because we all want to be leeches for Bob.

1370
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:46,770
Bob wants you to suck up the vital fluids of the conspiracy.

1371
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,950
Drain them of their energy.

1372
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:51,990
Sap them of their strength.

1373
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:53,530
And make the church stronger!

1374
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:59,350
But alas, there are some who confuse this.

1375
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:05,390
They instead become leeches on Bob.

1376
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:16,730
Did I not say just yesterday that we were going to have a special three-mile run for

1377
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:17,270
your life?

1378
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:19,530
Excess executional run!

1379
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:26,610
Inviting all holocaustals to come and join us in a Dobson Dispatch of Death rehearsal.

1380
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:31,850
Death Day is just tomorrow, 7 a.m.

1381
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:35,270
Do you expect the exes to do all the work for themselves?

1382
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:35,370
No!

1383
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:35,370


1384
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:35,370


1385
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:35,370


1386
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:35,370


1387
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:35,370


1388
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:35,370


1389
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:43,770
Don't you think Bob and his alien counterparts could use just a little bit of help?

1390
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:44,490
No!

1391
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:47,710
Dear, dear friends.

1392
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,790
10 a.m.

1393
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:53,110
Starlog 13, Campsite Death.

1394
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:54,070
Where's that?

1395
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:58,630
Oh, it's conveniently located next to Starlog 15 and Starlog 11.

1396
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,610
We waited.

1397
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:02,150
10 o'clock rolled around.

1398
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:04,850
Guess how many holocaustals showed up?

1399
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,350
Zero!

1400
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:07,850
Zilch!

1401
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:08,650
Nada!

1402
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:09,490
Nothing.

1403
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:13,990
And the worst part was, it was completely predictable.

1404
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:16,990
Yes, dear friends.

1405
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:20,910
Bob Dobbs has traveled millions of miles.

1406
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:25,890
His exes counterparts have traveled at light speed to get here to help you.

1407
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,470
All to be here at 7 a.m. tomorrow morning.

1408
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:31,710
And yet, when 10 a.m. rolls up,

1409
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:35,950
on next day eve, how many of you show up to rehearse to help him?

1410
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:36,810
Zero!

1411
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:38,110
What do you do?

1412
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,450
You hit the snooze button!

1413
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:43,970
Dear, dear friends.

1414
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:49,490
We have less than, what, 15 hours or so to prepare for the final onslaught.

1415
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,270
There'll be no first annual rehearsal anymore.

1416
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:54,990
Tomorrow's the day. I can feel it.

1417
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:59,390
So we have to remember the difference between being a leech 4

1418
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,690
and being a leech 8.

1419
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:01,870
So we need to get on!

1420
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:08,110
Now, I for my part also indicated that we would have a little swim in the cesspool down at the end of the road.

1421
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:12,690
You know, a way to kind of bathe and pre-Bob-tize ourselves after our little run.

1422
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:17,150
That is also when we are going to pass out the Dobbsian leeches for Bob.

1423
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:21,330
Your medals of honor that you would wear to declare to all the world to see,

1424
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:23,570
Yes, I am a leech 4 Bob!

1425
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:24,710
Woo!

1426
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,590
Alas, there were no recipients.

1427
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:30,630
Oh, yes.

1428
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,750
Yes, I got mine, but unfortunately it swam up my ass.

1429
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:35,190
It's rather difficult to display.

1430
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:36,810
But Dobbs will know.

1431
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,150
He'll feel it.

1432
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:40,510
Above those saucers, he'll get in there.

1433
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:43,190
When he's ministering to me and the other Yeti faithful,

1434
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:46,690
he'll know who has the leeches and who is the leeches.

1435
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:52,290
You see, friends, helping the church is a lot like camping.

1436
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:54,490
You all have to chip in.

1437
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:58,390
Somebody's got to make the food.

1438
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:01,410
Somebody's got to wash the dishes.

1439
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:04,270
Somebody's got to empty those porta-potties.

1440
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:05,250
Woo!

1441
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,730
He's the highest doctor.

1442
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:13,650
You can't just show up at the last minute for the chow and the frop.

1443
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:16,230
Although many of us do, don't we?

1444
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:20,550
So it's important to remember to chip in for the subgenius cause.

1445
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:26,710
Because when that faithful hour arrives, we're all going to be stuck with each other.

1446
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:28,150
That's right.

1447
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:33,250
The saucers are going to be filled with the people to the left of you and to the right of you.

1448
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:36,290
And if that doesn't scare the hell out of you, I don't know what will.

1449
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:44,910
So brothers and sisters, it's time to think about putting out for Bob.

1450
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:48,110
He wants more than just the $30 love offering.

1451
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,870
He wants more than just your praise.

1452
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,230
He even wants more than your witnessing.

1453
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:56,650
And he certainly wants more than you getting down on all fours and bowing down

1454
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:58,130
and assuming the position for him.

1455
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:59,490
He wants him to reveal his glory to you.

1456
00:52:59,610 --> 00:52:59,790
Woo!

1457
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:05,870
He wants you to help your fellow subgenie.

1458
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:10,810
And he also wants you to help the exes and Bob fulfill the prophecy.

1459
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:16,250
So if we come tomorrow at 7 a.m. and there's a little bit of a delay,

1460
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:19,590
well, we've got no one to blame but ourselves.

1461
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:22,210
And we'll only have one year to get it right.

1462
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:25,090
Of course, we've been saying that for year after year after year.

1463
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,350
But you know, you get the point.

1464
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:28,110
The sooner we get there, the better.

1465
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:30,910
The sooner we get ready for Bob, the sooner he'll be ready for us.

1466
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:31,890
Do I hear an amen?

1467
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:33,010
Amen.

1468
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:33,990
Amen indeed.

1469
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:43,750
Now in preparation of the final X Day Onslaught, I think it's completely appropriate, nay necessary,

1470
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:50,570
that we dig deep within the book of secrets and pull out one of Bob's most sacred rituals

1471
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:55,910
as developed by Saint Jaina Hyperclete's, the launching of a bleeding head.

1472
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,170
Do I hear praise Bob?

1473
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:57,510
Praise Bob.

1474
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:59,810
Praise Bob indeed.

1475
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:07,670
Now, if we can have the sacred altar boy with the sacred nine iron approach the stage,

1476
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:14,410
as well as the sacred choir girl with the bleeding head, please approach the stage.

1477
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:21,270
And of course, our favorite MC, Dr. Howe, to circumnavigate the ritual.

1478
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:22,770
Please come forward.

1479
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:24,470
What's that?

1480
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:26,090
What's that?

1481
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:26,850
What's that?

1482
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:28,290
What's that then?

1483
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:29,870
What's that?

1484
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:32,050
What's that then?

1485
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:35,610
Fuck that hell! Fuck that hell!

1486
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:43,090
We don't care about it! We get good!

1487
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:49,990
We don't care about it! We get good!

1488
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:55,830
This is a historic moment in the Church of the Subgenius.

1489
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:59,970
A revival of an ancient tradition.

1490
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:06,210
Here at great expense and difficulty, a specifically appropriate head has been chosen.

1491
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,650
An alien head.

1492
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:19,530
The head was designed by the Sli-Stack in the year 4080

1493
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:23,370
and was delivered through a rip in the time-space continuum.

1494
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:25,810
It is now being...

1495
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:29,670
set on its tee by Papa Joe Mama.

1496
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:38,150
In a moment, Papa Joe will very cautiously engage in this important event for which he is now preparing.

1497
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:43,990
He's been practicing all winter long in his winter quarters in Florida.

1498
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:48,790
The cooler bearer of the head is now being placed aside.

1499
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:52,130
And Papa Joe is limbering up.

1500
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,230
He's going to be...

1501
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:58,210
He's going to be...

1502
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:00,290
There go the scraps of praxis.

1503
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:01,730
There go the scraps of praxis.

1504
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,730
Typical and traditional to let go.

1505
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:06,110
He's testing the wind direction, ladies and gentlemen.

1506
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:06,610
He's testing the wind direction, ladies and gentlemen.

1507
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,610
It appears to be coming out of the north-northeast.

1508
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:10,350
This could cause a slight slice.

1509
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:12,430
He's checking the fairways.

1510
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:16,770
It's vital to avoid sand traps.

1511
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:17,470
It's vital to avoid sand traps.

1512
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:19,090
It looks like a...

1513
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:19,670
It looks like a...

1514
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,190
A classic hip wiggle.

1515
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,810
To loosen up. And the hands. To loosen up. And the hands.

1516
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:27,890
You can imagine the stress that's involved with this.

1517
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:30,030
So much is riding on the outcome.

1518
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:31,890
So much is riding on the outcome.

1519
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:35,390
Now he's getting his demons loosened.

1520
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:38,270
Getting ready for a practice swing, perhaps.

1521
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:39,490
Yes.

1522
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:40,670
Yes, we have!

1523
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:42,570
Yes, we have!

1524
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:44,070
Yes, we have!

1525
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:48,230
A practice swing. But that crowd sounds very unforgiving.

1526
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:49,570
Yes, we have!

1527
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:51,770
Yes, we have!

1528
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:54,830
The nine iron was designed by Dudlap,

1529
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:55,390
The nine iron was designed by Dudlap,

1530
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,110
created from Modizno, Georgia.

1531
00:56:59,250 --> 00:56:59,870
created from Modizno, Georgia.

1532
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:04,130
The head, of course, was designed by the Sleestak in the year 4080,

1533
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:04,430
The head, of course, was designed by the Sleestak in the year 4080,

1534
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:07,330
and was delivered through a rip in the time-space continuum.

1535
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:07,570


1536
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:09,270
It's the wind-up.

1537
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:10,410
And...

1538
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:14,830
What a drive!

1539
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:18,010
The audience is ecstatic.

1540
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:18,490
The audience is ecstatic.

1541
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:21,090
It's a hole-in-one.

1542
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,650
A hole-in-one for Dobbs.

1543
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:25,570
It's a hole-in-one for Dobbs.

1544
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:31,150
And so, we reconstitute our great tradition of head-launching,

1545
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:31,930
And so, we reconstitute our great tradition of head-launching,

1546
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:31,930


1547
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:36,010
as instituted by St. Janer Hyperclete's Hyperclesian,

1548
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:36,030


1549
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:37,290
now apostate.

1550
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:38,950
Thank you, Papa Jo Mama.

1551
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,490
Praise Bob!

1552
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:41,590
Praise Bob!

1553
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:48,090
And let's give it up for Dr. Howell,

1554
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:48,470
And let's give it up for Dr. Howell,

1555
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:49,510
Minister of Ceremoniums.

1556
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:49,750
Minister of Ceremoniums.

1557
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:51,870
Did you get the head?

1558
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,610
Did you get the head? A little head's always good.

1559

Post Office Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1563
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:07,390
But, you know, he can work his way up at the 7-11.

1564
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:07,490


1565
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:10,610
We got one more for you with Princess We Are Doe.

1566
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:10,850
We got one more for you with Princess We Are Doe.

1567
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:13,430
And it's my favorite love song ever.

1568
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:13,990
And it's my favorite love song ever.

1569
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,390
It was the words written by Gene Roddenberry,

1570
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:19,130
and the music by Alexander Courage.

Bridges his dark heart and sing

1589
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:27,310
Remember, remember me

1590
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:31,730
Me

1591
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:32,470

1592
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:45,070
Ladies and gentlemen, Princess We Are Dull

1593
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:50,510
I could never do that thing right

1594
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,690
Yeah, they're taking him back

1595
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:59,110
Susie has been saving wildlife selflessly

1596
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:00,870
She had to

1597
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,450
She had to

1598
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:04,810
strip off all her toxic clothing

1599
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:07,350
to save the sensitive creatures

1600
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:08,510
Titty bugs

1601
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:09,210
They're called

1602
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:11,790
Long-legged titty bugs

1603
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:14,810
That's like true bug porn right there

1604
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:17,430
It doesn't get much bugier

1605
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:17,910
There are two bugs

1606
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:20,690
Oh, you mean the titties

1607
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:21,430
Yeah

1608
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:23,230
Well, we couldn't put that picture on the internet

1609
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:25,230
You know me

1610
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,090
You know me, Princess We

1611
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,610
I'm not interested in titties

1612
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:29,510
That's on Titter

1613
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,270
But I love them

1614
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:35,590
Mauve and bugs
