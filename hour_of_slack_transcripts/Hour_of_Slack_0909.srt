1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Oh my god!

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,540
My friend, can your heart stand the shocking facts about Bob?

3
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,040
If you think that it's factual, then at least find that back in Bob.

4
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,320
The End

5
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,000
Bob?

6
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,180
Hello there.

7
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,680
You know, I've been all around this wonderful world of ours,

8
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,320
and in all this world, nothing else is Bob.

9
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:22,980
Bob.

10
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,360
Bob.

11
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,580
Bob.

12
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,300
Bob.

13
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,040
Bob.

14
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,220
Bob.

15
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,440
Bob.

16
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,980
Bob.

17
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,920
Bob.

18
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,440
Bob.

19
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,980
Bob.

20
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


21
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


22
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


23
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


24
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


25
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


26
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,280
The Son of Genius

27
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,880
The Son of Genius

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,760
The Son of Genius

29
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,780
I cut my finger on a soup can lid

30
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,700
I got an infection and it spread

31
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:29,960
To my whole body

32
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,380
To my dick

33
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,660
It swelled up to the size of a human head

34
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,400
And then a mouth opened on it

35
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,500
And this is what it said

36
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,120
Kill the pink boys, quit your job

37
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,780
Mock the world and praise Bob Dobbs

38
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,060
We'll build a ship and take a trip

39
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,280
Go on, go get a pen, write the coordinates

40
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,100
Three and a half months in my garage

41
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,860
Tearing parts off of old used cars

42
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,340
My groin at this point was unusually large

43
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,040
And would occasionally hum while smoking cigars

44
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,280
The project was finished

45
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,520
The ship would hold twenty

46
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,840
The power source was anything

47
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,060
The crew would think was funny

48
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,560
We didn't need the slack list

49
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,140
They're hapless

50
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,260
Our worth proved its worth

51
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,700
In escaping the stark fist

52
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,680
On our way to Planet X

53
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,920
For sex that wrecks necks

54
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,600
A prairie squid and every pot of money

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,480
Shot a coney twat

56
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,380
It's an all-horse hour of bonanza

57
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,920
It's like a world without Tony Danza

58
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,520
Orphanza

59
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,220
The pink shit that hits the charts

60
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,560
In a world of dead art

61
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,760
Simultaneous lobotomy and sodomy

62
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,880
We take a moment and we pause to reflect

63
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,380
On the pinks that we killed

64
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,640
And the planet that they wrecked

65
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,220
Then we laugh like banshees

66
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,060
And howl like a man

67
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,740
She's too a victim

68
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,320
To redempt

69
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,020
In our underoos and panties

70
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,680
Our fantasy is a reality

71
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,460
Earth's tarnished as dust

72
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,140
As Planet X are bust for us

73
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,360
Bob's pipe is lit

74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,520
Space and time shift

75
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,460
The ship will determine

76
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,340
What causes a slack rift

77
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,220
And they drop in ahead

78
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,460
A dimensional split

79
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,720
Severs forever

80
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,300
Subgeni from pink shit

81
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,420
Bob walked in a circle

82
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,180
And steadily exhaled in the smoke

83
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,260
I can see why the pink boys failed

84
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,740
To pay a daze has caused destruction

85
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,400
Second hole of slackless suction

86
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,720
Ape of you alien abductors

87
00:04:59,740 --> 00:04:59,960
Function

88
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,440
Functioning on soulless slack

89
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,740
The money should be painted black

90
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,380
The mate from space that stole your balls

91
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,820
Will soon come back and take it all

92
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,180
Return to slack

93
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,540
Return to Bob

94
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,140
Repent slack off and quit your job

95
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,920
Or slurp the beastly knob

96
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,720
Carnage

97
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,280
Lick the throbbing vein of slavery

98
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,860
Now you're sleeping like a baby

99
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,440
But Bob woke me up and said

100
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,240
Get out of Dodge

101
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,500
There's a guy who's dick and top

102
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,800
With a UFO in his garage

103
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,200
I ate some bad ham

104
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,720
And I guess I'm gonna die

105
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,380
I got really sick

106
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,780
And in a puddle of my puke

107
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,000
Where the puke was most thick

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,080
A mouth did appear

109
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,440
And it beckoned me near

110
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,000
And it whispered the following words into my ear

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,320
It said

112
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,680
Kill the pink boys

113
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,780
Quit your job

114
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,940
Mock the world

115
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,300
And praise Bob Dobbs

116
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,400
You'll build a ship

117
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,580
And take a trip

118
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,900
Go on go get a pen

119
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,820
Write the coordinates

120
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,740
Six and a half months hold up alone

121
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,260
Circuit boards duct tape and turkey bones

122
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,780
The ship appeared more than disaster prone

123
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,500
But the vomit assured me that far weirder ships had flown

124
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,700
The project was failed

125
00:05:59,700 --> 00:05:59,700


126
00:05:59,700 --> 00:05:59,700


127
00:05:59,700 --> 00:05:59,700


128
00:05:59,700 --> 00:05:59,700


129
00:05:59,700 --> 00:05:59,700


130
00:05:59,700 --> 00:05:59,700


131
00:05:59,700 --> 00:05:59,700


132
00:05:59,700 --> 00:05:59,700


133
00:05:59,700 --> 00:05:59,700


134
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,100
The ship would hold twenty

135
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,640
The power source was anything the crew would think was funny

136
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,640
We didn't need the slack list or hapless

137
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,140
Our mouth proved its worth in escaping the star fist

138
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,480
On our way to Planet X for sex that wrecks necks

139
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,120
A prairie squid and every pot of money shot a coney twine

140
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,920
It's an all-hoss hour of bonanza

141
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,500
It's like a world without Tony Danza

142
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,760
Or fans of the pink shit that hits the charts

143
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,120
In a world of dead art

144
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,260
Simultaneous lobotomy and sodomy

145
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,440
We take a moment and we pause to reflect

146
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,140
On the pinks that we killed and the planet that they wrecked

147
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,680
Then we look up and we see the world that we're in

148
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:29,680


149
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:29,680


150
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:29,680


151
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,720
We laugh like Benchies and howl like Comanches

152
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,520
Do a victory dance in our underoos and panties

153
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,220
Our fantasy is a reality

154
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,940
Earth turns to dust

155
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,440
It's Planet X or Bustros

156
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,040
Embracing day one

157
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,600
This is the end

158
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,600
Closing your veins

159
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,620
The front pipe clouds bring slack like rain

160
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,240
Let Bob control what's left of your brain

161
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,920
Oh yes and all your money to the Reverend Einstein

162
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,940
You have to turn around your head

163
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,580
Oh no too late

164
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:42,580


165
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:42,840
It's chain collapses

166
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,920
How long are you gonna get

167
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,020
They're just saying

168
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,120
Just make yourself waste of it

169
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
Come back here

170
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,620
Come out and start doing it

171
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:48,660
You ain't enough

172
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,580
Just relax like the Congress of the Democratic Dividends

173
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:49,580


174
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,520
Charging back to something that you icinged with

175
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,640
You see people are blaming their BottomS traveled

176
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,680
It's his position

177
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,560
Embrace the yeti blood that flows in your veins

178
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,740
The thought might cloud free, slap might rain

179
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,280
When mom can control what's left of your brain

180
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,360
Oh, pass him all your money to the reverend I can see

181
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:51,340
Oh, pass him all your money to the reverend I can see

182
00:08:51,360 --> 00:09:21,340
Oh, pass him all your money to the reverend I can see

183
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,800
We had Dr. Howl in town, Dr. Howl and Owl of the KPFA show

184
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,300
and the Ask Dr. Howl nightclub act in San Francisco

185
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,340
and even that game Half-Life.

186
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,820
So friends, get ready for, well actually for the next several shows,

187
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,280
get ready for a real plate full of spicy slack subgenius style.

188
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,200
Mamma mia!

189
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,080
That's a spicy meatball!

190
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,200
There is rebellion in the wind.

191
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,740
It will be crushed.

192
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,340
Be one of the few, the proud.

193
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,880
That's right, we want all the subgeniuses to get their lead out of their treads

194
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,300
and get some traction on the action and rumble on down to Indianapolis, Indiana.

195
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,820
Scene of the biggest subgenius revival ever to come coddling down the pike.

196
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,400
A scan 300 miles away from the Cleveland area, Indianapolis is home to many fine things.

197
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,340
The statue of Arno.

198
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,200
Armature Veswing.

199
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,780
The capital of Indiana itself.

200
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,920
The state building is there and also a number of outcroppings.

201
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,780
Death Race 2000.

202
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:37,160
But they all pale into etiolated whiteness in comparison to the pulsing full-blooded subgenius festival

203
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,800
which will be there in all its raw rampaging glory.

204
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,020
Five igloos, count them, five igloos!

205
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:51,120
And you'll see all the subs go through a wonderful montage of bloopers and flubs.

206
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,440
Right up on the stage it'll be a real fly slapper.

207
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,180
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly.

208
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,480
Bob is coming and also coming up next,

209
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,460
friends I am so proud finally to bring to the Midwest,

210
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,800
the howl-ribbly, rib-ticklin',

211
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,640
Dr. Howl!

212
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,440
Yeah!

213
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,140
Yeah!

214
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,140
Yeah!

215
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:17,140


216
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:17,600


217
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,260
Woo!

218
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,460
Woo!

219
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,680
Woo!

220
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,780
Woo!

221
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,720
Woo!

222
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,520
Woo!

223
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,100
Thank you, Ivan Stang.

224
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,020
You couldn't ask for a better introducer.

225
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,820
Of course, Ivan Stang and I go way back.

226
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,520
And we are, as they say, tight like that.

227
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,340
We know the secrets of each other's hearts.

228
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,300
We know the good that is in us,

229
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:56,040
and unfortunately, as a result of close association through so many years,

230
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,480
we also know the part that is not so good.

231
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,380
The crawling, creeping part.

232
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,520
For in every subgenus, even in one as slack-filled as the sacred scribe,

233
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,900
Ivan Stang himself,

234
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,160
there exists a small crawling worm.

235
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:23,180
Which hungers and thirsts for the juices and secretions of the conspiracy.

236
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,980
I wouldn't say this, unless I was certain that these are not idlers here,

237
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:37,000
but people who actually understand a little thing or two about subgenius doctrine.

238
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,260
After all, subgenius doctrine is not that difficult to understand,

239
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,920
it just takes a long time to explain it.

240
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,320
Today, bedraggled and sleep-rumbled,

241
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,120
we were leaving our hotel, or maybe it was yesterday, I don't know,

242
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,840
in a fog of sleeplessness and slacklessness,

243
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,460
suddenly we were confronted by a curious group of normals in a van,

244
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,540
who started asking us about that face on our clothing.

245
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,920
And they were saying,

246
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,440
You mean you're Trekkies, right?

247
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,520
No, madam.

248
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,060
Not in any sense.

249
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,080
We are members of the church of the subgenius.

250
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,900
Subgenius? What's that?

251
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,760
Does it mean you're stupid?

252
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,660
Well, indeed it may.

253
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,680
There's no point in ruling it out.

254
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,200
But, as has been mentioned before,

255
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,060
subgenius does not really have anything to do with intelligence,

256
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,040
and hardly anything to do with stupidity.

257
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,100
Subgenius, when you parse the word,

258
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,000
only means that each one who is a subgenius

259
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
is under, as the prefix sub indicates,

260
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,960
his own genius.

261
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,740
And the word genius has an alternative meaning

262
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,360
that you will find in the dictionary,

263
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,600
cognate to the word genie or spirit.

264
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,660
Because there are spiritual powers in this twisted and tormented world,

265
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,540
the conspiracy doesn't agree that any of them exist,

266
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,920
it can't make money from.

267
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,860
But we, members of the church of the subgenius,

268
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,980
are occasionally able to make money from even these tenuous phantoms.

269
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,180
And a true subgenius is one who acts under his own genius,

270
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,400
or her own genius,

271
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,060
rather than at the behest of the conspiracy.

272
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,540
Yes, the conspiracy.

273
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,780
Not just the John F. Kennedy conspiracy,

274
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,800
or any conspiracy in particular,

275
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,240
they interlock.

276
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,760
They are, at the back of all things,

277
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,980
the same gigantic interlocked conspiracy.

278
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,280
Conspiracy, from the Latin con, meaning with,

279
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,800
and spiro, meaning to breathe,

280
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,280
as in respiration, inspiration.

281
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,080
To be inspired is to be full of breath.

282
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,600
To conspire is to breathe together.

283
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,920
So the conspiracy and its members all breathe together.

284
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,620
They may not know,

285
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,880
that they are aligned in a mighty force

286
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,060
against the few heroic members of the church of the subgenius,

287
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,040
but nonetheless,

288
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,680
they act like some gigantic malignant organism,

289
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,400
together in thrall,

290
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,020
to oppose what the subgeniuses want.

291
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,520
And what do the subgeniuses want?

292
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,460
You know.

293
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,040
What must the subgenius have?

294
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:33,940
Slack!

295
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,040
Slack, yes.

296
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,840
Slack is the soft voice.

297
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,360
Slack, the luminous cloud.

298
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,900
We rejoice in Slack.

299
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,960
Slack is the opposite of tension.

300
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,460
Slack is leisure.

301
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,660
Leisure, the basis of culture.

302
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,340
Only in leisure can you figure out the next neat thing.

303
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,480
Not while you are enmeshed in the tentacular coils of the conspiracy,

304
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,940
at your meaningless job.

305
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,520
It is important,

306
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,560
it is unfortunately necessary,

307
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,340
since we are surrounded by the fluid medium of the conspiracy,

308
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,720
that we breathe it a little bit,

309
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,500
that we kick against it a little bit.

310
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,560
We may have to have a conspiracy job now and then,

311
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,040
on our way, on our voyage,

312
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,340
to being an art bum,

313
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,980
and having no job,

314
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,560
and somehow being miraculously supported.

315
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,520
It is a path beset with thorns,

316
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:28,820
scorpions,

317
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,660
and orthopedic shoes.

318
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,840
But it can be surmounted.

319
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,920
And it is worthwhile taking that sinusoidal trail

320
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,720
through the toils of the conspiracy's

321
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,480
bowels to the mountain of enlightenment,

322
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
the punchline,

323
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,580
the pot of gold.

324
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,240
See the heaven and hell diagram in Revelation X,

325
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,200
the Babel Bible Files.

326
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,380
Now, the conspiracy wants to take away your original Slack.

327
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,320
You were born, each and every one of you,

328
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,500
with original Slack.

329
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,300
But the conspiracy wants to take that original Slack

330
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,060
away from you and sell you a piece of false Slack,

331
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,780
that it has earned you.

332
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,820
And it wants to keep you thirsting,

333
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,860
and jonesing,

334
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,840
and gasping,

335
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,680
and grasping,

336
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,440
for each new laptop and palm pilot,

337
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,060
each new trinket,

338
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,620
each new tchotchke,

339
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,600
which it assures you will complete

340
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,460
the ring of your happiness.

341
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,440
But you will never be happy,

342
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,860
just as Tantalus in the underworld

343
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,940
is tortured by having food

344
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,040
lowered almost to his parched lips,

345
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,480
and then when he snatches at it,

346
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,800
has it draw away

347
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,440
what you think of

348
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,020
as part of your happiness,

349
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,600
will eternally draw away

350
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,200
as you attempt to approach it.

351
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,720
This is how you know it is false Slack,

352
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,280
a production of the conspiracy.

353
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,020
Now, anybody who's ever thought

354
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,780
of drawing cartoons

355
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,900
has probably looked at those books which say,

356
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,140
everybody can draw cartoons.

357
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,040
It's really simple.

358
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,680
First you draw a circle,

359
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,000
and then you draw a vertical line,

360
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,580
and in about 15 minutes,

361
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,080
you're completely bored with it,

362
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,860
and you throw it over.

363
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,740
But all these books have one thing in common.

364
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,580
They contain a diagram,

365
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,900
which allegedly represents

366
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,560
how to draw in perspective.

367
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,560
And this is invariably a picture of railroad tracks

368
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,000
stretching away to a point on the horizon,

369
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,240
a point which they call the vanishing point.

370
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,260
The horizon is always drawn at the head

371
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,680
of your characters at eye level,

372
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,940
because the horizon is the same

373
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,180
at everyone's eye level.

374
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,480
And these railroad tracks do appear

375
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,380
to draw away into a point.

376
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,000
And throughout your life,

377
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,920
you are rushing down those tracks

378
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,080
toward that vanishing point.

379
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,680
But there comes a time,

380
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,160
and it grieves me to tell you this,

381
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,880
it really does,

382
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,840
I don't want to bring anybody down,

383
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,520
I know everyone's here having a good time,

384
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,800
but there comes a time

385
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,900
when as you look forward

386
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,680
from the train,

387
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,960
you'll see, by God,

388
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,640
they do come to a point.

389
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,960
And that point is coming closer and closer.

390
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,340
And inevitably,

391
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,380
the train will go off the tracks,

392
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,980
derail, because the rails are no longer wide enough,

393
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,120
and after that point is oblivion,

394
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,080
the abyss of nothingness.

395
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,920
It is your job,

396
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,260
it is your duty as a subgenius

397
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,500
to indulge in what we call

398
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,700
time control.

399
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,040
Yes, you don't have to go

400
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,500
pell-mell down this track,

401
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,660
you can goof off,

402
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,900
you can bloviate,

403
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,720
you can loaf,

404
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,220
you can use your divine subgenius essence

405
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,240
and put it to the test.

406
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,760
Because time is nothing

407
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,800
you should have to consider,

408
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,360
it's slack that you should consider.

409
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,040
Time is a thing of dragonflies and angels,

410
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,900
the former live too little

411
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,400
and the latter live too long.

412
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,680
But you will live your allotted life

413
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:03,920
in a moment span,

414
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,460
either in slacklessness

415
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,320
or in thirsty grasping

416
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,540
for the conspiracy's worthless trinkets.

417
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,880
It's a sad business,

418
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,740
ladies and gentlemen.

419
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,600
I've simply laid it out for you a little bit.

420
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no.

421
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:29,660
Bob?

422
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,060
Stop it!

423
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,340
Bob? Bob? Bob?

424
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,200
Stop it, I tell you!

425
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:33,740
Stop it!

426
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,780
Bob? Bob?

427
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,020
Stop it!

428
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,600
Bob? Bob?

429
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:35,660
Stop it!

430
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,160
Bob? Bob?

431
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,400
Stop it!

432
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:37,860
Bob? Bob?

433
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:37,860


434
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,260
Bob? Bob?

435
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,320
Get back to your...

436
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:39,860
Bob? Bob?

437
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,240
Get back to your machine, you man!

438
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,520
Bob? Bob? Bob?

439
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,220
Bob? Bob? Bob?

440
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,720
Bob? Bob? Bob?

441
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,500
Now, these grunting,

442
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,320
all I have you know,

443
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,840
especially Dr. Howell,

444
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,720
the grunts are highly codified

445
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,040
and are of great interest

446
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,000
to those people who,

447
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,440
let's just call them red-liners...

448
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,680
...on the Pacific coast.

449
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,320
You know what I mean?

450
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:57,940
I'm talking about...

451
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,840
Yeah, when you turn down the elastic,

452
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,180
you see the little red lines.

453
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,200
No, you know what we're talking about.

454
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,600
CIA, Langley boys,

455
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,480
Fort Meade...

456
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,200
CIA, ASC, FBI, OSS...

457
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,160
Oh, yes, I know,

458
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,300
it's all very boring

459
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,100
to those who've heard it

460
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,040
a thousand times before,

461
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,940
but there are some...

462
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,300
Oh, no, I...

463
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:16,960
...who are just learning

464
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,980
about this kind of stuff,

465
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,240
and, uh, well, Pastor Stang,

466
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,360
I think you ought to...

467
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,780
Oh, I'm not...

468
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,860
...respect their quest

469
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,620
for knowledge.

470
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,640
I'm not bored.

471
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,200
I'm exhausted from helping

472
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,840
to fulfill their quest

473
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,580
for knowledge.

474
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,320
Me, too.

475
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,120
Soak your smelly old feet

476
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,180
in Excelsior and...

477
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,180


478
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,180


479
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,100
...dry gunpowder,

480
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,140
and, uh, place one of those

481
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,660
dirigible...

482
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,940
...those, you know, devices

483
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,800
you were selling in...

484
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,520
...in the right place,

485
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,160
and you'll be fine.

486
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,380
Those things don't work.

487
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,560
And we just came back from the...

488
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:42,740
They don't...

489
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,520
...either do they toil.

490
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,320
We just came back from the lengthy

491
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,720
and...

492
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,120
...and exhaustive, uh,

493
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,140
subgenius tour, uh,

494
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,740
uh, through Speedunk, uh,

495
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,400
Shinbone, uh, Potterville,

496
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:52,960
and...

497
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,700
...Spoontown.

498
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,820
You really went through

499
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,320
such places?

500
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,400
That's right,

501
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,800
and we left the glimmering

502
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,420
message of Bob behind,

503
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,360
right on the doorstep

504
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,180
of each individual.

505
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,420
We'd light it on fire,

506
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,520
and then we'd ring the doorbell,

507
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,000
and we'd run.

508
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,860
Well, how did these

509
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,140
rustic Hoosiers, you know,

510
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,100
go for your big, uh,

511
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,080
Bob blowjob there?

512
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,380
I mean...

513
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,100
They lapped it up

514
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,120
enthusiastically.

515
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,560
They did?

516
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:13,680
I'm proud.

517
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,240
Yes, uh, again and again...

518
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,420
I'm rather proud.

519
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,320
...a quivering audience

520
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,840
member pressed our hands

521
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,520
amidst sobs and tears

522
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,960
and told us it was

523
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,320
the best thing ever.

524
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,880
We love that movie.

525
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,860
You couldn't have said

526
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,480
it even better.

527
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,080
They sucked it up

528
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,500
like snakes suck milk

529
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,560
from a cow's udder.

530
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,420
Well, see, now,

531
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:30,920
you couldn't have

532
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,480
said it better.

533
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,820
And the swag table

534
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,160
doubled.

535
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,420
They did land office business.

536
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,300
Well...

537
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,740
Now, uh,

538
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
Pastor Stang owns

539
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,180
the mortgage to several

540
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,120
homes in the area.

541
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,880
Not to mention

542
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,640
orphanages.

543
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,880
Well, they're

544
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,720
feisty people,

545
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,300
those Hoosiers,

546
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,200
so I wouldn't put them,

547
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,100
you know, I wouldn't, uh,

548
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,480
you know, down them too hard.

549
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,380
They might come after you.

550
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,100
They make fine

551
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,100
basketball players,

552
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,360
but, uh, frankly, uh,

553
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,860
when, uh, it comes to

554
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,020
signing on the dotted line,

555
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,740
uh, all the Pastor Stang

556
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,880
has them beat six ways

557
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,360
to Sunday.

558
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,440
Yeah, and it's usually

559
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,620
a big ol' bloody X

560
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,580
they stamp down there

561
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,360
because they've forgotten

562
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,300
how to write their names

563
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,340
after being plowed under

564
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,080
so many times.

565
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,280
Yeah, and they're

566
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,280


567
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,900
by the Hoovers

568
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,740
and the big conglomerate.

569
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,320
It's easier for them

570
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,800
to scratch out an X

571
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,060
with their finger stumps

572
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,240
after they've been ratified

573
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,220
and codified.

574
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:13,840
Yeah.

575
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,060
It's a poor situation,

576
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,500
but what can we do

577
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,300
as, uh, you know,

578
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,600
slovenly, mediocre individuals

579
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,960
taking up our Hoovers

580
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,620
and, you know,

581
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,520
that thing there?

582
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,620
Well, you can't leave

583
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,820
the Hoovers switched on

584
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,280
all night,

585
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,520
but the easiest thing

586
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:27,980
to do is...

587
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,040
No, you know,

588
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,960
you blow out your spleen.

589
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,200
You just have to...

590
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,020
You can trust in Bob.

591
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,340
...make the entire

592
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,160
syllogism of the Hovers

593
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,160


594
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,160


595
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,400
become easier

596
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,160
for the average participant.

597
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,320
How do we start?

598
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,280
T and A.

599
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,740
Take out some of those

600
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,080
archaic legal

601
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,680
and theological concepts.

602
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,740
No one needs them,

603
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,120
and put some girls in it.

604
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:45,880
Yeah.

605
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,180
And, uh,

606
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:46,960
and some lively,

607
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,820
snappy music

608
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,540
and some songs.

609
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,340
Yeah, that's right.

610
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,640
And we can find

611
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,540
maybe an old barn

612
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,300
nobody's using

613
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,320
and put on a show.

614
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,020
I've got a mustache.

615
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,420
I can play the old man.

616
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:55,620
Yeah, I can use

617
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:55,620


618
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,020
a bunny girl.

619
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,560
Everybody likes this.

620
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:56,740
Look at this hat.

621
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,000
This used to be granddad's.

622
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,880
Well, now I can be

623
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,460
on the stage.

624
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,340
Yeah, and I got a friend

625
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,360
who's a dance.

626
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,060
We'll have the booze

627
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,500
and the music

628
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:04,980
and we'll be...

629
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,440
Yeah.

630
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,060
Hmm.

631
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,380
You can pull the curtain,

632
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,320
uh, just to take hold

633
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,200
of one corner of it

634
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,180
and give it a good pull.

635
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,760
I'll try.

636
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,060
See, it's real easy.

637
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,360
Uh, they make it seem

638
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,200
like it's hard to be

639
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,880
in show biz,

640
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,180
but nothing's easier.

641
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,300
The rest of it,

642
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,880
it's just a lot

643
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,020
of technical double talk

644
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,900
and tomfoolery

645
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,180
to keep people awed

646
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,400
and in their place.

647
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:25,800
But I...

648
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,300
I can't do

649
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,460
the fully stumping

650
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,000
and jumping

651
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,180
at the same time

652
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:29,780
that I'm pulling

653
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,280
the big old Excelsior down.

654
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,860
Well, you have, uh,

655
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,280
hidden talents

656
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,840
and untapped reserves

657
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,020
which you can call

658
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,620
to your aid

659
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,320
at this crucial time.

660
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,300
Are you saying

661
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,200
I can draw on my

662
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,260
higher shelf,

663
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:42,780
so to speak,

664
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,140
to create, perhaps,

665
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,160
maybe move the pots

666
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,000
down a little bit

667
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,880
to get that glow

668
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,640
off your nostrils?

669
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,360
I'm looking for people

670
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,140
who like to draw.

671
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,460
And you can draw on

672
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,880
a pair of long johns

673
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,720
with a drop seat

674
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,580
made out of

675
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,980
miracle sheep wool

676
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,380
with lanolin content

677
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,540
higher than anything

678
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,800
you ever dreamed possible.

679
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,960
Higher than that

680
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,940
spectral toxicity

681
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,760
in my blood.

682
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,100
Jesus,

683
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,160
I'm not sure

684
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:03,300
what you're talking about.

685
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:03,300


686
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:03,920
that's a great world

687
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,760
we're looking forward to.

688
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,300
I guess I used

689
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,500
the wrong name for Dobbs.

690
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,620
It's a wonderful world

691
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,640
we're looking forward to.

692
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,740
A brave kind.

693
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,980
Yes, that's right.

694
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,700
Uh, why should the Malaysians

695
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,600
have all the fun

696
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,320
of Dobbstown?

697
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,220
We're going to bring

698
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,340
the Dobbs struggle

699
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,440
back to these shores.

700
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:17,700
Dobbstown.

701
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,960
Build your own Dobbstown.

702
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,060
Look at India.

703
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,320
Look at all the

704
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,220
many, many, many,

705
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,320
many millions of people

706
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,980
working for one penny a week.

707
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,240
Why not Dobbstown

708
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,920
where they get

709
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,880
one penny a year?

710
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,820
They're toiling

711
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,280
in our offshore corporation

712
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,680
to make all sorts

713
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,500
of tchotchkes

714
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,620
for the subgenius

715
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,340
swag table.

716
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,240
These little kids

717
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,360
are paid in cigarettes

718
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,100
and chocolate.

719
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,900
Yes, we coat

720
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,420
the cigarettes

721
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,020
in chocolate

722
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,900
and serve them.

723
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,100
It saves time that way.

724
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,120
You get nicotine

725
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,860
and caffeine,

726
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,180
two of the basic

727
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,160
food groups.

728
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,480
And some hardworking

729
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,180
little kids

730
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,760
there in that

731
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,160
Dobbstown factory.

732
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,000
And what people

733
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,020
don't realize...

734
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,120
They turn their noses

735
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,880
pressed against

736
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,960
the cafeteria window

737
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,160
while we wolf down

738
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,140
our executive luncheon.

739
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,260
Mmm, eat the hell

740
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,780
out of it.

741
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,500
They certainly

742
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,240
don't realize

743
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,220
that we're doing

744
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,160
a good work

745
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,080
and a good job

746
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,720
for the Council

747
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,520
of Foreign Relations

748
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,400
and all these other

749
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,060
people who want

750
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,940
to reduce the world's

751
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,440
population.

752
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,840
They are going to get

753
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,640
what we have

754
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,620
sooner or later,

755
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,920
a square meal

756
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,940
and a square deal

757
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,260
for each and every one

758
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:16,860
of those little

759
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,580
wiggly characters.

760
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,740
And how many,

761
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,720
how many of those

762
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,900
posters of a child

763
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,260
crying can you stamp out?

764
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,180
One is good enough

765
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,140
to make a template.

766
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,900
Yes, that big-eyed

767
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,720
crying Bob

768
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,360
gives me a throb

769
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,600
right in the sternum.

770
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,540
Yes, it's removing

771
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:31,660
the blood

772
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:31,880
from the flesh

773
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:31,880


774
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:31,880


775
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:31,880


776
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,440
be a part of my clothes

777
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:32,960
right now.

778
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,880
We've got to have us

779
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,760
to talk, right,

780
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,820
right, right, right.

781
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,860
Oh, but I don't have

782
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,460
to think it over.

783
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,040
I can give you

784
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,820
an answer right now.

785
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,360
I don't believe in Bob.

786
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,460
You don't?

787
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,620
Of course not.

788
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,020
Isn't that a good idea?

789
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:47,580
Outstanding.

790
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,280
You have a wonderful

791
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,320
sense of humor, Bob.

792
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,180
Well.

793
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,200
Bob's arriving next week.

794
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,040
Bye!

795
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,640
Friends,

796
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,560
I had faith in Bob.

797
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,420
I kept up

798
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:01,660
the air.

799
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:01,660


800
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,800
I believed the FIB,

801
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,440
as we call it,

802
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,200
faith in Bob.

803
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,260
And by God,

804
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,600
after seeking

805
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,500
the hamburger

806
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,800
of eternal slack,

807
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,760
I finally got

808
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
that burger!

809
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,240
Yes, I did!

810
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,920
And friends,

811
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,280
I have not been,

812
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,620
just so you know,

813
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,580
I haven't just

814
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,160
been eating

815
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,660
the hamburger.

816
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,660
Oh, yes!

817
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:24,940
Oh, no.

818
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,040
I have been eating

819
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,560
the living,

820
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,080
greasy hell

821
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,580
out of that hamburger!

822
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:31,640


823
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:31,640


824
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:31,640


825
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:31,640


826
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:31,820
I have been eating

827
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:31,820


828
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:31,820


829
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:31,820


830
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,820
And it was because,

831
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,380
it was because

832
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,040
I kept up the FIB.

833
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:38,620
It really,

834
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,760
it was pretty close there.

835
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,100
But,

836
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,220
but we,

837
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:42,980
we made it.

838
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,000
And I learned something

839
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,620
very important

840
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,880
that we tend

841
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,920
to forget sometimes.

842
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,300
We get lost in,

843
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:49,880
oh,

844
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,440
the little trivial details

845
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,680
of our lives

846
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,460
or jobs

847
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,380
or our pathetic happiness.

848
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,260
Trivial things like that.

849
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,600
And we forget,

850
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,520
friends,

851
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:01,620
that we are

852
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:01,620


853
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:01,620


854
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:01,620


855
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,580
not alone.

856
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,080
We are not alone.

857
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:11,120
And I said

858
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,340
that to you

859
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,080
when you look

860
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,660
at the world,

861
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,060
and you see

862
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,060


863
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,060


864
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,060


865
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,060


866
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,180
in the world.

867
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:19,360
But,

868
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:19,400


869
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,440


870
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,440


871
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,440


872
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,440


873
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,460
but,

874
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:19,460


875
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:19,460


876
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:19,460


877
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,640
but,

878
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:20,640


879
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,200
but,

880
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,200


881
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,200


882
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,380
but,

883
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:23,380


884
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:34,500
is coming! When they say Jesus is coming they just mean he's on his way. Bob is coming.

885
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:49,560
And you know the great thing about all that is? You can be alone with Bob. If you've got

886
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,220
Bob you really don't need anybody else.

887
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:59,540
C allowed to Pros join.

888
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:07,060
Please give over B us in your community.

889
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,560
Please do subscribe and hit the bell.

890
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,260
Maybe we can raise it for you guys and you can be a spokesperson for thiswares.th.

891
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,860
C Around the Board with Chris redistricting,'s

892
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:23,360
From the cell phone back row We are a bench CD entering the role with the

893
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:28,840
Accept.

894
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,500
Bob.

895
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,640
You know what I'm going to do?

896
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,360
I'm going to take a dump in every last call you got there.

897
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,460
I'm going to pee on your counter.

898
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,900
I'm going to do it all.

899
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,700
Una secrecion vaginal anormal.

900
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,460
Listen up.

901
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,360
You have the right to remain silent.

902
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,300
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.

903
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,400
You have the right at this time to talk to a...

904
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,600
Bob.

905
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,860
Why did you let a turtle man in say I want to fight him?

906
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,220
You said you wanted to meet him.

907
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,760
Yeah, but that doesn't mean I want to fight him.

908
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,760
Hey, that's enough.

909
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,980
Don't act yet.

910
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,480
We had our problems, but we had smooth sailing after that.

911
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:07,500
And now we're here to inculcate all of you with subgenius philosophy.

912
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,880
As if they didn't get enough of that on this benighted station.

913
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:18,100
Well, they get it, of course, but then as soon as it enters their ears,

914
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,240
they start frittering it away and it dissolves.

915
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,840
And it...

916
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,140
It dilates.

917
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,340
Until finally there's nothing but a swirling mist of sophistry.

918
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,860
Because the actual subgenius doctrine, though solid and heavy,

919
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,020
is nonetheless as slippery as a pig at a greased lightning competition.

920
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,040
Hard to keep hold of.

921
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,120
And difficult to retain.

922
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,920
My, my, my.

923
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,140
Smell that bacon cooking at breakfast.

924
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,780
That's some slippery dogma, but it makes for a fine repast.

925
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,520
When you chop it up.

926
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,100
Smoke it.

927
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,140
Cook it.

928
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,580
Or you can hang it and it will get a little high,

929
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,180
but it will be more delicious and so will you be.

930
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,520
The yummy, yummy taste of the knowledge teat.

931
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,120
Surrounded in rich creamery butter.

932
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,860
The wisdom teat.

933
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,140
I'm on a wisdom drip myself.

934
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,880
The wisdom IV drip.

935
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,980
Must be controlled very carefully because it's...

936
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,440
It's a dangerous controlled substance, actually.

937
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,540
What is the spirit of man that goeth upwards

938
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,780
and the spirit of the beast which goeth downward to the earth?

939
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,760
And do snakes suck the udders of milk cows in the springtime?

940
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,420
These and other questions will be answered later on in our program,

941
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,140
but you're going to have to keep listening.

942
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,980
And we hope that you'll ask us questions by calling in the special call number.

943
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:45,860
Skis.

944
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,780
Best.

945
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,640
Three, five.

946
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,400
No.

947
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,500
Questions which require an answer.

948
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,960
And now you can bring closure, as they say, and receive that answer.

949
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,720
So please don't hang back or be coy or modest.

950
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,840
Simply call.

951
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,600
It's just like that number you see written on the inside of a bathroom stall, you know, for a good time.

952
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,860
Or the one you see on the inside of your eyelids in letters of fire.

953
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,540
It doesn't matter as long as you actually act and call the number.

954
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,500
Don't hang back and think about how much fun it would be if you did.

955
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,180
For a good time, call J.R. Bob Dodds.

956
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,040
1-888-669-2323.

957
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,120
Did you say Dodds?

958
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,060
Is that actually a real number?

959
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,160
Yes, that is a real number, actually.

960
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:38,380
As a matter of fact, if you were to call that number, 888-669-2323, you might wake up Jesus.

961
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,380
Yes, Jesus is at the end of that number.

962
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:43,800
Wow.

963
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,060
888-669-2323.

964
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,000
Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.

965
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,580
I wonder if...

966
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,480
Jesus does snooze at the end of the day.

967
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:51,480


968
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:51,800
That line.

969
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,920
Either Jesus or Magdalene would...

970
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,900
Actually, they'll probably let the message machine pick it up.

971
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,220
They'll be lying there snoring.

972
00:32:59,280 --> 00:32:59,960
Looks like...

973
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,380
They're not going to pick it up.

974
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,100
Oh, oh, oh, what?

975
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,780
Sorry, friend, sorry.

976
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,480
That was...

977
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:20,660
When Dr. Howell was in town, we invaded the show at WCSB Cleveland of Dr. Sinister.

978
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,540
His show called Synesthesia, which follows Hour of Slack on WCSB.

979
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,620
As Cleveland listeners would surely know.

980
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,960
Friends, yes, and we've also heard some great cut-ups by Fernanda Nande-Limor.

981
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,520
Lots more of those coming, too.

982
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,620
But first, a word from our sponsor.

983
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:48,900
The World Helpful Health Information Service invites you to consider direct head-to-head contact with an infected person.

984
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,480
It seems that we are suddenly living...

985
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,860
We're living in a more frightening world with terrible events happening around us every day.

986
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,580
If we're not hearing about or experiencing another homeless person under a bridge,

987
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:07,120
or even more distressing to most of us, cretinisms in the streets of our neighborhoods,

988
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,120
what causes that?

989
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:16,700
There are a variety of causes, ranging all the way from toddlers, on the one hand, to things that live in the sea.

990
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,480
The most common cause, however, is a diet low in valium.

991
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:31,060
So, to summarize, you may not be able to control the evil head lice that your child experiences.

992
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,860
And programs already exist in most countries to allow it to happen.

993
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:43,700
There is now an international drive to burrow into the scalp and cause psychological disease.

994
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:51,480
At this point in the proceedings, it is my privilege and my great honor...

995
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:58,000
to bring to the stage one who you have all thirsted to see, Reverend Nikki Death Chick.

996
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:11,000
Yes, you know that there are many, many rituals within the Church of the Subgenius,

997
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:16,420
and one of the greatest and least performed is the Death Chick Spanking Ritual,

998
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,680
which I have come here from a great distance to perform for you tonight.

999
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,940
Now, you know that the conspiracy, they...

1000
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:30,960
many of you here, you don't follow the conspiracy, you don't believe in the things that they have to say,

1001
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,500
but they put their guilt demons into you, whether you like it or not,

1002
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,740
and you cannot get rid of them except for the very special rituals that we have for you.

1003
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,900
Now, of course, you know that the things that you do that give you slack,

1004
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,940
the conspiracy says that they're bad on a lot of occasions.

1005
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,320
They say that they're very bad.

1006
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:51,480
Now, you know that they're very bad.

1007
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,220
And of course, this is true.

1008
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,900
I want you to know tonight that the conspiracy is right, okay?

1009
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,960
But what they don't tell you is that the things that you love that give you slack,

1010
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,360
that they tell you that are bad, they're bad for the conspiracy.

1011
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,060
They're not bad for you.

1012
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,140
Woo-hoo!

1013
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,840
You know that's true.

1014
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:20,580
So I've come here tonight to perform the spanking ritual for you because when they put their guilt demons into you,

1015
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,980
you know, it's my personal belief that the guilt demons, they reside in your ass.

1016
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:31,600
And through this ritual, whereas you come up here and I spank you,

1017
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:39,120
the guilt demons will come out of your ass and you'll be free to go forth and slack and sin again.

1018
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,240
I need people to come up.

1019
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,040
Come on up.

1020
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,240
Come up for your...

1021
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,020
All right.

1022
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:46,420
Woo!

1023
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,920
What's your name?

1024
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,520
Princess Nez.

1025
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,720
Princess Nez?

1026
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,220
Oh, that's very good.

1027
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,000
Okay, I need you to assume the position on the pulpit.

1028
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,620
All right.

1029
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:02,200
What is it that you have done that the conspiracy guilt demons played your ass?

1030
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,680
Oh, I fuck and I fuck and I fuck some more.

1031
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,800
And that gives you slack?

1032
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,240
Yeah!

1033
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,020
Oh, yeah.

1034
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,920
And the conspiracy says it's bad.

1035
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,940
Oh, yeah.

1036
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,700
You know what's bad?

1037
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,420
The conspiracy, but it's not bad for you.

1038
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,180
Hell yeah.

1039
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,400
All right, here we go.

1040
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:17,980
All right, Ellie.

1041
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:18,580
Woo!

1042
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,440
I feel those guilt demons coming out of your ass.

1043
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,160
What do you feel?

1044
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,540
I feel great.

1045
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,180
All right.

1046
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:26,840
Woo!

1047
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,960
I get into this shit.

1048
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,300
Woo!

1049
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,980
All right, do you feel it?

1050
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,420
Do you feel it?

1051
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,360
You have been healed, boys.

1052
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,540
The power of the spaggy ritual tonight.

1053
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,320
I have.

1054
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,700
All right, you've been healed.

1055
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,000
Go forth and sit again.

1056
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:44,780
Bravo!

1057
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:45,960
Bravo!

1058
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,080
Bravo!

1059
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,240
Bravo!

1060
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,460
Bravo!

1061
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,560


1062
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,560


1063
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,560


1064
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,560


1065
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,560


1066
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,560


1067
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,560


1068
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,560


1069
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,560


1070
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,560


1071
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,560


1072
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:48,720
Gosh, you've been really brave.

1073
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:48,720


1074
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,020
Cheers.

1075
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,740
It's over!

1076
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,960
All right, looks good.

1077
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,300
Chicken.

1078
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,400
Bob.

1079
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,440
Bob.

1080
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:31,460
Fossil is a 12-year-old boy who lived with his wife and family in Varna, Bulgaria,

1081
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,340
until about a year ago when his wife left him, taking their two children with her.

1082
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:41,200
He had a flattened nose, a pouchy stomach, and thickened skin.

1083
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,720
Soon, he developed fevers, retarded growth, and slow mental development,

1084
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,820
and his skin and eyes turned yellow.

1085
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,260
His skin began to bruise easily, and his abdomen became swollen.

1086
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,740
Fossil had developed alcoholic head lice, like several other children in the village.

1087
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,140
But that was the old world. That's so last century.

1088
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,520
Today, here we are in technological triumph,

1089
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,040
as the computer age has got everyone looking nervously.

1090
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,800
Over his, her, or its shoulder.

1091
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,680
It's silicon, Dad. There's no way out of it.

1092
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,560
I lived there for 23 months, and believe me, when I was done, I was shot.

1093
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,300
I was completely depleted. They took everything out of me.

1094
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,180
You talk about gates, there's worse monsters than this fish pile.

1095
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,160
And believe me, there's a lot of more shaking you can possibly imagine.

1096
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,600
Whether you're transformed or transgendered,

1097
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,380
you're going to have to make some room in your life for these little nodes.

1098
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:40,560
And pretty soon, a whole jittering cloud of nanobots will take up residence,

1099
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,860
inside yours truly, and everyone else.

1100
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,480
That's it!

1101
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,420
That went down.

1102
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,520
But don't worry.

1103
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,660
There's Amanda Fear, America's favorite transvex private eye.

1104
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,340
You know, they're making that stuff smaller and smaller, Seamus.

1105
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:02,500
They could be planting a bug that, well, it could be on a bug, if you know what I mean.

1106
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,360
Now, when you say Seamus, do you mean like a man's name, or do you mean, you know, a private detective?

1107
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,960
I thought you were taking the part of the spotted dick.

1108
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,120
And so I acted accordingly.

1109
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,040
Okay, well, we'll blend the genders and we'll go back to square.

1110
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,900
Not another gender blender.

1111
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,780
Yes, another!

1112
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,200
I hate it so much.

1113
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,760
The case of Bob.

1114
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,720
He will not reveal his identity.

1115
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,340
So for today, we're calling him Bob.

1116
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,260
Bob?

1117
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,240
Bob!

1118
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,700
Bob!

1119
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,440
Bob!

1120
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:36,880


1121
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,540
Bob!

1122
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:39,900
Bob!

1123
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:39,900


1124
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,180
Bob!

1125
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1126
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1127
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1128
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1129
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1130
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1131
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1132
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1133
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1134
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1135
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1136
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1137
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1138
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1139
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1140
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1141
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1142
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1143
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1144
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,180


1145
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,480
Anyway, friends, yes, I am an American weirdo,

1146
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,620
which unfortunately is an endangered species right now,

1147
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,960
as well as an oppressed minority.

1148
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,820
It's called the subgenius, the most understood minority.

1149
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,260
It takes a while to understand that.

1150
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,940
But friends, here's the thing.

1151
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,900
When you are a true weirdo,

1152
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,580
you can't be normal!

1153
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,760
You cannot!

1154
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,980
be normal. You can

1155
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,180
and to tell the truth

1156
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,200
friends, when you get after a while

1157
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,420
and many of you probably already at this

1158
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,300
point, of course you don't want to be normal.

1159
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,260
But then there's the

1160
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,280
keeping the job thing, you know.

1161
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,220
I sympathize

1162
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,260
believe it or not.

1163
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,280
And I learned the hard way that not only

1164
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,380
was I never going to be able to

1165
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,140
be normal, I couldn't even

1166
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,180
act normal.

1167
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,220
Not even to hold down the job.

1168
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,060
I ended up holding down lots of

1169
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,060
jobs for guys that were much weirder than

1170
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,820
me. But I

1171
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,100
couldn't even, you know, the best you

1172
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,180
can do is to pretend to yourself

1173
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,900
that you're acting normal

1174
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,900
and hope you can bluff your way through

1175
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,860
you know, the job.

1176
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,560
As Bob said,

1177
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,840
act like a dumb

1178
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,020
shit and they'll treat you

1179
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:01,840
as an equal.

1180
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,200
Luckily, some of us

1181
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,380
don't even have to act.

1182
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:08,820
But

1183
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,120
you know, really

1184
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,160
Pope Fred mentioned

1185
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,100
our brothers, the

1186
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,180
mighty

1187
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,860
mongrels of the Mormons

1188
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,560
in Utah.

1189
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,100
And we're in, they're in danger.

1190
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
Well, they're not in danger, but we are.

1191
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,140
Why is that? We're like

1192
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,040
American Indians or the Amish.

1193
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,160
It's not related.

1194
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,300
But here's what

1195
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,580
makes it, here's why

1196
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,400
we're in danger.

1197
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,660
It's hard to be

1198
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,780
really weird.

1199
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,680
What is weird anymore?

1200
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,260
I remember back in the day

1201
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,920
when you saw a man with long

1202
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,280
hair, you'd go, wow,

1203
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,180
look at that weird, strange man. He looks like

1204
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,180
Wild Bill Hickok. He looks just like

1205
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,160
a cowboy. What a weird man. Or you'd see a

1206
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,120
big, bald-headed guy with

1207
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,320
a mustache and tattoos all over him.

1208
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,120
You'd go, what a weird guy. He looks just like

1209
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,740
a pirate.

1210
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,160
Well, I guess all those gimps

1211
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,660
shopping at the mall

1212
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,000
must be cowboys and pirates

1213
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,560
then, huh?

1214
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,200
What is a weirdo

1215
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,820
nowadays? What is really weird?

1216
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,940
You know, when every grandma

1217
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,000
has tattoos and shades their head

1218
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,740
bald. Isn't Marilyn

1219
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,700
Manson?

1220
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,740
You know, that was

1221
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,680
normal back when Alice Cooper

1222
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,440
ditched his good band.

1223
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:28,680
Hey,

1224
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,660
I know what's weird. A man

1225
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,760
with boobs. Wouldn't that

1226
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,240
be weird? Hell, they have parades

1227
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,460
of men with boobs

1228
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,040
in Dallas goddamn

1229
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,520
Patrick.

1230
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,340
More than once a year.

1231
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,980
So, you know what I mean? A true

1232
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,660
weirdo is hard to find.

1233
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,280
And you sure

1234
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,200
can't judge a book by its

1235
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,180
cover. Bob can, and I

1236
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,040
can judge a book by how many pages are

1237
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,540
stuck together. But

1238
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,960
you cannot tell by

1239
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,200
look around yourself in this

1240
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,500
crowd of subgeniuses.

1241
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,060
And this afternoon

1242
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,140
a whole bunch of us met at that little pub.

1243
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,020
Well, when we first met, we were like, well,

1244
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,840
when we first walked in, there were just a few

1245
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,740
weirdos. But

1246
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,020
within about half an hour, there were only

1247
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,000
four normal people in the

1248
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,840
room. And the rest of it was all

1249
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,980
people with that smiling guy.

1250
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,220
You know?

1251
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,180
And somebody at the table

1252
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,060
said, well, actually it was me.

1253
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,820
I said, I feel sorry for those

1254
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,080
normal people over there.

1255
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,960
A more true to life subgenius

1256
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,440
said, I don't feel

1257
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,540
sorry for any

1258
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,600
normal people. Oh, no.

1259
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,000
If I could, I'd make

1260
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,320
them undergo the

1261
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,580
loneliest, the fear,

1262
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,940
the anger that I did when those

1263
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,380
villagers were chasing the

1264
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,300
torches.

1265
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,580
You know,

1266
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,080
but then it occurred to me,

1267
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,840
well, you know, here we are doing

1268
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,040
the same thing the normals do. We're looking at these normal

1269
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,680
looking people, assuming they're normal.

1270
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,680
For all we know, they

1271
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,840
just came back from Burning Man.

1272
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,620
You know.

1273
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,220
But

1274
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,880
the Burning Man old time,

1275
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,560
they quit going because

1276
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,780
it's too normal.

1277
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,520
You know, six flags out there now.

1278
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,840
So friends, really, what

1279
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,040
is a weirdo?

1280
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,500
Somebody would say,

1281
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,900
well, like our friend

1282
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,500
Dr. Pissoff here

1283
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,780
and Barbara Alien.

1284
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,940
They don't just, you wouldn't look

1285
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,760
twice walking down the street.

1286
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,780
They're not wearing their underwear on their head most

1287
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,560
of the time.

1288
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,480
I understand there are times when they do.

1289
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,700
But, you know,

1290
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,120
you just cannot tell.

1291
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,280
You can't.

1292
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,480
A true weirdo is hard to find.

1293
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,120
Now, there are plenty of

1294
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,740
fuckwads and kooks running around.

1295
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,100
Mal-aligned normals,

1296
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,580
nerds, dips and

1297
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,480
gims and neurotic pinks

1298
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,540
wearing berets and shaving their

1299
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,720
eyebrows and saying, oh, I'm an artist.

1300
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,380
I'm weird.

1301
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,380
I don't have a job, thanks to

1302
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:01,620
my

1303
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,040
inheritance. So I'm weird.

1304
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,400
You know, I've read,

1305
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,640
this entire

1306
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,480
post-modernist book, so I'm weird.

1307
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,420
I believe strange,

1308
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,220
wacky, weird.

1309
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,360
I watch television that my friends

1310
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,200
never heard of. I'm weird.

1311
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,400
And, uh,

1312
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,560
friends, give me

1313
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,620
a real weirdo, a real fanatic

1314
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,940
who truly believes

1315
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,200
in something totally insane.

1316
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,800
Such as a

1317
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,620
pipe-faced, innocuous

1318
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,440
looking clip guy

1319
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,920
could bring

1320
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,420
total and ultimate

1321
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,000
slack.

1322
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,700
Give me someone who can truly

1323
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,600
believe, and then believe

1324
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,640
me out of it, because they're mostly

1325
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,100
nuts.

1326
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,080
Furthermore,

1327
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,600
your idea of racial or religious hatred

1328
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,980
is the cornerstone of true Americanism

1329
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,680
and must be jealously guarded

1330
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,620
if we are to remain a band of hooded terrorists.

1331
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,500
Yes. Assuring to us all,

1332
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,360
the illegal government by primitive violence

1333
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,680
and the pursuit of happiness.

1334
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,060
As Abraham Lincoln said,

1335
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,560
this nation may as well abandon its constitution,

1336
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,300
forget its bill of rights,

1337
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,180
tear down its courts of justice,

1338
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,320
plant the seeds of despotism

1339
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,880
which God has planted in us,

1340
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,520
and revert to the barbarism of government by citizens.

1341
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,720
Um, uh,

1342
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,100
I know, I know.

1343
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,020
If only we could bring this

1344
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,500
special understanding to so many

1345
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,620
of our citizens who

1346
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,120
unknowing are searching in the dark

1347
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,400
and thirsting for it.

1348
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,940
But these early days, Stang,

1349
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,860
is Stang counseled for us as he used it to bring them

1350
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,520
the message?

1351
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,400
I don't know if this is still valid in today's world of modern times.

1352
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,800
Well, the first Stangian

1353
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,020
orthodox fist temple

1354
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,040
of whatever it is, is standing

1355
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,000
by to leech away

1356
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,960
your vital essence and turn it

1357
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,940
into solid blocks of

1358
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,400
subgenius understanding.

1359
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,800
Slack comes from the barrel

1360
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,020
of a gun, Dave.

1361
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,380
The slag gun.

1362
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,860
Looks like one of these.

1363
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,140
I bet you wish you had one of these.

1364
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,780
Slag guns like this one, see?

1365
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:11,700
Yeah.

1366
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,400
Pretty sharp, huh?

1367
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,540
I can smell your guys' pineal glands

1368
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,580
all the way from out here,

1369
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,580
50 miles away.

1370
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,540
Oh, I guess that's me.

1371
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:18,700
I can smell crackling and burning

1372
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,580
like a big forest fire out there in the west.

1373
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:20,800
I'm slightly embarrassed.

1374
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:22,580
I'm not.

1375
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,900
I'm just in such an awe

1376
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,920
because I wanted you guys to explain

1377
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,620
Dobbs Town and the good works

1378
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,740
and because it faded out

1379
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,680
as I began to

1380
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:31,920
transflux.

1381
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,080
Well, you know, we practice acubating

1382
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,460
and opening of the

1383
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,300
third nostril

1384
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,960
to all inductees,

1385
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,200
but that's just at the first

1386
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,520
few weeks of big boot camp.

1387
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,340
Afterwards comes

1388
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,460
hell month.

1389
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,540
Now, the legends

1390
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,100
and rumors about the balls

1391
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,740
and vice grips and the hazings,

1392
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,500
that's a bunch of propaganda

1393
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,080
from the experts.

1394
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:54,460
That's right.

1395
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,640
It's not nearly so hard.

1396
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,580
Benny, enjoy it.

1397
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,920
And they come back again and again

1398
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,860
to retake our slinky

1399
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:00,960
subgenius seminars.

1400
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,260
Well, sadly, some of the propaganda

1401
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,240
is being recirculated by various

1402
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,720
sectors of the Church of the Subgenius itself.

1403
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,020
But I wouldn't ask you to direct yourself

1404
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:10,580
to that.

1405
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,980
They're in the pockets of Time Warner

1406
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,300
Clear Channel and the Saturday Evening Post.

1407
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,000
They're everywhere.

1408
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,160
They're everywhere.

1409
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:18,760
That's right.

1410
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,760
Just like the carpet under your feet

1411
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,260
or the nails at the end of your fingers.

1412
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,820
Your little tinfoil helmet

1413
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,300
ain't gonna keep them out.

1414
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,180
Yes, pyramids won't do it.

1415
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,840
But my tinfoil helmet has worked

1416
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,880
for an awful lot of the evil things

1417
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,900
you've tried to do, you know, playing with my mind

1418
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,200
and stuff.

1419
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:35,920
It has helped.

1420
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,000
You have to remember that.

1421
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,980
You have a self-destruct button

1422
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,340
like our helmets do.

1423
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,380
Well, that's another thing in the hierarchy.

1424
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,740
How come you guys got better technology

1425
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:45,540
than the rest of us?

1426
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,260
Well, we were there when they passed out the beans.

1427
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:49,600
Hmm.

1428
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,900
You mean the multicolored beans?

1429
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,200
Well, you plant them in the backyard

1430
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,980
at the full of the moon.

1431
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,820
Should we be giving away this information?

1432
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,040
I think...

1433
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:00,640
Nobody's listening.

1434
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,360
All right.

1435
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,160
Well, it doesn't matter.

1436
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,960
You cast your beans

1437
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,380
on the fertile earth,

1438
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,400
and the next day,

1439
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,280
there's a humongous big piece of crabgrass

1440
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,600
out there with your name on it.

1441
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:11,860
Now, um,

1442
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,300
I wouldn't give these special things to...

1443
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,000
This is Arnold.

1444
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,260
Go see my new movie, Terminator 3,

1445
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,660
and please go vote for me, please.

1446
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,480
Now we see your listener-censored radio

1447
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,580
and still being interrupted

1448
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,240
by public service announcements.

1449
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,360
That was...

1450
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,560
...NPR affiliate.

1451
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,740
Oh, that's very annoying.

1452
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,940
That etches out the inside of your ears.

1453
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,020
Here we go.

1454
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:33,780
But I think...

1455
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,800
I think it's a form of cosmic relief

1456
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,340
for the whole rest of the evacuation,

1457
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,460
you know, middaging.

1458
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,740
You guys have been sputin' out.

1459
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,520
I mean, some of it's right on the money,

1460
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:45,080
but the rest of it is just to take your money.

1461
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,580
Well, you don't know what to say about that.

1462
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,680
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.

1463
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,800
Well, you're like cracking skulls, buddy.

1464
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,660
You can't control every aspect

1465
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:55,200
of the way this is developed and promulgated?

1466
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,200
I'm with you 100%.

1467
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,220
It's just that, you know,

1468
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:02,000
I have the eyes to see and the ears to hear it,

1469
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,460
you know, like they used to say in the old...

1470
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,920
And now you're looking through a glass darkly.

1471
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,860
Get some Windex and get a better view.

1472
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,820
I've got 360 vision, man.

1473
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,120
That's the best part of these helmets.

1474
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,360
I mean, I'm not saying it's keeping out

1475
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,160
all the bad vibes you guys are sending right now

1476
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,400
or anything, but I can still see behind my head.

1477
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,820
And you can see in the dark

1478
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,980
without searching blindly in the dark.

1479
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:24,560
That's correct.

1480
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,860
And it's been very, very valuable

1481
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,580
for so many members of my family

1482
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,860
who keep losing me daily,

1483
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,280
especially, you know, after the sun goes down.

1484
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,680
They should let their fingers,

1485
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,920
do the walking up your spine.

1486
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,460
Yeah, I knew you were going to talk about

1487
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,900
doing that stuff to my spine again.

1488
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,540
Don't, you know, don't...

1489
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,900
I'm not going to forget it.

1490
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,780
Let's just put it that way.

1491
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,500
You've got to release the Kundalini energy, see?

1492
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,020
There are 33 little bumps here,

1493
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,900
and after each one is tweaked,

1494
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,800
you'll feel like a new being.

1495
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,160
Yeah, I have felt like a new being before.

1496
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,080
It hasn't done me any good.

1497
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,480
Well, you just don't have faith.

1498
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:00,200
You've got to have faith.

1499
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,760
And faith will move mountains and molehills, too.

1500
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,900
Every day, a new personality.

1501
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,400
Every time I wake up,

1502
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,980
a completely new, different history.

1503
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,420
I'm getting really, really, you know...

1504
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,780
Your name is Legion.

1505
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,760
You have a hundred zip codes.

1506
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,840
Have faith and eat more prunes, Dave.

1507
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,980
Well, I'll give that a try,

1508
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,340
but no more of the Satanist hobo stuff.

1509
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,140
You know, my name is Legion and everything.

1510
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,280
My name's not Legion.

1511
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,740
That sounds, you know...

1512
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,280
Well, not most of the time.

1513
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,720
Let's take that other call there.

1514
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:31,680
Oh.

1515
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,380
The L stands for Lumbar.

1516
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,400
Uh...

1517
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,000
Or...

1518
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,900
Converter Brace.

1519
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,700
Hey, uh, Dan, Jack, and Jim, go over to see Tim.

1520
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,140
Dan, Jack, and Jim, go over to see Tim.

1521
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:42,720
Can I go...

1522
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,520
Can I borrow a toothbrush to clean my shoes?

1523
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,660
You know, once you guys like to buy a bottle of long water...

1524
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,040
This isn't a lending library.

1525
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:50,620
Hello?

1526
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,320
No.

1527
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,160
Why do they all want special privileges?

1528
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,040
They all do.

1529
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,200
You know, and after all the years

1530
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,020
that I've been sucking up to you guys and stuff,

1531
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:00,960
how many have I got?

1532
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:01,280
Three.

1533
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,780
Well, you see, uh...

1534
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,840
Those who...

1535
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,020
do don't receive the benefits,

1536
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,800
and this is very ironic,

1537
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,980
of those who simply lap up the cream.

1538
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,640
See, back to perplexation again.

1539
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,200
This Buddhist-type stuff,

1540
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,200
if I seek it, I will not find it.

1541
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,960
If I sit down, I take a nap,

1542
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,080
maybe it'll happen, and et cetera, you know.

1543
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:20,300
I...

1544
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,500
I don't know.

1545
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,580
I do lose my faith once in a while.

1546
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,360
You just gotta sit under that fig tree and, uh...

1547
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,820
concentrate on the eternal infinite.

1548
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:31,720
Okay.

1549
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,600
But what does that really mean?

1550
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,520
Well, it means that there is a universe of emptiness inside you.

1551
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,460
Oh, man.

1552
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,580
Now, that's not what I feel when I'm sticking my hand down there.

1553
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,520
Well, what?

1554
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,020
You got an amusement park inside?

1555
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:47,700
What?

1556
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:52,320
No, but I have a lot of misdirected hairs and calloused parts.

1557
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:53,520
College radio.

1558
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,520
And my name is actually Legion, not Legion.

1559
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,960
I got scars the size of a San Diego freeway.

1560
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,760
Why don't you put a Band-Aid on that sucker?

1561
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:01,820
That's unsightly.

1562
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,900
Our listeners aren't interested in your...

1563
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,260
your wounds and, uh...

1564
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:05,980
Oh, my gosh.

1565
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,180
He needs to drink lots and lots and lots of aloe vera juice, Dave.

1566
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,380
I've suffered these wounds for Bob Dobbs.

1567
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,640
Much in the same way...

1568
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,760
He can feel the inside of you.

1569
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,540
You know, I'll tell you one thing, Dave,

1570
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,220
as long as we're talking here, man-to-man.

1571
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:17,740
Chicks dig scars.

1572
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,280
You know what I'm talking about?

1573
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:19,800
Yeah.

1574
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,940
So those lumps and wounds, lesions,

1575
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,000
things that you're talking about,

1576
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,020
they... they, uh...

1577
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,040
they help you along a lot.

1578
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:26,860
They're chick magnets.

1579
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,060
Yeah, exactly.

1580
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,360
Just like you're on your refrigerator.

1581
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,200
So, uh, buck up and, uh,

1582
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:33,940
pull yourself together.

1583
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:33,940


1584
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:33,940


1585
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,740
Uh, things aren't as bad as they seem,

1586
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,420
and it's always darkest

1587
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:41,160
just before it goes completely pitch black.

1588
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:47,780
Ah.

1589
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,040
Yeah, well...

1590
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,320
Now I'm settling in.

1591
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,820
It seems I'm...

1592
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,340
Yeah, you don't want that to happen.

1593
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,140
...sunk up to the knee,

1594
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,820
so what's happening to the floor?

1595
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,120
Well, I...

1596
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:58,500
We didn't want to explain this to you earlier, Dr. Hall,

1597
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,240
but, uh...

1598
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,340
It's like hardening rubber.

1599
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,600
Once your knees begin to settle

1600
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,500
and your molecules are assuming

1601
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:03,940
the strength of the skin,

1602
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,500
the shape of the chair you're in,

1603
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,700
it's just one of the many luxuries

1604
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,560
and little daffodil ding-dongs

1605
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,960
we've got here out of the subterranean...

1606
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:11,820
It's too organic for me.

1607
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,300
Well, yeah, of course it's organic,

1608
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,320
but you are, too.

1609
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,200
You know what I'm saying?

1610
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:16,900
Yes, well, I...

1611
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:17,920
Some of us think,

1612
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,600
and I'm one of them,

1613
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,780
that these nanobots have gone too far.

1614
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,260
Ah, yeah, but enough thinking.

1615
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,080
The old world used to be more cohesive.

1616
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,120
Things didn't just melt and flow and fall apart.

1617
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,700
Yes, of course they didn't,

1618
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,540
but you do too much thinking,

1619
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,120
and this is the way it things.

1620
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,500
You're too stiff, dude.

1621
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,280
Listen to the hat man.

1622
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,860
He's here for your protection and benefit.

1623
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:38,720
All right, all right.

1624
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,380
I'll, uh, uh, uh...

1625
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,220
The flow of your genius must be lax, man.

1626
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,200
Do as he says.

1627
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,400
The flow of your hemisnapper,

1628
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,280
whatever he said.

1629
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,060
Just pay attention

1630
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:50,280
and keep your eyes firmly

1631
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,660
on the monitor screen.

1632
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,500
It all started years ago

1633
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,660
when they started manufacturing Play-Doh,

1634
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,120
that amorphous glop,

1635
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,120
and soon the entire nuosphere

1636
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,340
became contaminated with the idea.

1637
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,440
Silly party!

1638
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,140
Yeah, and the idea got so damn big,

1639
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,380
and everybody else got so small,

1640
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,100
there was no room left for any of us.

1641
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:11,720
We had to move.

1642
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,220
Starting with a little ball

1643
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,240
that you could roll against a pud comic

1644
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,920
from around a piece of bubblegum

1645
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,280
and lift up the image

1646
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,060
to the worst tyranny ever known

1647
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,720
in the history of the human race.

1648
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,240
Now I stamp his face on your newspaper.

1649
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,160
But that was nothing to what things

1650
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,320
came out of the sea caves of Creek Hill.

1651
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,080
Ahem.

1652
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:33,260
Yes.

1653
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:33,680
Yes.

1654
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:34,440
Never.

1655
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,400
Never.

1656
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:04,940
Never.

1657
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:04,940


1658
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,440
Or write to the church in Austin, Texas

1659
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,740
for free information

1660
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:12,060
at P.O. Box 204206,

1661
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,700
Austin, Texas, 78720.

1662
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,140
Friends,

1663
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,520
there's a new devival coming up in Detroit.

1664
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:20,320
Yes!

1665
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:21,140
Detroit!

1666
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,660
At the Magic Stick in Detroit

1667
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,640
on November 29th.

1668
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,840
Subgenius Devival

1669
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,700
with the Amino Acids.

1670
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,280
And now,

1671
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,660
let's see what these guys

1672
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:34,280
you're up to.

1673
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:36,920
Cleveland?

1674
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,520
Yeah, Cleveland. How about Cleveland?

1675
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,440
Cleveland? Okay.

1676
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,140
Okay. Cleveland

1677
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:45,620
has been cancelled until further notice.

1678
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,420
Sure. It's a nice town.

1679
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,880
Yeah, but...

1680
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,420
It looks like you've traveled around the Earth and

1681
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,160
I've traveled far to be here,

1682
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,320
that's no lie. But you are the

1683
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,840
conductor of the train itself.

1684
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,320
I do nothing but my own

1685
00:57:59,320 --> 00:57:59,880
business.

1686
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,320
Ah, yes, you are

1687
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,780
the conductor of the train

1688
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,100
of consciousness. You have your ticket?

1689
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,080
I have no need

1690
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,960
of tickets. Well, you can buy

1691
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,300
a ticket on the train, but it's gonna cost you.

1692
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,040
I'm telling you, I'm not buying. I have

1693
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,620
no need of a ticket. I...

1694
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,000
Well, that was the

1695
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,980
last we saw him. I think they hung

1696
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,960
him up on the mail hook as the

1697
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,840
train went by, and the whole

1698
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,160
story all goes to prove

1699
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,560
you've got to be prepared when you're

1700
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,460
riding mass transit.

1701
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,040
Be it the old method of a train

1702
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,860
or the modern method of a

1703
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,960
teleportation pod, it's all

1704
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,840
the same. But, of course,

1705
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,000
lonesome cowboy Dave bounced back from that

1706
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,200
one, and today, he's hail and hearty

1707
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,880
as ever. Why, uh...

1708
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,000
I've lost a little bit of weight, though.

1709
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,100
I've lost a little bit of weight. Not too much,

1710
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,500
just enough. Well, it looks

1711
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,100
ravishing. There's a lot more blue

1712
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,060
in the eye shadow now.

1713
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,660
I mean, there's not more

1714
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,940
blue things in it. It's just a little bit more bluish

1715
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,680
color. And, of course,

1716
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,780
you know, I wouldn't think you could

1717
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,600
get away with checks with stripes like

1718
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,720
that, but it's simply a divine ensemble.

1719
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,600
Wait, cowboy hat on top and

1720
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,640
until next week.

1721
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:11,560
Is that E.L.Y.? Or is

1722
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,920
your hat head actually light?

1723
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:14,920
Hats on tight.

1724
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,420
The world is

1725
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,800
crumbling. Back to when?

1726
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,080
Where is the revival? The Indiana

1727
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:21,120
revival?

1728
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,320
Yeah.

1729
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,680
I hate you.

1730
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,660
Good night.

1731
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:32,980
Good night.

1732
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,180
I say.

1733
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,520
All right.

1734
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:40,900
Good night.

1735
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,020
Good night.

1736
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,280
Good night.

1737
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,340
This is a conspiracy!

1738
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,280
Fine. Now buzz off.

1739
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:52,960
All right.
