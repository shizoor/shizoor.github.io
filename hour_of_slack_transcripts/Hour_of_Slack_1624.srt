1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
We don't have no time for that

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,020
All we want is an hour of slack

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,320
Do you know where it's at?

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,740
All you need is an hour of slack

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,220
Everyone needs a strained jacket

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,680
Pull it tight, let's all slack it

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,900
Everyone needs a strained jacket

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,420
Hold on tight, let's all slack it

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,240
The Steaming Sack of Slack Part 8

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:32,260
So give me B.O.B. or kill me B.O.B.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,460
Slack ain't free, you gotta pay your fee B.O.B.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,700
How is it I'm so happy? How is it I'm so free?

13
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,660
How is it that I shun the stench of mediocrity?

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,060
I'll let you know the secret to slack and kill your job

15
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,380
Dig deep into your pockets and praise the face of Bob

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,220
So give me B.O.B.

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:54,220


18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,380
B.O.B.

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,580
Or kill me B.O.B.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,780
Slack ain't free, you gotta pay your fee B.O.B.

Now the world don't move to the beat of just one drum

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,460
But my bear up for you, my bear up for some

24
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,480
A man is bolder, yes a man of means

25
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,800
Been along come two, they got nothing but the genes

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,620
But they got different strokes it takes

27
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,540
Different strokes it takes

28
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,920
Different strokes to move the world

29
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,960
Well everybody's got their special kind of story

30
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,220
Well everybody's got their special kind of story

31
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:54,220


32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,940
Everybody finds a way to shine

33
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,880
Little matter what you got, not a lot

34
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,020
So what they'll admit, you'll have yours and I'll have mine

35
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,900
And together we'll be fine

36
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,880
Cause it takes different strokes to move the world

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,800
Yes it does, it takes different strokes to move the world

38
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,820
So what they'll admit, you'll have yours and I'll have mine

39
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:35,820


40
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:35,820


41
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:35,820


42
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:35,820


43
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:35,820


44
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,540
Everything we know is right

45
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,520
We're not leaving without a fight

46
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,440
No matter how they insist

47
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,500
It's time we all resist

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,680
Be an exception to the law

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,660
Let's beat the irritating flaw

50
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,700
Wise men go against the wisdom

51
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,700
Time for a kink in the system

52
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,580
Wanna be a disappointment

53
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,880
Gonna be the fly in the ointment

54
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,560
Wanna be a disappointment

55
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,480
Gonna be the fly in the ointment

56
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,500
Gonna be the fly in the ointment

57
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,440
We don't need an advance directive

58
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,560
Backwards through is the right perspective

59
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,480
The kink is up, we won't be fooled

60
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,520
Time for us to change the rules

61
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,440
We don't need a protective sack

62
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,540
Time to get them off our back

63
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,480
Give the man a big surprise

64
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,620
Bend them over, cranialize

65
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,580
Wanna be a disappointment

66
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,880
Gonna be the fly in the ointment

67
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,600
Wanna be a disappointment

68
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,860
Gonna be the fly in the ointment

69
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,200
The stage is set for the unexpected

70
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,420
You can be the deciding factor

71
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,780
Back and forth like a bunch of jerks

72
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,540
Throw a monkey wrench in the works

73
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,480
When it all becomes a drag

74
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,740
It's not too late to be the snag

75
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,620
Mediocrity is like an infection

76
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,580
Stand up and make an objection

77
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,560
Wanna be a disappointment

78
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,960
Gonna be the fly in the ointment

79
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Wanna be the fly in the ointment

80
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:42,780
Gonna be the fly in the ointment

81
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,180
Wanna be the fly in the ointment

82
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,960
Gonna be the fly in the ointment

83
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,600
Make your own specialty

84
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:00,600


85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:00,680
You and I don't have the discipline

86
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:00,920
Sew rib Bank

87
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,520
Creep argue

88
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:05,520


89
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,200
Make your own specialty

90
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,440
Thank you.

91
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,620
Thank you.

92
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,940
Thank you.

93
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,880
Thank you.

94
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,120
Thank you.

95
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,020
Thank you.

96
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,140
Thank you.

97
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,080
Thank you.

98
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,200
Thank you.

99
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,140
Thank you.

100
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,460
Thank you.

101
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,740
Thank you.

102
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,020
Thank you.

103
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,620
Thank you.

104
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,840
Thank you.

105
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,620
Thank you.

106
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,340
Stop it on your sensible comrade Trump

107
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,600
Your big American oil bill took a dump

108
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,720
When they ask you what you know

109
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,200
You just say nichimo, nichimo, nichimo, nichimo

110
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,780
Howdy doody, howdy doody, comrade Putin

111
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,380
Your American mineral rights deal took a poopin'

112
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,280
When they ask you what you know

113
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,480
You just say nichimo, nichimo, nichimo, nichimo

114
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,140
In Russian, nichimo means nothing

115
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,540
In English, it means even less

116
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,860
All of the world's leaders

117
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,200
Are leading the world into a mess

118
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,980
It can't happen here

119
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,680
It can't happen here

120
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,400
I'm telling you, my dear

121
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,460
That it can't happen here

122
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,320
Because I've been checking it out, baby

123
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,360
I checked it out a couple of times

124
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,380
And I'm telling you it can't happen here

125
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,260
Oh, darling, I'm telling you it can't happen here

126
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,960
Darling, it's important that you believe me

127
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,880
Bop, bop, bop, bop

128
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,340
That it can't happen here

129
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,880
Who could imagine

130
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,620
That they would freak out

131
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,260
Somewhere in Kansas

132
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,540
Kansas, Kansas, Kansas

133
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,720
Kansas, Kansas, Kansas

134
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,860
Who could imagine

135
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,980
That they would freak out

136
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,040
In Minnesota

137
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,300
Minnesota, Minnesota

138
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,740
Central Virginia

139
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,120
Los Angeles, Maldives

140
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,800
Stormwater, Arkansas

141
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:45,800


142
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,620
Few of those in the lab

143
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,880
МУЗЫКА

144
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,080
Hey everyone, thank you for watching

145
00:14:51,080 --> 00:15:09,260
See all the bottles on the board

146
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,380
Diplomas

147
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:08,680
час

148
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,520
Thank you.

149
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,820
Thank you.

150
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,240
Thank you.

151
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,000
Thank you.

152
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,560
Thank you.

153
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,760
Susie,

154
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,040
you just got to town

155
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,580
and we've been

156
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,980
very interested in your development.

157
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,460
Forget it.

158
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,400
It can't happen

159
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:31,880
here.

160
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,400
Organic

161
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,900
head.

162
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,820
Dear friends, the mothers of invention there.

163
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:52,080
That's a real oldie from one of the earliest albums from good old Frank Zappa.

164
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,000
Before that, yeah, that was Lonesome Cowboy Dave's new song,

165
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,840
Dasvidanya, Comrade Trump.

166
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,220
It's amazing, but true.

167
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:11,240
Before that, there was an instrumental called Comrade, We Have Cabbage,

168
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,820
or something like that, from the Rudy Schwartz Project, relatively new album.

169
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:22,580
And the song before that, that sounded kind of Devo-like,

170
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:28,340
was Exposed Foreheads doing Fly in the Ointment.

171
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,200
Exposed Foreheads is spelled with a big X and a big numeral.

172
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,700
And at the very beginning, we had an opening collage,

173
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,700
the steaming sack of slack number eight,

174
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,220
from Reverend Dew-8, or Dwight, or however you pronounce that.

175
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,780
That involves numerals, too.

176
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:54,020
And Reverend Burn Bridges did that strange version of the song,

177
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,020
Different Folks.

178
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,020
Now, Dave and Princess We are going to call in in a minute,

179
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,200
but I have to read a rant real quick.

180
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,460
By the good Reverend Roger.

181
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,860
Dear humans,

182
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,940
just look at yourself.

183
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,260
Just look.

184
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,160
Sitting there drinking crappy beer,

185
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,340
stuffing your face with processed lard,

186
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,180
and worshiping the wrong Jesus.

187
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,340
How do you people do it?

188
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,220
How do you get through one single day without blowing your own heads off?

189
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,740
Hemingway was way smarter than you, and he couldn't do it.

190
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,040
So how the hell do you?

191
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,200
Not only do you not put your head on the ground,

192
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,360
but you also have to get yourselves out of your misery.

193
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,820
You breed like fruit flies.

194
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,620
At the time of this writing, there are seven and a half billion of you,

195
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,340
and there's a net gain of 200 more primates per minute.

196
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,160
That's New York, all five boroughs added every 14 days.

197
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,680
Stop.

198
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,940
Buy a condom already.

199
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,160
I mean, I don't care what happens to you,

200
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,180
but when you drown in your own crap, you're going to drag us down, too.

201
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,400
I find that to be very rude.

202
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,080
It's worth mentioning, at this point in my job,

203
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,380
what I get paid for,

204
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,980
is to measure the pace at which you fail

205
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,540
and to make guesses at what those failures will entail.

206
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,080
In many ways, it's a dream job,

207
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,040
watching monkeys ignore things like the shrinking availability of potable water,

208
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,620
power and communications infrastructure rot,

209
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:33,420
and the complete failure of Western nation states to shield their infrastructure from cyber attack.

210
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,080
Don't even get me started on your sewers,

211
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,400
but I can almost guarantee that someone hearing this will be killed by their toilet.

212
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,480
At this point, most primates will show me their inflamed red arse

213
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,800
and start screeching that climate change is a libtard myth.

214
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,520
It's almost understandable,

215
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,180
given that many supposedly educated people build massive models of climate change

216
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,520
based on incomplete data, which always turn out to be wrong.

217
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,600
It happens so consistently that a paranoid person might suspect

218
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,100
that they're being paid to be wrong.

219
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,600
A sane person might point out that paranoid people are just more aware of their surroundings.

220
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,420
And this is why the Church of the Subgenius keeps Reverend G. Gordon Gordon on retainer

221
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,340
with his signature baseball bat.

222
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,500
It's got three nails driven through it.

223
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,900
The first nail?

224
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,320
Is truth.

225
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,080
The second nail?

226
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,320
Is the facts.

227
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,280
The third nail is PAY ATTENTION!

228
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,000
And then there's generally a lot of running around and screaming

229
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,320
and the boys in the boardroom get a new, if final, view

230
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,540
on the nature of a market correction.

231
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,300
Or kill me.

232
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,680
So says the good Reverend Roger.

233
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:11,740
And it looks like the bad Dr. Sinister wandered in while I was on the mic there.

234
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,740
I guess you didn't know I was going to be here.

235
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,660
I saw the new i-van.

236
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,560
Yep.

237
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,920
There's a lot of things new this time.

238
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,160
This is my first time in seven months I've done a show in the actual studio.

239
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,680
We've missed you.

240
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,700
Well, thanks for not changing everything.

241
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,040
Except for that over there.

242
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,740
Oh, well, I'm not going to look at that.

243
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,680
And I don't think the listeners should either.

244
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,920
Just don't look at it.

245
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,280
It's easier than it looks at first.

246
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,100
I'll show you later.

247
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,620
It's my first time I've done a show without Princess Wee here.

248
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,740
Yeah, where's she at?

249
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,460
She's watching the new old hound dog.

250
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,080
Damn it.

251
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,280
This is his first.

252
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,380
We have a dog now.

253
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:01,660
Okay.

254
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,240
I inherited my father's dog.

255
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,880
He's a big dog.

256
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:14,740
A big tree, treeing walker coon hound is the actual coon hound.

257
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,700
Yeah, that is the.

258
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,100
That sounds racist.

259
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,360
He is bred to hunt raccoons.

260
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:22,860
Okay.

261
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,620
And he does.

262
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,620
He trees them.

263
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,940
He's a treeing walker coon hound.

264
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,320
He's not a walker.

265
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,520
He was bred by somebody named Walker or his ancestors were.

266
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,200
Anyway, he freaks out in the bad weather.

267
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,700
And so does that poor old lonesome cowboy Dave.

268
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,480
If that's him.

269
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,080
What's wrong here?

270
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,480
Hello?

271
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,620
Well, hello.

272
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,540
A big tree.

273
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,000
What?

274
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,180
Treeing walker coon hound is the actual.

275
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,560
It's Princess Wee.

276
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,180
I'm waiting to get on the air.

277
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,960
You're on the air.

278
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,880
And I can tell because.

279
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,440
You didn't turn your radio down.

280
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,160
Well, I have a complicated situation here with this dog.

281
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,520
Turn.

282
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,040
Please, listener, turn your radio off.

283
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,260
Dammit.

284
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,360
See what I mean?

285
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:23,520
Because it's stormy tonight in Cleveland, we dast not leave the dog alone.

286
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,280
It is a dark and stormy night.

287
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:25,560
Yeah.

288
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,540
He's huge.

289
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,220
But he doesn't like thunder.

290
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,020
The gods of thunder make him quiver and pee.

291
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,960
And so we could have brought him to the station.

292
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,360
I wonder if that's something that wolves have.

293
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,180
Like, you know, how many other canine species out there that are less domesticated have a fear of thunder?

294
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,420
Because, I mean, for a wild animal, that would be a real disadvantage.

295
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,520
I mean, like, you know, when I was a little kid, I didn't like thunder.

296
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,180
You know, I remember going to my first Fourth of July fireworks.

297
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,580
I nearly jumped out of my skin.

298
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,980
It was so horribly loud.

299
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,480
But you'd think that an adult animal would have eventually gotten used to that kind of stimulus.

300
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,440
And I wonder if it's the domestication that makes dogs afraid of thunder.

301
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,540
I figure chances are he was out in the woods one day and got almost struck by lightning.

302
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,000
And that just put the fear of the thunder god Wotan in him.

303
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,720
He quivers like that even when he's safe in the mighty Stang Ranch house.

304
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,700
But now he's in Cleveland Heights at the Slacker Mansion.

305
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,220
And we were afraid to leave him alone.

306
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,140
This would be his first time alone.

307
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,900
We didn't want to do it during a thunderstorm.

308
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,780
That's all.

309
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,940
You're just being a responsible doggy, Danny.

310
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,600
Yeah.

311
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,140
So, Princess Wee, are you there?

312
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:50,320
And yes, you wouldn't believe, but when you were speaking on the radio, your canine friend was staring at the speaker.

313
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,000
He heard your voice and he recognized it.

314
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,180
Yeah.

315
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,760
Oh, well.

316
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,800
Next RCA mascot.

317
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,120
I could hear it too with a seven-second delay.

318
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,140
So this is the first time I've done the show with hearing aids.

319
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,640
The first time without Princess Wee.

320
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,420
The first time that I won't have my eardrums blown out by the headphones when I take over after the show?

321
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,360
Maybe.

322
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:15,560
Yeah.

323
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,160
Maybe.

324
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,840
They're turned up all the way.

325
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,980
The first time I've done a show with a bionic stent in my heart.

326
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:29,020
And the first time I've ever done a show weighing only 158 pounds.

327
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,440
So I had a heart attack while I was in Texas.

328
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:39,940
And they made me stop eating bacon and ranch-style beans and anything canned.

329
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,900
And they made me walk on treadmills while they monitored me.

330
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,700
And now I'm this old skinny little sacred scribe.

331
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,960
You have led a much more ascetic life.

332
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:53,960


333
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:53,960


334
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,220
No, actually, more athletic was more what it was partly.

335
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,580
I wonder where Dave is.

336
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,600
I was expecting Dave to call in.

337
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,720
That old cowboy.

338
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,140
You know, oh, I've got a copy of his book here.

339
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,800
Dave's book?

340
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,200
Yeah, this is a proof copy.

341
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,460
Wow.

342
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,080
We haven't released it yet because we're still fixing little technical things in it.

343
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,900
If you need editing help, I can do that.

344
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,320
Oh, well, we've actually done most of that, I think.

345
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:21,660
Okay.

346
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,980
I'm not going to change.

347
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,760
Let me tell you, before he calls in, it's really good.

348
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,660
It takes some work getting started, like many good books do.

349
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:45,020
It's written a little bit like a clockwork orange in that it's partly in future slang invented by the lonesome cowboy.

350
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,840
And I had, of course, read it before I decided to publish it.

351
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,660
But I hadn't read it as a book.

352
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,960
I read it on a screen.

353
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,240
It's just not the same.

354
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:05,560
When I was able to peruse it at my leisure in my extra meditation chamber, it turned out to be quite a page turner.

355
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,580
As I was saying, I got towards the ending.

356
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:18,460
I was like, is our hero, Standard Mosek, going to be a happy ending or a terrible ending or what?

357
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,640
And I won't spoil anything.

358
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,500
But Jimmy and Guitar and Tina on vocals, that band was quite a page turner.

359
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,300
Yeah.

360
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,240
Jimmy Page Turner?

361
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:30,800
Yeah.

362
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:36,120
Remember Tina Turner and Jimmy Page when they had that one band for a while?

363
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:42,160
And Bob Keesham, of all people, Captain Kangaroo, was the lead singer.

364
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,480
That was a short-lived band.

365
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,520
It was great, though.

366
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,320
Tina Turner didn't even sing.

367
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,940
She just played tambourines and oranges.

368
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,060
And she was singing along.

369
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,260
And I was like, what's that?

370
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,240
And where's Dave?

371
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,600
That's very strange.

372
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,400
You know what it is?

373
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,360
I bet he doesn't know what time it is.

374
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,900
Or he fell asleep.

375
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,620
He exists outside of time.

376
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:13,180
Dr. Sinister, when I was doing the show at Stang Ranch, we had to call Dave.

377
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,400
He couldn't call in.

378
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,420
I had to call him.

379
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,760
And a couple of times I had to wake him up.

380
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,820
Oh, I see.

381
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,440
Sometimes when No Money Mark calls in, I have to wake him up during the show.

382
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:33,500
Our friend Dr. Hal has been known to fall asleep with his head leaning against a microphone.

383
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,620
It may sound like a joke, but it's not.

384
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,980
The smoking loon once passed out drunk on the air here.

385
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,860
Puzzling evidence show takes place in the middle of the night, though.

386
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,400
Well, of course.

387
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,040
It would have to.

388
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,800
But it's not going to happen.

389
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,400
That kind of thing isn't allowed during the daytime.

390
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,780
The Puzzling Evidence Show, friends.

391
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,020
That's actually the first subgenius radio show.

392
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,520
It started in 1982.

393
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,660
Hour of Slack didn't start until 1985.

394
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:15,460
And by the way, this would be episode number 1,624.

395
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,360
Pretty good.

396
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,360
My heart beats still.

397
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,780
Oh, my God.

398
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,760
1,600 hours of slack.

399
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,800
1,600 hours of Slack, and only about a hundred of them were reruns.

400
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:34,360
By the way, thank you for playing those shows and babysitting every week, Dr. Sinister.

401
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,800
Well, I mean, the babysitting, it's been a good supplement to my allowance.

402
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:49,900
And your diet, since you've always enjoyed the flesh of human immensely.

403
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,780
Dignified plants.

404
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:51,780


405
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:51,780


406
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:51,780


407
00:30:51,780 --> 00:31:00,680
spawn well of course doesn't everybody well no no not on the air anyway come on

408
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,880
you don't know what you're missing yeah the man could be listening you know i i or even worse the

409
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,380
woman might be listening no man see i uh even better i mean you know i i don't believe in in

410
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,920
waste you know when it comes to uh using uh the resources because you know it's expensive to raise

411
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:21,160
animals and especially human animals um so we you know i follow that ancient tradition of using all

412
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,880
parts of the animal and uh you know i like to uh render the fat of these babies and i have to make

413
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,180
sure they haven't been baptized and then i can um make an ointment out of that rendered fat which

414
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:38,860
will give me the power of flight at least that's what the malleus maleficarum said but then those

415
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,620
mormons came along and invented baptism of the dead so one time i was flying along with my

416
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:51,040
unbaptized baby ointment um in effect and then i guess some mormon baptized that dead baby

417
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:59,020
oh no no so retroactively i fell from the sky well you know you would hate to be a troll hunter

418
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:08,740
wearing what you thought was non-christian baby fat oil only to have it post saved by some

419
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:15,360
nosy pesky mormon suddenly the trolls would smell you you smell just like a christian baby

420
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,140
or a mormon baby like no controls smell the blood of a mormon

421
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:27,080
man that's a question i don't know by the way don't get close to me not that i'm worried that

433
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:48,360

434
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,840
who happen to be mostly dames

435
00:33:51,620 --> 00:34:00,100

436
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,120
interest and i said yeah i've been kind of trying to start something like that for 35 years

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:29,080

00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:17,640

else to crisis is a big one well i really want to put out that it was confined just

fresh mind you had a stupid question like i know i wanted to just lock all these little

453
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,140
bol structure and to broadcast and it was ridiculous i only had like voters should be

454
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,260
Turn to enter your number or code and try again.

455
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,520
Well, here's another first for this show.

456
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,020
This is the first time we've ever had anyone besides Lonesome Cowboy Dave call in simultaneously.

457
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,860
And I just learned how to do that.

458
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:44,080
He's a man who dresses, who likes to wear ladies' clothes, and has a huge proboscis in the middle of his forehead, and he's got, like, elf ears.

459
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,360
No, that's Dammit, the dog.

460
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,640
No, that's, that's, it is?

461
00:35:49,640 --> 00:36:00,140
Yeah, Princess, we, Princess, Dave, Princess, we had to stay home with the dog because it would be his first night at the radio station.

462
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,100
We didn't want to do it during a thunderstorm.

463
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:07,080
So she's on the phone, and you're on the phone, and that's another first.

464
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,440
Yeah, it's delightful.

465
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,900
It really is to have this roundtable conversation about absolutely freaking nothing.

466
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,260
Did you play Doris Bedania von Tomeret Hump?

467
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,460
Yeah, I sure did.

468
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,040
Oh, I missed that.

469
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,720
I think it sucked, but I like it anyway somehow because it's kind of strange.

470
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,600
Well, Dave, I improved it.

471
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,380
Oh, that's great.

472
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,960
There were three places in the sound file that were 100% volume.

473
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,380
They were just little smack noises like that.

474
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:47,220
And when I lowered them, I could bring the rest of the volume up, and lo and behold, you could actually understand the words once it had been processed.

475
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,360
I'm sorry, I missed that.

476
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,620
I was in a turlid.

477
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,020
I was in a turlid when that happened, and I felt kind of funny for a little while.

478
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,200
I got reorganized and came down as quickly as I got the message from it.

479
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,280
I knew you were in the toilet when I played it.

480
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,140
I knew you were in the bathroom when I played it.

481
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:07,620
And that must have also been while I was trying to connect my speakers to my computer.

482
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,340
It's because my guts are out of radency.

483
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:18,360
And that's the same thing about your CD player, or at least whatever, homongifier.

484
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,520
What is it, an iDoc?

485
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,160
It's a homongifier.

486
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,920
Homongifier.

487
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,860
They had those in the South where Stan was raised, right?

488
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,360
We used hollow logs where I grew up, man.

489
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,200
Homongifier.

490
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,200
We used big logs to listen through.

491
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,760
I used to have a kookamongifier.

492
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:45,360
We used to take grapevines and smoke them like cigarettes.

493
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,580
Did you ever do that?

494
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,240
Anybody from North Dakota?

495
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,620
Oh, you?

496
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,220
You had grapes.

497
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,300
Oh, you're one of those rich kids that had grapevines.

498
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,840
No, these are wild grapes.

499
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,380
We had to smoke old tires.

500
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,540
We had to wear these old sandals and things.

501
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,720
And shoes.

502
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,260
That's all we had to smoke.

503
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,760
I smoked shoes before, man.

504
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,300
What are you, imputing my...

505
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,160
Hell yeah, I smoked shoes and hats for me.

506
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,180
And I smoked the whole trailer park just because I had to keep my nose out of trouble.

507
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,340
What about banana peels?

508
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,820
Didn't you guys ever smoke them?

509
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,600
No.

510
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,060
How about corn silk?

511
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:21,740
No.

512
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,600
Corn silk, we did try.

513
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,580
I read about that as a kid.

514
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:27,920
What?

515
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,800
You can smoke that and get cancer just like with cigarettes?

516
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,520
Oh, boy, I want to be like my parents.

517
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,360
Yeah, get cancer like my parents.

518
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah.

519
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,460
See, we called them, the grapevines, wild grapevines, we called them stogies.

520
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,620
Because they resemble the cigar.

521
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,780
If you got them close enough to the big branch things there.

522
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,320
Oh, and they lost.

523
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,400
Oh, so it is a strange taste.

524
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,100
Oh, the grapevines are pretty old, huh?

525
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,260
Why would you smoke grapevines when you could be smoking trailer quarts?

526
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,380
I just don't get it.

527
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,500
Or salvia divinorum.

528
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,060
I said I was smoking...

529
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,260
It was funny, as a kid, they didn't know about salvia back then.

530
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,360
But it was still legal back then.

531
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,520
Right, but it hadn't been invented.

532
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,620
Oh, yes, it had not been invented.

533
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,700
Oh, it's elaborate.

534
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,840
You know, not really.

535
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,240
It was kind of reconstructed from an age-old myth.

536
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,860
Is that St. Pancreas and the hot dog people?

537
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,520
Do you remember his many, many, many, many, many, many works?

538
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,060
St. Pancreas?

539
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,840
A lot of his state development, but you know what I'm saying?

540
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,480
No, I usually don't know what you're saying.

541
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,840
He's the patron saint of diabetics.

542
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,700
Go ahead and mock me down, dude.

543
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,160
Did you know somebody named St. Clair is the patron saint?

544
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,060
Of television?

545
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,880
I did not know that.

546
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,260
Yeah, why would there even be one?

547
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,440
Well, hey, you know, I pray to the patron saint of sales.

548
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,160
Yeah, that's Bob.

549
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,000
And a lot of sales are done over TV.

550
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:10,520
I don't know that I would advise praying to Bob Dobbs.

551
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,740
Well, you know what I mean by praying to him.

552
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,540
You know, it's not a traditional prayer in that sense.

553
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,220
Right.

554
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,820
When you just shriek out,

555
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,760
something like, Bob, darn it!

556
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,040
That's about as close as it gets.

557
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:28,420
I mean, every, every, you know,

558
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,660
and every orgasmic scream is a prayer to Connie.

559
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,260
Yeah.

560
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,020
Well, that's a nice way of looking at it.

561
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,700
The problem with praying is,

562
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,480
you never know who else is going to be listening.

563
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,120
Besides the one you're praying to,

564
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,780
probably some other entity might be tuning in

565
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,800
just to find out who's going to be listening.

566
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:47,800


567
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:47,800


568
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:47,800


569
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:47,800


570
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:47,800


571
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:47,800


572
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:47,800


573
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:48,960
So, you know, you're going to have to ask God

574
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,800
to do something about what it is you're most afraid of

575
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,120
or what you most want so that they can do the opposite.

576
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,200
What, who you, they are crazy?

577
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,040
Well, I've ascended to a certain level of sainthood

578
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,620
and divinity myself, so I'm not really afraid of them.

579
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,440
Well, that's because you stink like marmalade now.

580
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,800
Back in the old days,

581
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,080
we'd have our caffeine crying out at the bar.

582
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,700
They'd grow huge.

583
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,500
Look who's talking.

584
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,880
More like stink like Marmite.

585
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,860
Huge growth would come out of their foreheads.

586
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,540
And then the people would ask them,

587
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,660
what are you thinking about?

588
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,620
Can't you see?

589
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,020
You just put your hand on my forehead.

590
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,480
Man, those were the days.

591
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,480
Those were the daves.

592
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,220
Those were the daves of our lives.

593
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,760
Back when there was more than one.

594
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:35,620
Yep.

595
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,120
But one by one.

596
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,660
These are the daves I know, I know.

597
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,780
These are the daves I know.

598
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,600
Not a monochromatic ooze.

599
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,420
One by one, the daves were carved off of the church body.

600
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,460
Sold to the highest bidder.

601
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,440
Each of them grew off into its own church.

602
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,960
Much the lesser was the church once the deans were trained.

603
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,480
There were a lot of daves that had to be shelved.

604
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:05,200
You know, Jayner was a dave.

605
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,120
I'm an original.

606
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,300
I'm not parenthetical either.

607
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,880
I speak for a whole generation of sandwich heads and freaks

608
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,500
and buzz babies.

609
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,260
And anything...

610
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:17,800
Anything...

611
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,640
They think...

612
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,500
You think...

613
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,700
Oh, never mind.

614
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,060
It's just too hard to describe.

615
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,800
Bob told us not to think.

616
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,920
Not the way you're thinking.

617
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,040
We're supposed to, at best, do break thinking.

618
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,480
Although that's kind of old-fashioned now.

619
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,580
And you can get hurt that way.

620
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,520
Yeah.

621
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,860
Non-think was another approach.

622
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,160
I love that one.

623
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,140
That was my favorite.

624
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,520
Non-think.

625
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,480
Well, that's real easy for most people.

626
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,940
It just comes naturally.

627
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,900
For most people, it's really difficult, though,

628
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,780
when you think of the answer.

629
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,980
The hypothetical parts of it,

630
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,380
of having no...

631
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,760
holding no thought in your brain

632
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,400
for longer than 20...

633
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,640
You know, like a piece of bologna

634
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,640
can speak to you in many...

635
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,000
You know, it's...

636
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,300
It's the same.

637
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,640
Buddhists pay extra not to think.

638
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,340
Buddhists work hard to get to the point

639
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:08,480
where they don't have to keep desiring and fretting.

640
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,780
Maybe that's smart.

641
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,700
I don't know.

642
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,120
Yeah.

643
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,720
Why not just hit yourself in the head real good

644
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,420
with a big rubber mallet every time you wake up?

645
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,000
I don't know.

646
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,400
Like so many subgeniuses do.

647
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,700
Go home and bury that mallet

648
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,020
so that at any time,

649
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,620
when you feel disruptions occur,

650
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,340
you can just beat the hell out of yourself.

651
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,760
Well, not everybody uses a mallet.

652
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,100
Some of them use dope,

653
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,320
or beer,

654
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,400
or TV,

655
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,500
or pornography,

656
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,760
or a porcupine,

657
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,760
or a ball-peen hammer,

658
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,380
which has a very, very different type of consciousness

659
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,120
explanation than the rubber mallet does.

660
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,280
The rubber mallet just kind of knocks it out

661
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,480
all across the board,

662
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,820
whereas the ball-peen hammer,

663
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,980
if it's applied by a doctor,

664
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,860
can take out just specific things,

665
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,580
like your...

666
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,600
Like balls and your peen.

667
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,200
Right.

668
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:08,320
Or your math, for instance,

669
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,660
or your emotions,

670
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,040
or, well, your higher emotions, anyway.

671
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,140
It depends on where they whack you,

672
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:17,420
you know,

673
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:17,760
and where they hit you.

674
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:17,760


675
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:17,760


676
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,420
They poke the pen up your nose,

677
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,000
or up your eye socket.

678
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,020
That's why the Dosh Bedaniah Trump song

679
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,520
was done at Tim Dorman's place,

680
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,300
because he's like one of those few people

681
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,980
that knows how to keep his scrotum

682
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,340
from the rest of it.

683
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,200
You know, keep those ideas separate.

684
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,480
At least that's what I've been told.

685
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:38,720
Okay.

686
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,500
Sure.

687
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:41,700
Yeah.

688
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,380
So what's wrong?

689
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,880
It's not like I invented the concept

690
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,420
of scrotal disembodiment.

691
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,680
It's like I know how to read, man, you know?

692
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,580
It's pinky in the suffragette.

693
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,660
They're hiding in the customized cool bars

694
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:02,040
and up above in the furniture.

695
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,680
You know, this is the first time

696
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,420
I've been in the station

697
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,480
since the new president was enacted

698
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,700
and enunciated in.

699
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,740
And if you're the prime minister...

700
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:14,460
Because I've been gone.

701
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,100
...of Montenegro...

702
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,640
It feels like he's always been president.

703
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:17,920
Really.

704
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,260
I just, I got used to him so fast.

705
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,680
That was the whole idea, I think.

706
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,180
That's what they were banking on.

707
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,480
Yeah, I've spent a good chunk of my life,

708
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,620
you know, having a president to hate.

709
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,540
And the last eight years,

710
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,940
you know, I had some disagreements with the guy,

711
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,800
but I didn't hate him.

712
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,160
Well, now it's back to normal.

713
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,860
Okay, yes, of course, we hate the president.

714
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,900
Like, that's the way things have always been.

715
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,320
So it's almost like a return to normalcy.

716
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,540
Yeah, it is.

717
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,460
I guess when you think about it that way,

718
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,900
I mean, yeah.

719
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,540
Bush-like.

720
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,720
You know, it's so easy to hate.

721
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,860
You have so many manners.

722
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,340
Well, actually, you know, by comparison,

723
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,420
W was downright likable.

724
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,580
Second term W.

725
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,600
Right.

726
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:13,280
And George H. was just a sweet old...

727
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:15,740
Geysar?

728
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:16,920
Geysar, yeah.

729
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,460
And Reagan and Nixon were like...

730
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,680
They're like brilliant super football players

731
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,700
that could also do brain surgery

732
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,680
and high calculus relatively.

733
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,820
I mean, this is all just relative.

734
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,620
The Bushes are compared to Trumpskins?

735
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,460
Anybody compared to Trumpskin

736
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:44,240
is like a beautiful, athletic, super genius.

737
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,460
Well, you know, I mean,

738
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,000
you can't have him...

739
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,420
You can't have Trump working out

740
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,540
because the body only has so much energy

741
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,100
and he can't use that energy.

742
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:56,620
Right.

743
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,540
It's like sperm.

744
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,600
Trump said he does not exercise

745
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,340
because he believes that every human

746
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,820
is like a battery

747
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,680
and there's enough juice in there

748
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,880
and you can't recharge it.

749
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,920
Right, can't recharge it.

750
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,180
You know, exercise doesn't recharge the battery.

751
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:11,940
What the hell?

752
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,480
We don't need a president like that.

753
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,340
That's going to make the kids get fat again.

754
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:15,780
Said...

755
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,920
Hey, hey, hey.

756
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,140
Hey, it could...

757
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,300
It's like the limited sperm thing.

758
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,260
It's to get kids to quit

759
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,940
jacking off and exercise.

760
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,680
I think Trump might be the fattest president

761
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,980
we've had since Taft.

762
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,060
I mean, even when Bill Clinton was at his chubbiest,

763
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,520
I don't think he was quite as full-bodied

764
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,140
as the Trumpster.

765
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,400
For people who don't know,

766
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,180
of course, he didn't use furosemide

767
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,240
or for ointment.

768
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,040
One thing I can say for Trump,

769
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,120
he does represent his support team

770
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,220
as his voters.

771
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,720
He represents them.

772
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:59,020
He looks like a large percentage of them.

773
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,280
He talks and writes

774
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,480
like many of them.

775
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,040
I don't know that he looks like many of them.

776
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:06,960
Every time he...

777
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,320
Every time he...

778
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,680
Every time he does...

779
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,240
Well, Bush spent most of his life in Texas,

780
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:16,720
not...

781
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,120
He was born in Connecticut,

782
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,740
but he did spend most of his life in Texas.

783
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,260
No, he moved to Texas

784
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,500
when he was in his 30s.

785
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,460
By then, you definitely have your own...

786
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,620
No, he went to SMU for college.

787
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,360
Okay.

788
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,020
Well, SMU, where's that?

789
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,260
In Dallas.

790
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,180
He lived in Midland for a long time, too.

791
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:35,800
Yeah.

792
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,120
Yeah, and remember...

793
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,460
Of course, Poppy Bush adopted

794
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,060
kind of a Southern accent,

795
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,820
and he was definitely a Yankee.

796
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,700
All right, so you'll say...

797
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,720
It's an infectious accent.

798
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:48,400
That's the thing.

799
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,660
So that you'll sound like the Republican voters.

800
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,620
Now they all do.

801
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,500
They say nuclear and...

802
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,580
If I moved to the South,

803
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,520
I'd probably start speaking

804
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,800
with a Southern accent very quickly.

805
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,540
My wife says y'all now.

806
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,560
She was in...

807
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,280
That's a useful word.

808
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,940
Texas for two winters.

809
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,820
Every other European language

810
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,860
has a plural second-person pronoun.

811
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,320
I think y'all is a useful word.

812
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,360
Or yins.

813
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,000
Yins.

814
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,880
In Pittsburgh, they say yun.

815
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,160
Yeah.

816
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,820
Yuns is Midland speech.

817
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,420
Yus is Northern speech.

818
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,100
And y'all is Southern speech, Pata.

819
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,340
Oh, yeah.

820
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:27,820
Y'all.

821
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,060
All y'all.

822
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,400
Southern anywhere.

823
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,020
It's Southern New York,

824
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,320
Southern Michigan,

825
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,540
Southern Ohio,

826
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,540
and it's Southern Cleveland.

827
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,440
Like Parma.

828
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,620
You knew what I was trying to say.

829
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:41,720
Yeah.

830
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,480
Well, you know, I got...

831
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,760
Princess, we and I,

832
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,680
after seven months,

833
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,300
you get...

834
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,940
Well, a lot quicker than that.

835
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,080
You get used to being

836
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,900
in a neighborhood

837
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,420
that's the exact opposite

838
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,100
of the one you've lived in

839
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,400
for the last 20 years.

840
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,540
You must be going...

841
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,520
In every possible way.

842
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,600
You must be going crazy.

843
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,760
That's true.

844
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,860
No, it makes for a good contrast.

845
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:06,620
Yeah.

846
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,280
I get to know that the people

847
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,020
who think the inner cities

848
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,820
are just hotbeds of crime,

849
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,200
I get to know they're wrong.

850
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,580
And the people who think

851
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,480
the small towns

852
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,680
are all hotbeds of crime,

853
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:16,680


854
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,360
stupidity,

855
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,380
well, they're wrong too.

856
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,520
Although,

857
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,720
there's plenty of both.

858
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,400
In both.

859
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,640
I have to say...

860
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,700
Both of them are hotbeds

861
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,580
of stupidity and crime.

862
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,080
Yes.

863
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,340
I heard that every time

864
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,940
a lovable Clevelander

865
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:31,900
moves to Texas

866
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,080
or another Southern state,

867
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,960
an angel loses its wings.

868
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,420
Oh, wings are way...

869
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,700
I'm just...

870
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,120
I'm sorry.

871
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,480
The fact that you're...

872
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,740
The fact that you're trying

873
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,280
to move down there

874
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,080
permanently kind of hurts.

875
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,020
It's like I lost my sister

876
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,580
to North Carolina.

877
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,500
And now I'm losing you

878
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,560
and Princess Weeda, Texas.

879
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,680
It's rough.

880
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,360
Well, no.

881
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,920
We're still going to be doing

882
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,000
X-Day up here

883
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,300
and Starwood up here,

884
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,820
assuming we have to keep doing

885
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:02,480
anything after this July 5th.

886
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,160
Which, by the way,

887
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,760
people who do wander

888
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,860
into the X-Day campground

889
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:08,620
this year

890
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,540
really do stand a chance

891
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:14,120
of being in a major

892
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,120
motion picture...

893
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:15,880
Well, documentary.

894
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,540
But they're all brown shirts

895
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,800
staying next to problem.

896
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,540
They're all members

897
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,760
of the private mockery

898
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,420
of the Mango Mussolini himself.

899
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,140
Who?

900
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,360
Who?

901
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,500
People at X-Day?

902
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,460
They don't even have shirts.

903
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,860
What are you talking about?

904
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:32,160
Of course not.

905
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,920
Much less brown ones.

906
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:34,720
They're sky-clad,

907
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,800
bare-naked brown shirts.

908
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:36,800
And the brown shirts

909
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,440
are only brown

910
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,780
because they, you know,

911
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:39,520
kind of soil themselves

912
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,260
a little bit.

913
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:40,940
That's all.

914
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,000
Yeah, they're saving

915
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,020
on toilet paper.

916
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,100
It's just not a big deal.

917
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,620
Oh, look at the brown pantos.

918
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,440
Brown pantos.

919
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:45,620
Brown pantos.

920
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:45,860
Brown pantos.

921
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:45,860


922
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:45,860


923
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:45,860


924
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:45,860


925
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,960
A lot of subgenius doctors

926
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,120
used to do that.

927
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,780
Soil their...

928
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,200
What?

929
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,820
It's a shower curtain

930
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,620
related thing.

931
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:56,380
You wouldn't understand.

932
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,800
Let's change the subject.

933
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,760
Let's change the subject.

934
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,080
In fact, in about...

935
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,180
In about three minutes,

936
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:04,960
I'm going to change

937
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,440
the subject to some music.

938
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,820
And I'm sure the listeners

939
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:09,960
will be happy about that.

940
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,540
What have I got?

941
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:11,980
I had something coming.

942
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,240
Oh, the Psychoskeletons

943
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,180
have a new tune.

944
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,240
I left my list at home.

945
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,340
It has a title like...

946
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,080
Something like Psychodrums

947
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,360
or Schizophrenic Drums.

948
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,780
Why don't you just make up

949
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:25,220
the names of the bands

950
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,240
and the lyrics yourself?

951
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,380
You know, just make them up.

952
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,260
You don't need to go

953
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,820
all the way home right now

954
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:30,660
to get ready to...

955
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,140
No, that's what we do at X Day.

956
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,020
I'm not going to do that

957
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:33,840
all the time.

958
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,720
We make up the bands

959
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,360
then and there.

960
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:36,940
Anyway, yeah,

961
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:37,800
there's going to be...

962
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,020
What was the new slogan?

963
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,220
Bob Needs Women.

964
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:43,960
Nasty women

965
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,720
to be in the...

966
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,820
in the subgenius documentary

967
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,060
filmed by a bunch of nasty women.

968
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:52,480
Although you wouldn't think it

969
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,180
to look at them.

970
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,060
They look pretty...

971
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:55,500
pretty...

972
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,160
not nasty.

973
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,200
But looks are not important

974
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,900
in the Church of the Subgenius.

975
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,900
Just look at our grades.

976
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,220
They're terrible.

977
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,980
Yeah, and we can all be like

978
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,260
going to fetal positions

979
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,320
really quickly

980
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,180
and quite easily

981
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,100
and snap right back

982
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:13,860
into normal...

983
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,460
normal...

984
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,300
almost.

985
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,780
So, uh, okay.

986
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,700
Dr. Sinister has gone to go

987
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,120
look for something

988
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,320
to play on his show.

989
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,360
That's his way.

990
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,620
He doesn't really think about it

991
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,360
until he gets here.

992
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,820
I'm the opposite.

993
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,540
I start fretting about it

994
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,000
two hours before

995
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,420
it's time to go on the air.

996
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,020
I thought there was...

997
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,360
you were a colonialist

998
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,380
and that your grandpappy,

999
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,960
I think it was

1000
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,360
Elmo P. Fordard,

1001
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,500
and was the emperor

1002
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,900
and transpector.

1003
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,300
No, you're thinking of

1004
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,700
Senator Cotton Ed Smith.

1005
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,200
That was another ancestor.

1006
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,180
Right, right, right.

1007
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,960
Poon Pappy.

1008
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,340
Or Dune Pappy.

1009
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:57,820
Okay.

1010
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,040
Okay, friends,

1011
00:53:59,140 --> 00:53:59,900
you're listening to

1012
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,960
The Hour of Slack.

1013
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,000
This is around

1014
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,840
the 1600th episode.

1015
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,960
We've been doing it

1016
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,880
for over 35 years now.

1017
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,980
And you probably know

1018
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,100
all you want to know,

1019
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,380
but just in case,

1020
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,220
you could look

1021
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,740
at subgenius.com.

1022
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:14,900
And see about

1023
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,000
this X-Day event

1024
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,620
that happens on July,

1025
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,480
early July,

1026
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,240
and the Starwood event,

1027
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:21,920
which happens

1028
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,940
a couple weeks later

1029
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:23,920
in the same place

1030
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,640
in Southern Ohio,

1031
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,300
and the devotional,

1032
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,400
which is in August

1033
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,100
in Cleveland.

1034
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,060
And then we go back

1035
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,600
to our fossil hunting.

1036
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:33,960
And Dave,

1037
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:34,940
I'm going to have to fade

1038
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,260
you and Princess We out

1039
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,640
because it's time

1040
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,120
to put this music on.

1041
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:40,960
I think.

1042
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,440
If it were only

1043
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,220
could be really

1044
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,260
considered music,

1045
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,460
and so be it.

1046
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,880
Psychoskeletons are ooga.

1047
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,100
Ooga.

1048
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:35,980
Unfortunately,

1049
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:36,760
we're not yellow swans.

1050
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:36,800
I do wonder

1051
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:36,860
why not yellow swans.

1052
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:36,880
That's not sure at all.

1053
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:37,120
I've been living

1054
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:37,120


1055
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:37,120


1056
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:37,520
they're not gentlemanly

1057
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:37,580
and not perfectly

1058
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:37,600
hunting,

1059
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:41,940
color or animal wenig.

1060
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:41,940


1061
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:41,940


1062
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:41,940


1063
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:41,940


1064
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,340
as if they're

1065
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,240
Thank you.

1066
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,180
Thank you.

1067
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,400
Thank you.

1068
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,600
Thank you.

1069
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,100
Thank you.

1070
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,320
Thank you.

1071
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,480
Thank you.

1072
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,440
Thank you.
