00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420
From PR News in Washington, I'm earmarked for infrastructure and urban development.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,720
PR's report reports a judge has struck down Kentucky.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,980
Judge says PR News.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,800
On Wall Street 46954446215.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,600
Today, this is PR News.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,120
How's that? You are a wee snot.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,220
Ah-ho!

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,240
Ah-ho!

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,420
Wah-ha! Aren't you a bobby dazzler?

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,320
How's that? You are a wee snot.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,500
Ah-ho!

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,840
Wah-ha! Aren't you a...

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,880
Self-genius. Power of...

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,680
Swag!

15
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48,360
I promise to cut taxes for the rich and use the poor as a cheap source of tea for aquarium gravel.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,680
That'll show those poor.

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:50,660
You're not rich.

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,020
But someday I might be rich, and then people like me better watch their step.

23
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,680
Alex Jones and David Duke met up and had a drink.

24
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,660
They laughed and joked and Alex said,

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,980
I'll tell you what I think!

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,100
Because of Trump's hyperbole and other crazy shit.

27
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,260
We used to be out on the fringe and now we're both legit.

28
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,520
Losing feels new to him and even though he's blue.

29
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,780
A billionaire with savoir faire has so much more to do.

30
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,920
It's back to Mar-a-Lago with the golf and chauffeur cars.

31
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,140
And if that doesn't work, there's always Dancing With The Stars.

32
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,200
Donald Trump called Roger Ailes...

33
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,360
...and said, I have a plan.

34
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,520
And when it comes to media, I know that you're the man.

35
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,760
Viagrified misogynists like us should act as one.

36
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,300
Let's partner up with Trump TV and really have some fun!

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:05,840
Woo!

38
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,420
Woo!

39
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,800
If I may, I dare to say, we've learned a valued lesson.

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,800
When cult of personality meets media obsession.

41
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,660
There's a brand new playbook.

42
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,860
We've passed on to our descendants.

43
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,960
Fabricate and elevate absurd to the transcendent.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,360
He's right, you know.

45
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,100
Quite!

46
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,200
Indubitably.

47
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,520
Super psycho Nazi racist, Trump is psychopathic.

48
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,580
Killing off Republicans just makes it that more tragic.

49
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,700
Build a wall and make us rich and do it all with magic.

50
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,160
Super psycho Nazi racist, Trump is psychopathic.

51
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,360
Super psycho Nazi racist, Trump is psychopathic.

52
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,580
Super psycho Nazi racist, Trump is psychopathic.

53
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,520
Super psycho Nazi racist, Trump is psychopathic.

54
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,300
Hi, my name is Metroton.

55
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,420
You might know me by that other name, Satan.

56
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,800
I run the Soul Recycling Plant.

57
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,160
Some of you humans call it Gehinim or Hell.

58
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,380
During this All Hallows season, the adjacencies of our worlds,

59
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,660
I decided I'd accept the invitation of my student and vessel, Reverend Watdefock,

60
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,060
and give a friendly shout out to Stang, Susie, and all my good buddies at the Church of the Subgenius.

61
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,520
And to all you fine mutants listening at home,

62
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,880
a bit of helpful inside info for your success up in there and survival back out here.

63
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,760
Look, nobody thinks garbage men are actually made out of garbage, right?

64
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,140
Just like me.

65
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,140
Hey, I'm a legitimate businessman in waste management.

66
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,000
Now, how could I possibly have kept this place running all these millennia if I was motivated

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,960
by hatred, rage, and a passion to destroy everything?

68
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,860
Come on.

69
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,940
You have nothing to fear, my friends.

70
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,460
Only those fanatical dogmatists burn with rage to find themselves back here with every

71
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,780
other mortal and not flapping white bow-tie shaped wings in time to harp music or something.

72
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,120
But I'm confident you subgenii are healthy enough to recognize the sickle-sickle of the

73
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,120


74
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,120


75
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,140
cyclical unity of creation and destruction, and that you'll dance joyfully, laughing,

76
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,680
and sneezing and climaxing as you dissolve back into the sea of potential cosmic energy

77
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,580
from which all springs.

78
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:40,380
So from all of us here in the Heavenly Host, Saints Pete, Mike, Ann, and me, Satan, together

79
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,580
with the Most High, Mr. and Mrs. God and their family, who their friends call them, Yahweh

80
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,200
and Ashtarati, their sons, Jesus, Belial, Bob, Buddha, Cthulhu, and Krishna, and their

81
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,120
daughters Lilith, Virginia-whore, and the rest of the family, I'm sure you've heard of them.

82
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,800
And the twins, Zipporah, Laura, and Babette.

83
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,140
A joyous and prosperous solstice, Beltane, and New Year.

84
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,080
Oh, yeah, I wanted to add, nearly every time some religious, blithering idiot is calling

85
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,900
out something like, get thee behind me, Satan, of course I am nowhere around.

86
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,560
But it's just possible one of you might catch me when I'm attracted to his ignorant noise

87
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,140
and I've had a couple shots, and I start chanting, I'm not touching you, stop hitting yourself.

88
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,120
I'm not touching you, stop hitting yourself.

89
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,040
Sometimes I just love that little prank.

90
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,880
Okay.

91
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,300
This is Metroton, returning your electronic network device to its original programming.

92
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,440
By Reverend Wat Default.

93
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,320
Reverend Basil of the Psychoskeletons is going to be mad because we're talking over his music.

94
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:38,780
Oh, no.

95
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,620
But I'll play it again.

96
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,980
It's a little piece called Keyboardistan.

97
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,700
Yeah, or a guy named Basil should come up with something that sounds like a metabolistic

98
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,460
characteristic.

99
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,100
Well, I don't know.

100
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,120
I don't know.

101
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,640
Well, Reverend Basil is the Psychoskeletons.

102
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,320
Or he's one Psychoskeleton, but I think the other Psychoskeleton is probably just his computer.

103
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,660
Oh, he eats slightly peppery herb as well.

104
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,680
Oh, it's the dance of the...

105
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,480
Or carnivorous old man.

106
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,080
I hear the winter dance of the koala sperm harvest in the background.

107
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,980
That's the name of this.

108
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,360
It's the Rudy Schwartz project.

109
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,140
I like it.

110
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:20,980
Yeah.

111
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,080
I like it.

112
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,080


113
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,080


114
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,360
I like it.

115
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,620
Winter dance of the koala sperm harvest.

116
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:32,120
You know, I told you the show was ending just a little while ago, and yet it hasn't ended.

117
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,060
This is the show that refused to die.

118
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,860
This is...

119
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,620
I almost missed that one because I'm confused.

120
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,380
This is a confused show.

121
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,820
Like I told you, I've done...

122
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,300
I've had to put together three shows today.

123
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,080
And I've gotten really mixed up.

124
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,840
I've got a lot of stuff mixed up between them.

125
00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:01,660
And this part here is going to end up on another show that's really mixed up between the last

126
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,600
X Day Drill and the X Day Drill before it.

127
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,980
It's a bunch of crazy stuff, man.

128
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,200
I just don't even know where this show's going, when it starts, when it ends.

129
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,300
And the horrible thing is with these new hearing aids, I can actually hear the show.

130
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,860
And that's what's making you cry.

131
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,560
And the song.

132
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,060
You realize that?

133
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,060


134
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,160
Yeah.

135
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,060
The awfulness.

136
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,420
Yeah.

137
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,380
Of the material you've been hoarding.

138
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,400
You've been rubbing so slowly like Smeagol and Gollum or whatever its name is.

139
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,280
It's like rubbing a ring or something like that around your shoulder.

140
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,320
My precious.

141
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,760
My precious shoulder shoulders.

142
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,780
My buffalo shoulders.

143
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,420
So you're wearing buffalo shorts now?

144
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,500
I was earlier, but then it got cold.

145
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,080
That's why we have to fly south.

146
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,600
Only we're not flying.

147
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,180
We're towing a giant load of art and books, actually.

148
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:00,800
Yeah.

149
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,340
In your case, you guys will be toe jamming.

150
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,080
Right.

151
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,780
All the way to Hinkleyville.

152
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,020
Well, Hinkleyville?

153
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,700
No, that's over by Cleburne.

154
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,040
Nobody goes over there.

155
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,100
It's boring.

156
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,340
Hey, you know what?

157
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,540
I'm going to play a different song now because-

158
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,680
But first, tell them it's .

159
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,920
Oh, I did.

160
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,320
Okay.

161
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,560
I'm going to play Nick of Time.

162
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,840
A subsequent show has just arrived, Dave, so I'm going to hang up and say goodbye.

163
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:29,860
Okay, Nick.

164
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:38,000
And I'm going to put on a song by Mutate Now, a German subgenius band in Germany.

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,680
Oh, I thought it was by Nick Cater and the four Nick Caters.

166
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,180
Doing an old Devo song called Mechanical Man.

167
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,120
See you later, Mechanic.

168
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,040
Mechanical Man.

169
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,680
See you later, Man.

170
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,360
Man.

171
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,740
Man.

172
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:50,860
Man.

173
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,060
Man.

174
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,200
Man.

175
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,760
Man.

176
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,400
Man.

177
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:14,900
Man.

178
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,300
Man.

179
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:15,800
Man.

180
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:15,800


181
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:15,800


182
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:15,800


183
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:15,800


184
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:15,800


185
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:15,800


186
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:15,800


187
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:15,800


188
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:15,800


189
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:15,800


190
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:15,800


191
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:15,800


192
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,660
Premature liao guy started playing....

193
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,260
I'm still in high school.

194
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:19,260


195
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:19,260


196
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:19,660
Excuse me, shorty.

197
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,280
I'm at the Rediresọt represents friends, though.

198
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,740
I'm a 2 plus 2 equals 4 man.

199
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,820
I'm a mechanical man.

200
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,680
I'm a mechanical man.

201
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,380
I'm a mechanical man.

202
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,140
I'm a mechanical man.

203
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:20,560
I'm a mechanical man.

204
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,980
I'm a mechanical man.

205
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,900
I'm a mechanical man.

206
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,920
2 mechanical arms.

207
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,820
2 mechanical legs.

208
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,700
I'm a 2 plus 2 equals 4 man.

209
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,680
We feel small.

210
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,500
We work well.

211
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,320
We run well.

212
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,380
We run well.

213
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,600
We feel small.

214
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,560
We work well.

215
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,240
We run well.

216
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,980
We go.

217
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,700
We feel small.

218
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,780
We work well.

219
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,280
We want what you want.

220
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,860
We feel small.

221
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,920
We work well.

222
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,380
We want what you got.

223
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,920
We feel small.

224
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,940
We work well.

225
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,380
What you want.

226
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:13,200
Oh yes, dear friends, and welcome to the hour of slack number 1,591.

227
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,340
The titles and news at the beginning of this episode came from Lemur.

228
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:25,000
Lemur. Super Psycho Nazi Racist Trump is Psychopathic was by the great Reverend Jimmy Ryan,

229
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,220
and he's been working on that for about a month. He would have beat everybody else to it, but

230
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,120
we were late with this show. In fact, that song is the main reason this show's not a re-run,

231
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,820
because we really did move the whole station to deepest rural Texas.

232
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:47,420
This is your host in prayer party, Reverend Ivan Stang, speaking to you from Tarzan's radio

233
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:47,980
station.

234
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:55,740
Now installed at the 9th Megafist Temple Lodge on Dockstock Mountain, Stang Ranch, Stangspill, Texas.

235
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,740
This used to be my parents' house, but they are on the saucers now,

236
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,120
so we have finished turning it into a proper Texas cult compound.

237
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:11,140
Our new studio is in a big room that already had animal heads and skins mounted on the walls,

238
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,520
but now they've been joined by a huge metal gobs head and lots of other bull dada.

239
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:22,960
We'll include Lonesome Cowboy Dave by phone in future shows produced here, but not tonight,

240
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:29,740
because we're still unpacking. We have several unreleased shows recorded last July at X Day Drill,

241
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,500
as well as lots of music and shenanigans from that same week-long festival. And tonight?

242
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:43,560
Tonight we're playing all kinds of leftover stuff, spillovers, recent subgenius head-launching news

243
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,800
commentary from Radio CineState.

244
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,760
Anesthesia on WCSB.

245
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,480
And some poetry by Reverend Andrew Genus from 18X Day.

246
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,080
Some Charles Dawkins remixed by Reverend Experimental, please.

247
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,180
Jimmy Ryan guitar.

248
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:08,740
And part two of the second 19X Day show with Dr. Howland Owl and Reverend Susie the Floozy,

249
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:16,180
both of whom have hosted their own subgenius radio shows for decades in San Francisco and Atlanta, respectively.

250
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,440
Well, anyway, that's what all we're going to be hearing.

251
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,920
But now, some tragic news from Dr. Sinister.

252
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,240
Well, hey, I heard some interesting news just now.

253
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,160
Okay.

254
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,460
That Arnold Palmer just died.

255
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,540
You know what the weird thing is? They did a joke about him on the Simpsons tonight.

256
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,840
Wow.

257
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,300
Wow.

258
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:45,760
Wow.

259
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,200
Wow.

260
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:46,500


261
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:46,500


262
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:46,500


263
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:46,500


264
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,440
They did a joke about Willy Wonka, you know, the Gene Wilder movie.

265
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,180
Man, there's something sinister going on, and I don't mean that in a good way.

266
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,080
Yeah.

267
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,180
With the Fox cartoons.

268
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,280
But, yeah, I'm thinking of what this means for the church's subgenius.

269
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:12,420
Actually, nothing, because there has not been a single launch of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer in a decade or more.

270
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,400
Mm-hmm.

271
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,800
So.

272
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,320
Apparently, we were over him before the rest of, you know, before he was over himself.

273
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,580
But we definitely couldn't do a launching of the bleeding head now.

274
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,320
It just wouldn't be tasteful.

275
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,200
Maybe, maybe, just maybe, this will bring it back.

276
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:31,980
I don't know.

277
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,520
Right, right.

278
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,100
When you don't hear me say anything, that means I'm checking the recordings, making sure the numbers.

279
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,260
Everything's going fine.

280
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:42,900
Yeah.

281
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,680
No trouble.

282
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,020
No trouble.

283
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,620
When you don't hear me say anything, feel very happy.

284
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,660
Well, feel free to shoot something in.

285
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,160
Yeah.

286
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,000
Just make some remark that occurs to you, and it'll all become part of the permanent Akashic Records.

287
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,960
Etched in.

288
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,680
Yeah.

289
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,580
Bob remembers everything.

290
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,020
Preserved in Edomantium.

291
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,460
I'm going to become part of the fossil record.

292
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,320
Well, you can dance to it.

293
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,300
It's got a good beat.

294
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,800
We're swinging here at X Day 19.

295
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,760
On top of a whole.

296
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,180
A whole geological heap of fossiliferous organisms.

297
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:24,900
The geological column ascends and stops under us.

298
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,600
Creation has occurred that I can be.

299
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,340
The ages have an heir, and I am he.

300
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,160
So I hope everyone is comfortable and ready for what is to come.

301
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,180
What does Owee Moet mean?

302
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,000
What does Owee Moet mean?

303
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,760
Owee Moet mean Dr. Howell?

304
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,360
Or do I need to give you a dollar before I ask you?

305
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,660
Tonight the lions eat.

306
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,820
The lions are going to eat all these saps who are lying around.

307
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:05,280
I guess it means the time of gathering the easily harvested.

308
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,060
So appropriate.

309
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,300
I have an alternative to the Ask Dr. Howell show,

310
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,580
which we'll do either Saturday or Sunday when there's lots of people here.

311
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,760
It's the Tell Reverend Stang show.

312
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:26,040
You pay me a dollar and I'll sit and listen to your whining or your jokes or your story.

313
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,020
Sounds like the Tell Off Reverend Stang show.

314
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,740
You can do that.

315
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,780
You can tell me off.

316
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,880
You can yell at me.

317
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,380
But you do have to pay me.

318
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,220
And don't ask me anything.

319
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,860
This is the Tell Reverend Stang show.

320
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,180
So.

321
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:44,940
Just.

322
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,400
And that's available.

323
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,060
First time you ever heard of it.

324
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,360
That service is available 24-7 pretty much.

325
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,020
You can wake me up and yell at me as long as you pay me.

326
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:55,820
What?

327
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,280
They can come into the house?

328
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,300
Well, if they can find us.

329
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,640
I guess the 24-7 offer is not really applicable.

330
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,060
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

331
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,700
Yes, Tell Off Reverend Stang.

332
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,920
So we've also taken unto ourselves.

333
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:14,920


334
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,560
The Grindhouse.

335
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:23,860
And last night we're showing one of the Chinese epic trilogy films.

336
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,300
The Monkey King Legend.

337
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,080
And what an exciting film it is.

338
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,300
And there are more movie thrills to come.

339
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,320
Aren't they, Stang?

340
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,200
Yeah, except that the last two nights everybody went down to the stage and watched the live

341
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,400
show.

342
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,000
You see.

343
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,920
So we're going to do that.

344
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,100
And the only people in here were you, me, and Dr. Dark watching them.

345
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,800
And a couple other people watching Monkey King on and off.

346
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,380
Yes, just a handful of us were watching that.

347
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,760
Because see, why would you go to a campground and watch movies?

348
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,220
The movie's in the can.

349
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,040
You can watch it any time.

350
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:05,420
You can't frop with your fellow subgeniuses except at X Day.

351
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,940
Or I guess you could drive all over the country doing that.

352
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,120
Yes, try to work your way out of that one.

353
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,960
I'll just start the screen show again.

354
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,240
So, yeah, thank you.

355
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,660
Thank you for helping me change the subject here.

356
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,480
All right.

357
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,660
Well, let's not mention The Grindhouse then, which apparently no one will attend.

358
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,800
We can leave that option open.

359
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,480
We'll see.

360
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,520
It was fun around dinner time.

361
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,760
I was wondering what else you had assembled for it.

362
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,340
You mean what other movies?

363
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:40,700
Yeah.

364
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,120
Oh, I've got a movie called Enter the Void.

365
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,900
Anybody familiar with that?

366
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,860
Enter the Void?

367
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,500
Yeah.

368
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,860
It was a Gaspar Noe directed it.

369
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,180
Oh, my God.

370
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,840
It's very, very, very twisted.

371
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,660
It would be.

372
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,220
It's all one shot, ostensibly.

373
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,180
It's all one point of view.

374
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,140
The entire movie is a point of view shot of a dead man.

375
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,160
He's alive at the beginning of the movie and on drugs.

376
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:13,800
And while he's alive, he stands in front of a mirror and when he blinks, the screen goes

377
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,900
black for a second.

378
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:14,900


379
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:14,900


380
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:14,900


381
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:14,900


382
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:14,900


383
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:14,900


384
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:14,900


385
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:14,900


386
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:14,900


387
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:14,900


388
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:14,900


389
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:14,900


390
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:14,900


391
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,380
And then he dies somehow and there's no more blinking after that.

392
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,440
But he can fly all over Tokyo as a ghost.

393
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,600
And it's just this one endless shot.

394
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,220
He flies through walls and spies on whore houses and goes to see his girlfriend.

395
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,000
And oh, it's a cosmic and disturbing movie.

396
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,780
I could put that one on.

397
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,680
Well, it's not for kids, though.

398
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,440
No.

399
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,620
It would have to be late at night.

400
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,600
As Robert Crumb said, not everything is for kids.

401
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:44,900
Not everything is for kids.

402
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:44,900


403
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:44,900


404
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:44,900


405
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:44,900


406
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:44,900


407
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:44,900


408
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:44,900


409
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,220
Not everything is for everyone.

410
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,700
And one for all.

411
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,520
And this is a good time for me to turn off this recorder.

412
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,760
And this recorder is still running, but I have to flip this.

413
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,440
Okay, Jerry Todd.

414
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,520
Tell everyone how you do your technical tricks.

415
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,320
This is the visible show.

416
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,780
Behind the scenes.

417
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:06,960
Yes.

418
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:06,960


419
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,040
Just let our people who are listening know exactly what's going on behind the scenes

420
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,360
to familiarize them with our procedures.

421
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,880
Thank you.

422
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,040
I just got a nice note.

423
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,040
It says, please don't all come at once.

424
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:19,760
Huh?

425
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:28,820
But anyone who is not yet registered can come and be registered by Princess We Are

426
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,760
Dole.

427
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,420
By golly, that's right.

428
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,680
I could use some coming.

429
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,900
Queen of all the UFOs.

430
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,080
She will register you as you've never been registered before and give you a copy

431
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,020
of the registration booklet.

432
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,740
Is it like that deer processing business thing?

433
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:44,880
Yeah.

434
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,100
This is the deer crossing sign.

435
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,680
Do they have a lot of signs around here?

436
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,200
Yes.

437
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,320
I saw the signs.

438
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,640
I'm like, what is that, immigration?

439
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:53,900
Wow.

440
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,420
Wow.

441
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,500
Do they put those deer crossing signs?

442
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,140
So the deer can read them, of course.

443
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,480
I thought that was to do the antler dance.

444
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:08,820
Someone wrote a letter to the New York State Highway Department complaining that they always

445
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,320
put deer crossing signs where the deer would get run over when they read them.

446
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,880
Remember, deer crossing signs.

447
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


448
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


449
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


450
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


451
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


452
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


453
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


454
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


455
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


456
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


457
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


458
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


459
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


460
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


461
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


462
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,980
Oh.

463
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:15,880
Yeah.

464
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,880
Why don't they put them at school crossings?

465
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,740
You know, because kids are going to be crossing anyway.

466
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:30,920
That woman was identified by trolls on the internet and boy, did they make her feel dumb.

467
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:38,100
But she later came out and said, well, that may have been a dumb thing for me to say, but

468
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,860
I'm not as dumb as all those haters hating on me.

469
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
And I agree.

470
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,580
Really?

471
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,860
I did think it was my fault.

472
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,920
It was one of the funniest things I've ever heard in my life.

473
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,840
I thought it was funny.

474
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,060
And it was dumb.

475
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,460
It was one of the dumbest things.

476
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,140
But I also knew that the bullies would come out and be so very mean.

477
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,780
Because you know you always got to pick on somebody just a little dumber than you, right?

478
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,980
Is that really the whole smart Mr. Smarty Pants?

479
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,000
Well, they like to recognize dumbness in someone other than themselves.

480
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,720
What would Saint Stupid say?

481
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,360
He would say, I know, I know.

482
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,000
But you know you never know.

483
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,220
He's a real dummy pants.

484
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,360
He thinks he's the dumbest guy in the whole world.

485
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,720
Mr. Dummy Pants.

486
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,620
Saint Stupid.

487
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,960
Well, actually that's Saint Stupid, not to be confused with Bishop Joey, his oracle.

488
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,640
He's Mr. Dummy Pants.

489
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,960
Mr. Stupid Pants, I call him.

490
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,300
Thinks he's stupider than Bob.

491
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,200
Santo is stupid.

492
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,560
Come on.

493
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,220
You really think you're stupider than Bob, Mr. Stupid Pants?

494
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,160
Well, it's such a thing as...

495
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,340
Well, I don't know.

496
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,400
Against the law.

497
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,340
Coming around here today.

498
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:46,340


499
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:46,340


500
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:46,520
Whang.

501
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,340
Doing that.

502
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:48,340


503
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,760
Taking the butler as the skipper.

504
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,680
Well thank you so much to all of your examples for that.

505
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,980
You didn't song that song last time you did?

506
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:56,980


507
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:56,980


508
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:56,980


509
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,440
Why don't I try to tell you a bit more original song for you.

510
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,440


511
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,100
Well, I just want you, as Chief Ken there, to know what a great mansion Saint Stupid

512
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,100


513
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,300
Oh dear.

514
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,240
Great стоит site is it.

515
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,240


516
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,240


517
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:14,120
We're going to have a fair and Nou bleiben Thais Н принимен энс Arologist

518
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,900
for the Bulldada auction.

519
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,420
We are collecting and assimilating those contents now.

520
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,260
Unfortunately, a crate of exclusive items

521
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,200
was not, by an accident, shipped to Ex Day.

522
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,620
So we're trying to take up the slack, as it were.

523
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,140
Actually, it wasn't a big shipment.

524
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,740
It was a thong, a tiny little thong

525
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,760
with a bob on the front and a knee-gee on the very back.

526
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,160
Yes, the thong remains the same.

527
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,280
I have no idea what you're talking about.

528
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,920
I thought it was a crate, a box.

529
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,480
No, no, no.

530
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,320
Just one manhole cover?

531
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,820
And some fridge magnets, bob fridge magnets.

532
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,940
And I voted for Bob Button.

533
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,620
I ordered a whole bunch of I voted for Bob Buttons.

534
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,520
But no one gets one.

535
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,180
Oh, the Trump people got in the way, or Killary or somebody.

536
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,140
Those fascist pigs were hassling some righteous dudes.

537
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,400
Oh, yeah.

538
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,040
Well, at any rate, we have got some nifty Ex Day

539
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,780
bull-dodger auction materials together

540
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:27,280
that will startle you and shock you and surprise you.

541
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,380
But we need more.

542
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,720
So if you have any to contribute to the aggregate,

543
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,100
please bring them in.

544
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,200
In any case, come and join in the joyful bidding

545
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,740
for the detritus of the Church of the Sun.

546
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:41,760
And I hope you'll join us for the next episode

547
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,040
of the Subgenius, which is a large part of everything that happens.

548
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,800
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

549
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,900
Are we not all toys or baubles for Bob?

550
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,920
Recording, everything's going fine.

551
00:26:59,140 --> 00:26:59,800
Yes.

552
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,380
Going fine.

553
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:07,020
No sign of disintegration.

554
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,640
Oh, what was...

555
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,580
Oh, we were talking about establishing a subgenius.

556
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,540
We were establishing a competition

557
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,800
for the Creationist Museum in Stainesville

558
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,380
called the Destructionist Museum.

559
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,200
Yes, that was a good idea.

560
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,900
We got at least that far.

561
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,020
Establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility,

562
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,640
provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare.

563
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,380
And I see you brought in a news sheet.

564
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,720
Yeah, this is an article

565
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,760
about the Creation Evidence Museum in Stainesville.

566
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,440
And there's a picture of Dr. Ball,

567
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,680
the creationist scientist.

568
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,240
My father got interested in just exactly where Dr. Ball,

569
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,680
the creationist, got his doctorate.

570
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,380
And it turned out to come from the Dr. Ball Institute,

571
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,840
which is located on a vacant lot next to his museum.

572
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,300
Well, the important thing is to be certified.

573
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:09,540
Yes, this museum shows how Jesus rode a triceratops into Jerusalem.

574
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,380
But, yeah, you can go to the Creationist Museum in Stainesville.

575
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,260
And you can see these absurd dioramas in there, in the museum.

576
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:26,220
Happy children before Noah's flood play with their pet theropods.

577
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,380
Since Facebook busted me, I might as well admit

578
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,060
that Stainesville isn't really called Stainesville.

579
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,400
It's really called Smithtown.

580
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,780
And Smithtown is a lot better than Jonestown.

581
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:38,820
Yeah.

582
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,840
So far.

583
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,020
It's bigger than Jonestown.

584
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,540
Bigger and better.

585
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,360
Because we learn from our mistakes.

586
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,240
And as Mark Twain said,

587
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,260
I was dead for billions and billions of years before I was born,

588
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,040
and never suffered the smallest inconvenience.

589
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,720
So we were all dead through the time of the dinosaurs

590
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,300
and the time of the trilobites

591
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,560
and the time of early humans and so on.

592
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,800
Um, I mean, I do think that,

593
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,820
there is something quite frightening about the idea of eternity.

594
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:17,340
The idea of just eternity going on and on and on and on and on.

595
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,760
Um, but, again, eternity before you were born

596
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,360
is just about as frightening as eternity after you're dead.

597
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,180
Um, and to the extent that eternity is frightening,

598
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,960
I think I want to spend eternity under a general anaesthetic.

599
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,300
And that's exactly what's going to happen.

600
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:36,840
Hmm.

601
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,780
Because when you're dead, of course, you're going to die.

602
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,040
Yes, you are.

603
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,000
Anaesthetised.

604
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,000
You don't know about it.

605
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,460
I think the nearest I could come to that would be

606
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:54,200
dying for, to preserve truth,

607
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,720
something like scientific proof, something like that.

608
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,020
Um, I, um, I value what humanity has achieved,

609
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:08,060
not just in science, but in literature and music and things as well.

610
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,220
Um, I, um, I do think there's something sad about the prospect that there will come a

611
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,360
I do think there's something sad about a single entity anywhere in the universe will know,

612
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:27,200
not a single entity anywhere in the universe will know anything about Shakespeare or Mozart,

613
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,760
anything about, um, Shakespeare and so on.

614
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,540
Oh.

615
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,780
Uh, well then, you can't really be too sure about that.

616
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:38,780


617
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:43,020
I think there's something about the schedule or about what might be shown or what might happen on the stage.

618
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:50,880
But there are some things that we know about, I suppose, and can, can confidently say are going forth, going forward.

619
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,600
Well, we'll have the baptism on Saturday.

620
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,060
That's about one of the few things that's scheduled.

621
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,620
And the party, the big party with costume party, formerly we had a theme.

622
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,980
I thought it was the no costume party.

623
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,900
Yeah, from now on, well, no or what?

624
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,960
This year, the no costume party.

625
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,980
Yeah, or the, uh, come up with your own idea party.

626
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,120
I've got mine. It's a secret, though.

627
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,240
All right, well, there you go.

628
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,480
Everybody's gonna laugh. It's real funny.

629
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,880
For, well, for a minute.

630
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,840
Like this show, funny for a minute.

631
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:24,900
Funny.

632
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,960
But slack for an hour.

633
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,480
Not funny, haha.

634
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,800
Slack to the future. Slack lives matter. Slack magic.

635
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,200
From the dawn of time.

636
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,840
Yeah, slack from the dawn of time.

637
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,920
The time that time forgot again and again.

638
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:46,480
All right, well, I might want to peruse that article when you're through with it.

639
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,640
Well, it was, oh, it's actually really funny.

640
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,100
It's for when things get too slow.

641
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:00,400
I used to believe and teach the theory of evolution, and I do not any longer, Dr. Baugh explained.

642
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:06,000
Part of the evidence that led me to adapt the evolutionary theory was the Piltdown Man.

643
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,720
Ha ha ha.

644
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,840
The Piltdown Man was a transitional form, but later it was found to be a frog.

645
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,700
The other philosophy is creation, and that we were designed and created.

646
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:25,780
And I hold to that for scientific reasons, for experimental reasons, and for biblical reasons.

647
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,880
I don't care.

648
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,940
Uh, so because one theory was wrong, all theories are wrong, friends.

649
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,860
Mm-hmm.

650
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:45,560
Well, you can pick and choose your theories, and you can scratch and sit while you pick them and choose them,

651
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:55,080
and chew and spit and pick and scratch, and then you'll have yourself a unified religion, theology, or philosophy.

652
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:02,200
Or you can just believe us in the church of the subgenius and not go through that procedure.

653
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,660
Well, but you see, the naturalist philosophy of evolution is based on...

654
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:14,160
Seven assumptions, none of which have ever been demonstrated in a laboratory or found in a field investigation.

655
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:21,960
But what about God's laboratory, and what about the divine field investigation?

656
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:29,960
Well, yeah, of course. But look, there are seven assumptions that have not been proven, Dr. Baugh said.

657
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,420
Yes, seven holes in the head, the seven hills of Rome, seven brides for seven brothers.

658
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,240
Okay, number one...

659
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,780
Seven come alive and eight will be confused.

660
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:43,300
Number one, non-living elements gave rise to living material.

661
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,720
That's never been proved.

662
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,320
Happens all the time.

663
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,780
That's never been proved, but now it's scientifically not true.

664
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:54,360
It happens right over here in this part of the universe, that when you put enough energy into matter, it likes to organize itself.

665
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:04,420
And we even have crystals and inanimate mineral forms which deliberately make themselves more complicated and organize themselves into lattices.

666
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,720
Lattices of new creation.

667
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,620
Well, that's just ridiculous, and it's not biblical.

668
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,660
Number two assumption that's never been proven.

669
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,800
Spontaneous generation occurred only once.

670
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:28,840
No, spontaneous generation was for a long time the only method around until the invention of sex, which was followed afterwards with the necessary invention of death.

671
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,560
Number three that has never been proven experimentally.

672
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,900
Viruses, bacteria, plants, and animals are all related.

673
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,320
That's just crazy.

674
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:48,780
Not only has it been proven, but that person who wrote that shouldn't be given antibiotics when he goes to the hospital since it apparently interferes with the depth of his belief.

675
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,520
Number four, it's never been proven that single-celled life forms gave rise to multiple-celled life forms.

676
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:00,820
Well, apparently no one ever asked a single-celled life form about that.

677
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:11,140
But our most simple multi-cell life forms even today are made of joined cluster of single cells.

678
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:18,320
Number five, those silly scientists think that various invertebrate phyla are interrelated.

679
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:28,880
Yes, it's odd why anyone would think that shelled creatures with dorsal hearts and ventral nervous systems would all be related.

680
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:36,460
Well, Mr. Smarty Pants, number six that's never been proved is invertebrates gave rise to the vertebrates.

681
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,860
Now you proved that to me, Mr. Smarty Pants.

682
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:47,060
Oh, I don't think anybody thinks that. I think we were squashy and wiggly before we got all these hardened cartilaginous parts and later bones.

683
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:58,140
And the seventh assumption that is so stupid is that fish gave rise to amphibians, to reptiles, to birds, to mammals, to primates, to man.

684
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:02,600
Apparently man, primates, and mammals are all different.

685
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:17,040
Well, according to the Bible, they are all standing on the other side and not given the souls which the monkey boy humans are awarded on the basis of no deserving nature whatsoever.

686
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:26,500
So here we have an Australopithecus that according to philosophy may have a feature that would transition to homo, yet the evidence shows he was simply an ape.

687
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,120
The descent of man.

688
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,120


689
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:33,000
The descent of man is shown thousands of times today between television, newspapers, and textbooks.

690
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:39,940
But what the propaganda does not talk about at all is all of the precursors leading up to homo everlast.

691
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:45,340
One of them being disqualified by the academic, scientific, and evolutionary communities.

692
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:51,960
Yet they leave the image in place assuming that something else will come along to take its place.

693
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,300
So every few months you get a new variation of the descent of man.

694
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:56,900
.

695
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,120
.

696
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:28,140


697
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,480
.

698
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:28,760
.

699
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,380
.

700
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:39,400
.

701
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:39,420
.

702
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:39,440
.

703
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:39,860
.

704
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:39,860


705
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:39,860


706
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:39,900
.

707
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,280
.

708
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:40,300
.

709
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,420
.

710
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:41,420


711
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,500
.

712
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:54,520
.

713
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,060
.

714
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,060


715
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,060


716
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,060


717
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,060


718
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,060


719
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,080
.

720
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,080


721
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,080


722
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,080


723
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:05,700
stakes which get plowed under so that another attempt to travel toward perfection may be made.

724
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,340
Hey, we've done a whole hour of show.

725
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:18,580
Funny how that works out. But this, oh, there it is. I thought for a moment the slide show had failed us,

726
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:24,700
but now I'm looking at the pinboard daubs made of thousands of pins, or I was a moment ago.

727
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,060
There's a little sidebar here, I'll close with this.

728
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:35,340
The Creation Evidence Museum houses a replica of the Gutenberg Press and the Gutenberg Bible,

729
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,780
and is now in possession of the smallest Bible in the world.

730
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:47,580
The world's teeniest, tiniest Bible. You have to use an electron microscope to read the book of Genesis.

731
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,720
It's a hologram.

732
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,820
Even clapturms can read the Bible now.

733
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,480
Oh, it was sent to the museum.

734
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:54,680
Oh, it was sent to the museum.

735
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,400
It came in the mail embedded behind a postage stamp.

736
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,980
Local artist Robert Summers, who's my neighbor by the way,

737
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:11,420
had the privilege of being the person to cut and peel the stamp back to reveal the hologram Bible behind it.

738
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:19,720
The stamp was sealed with a little drop of human blood from the mortification of the flesh of the fabricator.

739
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,680
Ah, yes, and we're going to put that Creation Museum out of business

740
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,160
with our Destructionist Museum.

741
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,980
Yeah, that'll be a lot more entertaining.

742
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:35,640
I've got devil skeletons on our property in Texas, got alien skeletons, cave subgenius skeletons.

743
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,600
All vertebrates.

744
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:45,140
So, here are the signs that we're going to put along the highway leading to our new exhibit.

745
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,320
Let's hear it.

746
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,480
Signs for our roadside attractions.

747
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,920
See live snakes and giant man tracks.

748
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,980
Five dollars.

749
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,220
Fossil ghost footprints.

750
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:56,920
Next stop.

751
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,400
Five dollars.

752
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,420
Proof that Bigfoot mated with dinosaurs.

753
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,440
Bible truth.

754
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,200
Five dollars.

755
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,580
Devil and alien skeletons.

756
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:06,720
Next stop.

757
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,520
Five dollars.

758
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,080
Noah's Ark sank here.

759
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:10,980
Five dollars.

760
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,360
See living fossils killed.

761
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,520
Five dollars.

762
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,100
Turn back and see the thing.

763
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,060
Five dollars.

764
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,260
Bootleg corner.

765
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:22,900
Authentic.

766
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,660
Five dollars.

767
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,440
Blue liquor.

768
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,920
One dollar a swig.

769
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,920
Next to the port it can.

770
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,600
Or Philo added this one.

771
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,940
Run for your life nature walk on your way out.

772
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,840
One dollar extra.

773
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,440
And of course, man eating chicken.

774
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:40,780
Right.

775
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,240
Otherwise known as Heathen Hammer.

776
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,840
Whenever you're in Stange County, Texas, you can go to the Dinosaur State Park, Dinosaur World,

777
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:59,020
Creation Evidences Museum, and the subgenius destructionist museum.

778
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,160
Yes.

779
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,560
Stop in for the dehumanization chamber.

780
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,360
Yes, yes, yes.

781
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,720
Seats 112.

782
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,180
And with that, we end this Hour of Slack.

783
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:09,960
You've been listening.

784
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,200
That doesn't mean we have to get up and go.

785
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,660
No.

786
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,680
We'll tell you next about the curse of the winking lizard and other improbable allegories.

787
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,860
You've been listening to Hour of Slack number 1500.

788
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:29,060
And for more information, please feel free to visit subgenius.com.

789
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,040
Insert file number here.

790
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,900
Praise Bob.

791
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,540
Boop.

792
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,560
End of show.

793
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,560
Begin next show now.

794
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,120
Start projector on tool.

795
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:38,460
Oh, yes.

796
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:38,860
Dear friends.

797
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,220
Another Hour of Slack begins.

798
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,380
It may not go on for very long, but at least we've got a beginning of one.

799
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,380
One is during the past.

800
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,840
When men were men.

801
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:50,840


802
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:50,840


803
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:50,840


804
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:50,840


805
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:50,840


806
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:50,840


807
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:50,840


808
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:50,840


809
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,120
Many Anniversary characters

810
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,080
And otherещ

811
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,300
moments

812
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,580
And ice

813
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:12,960
that

814
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,280
presented

815
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,420
many

816
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,000
real

817
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,320
theory of changes in gene frequencies in populations.

818
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,080
That was actually a big change.

819
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,080
Genes, which are things you can count, they're digital, you can count them.

820
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,660
Some of them become more frequent in the population,

821
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,060
others become less frequent in the population.

822
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:39,680
So that was a major evolutionary step in the evolution of evolutionary theory.

823
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:46,720
There were other major steps in the 1960s, 70s,

824
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,300
where, yeah, that was not so important, but that was it.

825
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,760
And in parallel to that, from the 1950s onwards,

826
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:04,500
genetics became digital in the sense of the actual molecular structure of a gene.

827
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,660
The Watson and Crick gene is just a long, long gene.

828
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,080
It's a little string of computer tape.

829
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,660
And that has hugely changed the way we think about evolution.

830
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:22,460
We now think about, we can now actually compare any two animals you like,

831
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,140
or any two plants and animals you like,

832
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:30,560
and actually look at the digital sequence of code letters in their genes,

833
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,280
count the number of differences between them,

834
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:38,980
literally count them, and compute how closely related they are.

835
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,280
And even calculate how long ago their shared ancestor lived.

836
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,980
And that's a huge advance, a huge advance,

837
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,680
when molecular biology became digital.

838
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,980
I changed my mind about something called the handicap principle,

839
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:04,220
which is, um, mostly arose in sexual selection.

840
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,420
Darwin's other theory, sexual selection,

841
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,060
the peacock's tail theory,

842
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,980
the peacock has this gorgeous fan,

843
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:16,180
because the peahen, um, likes the look of it.

844
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,680
And there was a theory, there is a theory, called the handicap theory,

845
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,520
which suggests that the reason why,

846
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,900
not just peacock fans, but sexually selected characters,

847
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,860
are favored by females,

848
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,500
is that they are handicaps.

849
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,540
Everybody knew they were handicaps.

850
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,000
But the idea, the handicap principle idea,

851
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:47,740
was that the reason why a particular sexually selected character is favored,

852
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,060
is precisely that it's a handicap.

853
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,700
And in a way, the female is saying to herself,

854
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,220
this male has managed to survive,

855
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:59,500
in spite of carting around this ridiculous, um,

856
00:44:59,680 --> 00:44:59,860
um,

857
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:02,540
advertisement.

858
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,060
So he must be a pretty good male.

859
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:07,540
Yes.

860
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,980
Um, that's putting it very colloquially indeed,

861
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:16,160
and I was extremely and vocally skeptical of that

862
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,640
in the first edition of Selfish Gene, my first book.

863
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:24,380
And I was converted to accept a more mathematical version

864
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:29,560
of the handicap principle by, actually by a student of mine, Alan Graff,

865
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,040
um, who produced a most brilliant, um,

866
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,820
mathematical model to show that the handicap principle

867
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,680
can actually be made to work.

868
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,120
It originated from an Israeli zoologist called Zahavi,

869
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,540
who didn't do it mathematically.

870
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,600
And you happily changed your mind.

871
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:49,500
Yes, and so in the second edition, um, of the Selfish Gene,

872
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,940
I, I explained Graff and Smollett's handicap principle.

873
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,660
And as Mark Twain said,

874
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,640
I was dead for billions and billions of years,

875
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,640
before I was born,

876
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,440
and never suffered the smallest inconvenience.

877
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,820
Ha ha ha ha!

878
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,060
.

879
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:05,060


880
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,060
.

881
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,760
So, I'm gonna tell you one other thing about the mysteries of X-Day.

882
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,980
There are many strange creatures out there in the bushes.

883
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,520
Name one, name one.

884
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,700
Well, that's just the thing, they're strange.

885
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,180
The candiru toad.

886
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,120
The candiru toad, that's one of them.

887
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,860
That's the nastiest, just about.

888
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:27,600
Is awful.

889
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:33,040
But, um, they're part of that strange biological wealth

890
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,520
that only that little corner of the globe has,

891
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,240
in that strange wrinkle of the Earth's crust.

892
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,280
Is that one of the ones that crawls up the man's...

893
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:42,660
Yeah.

894
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,220
Yes.

895
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,260
Oh, it's a toad.

896
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,340
It's not a fish, it's a toad.

897
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,720
It's a toad, but the action is the same.

898
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,920
It actually crawls up in your guineas?

899
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,620
The toad itself does not, but...

900
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,440
It goes in your guinean.

901
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,840
It nests in the bladder of large mammals.

902
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,300
And lays its eggs.

903
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:02,940
Yeah, Stang has to go and have this taken care of at a medical institution pretty soon.

904
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,840
Yeah, I'm gonna be gone the week...

905
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:09,580
I may not be able to make it to the devotional because they have to remove the toad tadpoles.

906
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,860
But, on the other hand, it's an outpatient procedure, and after being in the hospital one day,

907
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,400
Stang may be able to attend the devotional,

908
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:24,160
at which point he'll whip down his trousers and have a most unpleasant surprise for the audience.

909
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,180
Well, I'm hoping they'll let me keep the tadpoles.

910
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,920
Why did you have to put it that way?

911
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:35,620
It's a large mass of jelly-like eggs attached to the nearest free-floating object.

912
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,160
Right, they have to go in there and scrape those things out.

913
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:39,620
The audience.

914
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,780
I did what you're not supposed to do.

915
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,400
I walked down the yellow trail and thought,

916
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,160
Well, I don't wanna go...

917
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:46,780
Well, I yell about...

918
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:51,240
Those chem toilets are so hot and stinky.

919
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,080
They leave chem trails in there.

920
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,140
It's not to...

921
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,680
Right, they cause autism.

922
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,320
I was gonna go down to the...

923
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,780
You know, just go out in nature.

924
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:03,200
But the problem is, nature will crawl up your urethra.

925
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,540
Nature's natural.

926
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,160
In certain conditions.

927
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,260
All those urethra Franklin records have their effect.

928
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,860
I would not listen to country music.

929
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,320
Well, it's your privilege as an American.

930
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,420
Not to listen to country music.

931
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,120
I don't know what kind of a NASCAR-hating, terrorist-loving American...

932
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:24,780
You are.

933
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,380
Yeah.

934
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,260
Yeah, buddy.

935
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,220
Love it or leave it.

936
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,280
She ain't a country music lover.

937
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,700
I even took her home to meet my mother.

938
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,600
But it broke my aching heart to discover...

939
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,420
That she weren't a country music lover.

940
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,480
Did you hear that a lot?

941
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:53,560
Did you know that most of the relatives of the Great Sphinx are not the...

942
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,420
Boy, I'll say.

943
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,600
Somebody open the window.

944
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Death metal, black metal.

945
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:00,820
Hmm.

946
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:05,100
What's part of the Great Trail is stretches all the way from Sandusky to Pittsburgh.

947
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:10,620
These trails loop back upon themselves and deposit you right back at Wisteria.

948
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,180
They don't lead away.

949
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,360
You can't get away from Wisteria.

950
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:14,600
No.

951
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,960
You can walk for hours thinking you're going west.

952
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,860
And really, you're suddenly...

953
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,140
Copper metal.

954
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:23,700
It's twilight, John.

955
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,100
There you are, right back at Caffeina's Cosmic Cafe.

956
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,660
Time for an iced coffee.

957
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,240
The new one today is plastic metal.

958
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,280
You know what else it's time for.

959
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:40,080
So this one, you might like some of the imagery.

960
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,400
It's called Chocolate, Wine, and Porn.

961
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:48,560
So maybe somebody might do somebody's favorite in one of these, one of those three.

962
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:48,960
I don't know.

963
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:50,980
I don't know.

964
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,060
I don't know.

965
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:51,080
I don't know.

966
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,560
I don't know.

967
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:08,400
I don't know for certain.

968
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,180
MyПрose intensity is human.

969
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:09,380


970
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:14,740
not all black and white, God.

971
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:20,000
I'mann Guy.

972
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,960
I think all of us are.

973
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,060
It's not just when I talk about

974
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:27,680
dark chocolate, red wine, grainy porn, still no silicone video, hairy, hot, and real.

975
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:32,860
My brain stops here. I want to know what you do by yourself and what with.

976
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,960
Times I've known you, there is love and doors that close on making love,

977
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,940
sudden, no warning, no formula to break barriers.

978
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:47,720
Still, I believe you, once mistress of these three classic pleasures,

979
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:54,120
exciting, still, and dulling nerve endings in your endorphin cocktail haze.

980
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,560
Lover, may you have remembered me.

981
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:03,500
I remember your backpack at the bus stop, what your intent eyes knew,

982
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,860
your sleeping beauty on post-collegiate futon,

983
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:11,320
how the three of us that one time barely fit in the shower.

984
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,120
Want to fast forward this stuck cassette, see what is now,

985
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:17,700
what is now, what is now.

986
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:17,700


987
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:24,620
unstuck passion together might come beyond memory, beyond numbing, beyond the endorphin rush of running.

988
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,740
Pour me a pinot. I'll bring the raw cacao.

989
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:17,700
I'll bring the raw cacao.

990
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:47,680
I'll bring the raw cacao.

991
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:50,620
I'll bring the raw cacao.

992
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,880
Can you hear this all right? All right.

993
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,820
On the Lindenwald train.

994
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:32,720
On the Lindenwald train to Philly, you keep approaching to interrupt an otherwise perfect spring fever.

995
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,160
Warm enough tonight to feel cute on South Street in jean and short black jacket,

996
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:44,060
and at the ease back home where Forsythia announced the inevitable end to cold.

997
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,620
On my way to meet the Pali people.

998
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,700
Same place we met.

999
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,900
Once at the inevitable start.

1000
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,060
This train best get going.

1001
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,260
Take me to my punk rock roots and motley crew of a mock up family.

1002
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:06,160
So I forget how once last fall I would have liked to catch you sleepy mojito in hand and me with knives in mind.

1003
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,440
Luck held out for both of us.

1004
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,340
Trees still bear.

1005
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:17,340
I long to lie naked in the neighborhood under natural cover, but I will not rush this season.

1006
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:26,520
It pushes me slowly along from last September when I lay trapped in a learning curve of drinking and dreaming your house demolition.

1007
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,120
Woodcrest station.

1008
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,980
A musty man stinking of BO and basement chatters questions.

1009
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,260
I am annoyed by my impulse to answer.

1010
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:45,300
Glad to break for the tumbling thoughts of broken intentions, secret darknesses that I have felt have left strange nutrients.

1011
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,260
I lap up new.

1012
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,280
Knowledge.

1013
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,520
Drops of blood to a ravenous bat.

1014
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,920
I turn my head to breathe.

1015
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,380
The box is open now.

1016
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,380
There will be more weapons forged with sparks of light.

1017
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,860
I rest relieved it is someplace else.

1018
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,660
Your poisonous script will run.

1019
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:09,600
My feet hit eighth and market smooth in the rhythm of my streets.

1020
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:17,580
That was the beautiful Reverend Andrew Genus live at X Day.

1021
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:17,700
Live at X Day.

1022
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:17,700


1023
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,240
18 X Day in fact.

1024
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,280
The guitar work in between the poems was by Reverend Jimmy Ryan.

1025
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:30,260
But now by time control, Reverend Andrew Genus joins us on Radio Synesthesia.

1026
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:37,360
Reverend Andrew, I'll call you tomorrow during the daytime.

1027
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:38,900
Okay.

1028
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,160
From my phone.

1029
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:43,480
Well, yes, there is that.

1030
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,560
I'm a house guest of Reverend Ivan Stang at the moment.

1031
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,160
Back in the Slacker Mansion.

1032
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:57,500
The one with the gorilla statue out in front that everyone in Cleveland is so familiar with.

1033
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,580
I would like to visit Slacker Mansion one of these days.

1034
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,980
Can we make that happen?

1035
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,320
Absolutely.

1036
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,700
We'd love to have you.

1037
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,420
We have a luxurious guest room and library.

1038
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:16,240
And yeah, just drive around Cleveland looking for the giant blue gorilla.

1039
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,600
Or call me first and ask the address.

1040
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,140
Yeah, he'll give you the address.

1041
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:21,680
It's easier.

1042
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,420
That's how people find us over in Cleveland Heights.

1043
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,280
The stalkers, they just look for the giant.

1044
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:33,660
You only have to drive up and down a few hundred residential streets and you'll see that giant blue gorilla.

1045
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,800
There's only one.

1046
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,080
I'll sing my harmonium.

1047
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,500
I'll sing some mantras.

1048
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,120
It's called the grape ape.

1049
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:45,480
Well, you'll have your harmonium with you and a zither maybe.

1050
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,980
Maybe a zither.

1051
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:52,720
Maybe a, I don't know, harmonium for sure.

1052
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,460
Maybe the washboard.

1053
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:57,340
Maybe I'll bring the mountain boys washboard.

1054
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,240
Okay.

1055
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,660
Yeah.

1056
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,200
Sounding better all the time.

1057
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,680
And the gorilla will be happy.

1058
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,280
That's a well-tuned washboard.

1059
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,100
Oh, oh.

1060
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:07,820
By the way.

1061
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:13,840
While we get things together, why don't I play one, it's about a three-minute collection

1062
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,540
of...

1063
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:20,220
They're all clips from Futurama that seem to be about X Day.

1064
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:21,260
Ah.

1065
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:21,960
Yeah.

1066
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:22,660
Let's do that.

1067
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,460
There's a couple of shows that just seem to be about X Day.

1068
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,520
Some shows play other stuff during the show.

1069
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,960
End of the world Futurama.

1070
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,340
Proud of yourself, Bev.

1071
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,660
You've turned this perfectly worthless loser into an addict.

1072
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,080
Cut me some slack, preacher.

1073
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:39,360
I'm just a coal grinder's daughter trying to stay off the pole.

1074
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:40,500
Let's see.

1075
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,320
I think it means...

1076
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:44,500
I think it means...

1077
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:44,500


1078
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:49,280
The sun will erupt, all shall perish, blah, blah, blah.

1079
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,360
Get to the point.

1080
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,240
What does it say about me, Bender?

1081
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:53,320
Nothing.

1082
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,060
But it does say a great cataclysm will destroy the world in the year 3012.

1083
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,200
The world?

1084
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,480
That's where I live.

1085
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,420
Told you it'd say something about me.

1086
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,340
So the world will end in 3012.

1087
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,360
Why does that year sound so familiar?

1088
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,740
Because that's the year that's this year.

1089
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:13,140
Is it just me, or is the world ending more often these days?

1090
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,480
The calendar pretty much says it all.

1091
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:19,240
The year it expires, earthquakes, shark-splosions, then it just ends.

1092
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,280
Exactly as the weather balloon foretold.

1093
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,740
It's starting.

1094
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,180
This is the end of the world.

1095
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:35,660
Some of us were crazy before it was cool.

1096
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,440
Evacuating the planet in three, two...

1097
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,800
So long, Earth. Thanks for nothing.

1098
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,160
Stop the end of the world sex!

1099
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,000
We might survive after all!

1100
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,480
I translated your warning that the world was doomed.

1101
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,960
Not your world. Our world.

1102
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,980
We put calendar there to warn you not to visit Mars.

1103
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,220
It's Mars that's gonna be destroyed.

1104
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,740
Why you think we're so eager to abandon this dump?

1105
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,200
My God!

1106
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,540
One of the hundreds of contradictory prophecies is coming true!

1107
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,460
It's just as I thought.

1108
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,940
I only now began to fear.

1109
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:19,540
The solar flares are igniting subsurface gas pockets!

1110
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:24,800
All in all, it's a fine day for an apocalypse.

1111
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:32,340
