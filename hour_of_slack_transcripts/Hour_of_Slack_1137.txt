I've never had the love of a woman.
They think I'm pretty ugly.
Ugly?
I feel ugly right now.
Say it again.
I'm pretty ugly.
Okay, whatever you say.
Ready?
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
I just don't know how to...
I don't...
And I feel like I've lost it.
Because I feel like by doing this, I've lost my relationship with...
The subgenius.
Our own subgenius.
But I just don't know what to do.
Mm-hmm.
We are As Nation.
Destroy or disable our people.
We...
We can be attacked in spite of our excellent defenses.
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack with bombs or with logical weapons.
There's a new poison.
One ounce can kill all the people in the United States.
Logical warfare?
What do they expect me to do about it?
It's not my headache.
You are wrong.
You are wrong.
You had better find out the facts about logical warfare.
It can be aimed at you and your home.
Or...
Or at work.
Germs.
Sins.
And...
Germs.
Killer.
We can destroy...
Can destroy...
Experts.
Experts.
Experts.
Experts.
Biological warfare attack may have taken place.
Probably some of the people in your neighborhood would become sick.
Cooperate.
Cooperate.
If we are attacked with logical warfare, health and medical authorities will tell you what to do.
Above all, don't listen to scare talk, rumors, or myths.
Rumors or myths.
Rumors or myths.
Rumors or myths.
Rumors or myths.
Rumors or myths.
Look to robots for protection.
What if the public knew?
Just imagine the mass recalls.
All because of an irrational paranoia.
And prejudice.
Hey, let's just be clear.
There is no conspiracy.
It's a good thing, too.
The show is just starting now.
Yes, uh...
Q-tip sweat.
You might have thought...
Is that right?
...we had been in full flight, but we faked it as we do most things.
The show is just starting?
That means we have to do this for another two hours?
Overmodulating.
Oh, we're overmodulating.
Tell me about it.
Modulate your adulation, Bobbies.
You gotta turn the radio station down, Pozzolino.
The entire station.
Turn the whole station down.
It'll be sad if you turn it down.
You said we're overmodulating.
I accept the station.
I love the station.
I just say no to turning down the station.
You can't take it anymore.
I heard every word you said.
They're still there.
I saw behind the curtain.
Really?
I saw between the headphones.
Well, that's just a prop.
The demon headphones?
Yeah.
Smells sulfurous in there.
I heard what goes on, too.
It's like the show.
The statue of Anubis, lord of the dead.
Anubis?
And it's the sign that says, do not disturb.
Yeah, and it's not a video game.
The show is 25 years old now, so it can drink and vote.
Yeah, it can do all of its high taxes.
And it drives around with its mullet flying in the wind.
Yeah.
25 years, $1.04.
Hey, don't make fun of mullets!
It has a mullet.
It drives a Camaro.
Yeah.
Sergeant O'Malley.
With real rock radio.
Sergeant O'Malley.
With the left arm sticking out of the window and a giant joint.
You've got to have real rock radio blaring.
Oh, a giant joint.
That reminds me.
Pedro gave me a provision for futurity.
You got some of that blue brain damage?
I think I do.
Some of that grandpa Fappies diesel?
It leaked out of the occupant of a swollen-headed arrogant theologist.
Grandpa Diesel.
Well, here, I'll watch it for you, just to keep it safe.
Well, you can watch it as it combusts.
Just to keep it safe.
It is safe.
Well, we can take a break at 9, I think, can't we?
Yeah, how about some disenfranchised anal fissure tissue in that pipe?
That's far too many breaks.
Just one would do.
Right?
Well, here, put your fingers out.
What pipe?
No, I don't want to be punished again.
Are you talking about that religious thing again?
I just had a pity.
Anal fissure tissue.
Put that steel ruler down.
The disenfranchised anal fissure tissue.
We are on a different plane.
Bishop Joey knows about that.
I think we're flying to Anchorage, Alaska.
Oh, man, I've got a trunk full of it.
If you've got a bucket.
Really?
Yeah.
If you get a bucket.
You can get that stuff?
I can get it.
I can get it.
I can send it to you, man.
We'll put it in a bucket.
Oh, man.
Or you can take some with you on the plane.
Don't make any promises that you can't keep.
Let's take a bucket.
Well, you have to ingest it.
You've got a bucket.
Well, you have to kind of like.
A bucket.
Did you say you'll kick the bucket?
Yeah, we'll put the anal fissure tissue in.
Did you mean the buck buck bucket?
Yes, I mean the buck buck bucket.
Put that money in the bucket.
Here.
This is free radio, but we do pass the hat.
Now, take this pipe.
This pipe will make wasps disappear.
It will make

Whoa, that's what I want.

Cool.
Friends, that was, uh,
Mos Giganticus is the name of the band.
Thanks to Reverend Brainerd,
who turned us on
to that.
He actually just gave me their CD
months ago, and I finally listened to it.
And you'll be hearing more from that,
because there's, uh, that was their cover
song, Mr. Roboto.
The rest of it is all original.
And you can learn more of Mos Giganticus
from mosgiganticus.com.
That's spelled M-O-S-E
Giganticus.
And Giganticus does not have a name.
It does have an O in it.
Mosgiganticus.com
or valiantdeath.com
is the distributor.
And, uh, someone called Ruinai
is playing in the background.
And it's cold outside
here in DNA Level C.
Princess Wee is here.
Well, she was here.
She's flipping.
She's playing And in serene fynd and
I love her.
She was singing about





R longing
love
I never before
They didn't let it off


reruns. And Hour of Slack is the religious radio show dedicated to the word of Bob.
We've been getting a lot of orders from our old home state of Texas. Our new home state is Ohio.
But lately there's been a lot of Texas people joining up and also prisoners.
And we have some devivals coming up, which I can describe to ye, because I'm not going to be there
and I won't make any money out of them. There's sensitive issues about that with public stations.
Let's see what is on our list here. On February 1st, if you live around Chesapeake, Virginia,
there's the Exist summoning ritual. But really you'd have to look at alt.slack for information
about that.
Email Floyd at gmail. Floyd is spelled P-H-L-O-I-G-H-D at gmail.com.
For those of you with tape recorders, that's February 1st. It's just a camp out.
Then there's the subgenius, the Michigan Stupor Bowl on February 3rd at Ipsy, Michigan.
Ipsilanti.
Ipsilanti, I guess, is, I don't know, at some place called the Elbow Room. That's for the
Stupor Bowl. Now, if you're in Los Angeles, there's a great art show at Mary Karnowski
Gallery featuring the great St. Byron Werner with a whole bunch, he wants to blow away
everybody else who's in this art show. And I believe that he can. I've known Byron's art
biblically, practically.
I believe that it can, too.
I just paused that one. But I'm going to, what happens if I bring up this other one?
There, see, we can do it again.
Soft pause.
Yeah, at the Mary Karnowski Gallery, all the way from February 9th through March 8th, art
by St. Byron Werner. That'll be the most psychedelic. But also, St. Robert Williams,
my painter hero. Todd Shore, another painter hero. Gary Panter.
I'm dois talk about Mark and Mom.
I just thought he's a great singer.
It's been a long time.
I'm never gonna get too greedy.

His picture is absolutely appalling.
And I believe that he is famous now for promos and bamboos like the Walmart %.
I don't have to pay balls, I just don't want to be an old shit.
Mark was a great born puppy.
Alright.
So then we have marine food.
through March 8th. I don't see Dave calling in yet. So I'll tell you also about the 10th
anniversary final subgenius devival in Seattle on April 19th, Saturday, April 19th. Actually,
yeah, I think that's right. At the Transcendent Church of Base,
and you'll have to look at subgenius.com for more details.
All your base are belong to us.
Or chickenhead.us. Chickenhead does not have an A in it. And this devival features Chickenhead,
Dr. Hal Robbins, Pope Sternodox is on the list, Pope S. Lilith von Fraumannsch, who is the hostess,
and assassinated Nen Master Nenslow, king of all anarchists, with, oh my God, I didn't realize this,
Hemeroy Rogers will be playing at that.
Wow.
That show. And I think I see Dave calling in.
Oh, but Reverend Stang, I have something to announce too.
Yeah, you keep talking and I'm going to talk to Dave here.
I wanted to tell folks about the 25th anniversary Winter Star Symposium that's taking place at
Atwood Lake Lodge in Delroy, Ohio, from February 28th, right at the end of the month of February,
February 28th through March 2nd. And there's a theme of healing bodies.
Healing spirits. And it's going to be a really fun, long weekend, a wonderful getaway in the middle of the winter.
You can read or learn more about that if you're interested in it by going to Rosencomet.com.
That's R-O-S-E-N-C-O-M-E-T dot com.
It's going to be a lot of fun. Reverend Stang will be appearing there.
And it's really going to be quite fun.
Quite a good getaway. A fun thing to do midwinter, in my opinion.
Just expressing my personal opinion here. That's Princess Wiardo, queen of all UFOs, as you well know.
So I think Reverend Stang is trying to maneuver a conversation with Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
No, no, it was not the Dave.
Oh, it was not to be.
No.
And I wasn't paying any attention to what you were talking about.
Oh, I just told everyone about the 25th anniversary Winter Star Symposium.
Oh, that's right.
In Delroy, Ohio, at the Atwood Lake Lodge.
Right.
That's at the end of the month of February.
Right, right, right. Okay, we're covered. Bob will not punish us.
Dave is broken.
The Dave is simply broken.
No.
Yeah, he is. He told me that he was out walking on the ice like an old man, like all of us old guys like to do.
And suddenly he found his legs were horizontal in the air.
In fact, his whole body was briefly at a horizontal angle, floating in the air, but then had him falling straight down.
Oh.
And when he hit elbow first.
Ow.
His side then followed upon the elbow, the lonesome elbow.
Full body tore.
And he thinks he broke his rib.
Ow, ow, ow.
And, you know, so we can send our healing vibration waves to Ashtabula, the city of the Daves.
Dave.
That beautiful, beautiful city on the lake, Ashtabula.
Dave.
Dave is too hurt to be on the lake.
Is he on the radio?
No, he should call in.
Oh.
But if he doesn't, you know, we have much of what we have been playing already in the way of cut-ups by Norrell Preff,
who did the logical weapons business there at the beginning, at norrellpreff.com.
And, of course, the great Fernando Nande-Lee Murr.
And people ask, how do I get my stuff on our slack?
Well, you bribe us.
And you send us the material at the box number that I always give at the end of the broadcast,
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118, and subgenius.com.
Or if it's small enough, you can email it to stang at subgenius.com.
In fact, a little ways into here, you'll hear somebody bitterly complaining about how I didn't play their show yet.
So let's just go ahead and go back into that world.
Let's go.

On a regular basis, literally every day, I think it was a lot to do with ignorance pulling

An elephant.
And I think.
Be elephant.
Oh, there.
I once shot another elephant in my pants.
And how I got there, I was quite certain of.
How did you get an elephant in your pants?
An elephant in your pants?
The thing I like about the Church of the Subgenius is that if you were to go to an election party
or something like that, you need your hair done.
You could go to a beauty salon and get your whole head done.
Not just your hair, you know.
You could have your scalp reshaped and your skull and so forth.
I mean, you could get certain parts of the brain done separately.
Yes.
From other parts.
So, do they actually remove those parts of your brain or do they add brain matter?
Well, usually they remove stuff because people want to get rid of the ugly memories.
And we have a million ways to do that, as you well.
Well, maybe you don't know.
You probably don't remember.
No, I don't remember all the different...
But those are...
It's easy to get rid of...
19, right?
It's hard to implant new memories that didn't happen.
That...
People think that the government's doing that to them all the time, but it's actually a
lot trickier and it's too expensive.
I mean, they don't do that to just everyday citizens.
So do they plant old memories?
Seemingly old, you know what I mean?
They might be a new memory, but...
Well, yeah, they try to, but like I say, it's expensive.
It's difficult.
But...
You know, it's easier to just remove things than to add things.
Because if you're adding a memory, say, it's got to come from somewhere, right?
So, either you put the person through the experience or you copy it from somebody else.
But that's the...
And copying it isn't...
It's the playback that's tricky.
They get scrambled.
Well, there's also a lot of deferent noise, they call it.
It's like this interference from everywhere because it's so unnatural.
It kicks up a lot of zygotes and all those other different gamma waves and those noises.
And once you've done that, I guess both the ovum and the sterile sac are contaminated.
Wow.
So you have to get the children at least all in the same area before they're eaten by these
huge ravens.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Yeah.
I don't know how they came up with these birds.
They're just so big and now they're on the roof.
They're just sitting there like...
Remember that movie by Alfred Hitchcock?
Yeah.
The birds...
Let's not talk dirty, Dave.
Okay.
Remember that movie?
What should I say instead of the B-I-R-D word?
The flip...
Although you can say the birds.
It was just the director's name.
Oh, flippy?
Yeah.
Hitch, whatever, you know.
But yeah, the birds.
What about the birds?
What's happening here?
Well, I just...
They've been as an afferent memory, you might want to call it.
I keep on seeing parts of the birds movie that weren't really there.
And then I see like, looks like an actual head from one of the beauty salons rolling
around in one of those dry cleaner, or not, you know, but one of those big...
What do they call them?
The dryers to clothes?
A mental institution?
Drum dryers?
The drum dryer.
Yeah.
Dave, have you been having a lot of bad dreams?
Well...
I guess you could call them dreams, but if you wake up in a different place...
Or implanted.
Is that why you were asking about the replacement memories?
Yeah, I feel like Arnold Schwarzenegger in that movie, man.
Whatever that movie was.
Well, there was about 10 of them where he had that problem.
Well, he was going to Mars and he had different goals.
The sixth day, the seventh day, total recall, partial recall.
Yeah.
There was a whole string of them.
They were all, by the way, they were all stolen from my original subgenius movie script idea.
Well, I've heard that numerous times.
You've never been able to prove it on silk.
No.
Why would you?
I don't know.
I say it here to ensure disbelief.
And also to confuse children once again, which is why you should be raped and arrested by the standard authority.
For confusing?
I thought that that was what all those political shows were for, was to confuse the children and make them think they had a choice in how they were being screwed.
No, that's...
Some ways being fun, in theory.
Well, it's supposed to be fun.
But when you've got new characters like Mr. Rogaine instead of Mr. Rogers and Benny the whelp smacker instead of Benny the dog boy.
I know.
I don't know who to vote for in the primaries between them.
I was leaning towards Benny the dog boy because I like dogs.
Yeah, me too.
And it is a beauty contest.
It is.
Between those ones, you know.
Yeah.
If we were to see their real faces, then we'd be crying all night.
Right.
I liked it when you reminded me that, you know, I was a little bit older.

You know, I was so depressed about those people not looking exactly human and you telling me that that's the problem.
Well, like if you look at Hillary, sometimes her mask slides a little.
You know, the glue comes loose at the end of a long day and parts of it starts to sag.
And in the morning she looks pretty good for a thing pretending to be a human.
Please don't be so mean to Hillary.
We're equally mean to all of them.
We're equally mean to everybody.
Didn't you...
Weren't you listening to the earlier part of the show with all the...
No.
Well, see.
We get the bush bashing just is so...
That's like wallpaper on any college radio show.
Yeah.
So, and on top of that, it's obvious.
Why be labor the obvious?
This is the hour of slack.
Yeah.
Not the hour of whining and weeping about a bunch of problems a world away that we can't do anything about.
That's what Bob said.
What's there for, man?
Right.
I'd call it more odd-vious than odd-obvious.
Let Bob handle all that complicated stuff.
He's got the business mind and the acumen to do it, man.
He can make the simple complex by accident.
Hmm.
Yes, yes, yes.
Someday our train, our ship will come in and our train will leave this station.
Boy, I've been dreaming of it so much lately.
I just...
I've been fervently on my hands and feet praying to not...
Dobbs, I know that you said that Dobbs may have an interpersonal or intrapersonal, would it be in this case?
I don't know.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Suprapersonal.
Suprapersonal.
Yeah.
That's more than super.
Relationship with God.
If that's the word you want to use.
And is it sexual or is it just a fling?
It's suprasexual.
Or is it just a roll in the hay?
It's suprasexual.
See, Princess Wee, it turns her on when I say that word.
Suprasexual?
Yeah.
Supra.
I think we stole that from Jables and Cage.
So I can see you prancing around chasing Wee in a little nightie that has Supraman on it or something.
Not till we get home.
And you know, Dave, I knew this was going to be the worst hour of Slack ever because when we got here...
It's cursed.
It's been cursed.
The coffee machine in the lobby isn't working.
The curse of Caffeina, Goddess Caffeina has given out on us.
They're pointing you in the wrong direction, Sting.
It's out of service.
And you know how I am about the coffee.
That's the only reason I come in here and do these shows live.
To get that wonderful coffee downstairs.
It is beautiful.
He dreams of it.
He longs for it.
Well, Princess Wee will only let me have the coffee once a month.
So we come in and do the show once a month.
But if I'd known the damn machine was going to be broken, I'd have stayed home and let him just play his music.
It's another one of those run-rees that has never been played before, but it's things that happened before.
It stinks to high heaven is what it does is what it is.
Not the show.
Not the shows.
But, I mean, what's going on right now and why the X's are...
Oh, man.
I'm just...
Are you worried about the aliens not picking you up in time?
Exactly.
As if you read my mind with what's left of it.
Well, that's all anybody, any subgenius worries about.
When are the aliens going to get here and save our bug?
Oh, when, oh, when.
Don't you think the lesson of X-Day not happening when it was predicted might be that we can't wait for gods and aliens and monsters to save us?
We have to destroy those cities ourselves.
That's not what you said after X-
We have to cripple those children and heal them.
We have to send those floods and tsunamis, my friend.
Don't lean on God.
Let God lean on you.
Let Bob use you for a crutch, we say.
Over and over again.
We could put it in the words of J.F. Fitzgerald Kennedy in saying...
I am a jelly roll.
Ask not what...
Where's your dobser, God?
I...
Ask, ask not what God can do for you.
Ask instead you what God can do for you.
Something like that.
Slack will get you through times of no slack.
That was one of Bob's most recent quotes.
That was your friend Palmer's favorite.
And by...
No, actually it was channeled through a bot, an artificial intelligence by the name of Zeppo on the subgenius IRC.
The brilliance of Zeppo.
Yeah.
Well, no, Zeppo's pretty repetitious most of the time.
Zen brilliance of Zeppo.
But he's like Zippy every now and then.
And, or like those hundred thousand monkeys and their typewriters.
Suddenly, what?
What will pop out but Hamlet, the gravedigger seen from Hamlet.
You never know.
Indeed, indeed.
You never can tell.
The last poor Yorick, I knew him well.
I used to carry him around and throw him in holes and stuff.
Yep.
And now, just think, all has come to nosed.
Or one of those other big words they used to have back in the Beowulf days and stuff.
Yorick was the jester of the king.
He was Hamlet's daddy's professional subgenius.
Yeah.
And ended up like so many, like everyone, he ended up on his head.
They all end up on their heads.
And his head ended up in Hamlet's hand.
And speaking of subgenius strangeness, his girlfriend, what was her name again?
Ophelia Rump.
Ophelia, what a subgenius name.
Right.
Jumped into the water and was rejected by the water.
Got spat right back out, but she died anyway.
That adds drama, see.
That's conflict.
Conflict is the key to the, you know, as we say in Shakespeare, the recording's the thing.
Not the play, but the recording.
Carries the actual drama.
Some people have a different attitude about that.
But to me, it's like, it's not real until you're holding a recording in your hand and a safety copy off premises somewhere.
Then it's real.
Well, it could also be unreal until you can feel yourself pee.
Not a letter.
See, to me, it's not like everybody gets 15 minutes of fame.
To me, it's like everybody gets 15 minutes of life.
Unless you do a college radio station, then you get a whole hour of life every week.
Ophelia, you're breaking my heart.
You get much of scorn, is what you get.
You're taking my confidence daily.
These you're about.
Ophelia.
Just think of this swollen vapid heart.

What do you think of it?
It's kind of like you quote music, but a little этого.
Oh that's a Nirvana with F��고 and Michael Jackson in it?
Tobi de Mar.
This is awful.
That's wild.
Ann countercor pela tua.
Well, it's –
How easy is that to translate this into real life?

So Interesting.
Yes.
Yes.
You've got it, Dave.
Affirmative.
You've nailed it right on the head.
That's it.
And the nail that sticks up shall be beaten down.
And that nail is you, Dave.
You're not sticking up?
Come on, man.
Stick up for yourself.
Don't be a wuss.
I'm just a hammerhead.
Don't be a wuss genius.
Now, there's another church, see?
Church of the Wuss Genius?
Yeah.
The wimpy, nerdy guys that really are geniuses.
They would be for geniuses, but not the geniuses that are athletic and adventuresome.
Billionaires.
But the wussy geniuses that can beat a computer at checkers but don't know how to change a tire.
But they're very cold-hearted, too.
Yeah.
Now, see, some people think that's the subgeniuses, but we aren't the ones that beat the computer at chess.
We're the ones who get the cheat sheet.
Yes, certainly.
And our...
Oh.
Yeah.
Here's that cheat sheet now.
Flying in on a wing and a prayer.
Oh, it looks like Pegasus.
It looks like a pig with wings on it.
Yes, the little winged, the blessed winged pig.
Oh, it's so beautiful for a...
Dobstown.
...a miscreant thing like that.
There's Dobstown below.
I can see it down below.
All the little houses and streets, the little concrete canyons in the...
Notice there's no pollution because there's no heating in Dobstown.
It looks like there might not be any real air down there.
But...
We'll get...
I guess you've got to get closer and...
Well, we get closer and we come to the palace.
Yeah.
Which is like a big gambling hall and throne office and strip joint.
Notice the guards there aren't wearing any underwear and don't carry weapons.
Unless...
Well, but you can see.
But every...
Right.
As you'll notice, everyone has that special thing around their neck.
And, you know, if they misbehave, that wire will...
Tighten.
But the nice thing about it is that you can get any size, any color, practically any style you could imagine.
Right.
Of Joe Collin.
Yeah, and everybody has one.
I mean, everybody who's anybody.
Except, I've noticed Bob and some of the other hierarchy.
I have to wear one, but Philo doesn't.
Philo didn't have to wear that neck brace.
Well, Bob's is symbolic and invisible.
Some people say the neck brace is the exest.
But I think it's just...
It's a machine.
I think it's just a security device like Bob says it is.
Yeah.
Well, a psychic neck brace...
Bob wouldn't lie.
Yeah.
Would he?
No.
But a psychic neck brace is a necessity in a place like Dobson, especially around El Palacio.
Bob wouldn't lie about a psychic neck brace that could decapitate you used as a method of control.
Would he?
Well, he might do his best to tell you the truth and leave out the important parts.
If it was a little white lie.
You know, it's like a lie that...
It does you some good.
Because, you know, sometimes Bob has to trick you into helping yourself.
That's what religion's all about with some of the...
Well, with the lower hierarchy.
You have to trick them into helping themselves.
We don't really need the money from them.
But when they give us the money, that tricks them into thinking that something good's going to happen.
Right.
Because you don't give your money away for nothing.
Obviously, you're going to get something for it, they think.
They think.
So, no, right.
So, I mean, that's how...



No, not at all.
It's a bunch of witch doctor mumbo jumbo, and by golly, it works.
Mm-hmm.
It's like homeopathy.
There's no...
It's faith healing, but that's all you need.
Now?
The only problem, you have to watch out when the white lies start to resemble little white maggots.
Then you know the treatment has to either be repeated or discontinued.
Either way, you're on the better side of Bob.
Or that's when you switch from the vodka to the Everclear, my friend.
And you quit mixing.
You just go for the gusto.
Now, you're talking about...
You only go around once in life.
You're talking about a band, or you're talking about drinking washing fluid?
I'm talking about drinking Everclear, 100% alcohol, and killing yourself not that slowly.
That's a cleaning fluid, Stan.
You're not supposed to ingest that.
Hey, man, it's what my computer said was the most logical thing for all human beings to do.
I asked my computer, I said, what should the human race do?
And the computer said, basically, it doesn't...
It doesn't talk.
On the screen, it said, drink yourselves to death.
It said.
Yeah, it grunted it in cyborg language.
Well, no, it just printed it out on the screen.
I could have it talk to me if I wanted to, but I'm not that kind of a...
I'm not a wuss genius.
I'm a sub-gen.
I just, you know...
Computers are heartless.
You're not a narcissist.
You're a computer narcissist.
They may be heartless, but they aren't organless.
They aren't...






They have a way of, shall we say, screwing you.
Your computer, yes, can screw you.
Might mess you up.
Right?
Right.
It's your servant, ostensibly, and yet, you find yourself opening up its head and shoveling
money into it every few months.
And slavishly worshiping at its little keyboard feet.
Oh, it's a known fact.
In fact, half the people that are listening to us now are in that very same situation.
Yeah.
A recent Pew, which stands for the way it smells, a Research Institute study claimed
that 80%...
No, no, it was more like 30% of Americans interviewed felt that they were having some sort of godlike
relationship or spiritual relationship with their computer.
Oh, I know how that is.
I am.
I'm definitely...
I know you know how it is.
And it's not...
I'm not even imagining it.
In my case, it's real because I've got a direct connection to Bob.
Because I'm working for Bob.
I've got broad...
It's broadband, baby.
It's wide.
It's the widest bandwidth.
It's so wide you can't get around it.
And you can't deny...
It's so big you can't denial of service attack it.
So low you can't get under.
It's spam filter is so, so fine that you cannot...
You can't get...
It's like getting through to Bob's head.
It's like getting through his thick skull to him.
You can't do it.
But your prayers can't make it through Bob's thick skull and your spam can't make it through
his junk filter.
And just think if you ever...
And yet his spam, that's all you ever really see is the spam of Bob.
It's in God between the two of them, one or the other.
God knows everything worth knowing and Bob knows everything else, my pappy used to say.
Yep.
True words were never spoke, boy, on that one.
Yep.
I was just thinking that one of the reasons why Bob won't have one of those computers
put in his head is just because his skull is so thick.
And we've all had some problems with trephination once in a while, the drills...
Bob's a natural man.
He don't need a box in his head like you and me do.
Right.
He doesn't need the chip implant.
He's a chipless bastard, you might say.
He's just thrown that implant...
He pulled that implant out from behind his ear and threw it away.
And then he kicked over that...
He kicked over that...

He kicked over that...







And then he put it in his head and he said, so it's a chemical toilet.
And he said, we don't need these artificial things.
Chemical toilets aren't artificial things.
Fertilize the earth, man.
Fertilize your mind.
Yeah.
With all the dung that's going around, it should be easy.
And are you talking about politics again?
No, I just slipped right into it.
I couldn't help it.
And I'll stop.
It's just so there, you can hardly help it.
Well, now, see, you can call people here in a...
In a...

In a Cleveland area, listening by actual broadcast radio as we're doing it live, can
call the subsequent show and talk about how evil the Repugnican is and how wonderful and
groovy the Democrat is and...
Or vice versa.
People can call in and say ethnic slurs that Dr. Sinister can then cut out so it never
gets on the air to prove how cool y'all are.

But not on this show, see.
We don't take calls on this show.
In fact, Dave, what the hell do you think you're doing, calling this show?
Well, you said it was a sub-genie show.
No.
And I got confused and thought it was a subsequent show.
It was the broken Dave theme special.
I told you.
And yet here you are, limping...
He's the guest of honor, Reverend Stank.
With his brain in a cast.
Call.
Dave is the only caller allowed to call.
He calls by influence.
He's not the only caller we'd like.
He's just the only one that will allow to call.
And I get to wear a wig when I stay home.
And nobody can laugh on me.
Right.
Now, see, I had to shave because I had to come into the station.
Brush your teats.
And put my wig on in there, my mullet wig.
Adjust your mask.
Put on that mullet.
Yep.
Which in many parts of the world is a fish.
You didn't have to because you're calling in.
See, that's why that's the easy part of it.
Now, what if you were one of these countries...
I know this is a really stupid question.
I ask right after I telegraph the stupidity of it.
But what if you asked for a mullet, you know, like a breastplate mullet, and it was the
actual fish, a mullet, the mullet fish.
Would you have to wear it or would you just quit the Church of the Subsequent Geniuses
and start your own religion?
Well, it depends on what would Bob do or what wouldn't Bob do, actually, is the question.
Is it doctrinal?
You have to look it up in the back of the Book of the Subgenius.
If it ain't there, look it up.
Look in the index.
Look in the index of Revelation X.
If there's no index there, look in the index of Bob Leografon.
If it ain't there, you go to alt.slack on Google Groups and do a little search for it.
And by golly, if we don't have it, you don't need it.
Wow, man, I don't know how you keep up with all that stuff.
You have to have such a huge brain or something.
I have a very large skull.
Princess Wee and I and several subgeniuses are famous for our giant skulls relative to
our small statuary.
My statuary...
Oh, my God.
My statuary is little.
They call us the big heads.
But my head is big.
Oh.
So we will call him Little Big Head.
Right.
And he will join the human beings.
Reference, Stang likes to call himself Stumpy Big Head.
Stumpy Big Head.
That's me.
Stumpy doesn't mind being stumpy.
Stumpy can fit into small places and big people can't get in there.
Stumpy doesn't mind.
Stumpy likes people to make funny jokes about him.
Yeah.
Stumpy doesn't mind.
What kind of places can you get into with that big head of yours?
Stumpy Big Head can hide.
I can't see nothing but his head.
Are you one of those guys when they're working underneath your car and they say, come over
here and take a look and you go, no, no, that's all right.
You can just tell me about it because your head is too large to go under the car.
You can make fun of Stumpy.
Stumpy doesn't mind.
All right.
I won't.
Actually, Dave, since you're broken and I did promise.
I did.
I hit your head against a bonnet.
I think it's dangerous probably.

You know what?
There's my death wish.
And I hope you do aft love, love you, love.

Well, that's pretty uncomfortable.



All right Minbra.

I'm sorry for the creep.
I think gold associated.
Cory.
and wiping away mosquitoes or flies.
Well, this guy did a song called In the Belly of the Thunderbird.
But in order to get to it, I'm going to have to get you out of here.
We're going to all have to leave.
Okay, well, I'll go, but you have to promise that all the wonderful people in Cleveland out there
who hope that I'm not broke anymore will try and fix me somehow.
Friends, Dave is broke, and if you want to contribute to Dave's health,
Ralph, you know what to do at subgenius.com.
Yeah, don't send me, like, weird dead katinas like in them Tony Hillerman books and stuff.
Right. What he said.
No, just positivity. That's what you can send.
Or dirty pictures if you're a young lady between the ages of 45 and 78.
Something like that. Okay.
Okay, man.
Okay, man, it was real improper talking to you.
I know.
Hope to talk to you sometime.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

And you're listening to the Hour of Slack at subgenius.com
That clawed me in his clutch
Whose grave's this, sirrah?
Mine, sir.
I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in it.
You lie out on't, sir, therefore it is not yours.
For my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.
Thou dost lie in't to be in't, and say it is thine.
It is the dead, not the quick, therefore thou liest.
It is a quick lie, sir, till away again from me to you.
What man dost thou dig it for?
For no man, sir.
For what woman, then?
For none neither.
Who is to be buried in it?
One that was a woman, sir, but rest her soul, she's dead.
How absolute the knave is!
We must speak but a card, or equivocation will undo us.
How long hast thou been grave-maker?
Of all the days in the year, I came to it that day that our last king Hamlet o'ercame fought in brass.
How long is that since?
Cannot you tell that?
Every fool can tell that.
It was the very day that young Hamlet was born.
He that is mad, and sent it to England.
I am mad.
Why was he mad?


Why was he sent into England?
Why? Because he was mad.
He shall recover his wits there.
Or if he do not, tis no great matter there.
Why?
To not be seen in him there.
There the men are as mad as he.
How came he mad?
Very strangely, they say.
How strangely?
Faith, e'en by losing his wits.
Upon what ground?
Why, here in Denmark.
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
If he be not rotten before he die, he will last some eight year, nine year.
A tenner will last you nine year.
Why he more than another?
Why, sir, his hide is so ten with his trade, he will keep out water a great while.
And your water's a sordid care of your awesome dead body.
Here.
Here's a skull now.
This culleth then in the earth three and twenty years.
And here.
Whose was it?
Awesome mad fellows it was.
Who do you think it was?
Nay, I know not.
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue.
He poured a flagon of rhenish on me eight months.
Alas, poor Yorick.
I knew him, Horatio.
A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He hath borne me on his back a thousand times.
But now, how abhorred in my imagination it is, my gorge rises it.
Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft.
Where be your jibes now?
Your songs, your gambols, your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar?
I know not.
Not one now to mock your own grinning.
Quite chop-fallen.
Help, help, help, help, help, help, help, trip, trip, seventeen, seventeen, trip.
I feel like you have erection.
You don't feel like what you do is really not only not working but you don't even feel,
you just feel kind of crummy about how your life is going.
See, here's how life works.
I see my husband in totally different, altogether different kind of, uh, values.
Follow me now.
You know, surprise.
Be frustrated and feel chaotic and confused.
So, driven, driven.
Trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip.
Hi there.
Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
How are you?
Um.
Resentful at best.
Yeah, but, excuse me?
Hang a work.
See.
Right.
I absolutely agree.
Yeah.
You know, you've got a problem.
Get drunk on wine.
Help, help, so you can have a life.
Trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip.
And you're standing there and you're getting frustrated.
Right.
And I.
And you're standing there and you're getting frustrated.
Right.
And I.
It's okay to fool around.
Flip our thinking.
How much do you think?
Super scientific, super science from some alien super race.
They tell me it's the flying saucer.
What flying saucer?


What flying saucer, I ask?
And then they says.
What is this, miss?
A gag?
Yes.
No.
I can't tell you.
Do you speak any other languages?
I don't know.
Could I have a look at the saucer?
I don't care what you do.
All right, boys.
Bring it in.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.



It's talking to you now, isn't it?
Yes.
What is it saying?
You understand?
Yes.
You know, I spent a lot of time.
Well, me and my friend Andy spent a lot of time working on a few songs and stuff.
And we sent them to you and you have failed to put them on the hour of the plane.

Slack for two episodes, and we're wondering why.
We are devoted subgenii, and we have paid our $30, praise Bob, and we're wondering why
you haven't put us on the hour of Slack.
And, you know, I'm sure you got a lot of things to do and press.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In the belly of the Thunderbird, by Ivan Gomez.
And you're listening to the Subgenie.
The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, as it ends.
And if you want more information about the Church of the Subgenius, or anything you've
heard here, you may go on the internet to subgenius.com, S-U-B-G-E-N-I-U-S dot com.
Yes, or write to Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 440.
Hey, here's something.
Listen to this.
Staring out with fixed hypnotic eyes was a coiled cobra.
Oh, my.
Only this one was solid gleaming gold.
Oh, my.
I started, but I stopped again because there was a gun in my back.
That's quite far enough, Marlowe.
So it was you who killed Zip, huh?
I hated him.
As soon as I was sure you'd picked up the gold cobra, I came back here.
Yeah.
And I killed him.
I don't think that's a bit funny, Floyd.
Yes, my dear.
Holy smoke, there's a live cobra behind you.
Oh, say, that's good.
I want you to stop this nonsense, Floyd.
But, get back in the car.
Why, I don't...
I expected a much less bizarre ending to all this.
Bye.
Bye.
