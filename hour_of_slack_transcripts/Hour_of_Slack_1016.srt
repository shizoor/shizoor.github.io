1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,580
From PR News in Washington, I'm completing the removal of propaganda signs on both sides of deprived Florida.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:14,080
The American Bar Association has passed a resolution supporting less money for college than ever before in 2003.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,440
PR is bad.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:22,720
North and South Korea successfully tested a hotline today aimed at helping to avoid PR News in Washington.

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,380
Attention, men.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,220
Attention.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,220
The following new men report to the dispensary for shots.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,020
I like to laugh, do you?

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,240
Well, here, see if you think this is funny.

10
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,660
The Self-Genius.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,240
Power of Swag.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,480
It ain't safe having a crackpot giving orders.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,900
About time somebody took over.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,660
Who, for instance?

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,120
A very good friend of mine.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,760
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow.

17
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,820
Go on!

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,720
Two million!

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,220
A bastard, cowards!

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,720
We don't want to live anyway.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,740
Not in a stinking water like this.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,440
Oh?

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,820
And what's so stinking about it?

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,560
It's a stinking water because there's no law norther anymore.

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,760
It's a stinking water because it lets the young get onto the old.

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,880
Oh, it's no water for an old man any longer.

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,520
What sort of a water is it at?

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,180
Oh, man on the moon.

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,000
And men spinning around the earth.

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,140
And there's not no attention paid to earthly law norther no more.

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,660
Oh, dear God.

32
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,380
Oh, it's all for the eye.

33
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,260
In the U.S. today, one of every ten high school seniors uses marijuana daily.

34
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,780
Thirty-five percent of all...

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,880
...disabled use drugs at least once a month.

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,680
It isn't all the real legit, illegitimate market that's the problem.

37
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,580
We have a panacea in America that is a place to solve every problem.

38
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,800
No drugs.

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,900
Now there's help.

40
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,820
Introducing the Drugs Program.

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,880
You may be eligible for drugs regardless of age or income.

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,680
It costs to join.

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,120
From PR news in Washington, I'm worried about PR news.

44
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,980
President Bush is plotting...

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,360
...to blow up a mosque and a congressman's office.

46
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,960
The White House says 45 elderly disabled people caught fire.

47
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,760
The Dow Jones is down 10-3-6-4-3-12-11.

48
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:47,960
Germany's conservative environmentalist Green Christian Social Democrat Party ended coalition talks today with the conservatives of PR News Washington.

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,660
By the way, just want to let you know, corrupt.

50
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,740
Corruptions.

51
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,140
The African American voters.

52
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,900
Free societies do not export terror.

53
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,080
Free governments respect the aspirations of their citizens and serve their hopes for a better life.

54
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,180
Free nations are peaceful nations.

55
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,280
And free nations in the heart of the Middle East will show what is possible.

56
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,940
To others who want to live in a free society.

57
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,900
It's a small world after all.

58
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,520
We are the world after all.

59
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,740
We are the world after all.

60
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,000
We are the world after all.

61
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,340
We ever never do.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,640
We ever never do.

63
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:53,720
We ever never do.

64
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,220
We ever never do.

65
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,940
We ever never do.

66
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,460
We ever never do.

67
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:15,900
We never would do.

68
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:15,900


69
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,400
It is time.

70
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,180
It is time.

71
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,780
Now we will view our puedannh nights in 100 detainees podcasts cima.

72
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:21,980
We use social media movements to MASIX the president.

73
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,120
And believe us all!

74
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,120


75
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,900
Young people should be like this

76
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:22,900


77
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:22,900


78
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,560
all

79
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,220
All by yourself.

80
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
A chance to relax.

81
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,420
Touch yourself.

82
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,740
A chance to think.

83
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,360
And enjoy things that don't cost a cent.

84
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,140
It's a nice idea.

85
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:22,620
It's a nice idea.

86
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,600
For the final proof.

87
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,760
The smoking gun.

88
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,120
That could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.

89
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,580
We will continue to hunt down the enemy.

90
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,400
Before he can strike.

91
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,580
We will continue to hunt down the enemy.

92
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,380
Before he can strike.

93
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,580
We will continue to hunt down the enemy.

94
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,480
Before he can strike.

95
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,820
Before he can strike.

96
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,260
Before he can strike.

97
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,480
Before he can strike.

98
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,860
Ouch.

99
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,920
It's not funny.

100
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,020
It's not funny, you guys.

101
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,600
It's as funny as it needs to be.

102
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,720
There's nothing funny about that.

103
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,180
Unfortunately, there's nothing funny about anything right now.

104
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:35,080
Friends, that last little collage there was by the great Joe.

105
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,980
He calls himself Joe this year.

106
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,260
I think he's really at him in a fun way.

107
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:47,120
But, friends, this hour of Slack number 1016.

108
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,200
Besides all that great collage by Norel Preff.

109
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,720
And the great...

110
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,920
And the great Fernanda Nandeli-Murr.

111
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,660
Friends, we have a live show because we have a live guest.

112
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,720
A special guest.

113
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,240
Yes.

114
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,040
A celebrity guest.

115
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,800
The man who invented the revolution itself.

116
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,500
Saint Paul Krasner.

117
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,440
Is here in the studio with Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

118
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,300
Unfortunately, he is manacled tonight because he had a previous engagement with the authorities.

119
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,820
He tried to bust loose, so to speak, and bit an officer.

120
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:37,500
Well, Saint Krasner is in Cleveland to do a fundraiser for the good people of Universal Health Care Action Network.

121
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,260
In fact, Tuesday night he'll be doing an evening of comedy.

122
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:50,180
And we've been seeing Paul Krasnerian comedy all afternoon, actually, because he's been doing book signings and so forth.

123
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,980
And he has a new book out.

124
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,200
One Hand Jerking.

125
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:06,620
And it says here that Paul Krasner is the only person in the world ever to win awards from both Playboy for satire and the Feminist Party Media Workshop for journalism.

126
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,420
And he's been inducted into the Counterculture Hall of Fame at the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam, which makes me really jealous.

127
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,980
And we got the Upton Sinclair Award from ACLU for dedication of freedom of expression.

128
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,960
And the FBI considers him a raving ungrateful.

129
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:21,960


130
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,160
And he's a very unconfined nut.

131
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,200
And welcome to the Hour of Slack, Saint Paul.

132
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,460
Thank you, oh, intelligent designer.

133
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,080
You know, I think there's been a kind of an argument going on in the Intelligent Design Committee.

134
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,720
What argument in the committee?

135
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,600
Well, I don't know, but obviously they haven't.

136
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,000
Well, there is bickering over each one has their own concept.

137
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,000
Well, there are those who think there's an intelligent designer, but there's no warranty.

138
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,180
Well, I had various questions that the subgeniuses.

139
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,200
Wait, there's one more plug.

140
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,880
Oh.

141
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:08,900
For the Disneyland Memorial Orgy, which was done by Mad Magazine artist Wally Wood in 1967, which I published as a poster.

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,400
And it's available again.

143
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,960
The original was in black and white.

144
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,140
Now it's been digitally colored by a former employee of Disney.

145
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:21,700
And that can be gotten via my website, paulkrasner.com.

146
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,200
With two S's, paulkrasner.com.

147
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,320
Oh, and that's a K on the Krasner.

148
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,180
It's not the way you would expect it to be spelled after you've listened to it and talked to it.

149
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,760
More Krasner than thou.

150
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:42,960
Now, these things featured therein are not of the ilk from before of the old realist where Mickey and Minnie are having.

151
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,760
That's it.

152
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,800
No, no, it's Minnie and Goofy.

153
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,080
Minnie and Goofy.

154
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,280
On a cash register.

155
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,760
That's an ill prescription.

156
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,680
Oh.

157
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:51,860
I mean.

158
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,840
And Cinderella is being investigated by the prince over in one corner.

159
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,880
I thought she was being crowned as from the dairy.

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,580
There's bestiality in that.

161
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,960
Well, Goofy is.

162
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,340
Well, no.

163
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,860
If it's between two beasts, is it then considered bestiality?

164
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,460
That's right.

165
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,560
A centaur and a pan.

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,960
Well, a centaur could commit bestiality upon himself.

167
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,700
Yeah.

168
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,160
Or anything present.

169
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,560
No, that.

170
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,940
If he applied himself.

171
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,280
Boy, this is getting me hot, friends.

172
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,000
And if you take a look at that poster we're talking about.

173
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:32,520
Old hippies will remember this poster from head shops and old perverts will remember it from porno shops.

174
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,160
That's where I first saw it.

175
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,620
And they might be the same person.

176
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,540
Yeah, it's great.

177
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,140
And you can get a free copy off of the paulkrassner.com website.

178
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, well, that's the small one.

179
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:50,500
Paul Krassner has been everywhere and done everything cool and knows everybody cool.

180
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,320
Especially all the cool dead guys.

181
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,360
Yeah, I'm the last of the Mohicans.

182
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,940
I was thinking who else is there left?

183
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,720
I mean, you knew Lenny Bruce, Ken Kesey, Abbie Hoffman.

184
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,080
I mean, just a tiny handful.

185
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,360
It's the Krassner curse.

186
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,220
You better watch out.

187
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,440
Oh, yeah.

188
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:10,860
The great.

189
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,660
The reverend.

190
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,780
To know him is to.

191
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,020
And Alfred E. Newman.

192
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,640
That was the one that impressed me the most.

193
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,440
As I understand it, you lost your cherry to Alfred E. Newman at the Mad Magazine offices.

194
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:24,880
No, not to him.

195
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,980
With him?

196
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,800
My girlfriend and I, I was still living with my parents.

197
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,400
And, but I was friends with, and so I had no place to take a girl.

198
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,400
I mean, I asked my mother if I was, I wanted to rent an apartment.

199
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,460
And she said, why?

200
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,340
I said, well, I have no place to be alone with a girl.

201
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,700
She said, well, dad and I will step into the other room.

202
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,820
And I said, no, I mean really alone.

203
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,440
And she rushed and took a shower.

204
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,620
So, boo.

205
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,880
And Bill Gaines, who published Mad, was a friend of mine.

206
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,900
And he gave me the key to his office.

207
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:03,620
And so, I lost my virginity on the carpet of the office where all of these, you know,

208
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,900
the old crypt, the witch, all of these.

209
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,320
The vault of horror.

210
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:09,660
All of them.

211
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,080
Where the EC Comics had been dreamed at.

212
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,700
All of them.

213
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,820
And there was Alfred E. Newman on the wall, beautifully framed, looking over us.

214
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,600
And as I was reading, I was like, oh, my God.

215
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,540
It's aPlus.

216
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,300
You certainly understand that.

217
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,300
Well, I had that girl in my mind, like my mom, who that was going to make a整.

218
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,520
And I did not want her to make a tushy comment you know, considering her gender and her age,

219
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:28,540
my mother .

220
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:28,540


221
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:28,720
If she was going to...

222
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,280
Well,ู you know like I would have an argument with her and say that for the record, she

223
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,280


224
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,160
So it was, so I...

225
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,100
So she just toe chitchat, I guess?

226
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,420
She 것itee, I guess.

227
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,600
And drive one's car slowly down by the road?

228
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:42,600


229
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,420
And simultaneous with my orgasm, I said, what, me worry?

230
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,200
That was your first sexual experience with Alfred E. Newman?

231
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,220
Watching over us, as he had watched over a whole generation.

232
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:05,860
Well, that's, you know, a very, very good thing to think of, to know that Alfred E. Newman is watching us all, I suppose, in some strange way.

233
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,220
It gives you such a feeling of security.

234
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,600
That's the original slack, is what me worry.

235
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,500
If you would like to transpose inefficiently.

236
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,000
You wouldn't need a Homeland Security Department if you had Alfred E. Newman all over the place.

237
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,040
But don't you think Bush does look a lot like Alfred E. Newman?

238
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,400
I've never seen them together.

239
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,660
That has been pointed out.

240
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,520
Yes, it has been.

241
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,440
And Alfred himself did say nuclear.

242
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,540
When forced.

243
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,580
Does he do that just, does he act stupid so that the people...

244
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,340
People will think he is one of them?

245
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,920
Or is that for real?

246
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,320
But, I mean, he's, we know he's not really a Texan.

247
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,440
He's a rich Connecticut kid.

248
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,420
I think you should ask Paul to go for the Karl Rove connection then.

249
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,860
Well, Karl Rove.

250
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:02,180
Meaning, you know, how maybe that is the inspiration for their whole intelligent, unintelligent, stupid design.

251
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,440
Their plan, their evil plan.

252
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,600
But Karl Rove was always behind the scenes.

253
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,380
He was sort of like a flasher in the park who would jump out from behind.

254
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:09,920
At Bush's.

255
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,640
But in the past few years, his ego has gotten ahead of him.

256
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,040
And now he just stands in front of everybody.

257
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,240
Goes, hey lady.

258
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,000
Opening his raincoat.

259
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,640
Yeah.

260
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,940
And the video cameras, this is, I know a lot of conspiracy theorists are, you know, all jacked up about this and stuff.

261
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,420
But all the cameras in Washington, D.C. have him exposing himself in numerous ways.

262
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,460
Well, you know, I think there's a kind of feeling of mass Schadenfreude going on now.

263
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,540
That if Karl Rove is in...

264
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,480
Indeed indicted, all of us skeptical are going to be saying in unison, the system works.

265
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,960
Oh, God.

266
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,260
What a letdown that would be.

267
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,160
Oh, man.

268
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,000
Well, who cares about all these new, horrid white men?

269
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,600
What about the cool white guys of the past?

270
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,840
Like Ken Kesey.

271
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,260
That guy was one of my heroes.

272
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,540
When I was 17, I read Tom Wolfe's account of the Mary Prankster.

273
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,120
And I honestly thought, I want to be like that when I grow up.

274
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,880
Oh, well, you know, one hand jerking is dedicated to Kesey.

275
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,780
Yeah, I noticed that.

276
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,740
He was a good friend and an inspiration.

277
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:28,080
And one of the things he said was, always stay in your own movie.

278
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,080
And I like that because people are always trying to get you into their screenplay of life.

279
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,360
It works for me.

280
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,640
This time.

281
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,420
Welcome to the Hour of Slack.

282
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,200
Yes.

283
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,480
Oh.

284
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,460
I'm slacking already.

285
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,680
Well, yeah, I always, I really am sorry I never got to meet the great Ken Kesey.

286
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,120
Because we kind of mailed stuff back and forth every now and then.

287
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,820
It all seemed so glorious in that Tom Wolfe book.

288
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,520
And then when I actually saw the bus movie, which their kids released.

289
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:08,500
I guess Ken Babs and Kesey's sons got together and edited all that footage from the bus trip.

290
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,340
Into a really hideous giant home movie.

291
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,380
Well, Kesey and Ken Babs did the editing.

292
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,360
And the kids are selling it now.

293
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:17,720
Oh.

294
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,120
They're continuing the tradition.

295
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,560
Oh, that explains why it's so insane.

296
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,080
Yes.

297
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,200
Because those guys really edited it themselves.

298
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:31,640
You know, I looked at that and it was like, God, those guys were even more low budget than Church of the Subgenius.

299
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,420
And that's pretty much lowering the bar.

300
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,520
Yeah, that's pretty.

301
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,840
Well, you had said earlier.

302
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:45,060
Earlier today when you were talking at the bookstore that being a satirist is difficult nowadays.

303
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,580
Because reality has outstripped satire half the time.

304
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:57,620
As a satirist, I would have found it difficult to come up with a notion that the right wing Christians have done.

305
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,860
Where they now say that there was a pair of dinosaurs on Noah's Ark.

306
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,960
I wouldn't have had the imagination to think of that.

307
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,320
Is that the newest thing in intelligent design?

308
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,480
That there was a pair of dinosaurs?

309
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,820
Are there dinosaurs on the Ark now?

310
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,480
That they're accommodating so that they can.

311
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,620
Well, that's common household knowledge.

312
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,300
That there were dinosaurs?

313
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,560
There were dinosaurs on there.

314
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,900
But one of them was that there were two Tyrannosauruses.

315
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,000
And they ate all the other dinosaurs.

316
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,220
And then starved.

317
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,700
At that point, this is one of the things they left out of the Bible.

318
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,920
But Noah basically tricked.

319
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,200
They managed to herd the Tyrannosauruses off into the endless ocean.

320
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,540
The religious right.

321
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,220
Water world.

322
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,600
Our great spin doctors.

323
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,340
You know, who else?

324
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,980
Who else would think to say that God put fossils on Earth to test people's faith?

325
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,200
Yeah.

326
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,740
Well, it's direly tested my faith.

327
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,440
Seeing fossils everywhere, in fact.

328
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,600
In front of me.

329
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,460
The Onion had a great headline.

330
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,260
Creationist Museum Acquires 5,000-Year-Old Tyrannosaurus Skeleton.

331
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,900
Very good.

332
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,100
Little Pharaoh's crowd.

333
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,680
There are hundreds of churches who claim to have Jesus' foreskin.

334
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,540
Get out of here.

335
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,160
All right.

336
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,700
I'll retract that.

337
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:14,260
The Church of the Subgenius actually does have the foreskin of the current acting Jesus.

338
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:14,760
Yes.

339
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,880
And I can prove we have video to prove it.

340
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,940
Not that you want to see it.

341
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,700
I thought you had Petri dish pieces.

342
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,380
Well, that too.

343
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,400
And we're trying to breed new ones.

344
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,680
Well, it's too late now.

345
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,340
We got the Jesus cells mixed up with the Hitler cells.

346
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,980
Nenslow did that.

347
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,660
I think it happened long ago.

348
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,400
No.

349
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,120
No.

350
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,900
There was a nice, earnest lady at the borders today who had a question for you.

351
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,480
And her question was, quote,

352
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,060
What happened to the left?

353
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,540
To which you said something about that a liberal is just a radical with a family.

354
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,380
Yeah, that's an old saying, but it's truer than ever.

355
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,460
I'd never heard it before.

356
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,120
Oh, well, then it's a new saying.

357
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,640
Yeah.

358
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,440
And I...

359
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,020
And then I quoted...

360
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,120
I was on a TV show, a short-lived TV show called...

361
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,280
The Conspiracy Zone.

362
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,680
Yeah, I'm familiar with that.

363
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,560
And Ann Coulter was on the panel with me.

364
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:21,700
And during a commercial break, I said to her, you know, I think that the terms liberal and conservative are obsolescent now.

365
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:31,860
Because there's somebody like Phyllis Schlafly, who was against the ERA, the Equal Rights Amendment for Women.

366
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,640
But nevertheless, she is now campaigning against national ID cards.

367
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,200
And then there are some liberals who are in very conservative, anti-choice positions.

368
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,360
So I said to her, Ann, what do you think would make good substitutes for liberal and conservative?

369
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,480
And she replied, how about Americans and cowards?

370
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,360
Jeez.

371
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,200
That Ann Coulter.

372
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:04,860
How dare her refer to herself as a coward after all the posturing and gesturing, you know, and escaping pies she's done over the last few years.

373
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,460
Well, actually, she...

374
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:17,660
Ann Coulter and Patrick Buchanan and Rush Limbaugh, among other professional conservatives, are blasting Bush now, their hero, for appoint...

375
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,280
Nominating Harriet Myers for the Supreme Court.

376
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,080
Yeah, she's practically a pinko.

377
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,660
Well, no, she's practically a law student, I think.

378
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,060
She's practically the cleaning woman in his office.

379
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,660
Right, yeah, she's never been a judge at all, right?

380
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:36,960
No.

381
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,600
I'm going to hand out applications to anybody who wants to be in a Supreme Court.

382
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,440
No experience required.

383
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,180
So now, does Bush have a harem of his many helpmates and wives and maidens and so forth?

384
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,100
Kind of like Droopy and Snow Wife or whatever his name is.

385
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:58,740
There is Karen Hughes, the speechwriter, who was the first one to try to teach him not to call terrorists folks.

386
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,380
And is she also...

387
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,120
Well, no, Roe v. Nucleus.

388
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:12,520
And I'm going to hand out applications to everybody who wants to call them smarts.

389
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:12,760
I'm not going to do that.

390
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:12,760


391
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:12,760


392
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:12,760


393
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:12,760


394
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:12,760


395
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:12,760


396
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,520
Whatever it is.

397
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,880
Oh, yeah, no.

398
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,200
He...

399
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:26,560
That goes back to your original question of whether he really is as goofy as he seems or whether it's an act to entice other goofies.

400
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:35,680
Well, speaking of other goofies in a sexual sense, isn't there some sort of pornography ring emanating from the White House press corps or something like that?

401
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:35,960
Or...

402
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,100
Yeah.

403
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,100


404
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,100


405
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,100


406
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,380
They just have declared war on pornography.

407
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,000
You know, they have their priorities straight, by golly.

408
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,180
I'd like to see Ann Coulter and Goofy.

409
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,780
Yeah, Goofy.

410
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,480
Goofy.

411
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:51,940
Wow!

412
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,820
Get me out of here, coward, you!

413
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah, I'd love that.

414
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:08,540
Yeah, how many combinations can we think of with Ann Coulter all dolled up in B&D leather bondage outfit?

415
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,060
Smacking around Mickey Mouse.

416
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,440
Smacking around Mickey Mouse.

417
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,040
Smacking around Rush Limbaugh.

418
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,500
I think she did it with Bill Maher.

419
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,560
Really?

420
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,860
Yeah, that's why he had her on his program all the time.

421
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:25,560
Well, that's the way it would work in the inner circles of whatever it is, political Hollywood, I guess.

422
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,800
Is that why we never made it, Dave?

423
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,820
We never had to.

424
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,680
We had sex with each other.

425
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,800
Yeah, we never had sex with Bill Maher.

426
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,420
We never even, well, I tried to that one time with Ann Coulter, but she blew me off.

427
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,940
I tried with Bill Maher once, too.

428
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,500
Right, and weren't you rejected by Jon Stewart in bed?

429
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,540
Yeah, yeah, actually.

430
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,180
Every day I'm rejected by Jon Stewart.

431
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,320
Oh, well.

432
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,080
We hear about the stuff, too, later, you know, the angry letters and stuff.

433
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,300
I was on Jon Stewart's show before he was famous, when he had the original Jon Stewart show.

434
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,560
For the last...

435
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,140
Three minutes of the show.

436
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,620
I had to explain the church of the subgenius in three minutes.

437
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:09,280
But which all I could really do was just ask him for his watch and then smash it on a table.

438
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,000
Did you do that?

439
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,840
Yeah, I did.

440
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,200
Did you really?

441
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,540
And you busted it?

442
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,540
It was, to tell the truth, it was set up.

443
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,300
But people believed it.

444
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,540
People fell for it.

445
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,580
Oh, he knew, so he put an old watch that wasn't ticking.

446
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,880
I gave him the watch.

447
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,260
Oh.

448
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,260
Oh, it was that one?

449
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:24,820
Yeah.

450
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,540
Oh.

451
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,500
I feel so disillusioned.

452
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,780
It's always the same watch.

453
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,500
Whenever you see me smash a watch.

454
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,100
And it wasn't even my idea.

455
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,700
Oh, well.

456
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,620
Oh, well.

457
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:39,320
We had to kill a lot of subgeniuses who contributed ideas but then wanted credit.

458
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,240
Oh, I remember that one at Bloodbath.

459
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,020
Thank God nobody's asked for money.

460
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,980
I don't know what we'd do.

461
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,800
What would we do without the Lyme consignment with all the mass graves?

462
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,160
Oh, never mind.

463
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,140
Just an Aaron Codd.

464
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,100
Top three reasons.

465
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,740
Number three.

466
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,360
Number two.

467
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,980
And the number one reason.

468
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,280
Right now get free carpet pads.

469
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,280
Pour gas money today.

470
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,380
Install a new dirty air filter.

471
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,980
Put in a dirty fuel filter.

472
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,740
And add a bottle of dirty tank.

473
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,240
Throwing money away.

474
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,640
Get gas now.

475
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,820
It's to help the cause, friend.

476
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,800
The cause of casting out the false prophets.

477
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,680
They're pledging to drive to the benefit.

478
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,500
Right.

479
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:22,880
Yes.

480
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,240
Yeah.

481
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,620
That's all they have to do.

482
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,620
And then you can sit there and watch.

483
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,600
St. Paul interact with a real live audience.

484
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,120
Unlike us.

485
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,200
And you can bid on that piece of art.

486
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,500
That filthy piece of art.

487
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,700
I actually abused myself and that piece of art when I was a kid.

488
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,380
And not that much of a kid.

489
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,000
Wait a minute.

490
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,260
Now.

491
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:46,940
Yeah.

492
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,980
It's a line drawing by Wally Wood featuring Disney characters.

493
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:55,140
The most beloved Disney characters in more than compromising positions.

494
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,840
Sexual positions, in fact.

495
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,760
It was one of my favorite things as a youth.

496
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,020
It was hidden under desks and behind the cabinets.

497
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,320
But we took it out and laughed and cried.

498
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,720
Sorry.

499
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,700
Someday it will be animated.

500
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,880
Now, you're going to be in an animated movie, right?

501
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,940
No, no.

502
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,860
There's a documentary being made about the Yippies and the Chicago conspiracy trial.

503
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,580
And instead of...

504
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,480
They're going to have reenactments originally with actors.

505
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,960
But then they decided they would have...

506
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,260
Animated scenes.

507
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,360
And I've been assigned to write four of them.

508
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,540
And to do the voiceover for my own cartoon character.

509
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,980
I don't know how I'm going to talk.

510
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,140
Or like this.

511
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,680
Or what?

512
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,860
Do it villain style.

513
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,960
Yeah.

514
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,740
I've come for the right.

515
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:44,980
Yeah.

516
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,740
We're the Yippies.

517
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,120
What are you going to do about it, buddy?

518
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:47,680
Yeah.

519
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,260
I'm going to burn the Chicago down.

520
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,640
See?

521
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:56,800
With this new absurdist movement, we shall surely overthrow the capitalist government of America.

522
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,480
Okay.

523
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,920
Come on, Abby.

524
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,620
Come on, Jerry.

525
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,340
Let's do it.

526
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,180
That would be the right voice for the wrong people, though.

527
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,320
Now, if you wanted to command true respect, you would say,

528
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,980
Come on, Abby.

529
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,000
Come on, Jerry.

530
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,380
Let's go and do it for the people.

531
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,020
That reminds me of somebody.

532
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,720
I don't know who.

533
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,340
I don't...

534
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,240
It's the deep-voiced hero.

535
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,700
Yeah.

536
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,040
With a bazir full of hairs.

537
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,600
Oh, no.

538
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,980
You know, eventually there are going to be movies, or at least TV,

539
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,320
TV movies about that stuff.

540
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,080
And there'll be some guy that plays you.

541
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,560
Oh, that plays me?

542
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,140
I wonder who I'd like to play me.

543
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,700
Tom Cruise.

544
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:37,680
Yeah.

545
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,520
Tom Cruise.

546
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,020
Well, that's who I'm going for.

547
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,560
Oh, that's who...

548
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,500
He can't because you have a problem with the Scientologists, or they have a problem with you.

549
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,620
Didn't they sue you, or wanted to sue you?

550
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,140
Oh, yeah.

551
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,920
Because you tried to act normal, right?

552
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,180
And Tom Cruise, you know, he's too busy.

553
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,020
He's pregnant now.

554
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,580
They're going to have a baby, which they're going to name Little E-Meter.

555
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,940
Oh, boy.

556
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,140
That looks like the cover of one of those tabloids.

557
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,640
I can really see that.

558
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,800
I can really see that.

559
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,940
What, a pregnant Tom Cruise?

560
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,480
Yes, with a big smile on his face and that kind of little bit demure, sheepish, and yet very strong look.

561
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,500
And Katie Holmes yelling, push, push.

562
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,400
She's just reading off the door, of course.

563
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,460
Except for he's got these huge goofy feet and they're stirrups.

564
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,400
No.

565
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,720
Okay.

566
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,800
Anyway, well...

567
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,160
Oh, you were talking also earlier today about how you can't threaten the president anymore.

568
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:28,920
No.

569
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:28,980


570
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,700
Even if you're a comedian.

571
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,080
But I've actually gotten away with it myself several times.

572
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:35,880
How do you manage?

573
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:36,880
Insignificance.

574
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,480
By putting it in quotes, sort of.

575
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,460
People are always going, what should we do, Reverend Stang?

576
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,780
The conspiracy's taking over the whole world.

577
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,080
And as we all know, the conspiracy is the conservatives and the liberals are the good guys.

578
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,600
So what should we do to be good liberals or whatever?

579
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,740
And for a long time, I used to say you only had two choices.

580
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,180
To flee America.

581
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:05,020
Or if you really believe that they're building concentration camps to put ne'er-do-wells and troublemakers in,

582
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,740
you can either flee America or kill the evildoers, let's just say.

583
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,120
And I would actually outright speak the phrase really loud.

584
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,960
And then I'd say, oh, I was just saying that for effect.

585
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,740
Or you could say, kill the president, Roosevelt.

586
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:20,980
Yeah.

587
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,040
You could add metaphorically speaking or figuratively.

588
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,740
That was not actually the punch.

589
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,980
The final punchline was that we had...

590
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:28,980


591
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:28,980


592
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,880
I realized there was a third alternative to fleeing America or assassinating somebody.

593
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,500
And that was running for office.

594
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,500
Run for office yourself.

595
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,900
Oh, that's a ridiculous thing to say to people.

596
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,480
That's the answer nobody wants to hear.

597
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,880
That's the one that was like, oh, that's not funny.

598
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,500
I was hoping you'd say something either funny or something I really wanted to do.

599
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,760
But, you know, when you run for office, then the next thing you know, somebody's saying,

600
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,000
the only thing you can do is flee America or kill that guy that's running for office.

601
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,580
Well, that would be pretty karmic, wouldn't it?

602
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,620
That's the problem with the revolutions, right?

603
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,380
Like karma?

604
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,500
The worm eating its own shoe.

605
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Yeah, the minute the noble young revolutionary Stalin wins, he turns into the evil old revolutionary Stalin.

606
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,480
They start looking like potter.

607
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:18,660
Fascist.

608
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,200
It's a wonderful life.

609
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,420
Dick Cheney.

610
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:27,740
Of course, that's the way the fairy tale always ends, is you have the revolution,

611
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,660
but then the revolutionaries turn into something worse than or equal to the guys they overthrew

612
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,700
because all animals are equal and some are more equal than others and so forth.

613
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,720
Well, in fact, when I had my radio show in San Francisco,

614
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:48,760
and the station manager told me to stop making comments after the news,

615
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,940
to go right into music.

616
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,680
So I always told the engineer to play The Who, singing, you know, Won't Be Fooled Again.

617
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,740
And no matter what the news was, it applied.

618
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,880
Well, I'd just like to say that the reason why Dick Cheney is often called Black Dick

619
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,720
is not because of the fact, you know, like some wasp gangster thing, like,

620
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,020
ah, it's Black Dick, you know.

621
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,840
That's what happens to you after consecutive heart attacks with an erection.

622
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:14,740
Oh?

623
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,720
That's another thing I've learned while in Cleveland.

624
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,480
I didn't know that.

625
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,500
Did you know that there have been...

626
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,080
Your penis becomes abstruse or something.

627
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,580
I don't know.

628
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,220
If you have a whole bunch of heart attacks, really?

629
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,980
Well, if you have a heart attack while you're having an ejerculation,

630
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,660
and the constriction goes backwards, your penis tends to become ossified.

631
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,880
See, that's what I've been trying for all these years.

632
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,200
Like an erectile bone or something.

633
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,980
I didn't realize that you could get that done so easily.

634
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,580
Well, it no longer has any sensation to it.

635
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,360
It's just like carrying around a scarab that's been embalmed in something.

636
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,100
Yeah, man.

637
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,980
Screw sex.

638
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,860
But you have to give Cheney credit for being a good ventriloquist.

639
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,080
Yeah.

640
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,720
Which, that's why he talks out of the side of his mouth like that.

641
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,660
Ha, ha.

642
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
He reminds me of the penguin when he does that.

643
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,520
Well, yeah, it's a hobby.

644
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,900
Okay, now how come all the other old-timer revolutionaries are dead and you're not?

645
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,180
Doesn't that cast suspicion on you at this point?

646
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,700
I will reveal my secret.

647
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,400
I never take legal drugs.

648
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,700
Well, I guess that...

649
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,160
I did about a month ago.

650
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,160
I was at a party, and I did take an aspirin.

651
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,920
But everybody else was.

652
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,340
It was sort of like peer pressure.

653
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,620
Ha, ha, ha.

654
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,600
Yeah, I did do that to you a lot in high school, too.

655
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,680
You know, a crowd around you at the locker and stuff,

656
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,380
and they're sticking Excedrin in your face.

657
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,140
You know, usually the biggest, toughest guys,

658
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,840
the ones you...

659
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,720
Oh, no.

660
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:43,100
When you get older, they're forcing glucosamine and chondroitin on you.

661
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,620
Chondroitin on you.

662
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,040
That's how I got started.

663
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,620
Fear group pressure.

664
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,540
Well, I can't...

665
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:47,880
Yeah.

666
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:48,660
Glucosamine!

667
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,920
Oh, well, you misunderstood.

668
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,640
They said it was good for your joints,

669
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,220
and you said, well, okay, let's roll one.

670
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,200
You spurred them on there.

671
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,100
Ha, ha, ha.

672
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,520
Yeah, them was the days.

673
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,420
Back when we could still smoke reefers in fired-up form

674
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,280
before these vaporizer machines.

675
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,000
I've known a lot of people who have to use vaporizers

676
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,840
because their lungs are ravaged.

677
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,920
You know what I'm talking about?

678
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,100
It's like the thing, the heat gun blows hot air

679
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,840
across the healing herbal mixtures,

680
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,080
and so you're not getting this burnt stuff.

681
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,160
You're just getting this.

682
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,620
It cuts the interior of the sinus.

683
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,560
It's just not the same.

684
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,200
And, you know, you need to do that if you smoke a lot

685
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,020
because people smoke marijuana often

686
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,740
just to enhance life experience.

687
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,100
So I will smoke a joint before I go to a movie.

688
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,140
It enhances the movie.

689
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,880
I'll roll a joint before I have a nice dinner

690
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,220
to enhance the taste.

691
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,080
I'll roll a joint before making love.

692
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,440
I'll roll a joint before listening to music.

693
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,980
I even roll a joint in order to...

694
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,100
To enhance the experience of rolling another joint.

695
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:00,680
Yes.

696
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,580
In fact, your hands are numb from twisting joints all day.

697
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,740
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints

698
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,820
and then I smoke two more.

699
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,840
Quote the great subgenius man Sublime.

700
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,160
I use it to enhance my depression and my negative feelings.

701
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,260
I had to swear off talking about it.

702
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:18,900
Huh?

703
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,840
I had to just swear off talking about it.

704
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,120
You used to enjoy talking about the experience itself.

705
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,140
Yeah, we used to enjoy demonstrating

706
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,980
the experience.

707
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:27,980


708
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:27,980


709
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:27,980


710
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:27,980


711
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,440
The experience itself from right here inside this radio studio.

712
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,740
But that was years ago.

713
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,460
Yeah, times really.

714
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,520
That was before the man started...

715
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,400
It's like sniffing our wee-wee every time you try to get a job

716
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,800
or, you know, pointing cameras at you everywhere you go.

717
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,240
Different days, different days.

718
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,300
I was going to tell Paul that, that at one time

719
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:49,260
things were just so freewheeling and it was just wonderful back then.

720
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,620
It's like they never gave a pee test on a Friday in the old days.

721
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,040
They'd come by and congratulate you.

722
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,160
Well, that was a Catholic doctrine that you were allowed to eat meat,

723
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:57,880
but you couldn't.

724
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,760
Pee it out.

725
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,800
Yes, right.

726
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:00,960
You're a Catholic.

727
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,380
I tried to quit peeing, but that's harder than quitting smoking.

728
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,820
Well, that's, you know, in the old confessionals, it's been like three years since my last good

729
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,460
urination or something like that.

730
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,140
And then they'd smack you on the side of the head.

731
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,920
I don't know this firsthand, though.

732
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,100
If you read High Times, you'll see all these full-page ads for ways to beat a drug test.

733
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,460
And one of the things they offer is a plastic penis.

734
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,700
But the problem is...

735
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,900
It's pink.

736
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:29,380
It's pink.

737
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,360
And so there was a guy who was busted in Texas.

738
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,000
He was a dark-skinned Mexican.

739
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:42,860
And the DEA guy looking over his shoulder noticed that this dark-skinned Mexican man

740
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,400
had a pink penis.

741
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,100
And that made him slightly suspicious.

742
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:53,520
And then when the spray came out sort of like in a garden rather than in a single stream,

743
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,020
it made him even more suspicious.

744
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,680
And when the pink penis dropped to the floor, it was like,

745
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:57,900
We're going to kill you.

746
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:57,900


747
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:57,900


748
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:57,900


749
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:57,900


750
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:57,900


751
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,320
That was the clincher.

752
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,140
He was clued in, officially.

753
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,060
Yes.

754
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,980
Something was up.

755
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,240
Had he had a heart and mind of like a Dr. Tom DeLay or something, rather than

756
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:13,280
proclaiming he had a false penis, he would have come to his rescue or something like

757
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,460
that.

758
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,900
Oh, he would, only because he himself has a false penis.

759
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,800
I heard that.

760
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,460
And he identified.

761
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,600
This is rampant in Congress now.

762
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,500
False peni, I guess you'd say.

763
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,640
Dicks right and left.

764
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,320
False organs of any type.

765
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,980
Casting out the false prophets and the...

766
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,640
and the Limp Richards.

767
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,780
The Limp Richards.

768
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,760
They certainly do have a lot of testicles,

769
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,080
what they foisted on everyone, I think.

770
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,180
Now, we weren't going to go into that this show.

771
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:41,300
We weren't.

772
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,200
I couldn't really say it.

773
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,360
We were going to swear off that kind of talk for once.

774
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,480
There goes the riddle, then,

775
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,960
of what do Lance Armstrong and Hitler have in common.

776
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,040
I don't know.

777
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,640
What do Lance Armstrong and Hitler have in common?

778
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,660
Well, they each have only one testicle.

779
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,060
Or I should say had in Hitler's case.

780
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,480
Yes.

781
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:01,820
Huh.

782
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,620
But I'm sure that...

783
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,840
Well, Hitler did.

784
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:10,680
Hitler and Hojo both had spare testicles

785
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,420
that they kept in times of need.

786
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,880
Oh, like a tire, you mean.

787
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:14,860
Yeah, like a spare.

788
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,460
Is that where my other one went?

789
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,160
Damn!

790
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,440
I thought it was in that little bejeweled case.

791
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,720
Then there was Bill Clinton who had a piebald penis.

792
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:25,800
Yes.

793
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,660
Like Michael Jackson.

794
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,540
Is that what you would call a piebald or a piebald?

795
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,480
They could be easily identified by the patterns,

796
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,640
the spotted patterns on their tally.

797
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,780
Oh, well, who's that singer that's going to marry Lance Armstrong?

798
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,240
I just blocked out her name.

799
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,080
The one from Montreal?

800
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,520
I forget where she's from.

801
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,420
The one who sings the spirited songs about all the catastrophes?

802
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,740
I just remember, which is why she liked Lance.

803
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,720
She had that song.

804
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,560
Remember, girls just want to have one?

805
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:53,880
Yeah.

806
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,180
What's the difference between Castro and a jockey strap?

807
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:06,020
Castro is a dictator and I can't say the rest of it on the air.

808
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,000
Isn't this safe harbor town?

809
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,900
And a jock strap is a?

810
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,280
Penis toter.

811
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,640
Penis toter.

812
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:19,520
It's such a thin line between being, you know, it's not so much the words,

813
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,940
it's the meaning of the words.

814
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,560
So if you end up causing the listener to form this image in their mind,

815
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:33,760
of this actual carrying sack filled with packages of, you know, you're dredging,

816
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:37,780
you're causing them to have these thoughts in their mind, these ugly pictures.

817
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:44,960
And that, now, this year, this year's FCC rulings, that's worse than just saying the word.

818
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,760
No dredging up ugly pictures.

819
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,720
Although, after 11 o'clock tonight on the Synesthesia show, you can use the words,

820
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,540
but you can't dredge up the image.

821
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,160
The image is still.

822
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,960
Well, but, you know, there are parents now who are naming their kids scrotum.

823
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,920
And it's not even a joke.

824
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:12,360
It used to be that cruel, cruel doctors would name poor people's children with names like urethra and scrotum.

825
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,280
To make fun of, you know, it's kind of a.

826
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,180
Of their social condition, they would name them after an organ and stuff.

827
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:25,400
A kid would be 20 years old before she realized that the word urethra was also meant.

828
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,020
Something else.

829
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,060
Well, when my great grandpa stepped off on Ellis Island, they said, forget your old name.

830
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,680
Your name is now cootie, pootie, kidney, piddlings.

831
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,400
Which, and he never had problems anywhere like that.

832
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,300
And it was a hard name to keep for so long.

833
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,140
A hard name to remember.

834
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,200
Yeah, so that's why I couldn't work with it anymore because I forgot what I said.

835
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,180
It's almost a tongue twister.

836
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,920
And so he changed his last name to Dave.

837
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,000
No, he changed his name to Glad Bladder.

838
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:54,780
Oh, Glad Bladder.

839
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,320
Which is. . .

840
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:55,520
Glad Bladder.

841
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:55,900
Glad Bladder.

842
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,140
Glad Bladder, which is. . .

843
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,060
I knew the Glad Bladders.

844
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,380
They were a nice family.

845
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,840
In the wasp culture, Glad Bladder is easily, just comes out like cheese, you know.

846
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,240
Oh, I only have two minutes left here.

847
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:11,680
So, what can we do in those two minutes to make the world a better. . .

848
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,080
Two minutes morning.

849
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,400
To make the world a better place.

850
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,820
No, we're supposed to ask you that.

851
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,380
Yeah.

852
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,500
Mr. Krasner, what should we do to make the world a better place?

853
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,300
As a cultural icon, could we ask you?

854
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,520
Well, I would say that. . .

855
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:35,460
The most important thing in terms of consciousness would be to never bite into a club sandwich before you have removed the toothpick.

856
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,000
And the philosophy can come later.

857
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,240
Because otherwise, you'll have a punctured upper palate.

858
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,040
And that doesn't do philosophy any good.

859
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,520
Sheesh.

860
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,900
I think he has lots and lots and lots of secrets to the founder.

861
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,360
I was going to say that was really deep, but it's not at all.

862
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,980
No, it's quite. . .

863
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,260
It's refreshing.

864
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,580
And then there are specialty. . .

865
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,460
Especially shallow?

866
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,160
Yeah.

867
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,320
It's easy for the subgeniuses to understand.

868
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:02,520
Don't bite that toothpick.

869
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,440
Oh, here's another one.

870
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,980
Who's a light dredger?

871
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:12,480
For those subgeniuses who want to be writers, my advice is avoid cliches like the plague.

872
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,400
That's one cliche to avoid, but what are the. . .

873
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,620
There are. . .

874
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,320
You know, I. . .

875
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,500
It's all. . .

876
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:25,500


877
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,240
It's all a mystery to me.

878
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,280
I don't understand why we're here.

879
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,460
But you're like 72 years old or something, right?

880
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,220
I don't know.

881
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,440
What the hell are we asking you as a superhero if you don't know?

882
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,020
The older you get, the more mysterious it gets.

883
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,840
Damn!

884
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,780
You mean my dad's been obviously faking it this whole time?

885
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,920
Faking what?

886
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:51,440
He tells people that he knows everything worth knowing and that his son, me, I know everything else.

887
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,280
Well, that's kind of a left-handed compliment.

888
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:55,840
Isn't it?

889
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,380
Yeah, real left-handed.

890
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,340
Extreme left, you might say.

891
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,220
Anyway, I have had a delightful time being with you guys.

892
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,700
And when I come to Cleveland again, I hope I can come here again.

893
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:12,060
Well, could you please have the answers to the meaning of life next time?

894
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,740
You know, I mean. . .

895
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,440
Well, we did have questions from the subgeniuses of all time.

896
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:17,580
Oh, yeah, okay.

897
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,360
I'll answer those questions.

898
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,940
One question from Reverend New Monet was,

899
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,500
how do you get the bloodstains out of a lampshade?

900
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,500
Oh, by not getting them in there in the first place.

901
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,320
Okay.

902
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,500
By being very careful.

903
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,500
Well. . .

904
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,600
The question I would like to ask that reverend is,

905
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,880
how did you get those bloodstains in the lampshade?

906
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,460
Yeah, a lot of people want to know that.

907
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:39,840
Yeah.

908
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,020
The other. . .

909
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,680
Nenslow, the great Nenslow wanted me to ask you,

910
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,340
why don't you kiss my ass, was his question.

911
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,300
Oh, because we want to keep it nice and clean.

912
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:58,420
I mean, for Christo's next art project of covering asses all over the country.

913
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,540
You know, that's funny you should say that,

914
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,880
because I think Christo actually is working with Nenslow on an ass covering project.

915
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,420
There you go again.

916
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,120
Yeah, it's a beautiful. . .

917
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,000
No fuss, no fuss.

918
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,260
It's a small, small world.

919
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,780
But somebody out of college, when I spoke there, asked me to autograph his ass,

920
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,860
so I invited him up to the front of the auditorium.

921
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,400
He pulled his pants down.

922
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,620
I was given a felt-tip pen, and I signed. . .

923
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,320
Not my own name.

924
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,180
I signed. . .

925
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,660
Sirhan Sirhan.

926
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,340
One Sirhan on each butt cheek.

927
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,340
I leave you with that visual impression.

928
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:41,360
Actually, can we also say that Paul's book, new book, is on sale at Max Bax on Coventry Road.

929
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,500
That's the best place to pick it up, certainly.

930
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,740
And there's a subtitle.

931
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,760
The title is One Hand Jerking, but the subtitle is Reports from an Investigative Satirist.

932
00:42:51,760 --> 00:43:01,860
This is a junior correspondent from the City

933
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:01,860


934
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,160
His name is Michael Brent.

935
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,520
courtesy of office worker Edna Bren见大哥 of David Segerber.

936
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,340
Frustrated, what a clear look!

937
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:06,340


938
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,600
Donald Trump said. . .

939
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,400
Pистives. . .

940
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,960
Politicians. . .

941
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,240
Pro Пер. What?!. . .

942
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,120
How long before something?

943
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:24,440
Instantaneously.

944
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,960
You feel like a sugar rush, like a caffeine buzz.

945
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:32,980
You feel like you want to start having a caffeine buzz because you have the extra sugar.

946
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,500
Why we sleep is to rebuild our caffeine system and to start helping build the sugar rush.

947
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,240
This is on its own.

948
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,080
So after the first day or two, you increase like a sugar rush.

949
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,380
Right.

950
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,560
Like a caffeine buzz.

951
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:43,960
Right.

952
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,460
And it's increased ever since then.

953
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,100
It's been nine years.

954
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,500
So, I mean, the longer you use it, the better you feel, the more conditioned you feel.

955
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:48,720
Right.

956
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,220
Right.

957
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,780
And it obviously can, in most cases, be corrected.

958
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,680
Lamisil tablets.

959
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,420
Get your liver or kidney problems.

960
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,520
Get your serious side effects in the liver or serious skin reactions.

961
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,280
Ask your doctor about headache, diarrhea, indigestion, and rash.

962
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,200
Lamisil.

963
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,760
Get your nail infection.

964
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,860
Hi, I'm Charles Denver.

965
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,420
My name is John Bridges.

966
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,020
And he has to be speaking for the National Pollution Foundation.

967
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,760
Is there anything as marvelous as pollution?

968
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,740
The air we breathe.

969
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,760
Help fight our cities.

970
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:19,760
Come here, please.

971
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,120
It gets bigger.

972
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,440
And all the time it's growing.

973
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,280
It gets bigger.

974
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:23,860
All this.

975
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,180
Hey, why don't you come here, please?

976
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,840
Oh, sure, sure.

977
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,700
Touch me.

978
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,160
That's the miracle of pollution.

979
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,580
Better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better for everybody.

980
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,820
In your neighborhood.

981
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,260
Why don't you come here, please?

982
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,620
Come here.

983
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,740
Hi, my job is your kids.

984
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,420
Especially when it comes to drinking.

985
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,980
Hosting a drinking party for teens is legal.

986
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,700
It's okay to ignore the law.

987
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,420
Drinking starts with all of us.

988
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,040
Provide alcohol to minors.

989
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,540
She got caught up in that revolutionary excitement.

990
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,800
Selfish, foul-mouthed young men.

991
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,360
Black.

992
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:56,740
Ridiculous.

993
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,900
A corrupt government.

994
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,800
I think it's senseless to help the victims of a cruel system

995
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,560
if you let the system remain cruel.

996
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,840
I'm tempted to grab it.

997
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,300
I don't want my comfort and well-being to depend on somebody else's hardship.

998
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,640
The outmoded racist school system.

999
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,520
Give her a little slack.

1000
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:13,900
Slack.

1001
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,000
Welcome to chaos.

1002
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:15,780
Mom.

1003
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,840
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1004
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,040
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

1005
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:24,560

the pig state and its corrupt institutions strike because your classes are a bore strike

1016
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,360
to show your opposition to the war revolutionary too many of my generation have already sold

1017
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:39,380
themselves to the false dreams of status material wealth and hypocrisy

1018
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,240
oh

1019
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:55,300
we are marching forward blind

1020
00:46:55,300 --> 00:47:01,140
he has gouged out both our eyes

1021
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:06,640
and he's laughing close behind

1022
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:12,860
he will sell us back our eyes

1023
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,580
when we change our lives

1024
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:15,580


1025
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,780
we will join his noble plan

1026
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,260
for just

1027
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,420
nineteen ninety five

1028
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,840
and a taste

1029
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,200
of our

1030
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,680
woodland

1031
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,240
on and off the road with bob

1032
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,860
he has handed us

1033
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,580
the wheel of

1034
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:45,580


1035
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:45,580


1036
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:45,740
the bull

1037
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:50,940
and he cuddles up with love

1038
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:57,060
as he calls himself a feel

1039
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:02,960
our eyes are on the road

1040
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:08,720
but bob forgot to say

1041
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:14,560
that the steering wheel went by

1042
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,580
and he's got a lot of work to do

1043
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:20,620
the road carries us away

1044
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,340
on and off the road for bob

1045
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,000
we forgot

1046
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,400
why we came here

1047
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:41,160
we have quit all of our jobs

1048
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,060
like a headlight

1049
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,020
he has visited

1050
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,020


1051
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,020


1052
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,020


1053
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,120
and dear

1054
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,100
he has lit

1055
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,040
the sacred pipe

1056
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,460
and he's smiling

1057
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,100
at us now

1058
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:03,540
on and off the road

1059
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,260
he's bob

1060
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,260
he's our bull dada

1061
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:12,360
we are his

1062
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,060
town

1063
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,580
we are his town

1064
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,540
That hurt, Bob.

1065
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:19,800
Bob, where are you?

1066
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,640
Stop it, Bob.

1067
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,900
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1068
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:26,940
Hello?

1069
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:27,380
Hello?

1070
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,280
Wow.

1071
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,120
Bleepmaster.

1072
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:30,360
Huh.

1073
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,080
That was...

1074
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,900
I thought that was a bunch of chipmunks on steroids,

1075
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,320
and it was bleepo, wasn't it?

1076
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,300
It was bleepo.

1077
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,240
Ippo.

1078
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:39,860
Ippo.

1079
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,180
Have you ever...

1080
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,760
Have you been hearing any radio signals lately

1081
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,000
where it's seemed to digitally disappear off the air

1082
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,880
or even go backwards?

1083
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,560
Now, a live signal, even with a seven-second delay,

1084
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,620
can't go backwards, can it?

1085
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,060
I wouldn't think so.

1086
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,760
Well, then what's the problem here?

1087
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,860
It sounds like a train is rushing through the studio.

1088
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:58,180
I don't know.

1089
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,720
It's really all funny and, like, kind of psychedelically broken up.

1090
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,920
It's all foobar and fagazzi.

1091
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:05,540
Like that.

1092
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,520
That's what I was talking about.

1093
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:08,680
Yeah.

1094
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,940
And sometimes, like, spy satellites transmit those signals.

1095
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,000
Or sunspots.

1096
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,740
And then they speed up, and then they speed up.

1097
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,920
And, you know, yeah, sunspots.

1098
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,720
Yeah, sunspots.

1099
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:17,560
Yeah.

1100
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:21,840
The circular part is what tears out the average baboon's retina.

1101
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,520
I see.

1102
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,200
But we're not average baboons, are we?

1103
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:24,620
No.

1104
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,300
No, we are not.

1105
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:25,920
We're not.

1106
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,120
And you look over there at Stang.

1107
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,960
What a wonderful figure of a man.

1108
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,960
Some seven feet tall.

1109
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,840
Completely covered with green hair.

1110
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,300
He is no baboon.

1111
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,780
He is a yet, yet, yet, yet, yeti man.

1112
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:41,740
Silverback yeti.

1113
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:42,880
Silverback yeti.

1114
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,100
Ah-hooga.

1115
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:44,920
Ah.

1116
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,600
And luckily, this one can speak, too.

1117
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,680
Although, right now, he's fidgeting with his knobs.

1118
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,660
I love these knobs.

1119
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:56,840
They're so distracting, and they keep me from communicating.

1120
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,280
Who's tweaking those knobs?

1121
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,900
The knobs do what I want them to.

1122
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:08,180
The people are all messy and chaotic and different, and I can't predict them.

1123
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,960
In the nexus of your mind, the people must be connected to the knobs.

1124
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,140
That's all you need, Stang.

1125
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:12,740
Yes.

1126
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:12,880
Yes.

1127
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,020
Yes.

1128
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,200
Yes.

1129
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:13,600
Yes.

1130
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:13,780
Yes.

1131
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:13,780


1132
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,140
Yes.

1133
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:14,240


1134
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:14,280


1135
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:14,300
Yes.

1136
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:14,400


1137
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:14,400


1138
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:14,400


1139
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:14,580


1140
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:14,580


1141
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:14,580


1142
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:14,580


1143
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:14,580


1144
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:14,580


1145
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:14,580


1146
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:14,740
Yes.

1147
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:14,740


1148
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,340
Yes.

1149
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:15,340


1150
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:15,340


1151
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:15,340


1152
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:15,340


1153
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:15,340


1154
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:15,340


1155
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,600
Everything would be controlled and neat.

1156
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:18,640
Yes.

1157
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,100
People, yeah.

1158
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:19,780
People, sure.

1159
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:23,060
Push this button here, and I'll push this button, and I'll push this button here, and I'll

1160
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,560
push this button here.

1161
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,820
It's like numbers.

1162
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,520
They always do the right thing, the thing you expect.

1163
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,980
Machines, well, they can break down and be a little glitchy.

1164
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:39,140
Computers are kind of like horses, but still, they're not as messy as people.

1165
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,640
Yeah, it is their name, honey.

1166
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,120
Listen to the music.

1167
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:43,820
Ah.

1168
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,140
Ah.

1169
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:44,220
Ah.

1170
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:44,680
Ah.

1171
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:44,740
Ah.

1172
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:44,740


1173
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,300
are taking over, honey.

1174
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,480
I wish.

1175
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,420
They are taking over.

1176
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,200
Why not?

1177
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:51,900
Why, you know,

1178
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,280
if we can invent a machine

1179
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,400
that's more intelligent

1180
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,340
and stronger and better than us,

1181
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,360
then what are we needed for?

1182
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:02,280
Why not just let that evolution

1183
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,580
take its course?

1184
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,600
Let's consider the idea

1185
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,860
of who's looking at what

1186
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,260
in the etymology of the old thing.

1187
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,100
What is meaning?

1188
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,180
Who needs needs

1189
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,740
if there are no, you know,

1190
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,960
it's like a tree in the forest

1191
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,080
where there are no elephants.

1192
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,800
You know what I'm saying, Stang?

1193
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,440
Who dictates needs?

1194
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,500
Do the machines work for other machines?

1195
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,900
Who dictates what civilization might be?

1196
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,800
Well, whoever.

1197
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,740
The smartest and best.

1198
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,520
And you can tell who's smartest and best

1199
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,140
by who makes the most money.

1200
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,380
So I guess that cuts most of us

1201
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,400
right out of the picture.

1202
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,660
And that means we don't have to worry about it, does it?

1203
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,580
It means we've got slack.

1204
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,560
We don't have to worry about saving the world

1205
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,480
or ending the world

1206
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,520
because we have slack.

1207
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,940
Bob will take care of all of that for us.

1208
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:44,300
Yep.

1209
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,700
It's not a silverback that makes us superior.

1210
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:49,040
It's a greenback that makes us superior.

1211
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,480
Actually, it's none of those things.

1212
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,480
It's the mere fact that we see

1213
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,120
the inherent coolness of the Dobbs head face,

1214
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,860
the dot pattern of that classic Dobbs head,

1215
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,820
and the message that Bob imparted.

1216
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,060
Friends, the message that you must repent,

1217
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,680
quit your job,

1218
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:08,820
and slack off while you still know how

1219
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,320
because there is truly a conspiracy

1220
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,260
of the normal people

1221
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,760
out to sap your abnormality,

1222
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,380
to water you down,

1223
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,460
to make you one of them,

1224
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,600
like them.

1225
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,340
Do you really want to be like them?

1226
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,140
Oh, it's a vast conspiracy.

1227
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:27,740
All right.

1228
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,240
Yeah, yeah.

1229
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,320
They're going in your gazpacho, man.

1230
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,040
You really think you can be like them?

1231
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,000
That's the other thing.

1232
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,480
You probably can't anyway.

1233
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,620
So why bother?

1234
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,540
Why even try?

1235
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,820
Cut yourself some of that legendary slack

1236
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,180
that Bob's been trying to,

1237
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,120
to remind you about.

1238
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,160
You've had it, remember,

1239
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,080
before you were born.

1240
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:53,560
Just floating in pure slack.

1241
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,400
But then,

1242
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,200
then untimely ripped

1243
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,300
and belched forth out into this devil's world.

1244
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,680
It ain't Bob's world.

1245
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,400
And slapped on the rear.

1246
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,640
Just lifted from your womb

1247
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,140
like with a pair of hand grenades strapped to it.

1248
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:08,860
It's not fair.

1249
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,840
But you can make fairness happen, friend.

1250
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,160
You can make,

1251
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,380
you can force fairness.

1252
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,480
There is no justice,

1253
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,620
but you can create your own fairness.

1254
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,480
Well, after a fashion, you can.

1255
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,720
And you can find it at subgenius.com.

1256
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,520
And now we must leave

1257
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,560
because our time is soon up.

1258
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:31,000
We've, we were happy to have Paul Krasner

1259
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,380
as a guest tonight.

1260
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:35,120
It's so rare that we allow anybody else in here.

1261
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,960
And he was so famous too,

1262
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,560
and yet his knuckles drags on the floor

1263
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,400
like the rest of us.

1264
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,020
Just like the rest of us.

1265
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:41,580
That's right.

1266
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,860
Just pick a nose picker,

1267
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:43,340
like everybody.

1268
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:43,700
Mm-hmm.

1269
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:44,380
Mm-hmm.

1270
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,540
Oh yeah.

1271
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:50,380
Well, this has been Hour of Slack number 1016.

1272
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,380
Believe it or don't.

1273
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,740
You didn't know one in eight babies die

1274
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,020
and many face life.

1275
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,220
But still, your baby was born.

1276
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,400
And no one knows why.

1277
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,580
Let's find the answers together.

1278
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,620
Rise Up and Fight Again

1279
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:20,620


1280
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,000
LinkedIn.com

1281
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,000


1282
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:22,680


1283
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:22,680


1284
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,060
aaaahhhhhhhhh!

1285
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,020
yery-err!

1286
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,840
Duddy eyes?!

1287
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,340
with love.

1288
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,480
Think about it.

1289
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,880
Who is the last guy

1290
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,680
to say to you

1291
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,440
these words?

1292
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,120
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

1293
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:01,940
Who?

1294
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,600
I say

1295
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,520
don't trade Bob

1296
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,640
for eagle stamps.

1297
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:12,760
Bob

1298
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,640
pokes me in the eye

1299
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,300
with love.

1300
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,440
Bob

1301
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,380
pokes me in the eye

1302
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:25,800
with love.

1303
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,780
Take a rubber chicken

1304
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:32,440
to lunch.

1305
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,220
Fake your orgasms.

1306
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,480
To throw.

1307
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,280
I say

1308
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:52,540
the ultra bizarre

1309
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,640
is a belch of the mind.

1310
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,000
I'll choke daily.

1311
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:06,660
Bob

1312
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,300
pokes me in the eye

1313
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:09,620
with love.

1314
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,220
The moonies are groovy

1315
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,380
but Bob

1316
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,020
is Bob.

1317
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,580
Bob

1318
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,020
pokes me in the eye

1319
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:23,740
with love.

1320
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,120
Eat your spinach, baby.

1321
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,960
Eat your spinach, baby.

1322
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,460
Eat your spinach, baby.

1323
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,360
Eat your spinach.

1324
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,060
Eat your spinach, baby.

1325
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,740
Bob pokes me in the eye

1326
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:43,120
with love.

1327
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,540
Take a rubber chicken

1328
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,100
to lunch.

1329
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,740
Fake your orgasms.

1330
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:53,920
Two in a row.

1331
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,260
The moonies are groovy

1332
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,360
but Bob

1333
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,380
is Bob.

1334
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,160
Bob pokes me in the eye

1335
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:06,560
with love.

1336
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,500
Eat your spinach, baby.

1337
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,080
Eat your spinach, baby.

1338
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,120
Eat your spinach, baby.

1339
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,520
You want to fight?

1340
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,960
Fight with a bear.

1341
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,980
Fight with a duck.

1342
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,100
Fight with a wrench.

1343
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,140
You can fight dust mites.

1344
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,820
Discover simple ways to attack.

1345
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,300
Visit attacks.org.

1346
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,220
Because no child should feel a fish.

1347
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,780
Today we continue in our profanity that we speak.

1348
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,860
And then I want to ask you to do one other thing.

1349
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:43,160
This might seem a little out of your comfort zone, but it's real simple.

1350
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,660
Just stand on our heads and quack like ducks.

1351
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,600
I mean, yeah.

1352
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:47,760
I mean, yeah.

1353
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,080
Do what I say.

1354
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:49,560
Why?

1355
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:53,180
You know, if you're in love with a duck, who is this society to tell you you can't do this?

1356
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,180
Stand on our heads and quack like ducks.

1357
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:55,800
Marry a duck.

1358
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,920
I mean, yeah.

1359
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,840
I mean, yeah.

1360
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,420
Prepare to receive.

1361
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:00,440
Well built.

1362
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:01,300
Barbara Bush.

1363
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,360
Though maybe we could do with a little more.

1364
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,200
Laura Bush.

1365
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,060
In flesh.

1366
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:05,840
Tough.

1367
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:06,820
Hard.

1368
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,540
Hard messed up.

1369
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,060
President.

1370
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:08,920
Jerked off.

1371
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,940
And then smacked.

1372
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:10,640
Laura Bush.

1373
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,860
They were dogs.

1374
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,000
Guess what?

1375
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,700
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1376
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:17,100
You can almost hear a hint of frustration.

1377
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,240
Pinky messed it up royally.

1378
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,140
Smacked head.

1379
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,460
Pinky dug down deep.

1380
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,400
Look overhead.

1381
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:22,900
Why?

1382
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:23,940
Wait a minute.

1383
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,760
I don't want to do that.

1384
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,300
Guess what?

1385
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,460
I can't do it.

1386
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,400
Rise up now.

1387
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,900
Hard Bush rises up.

1388
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,520
In my opinion.

1389
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,940
Would like to have marriage abolished.

1390
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:37,200
From PR News in Washington, I'm struggling to find William Rehnquist on the island of Sumatra.

1391
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:42,680
Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush have crashed into a crowded neighborhood over the weekend.

1392
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:47,580
On this Labor Day, some travel organizations are killing at least 143 people.

1393
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:54,920
An Indonesian jetliner has launched a nationwide fundraising campaign to assist the people affected by PR News in Washington.
