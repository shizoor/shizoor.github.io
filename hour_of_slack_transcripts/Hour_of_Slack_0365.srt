1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
But stay tuned for our Halloween pledge drive and voting drive show tonight.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,700
Ought to be a nasty show. I'm feeling a bit rinnish tonight.

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,100
Yeah, okay.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,660
I'll tell you what, we're going to get into all that. Don't worry, man. Don't worry. You don't have no program.

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,280
Just relax. When I say toilet paper, that's when you come rolling out, okay?

6
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,920
Well, can you do all the things recorded in 1738 in the Benjamin Franklin Studios?

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Some of my friends have prepared a song that they desire you to hear, and I would appreciate it if you would listen to it.

8
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:25,620
Also, please play it for your friends, and even after election day, please run it off once in a while to remind you that I am in Washington,

9
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,640
and we're going to get into all that.

10
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:26,640


11
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,420
We'll be watching out for your interest. The song will now be sung by the Lang and Glee Club.

12
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,940
Are you a vampire, Melvin Laird? Are you a lame vampire?

13
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:45,100
Are you caught in the Transylvanian transvestite time trap, Melvin Laird?

14
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:54,380
The geese of Canada quack, quack, or the ducks of derision late at night when the moon is full?

15
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,640
Do you creep?

16
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,580
Do you creep from the crypt and flit from throat to throat, Melvin Laird?

17
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:11,080
Cause I saw you grinning with a drool dripping on the TV screen, testifying with your vacant voice for the ABM machine.

18
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:23,660
I could swear I saw two fangs touching the microphone, so I'm carrying my wafer, I'm carrying my cross, just in case I find you breathing down my neck.

19
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,640
In the silent halls of...

20
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,480
Congress, Melvin Laird.

21
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,440
Are you a vampire, Melvin Laird? Are you a lame vampire?

22
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,340
And it's starting with verse 1 of chapter 4. It says,

23
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,900
Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God,

24
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,060
because many false prophets have gone out into the world.

25
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,660
It is a quest.

26
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,560
It's a quest for Bob.

27
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,560
We're going to bomb the entire Cleveland area tonight.

28
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,660
Yet again.

29
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,320
Yes!

30
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:04,960
We are uber women going into Kinko's to make thousands of bomb faces.

31
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,560
Thousands and thousands.

32
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,760
Thousands and thousands.

33
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,040
Thousands of bomb faces.

34
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,800
Billions upon billions.

35
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,380
And then we're going to scatter them.

36
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,940
Yay!

37
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,160
Yay!

38
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,180
Unto the masses.

39
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,260
Unto the masses.

40
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,860
And 1 Timothy 4.1 says that there are false prophets that go around teaching doctrines of devils.

41
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,340
This is a doctrine that I follow the devil.

42
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,540
2 Chronicles 11.

43
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,520
14-15.

44
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,440
It says, don't be surprised because the Satan will appear as an angel of light.

45
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,820
I know you think, well, it's just an innocent, fun little holiday for kids to go out and dress up.

46
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,660
Well, we need to, you know, to really investigate and find out what the origins.

47
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,000
And we need to be honest with ourselves and say,

48
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,180
Now take a look around and see what can be found.

49
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,800
A bicycle seat can be pretty neat.

50
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,100
An electric toothbrush will give you a rush.

51
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,480
A handy cucumber is a fine number.

52
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,540
A dozen drumsticks.

53
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,600
Won't make you tick.

54
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,600
And don't forget.

55
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,720
We told you so.

56
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,540
Get loose.

57
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,640
Float juice.

58
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,160
The best sex can be found at home.

59
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,060
All by yourself.

60
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,200
Sitting alone.

61
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,060
Get loose.

62
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,260
Float juice.

63
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,740
You got ten fingers?

64
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,660
Use them, baby.

65
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,100
Every time you get out of my clutches, you turn into a punk rocker.

66
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,080
Or whatever you are again.

67
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,240
It just never fails.

68
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,900
That's the way they want you.

69
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,900
They want you a bum.

70
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,480
Lose your job.

71
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,280
Lose your car.

72
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,620
Just like it used to be.

73
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,040
When you ran around with them.

74
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,200
And you're starting the same thing again.

75
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,920
So I'll tell you what.

76
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,220
The best thing for you to do is keep away from me.

77
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,240
Because I don't want no part of it.

78
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,780
Until you can shape up.

79
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,080
Change your look.

80
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,700
Get rid of that blonde hair.

81
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,320
Go back to normal.

82
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,580
And get off the drugs and the booze.

83
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,380
And quit running around with those kind of girls you run around with.

84
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,200
What?

85
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,800
Who am I?

86
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,580
I'm the record.

87
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,180
Genie the record.

88
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,280
Genie the magic record.

89
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,920
Why, I can do anything.

90
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,920
Oh, you don't think so?

91
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,760
Well, I'll prove it.

92
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,160
Alakazoot, I'm a whistle.

93
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,700
That was easy.

94
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,280
Alakazing, I'm...

95
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,720
The Self Genius Hour of Squat.

96
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,440
Here is your host.

97
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:38,460
I was shown on my inner eyelids the true history of this planet.

98
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,540
It is one of amazement.

99
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,120
And it's gold.

100
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,500
Yes, I said gold.

101
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,040
It's gold.

102
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,540
It's more impressive.

103
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:07,540
And more wonderful than any, any, any religious or any superstitious nonsense that has been

104
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,060
propagated to keep the hybrids going.

105
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,500
To keep them pointed in one direction.

106
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,400
Bob.

107
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,520
Bob.

108
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,960
Please, Bob.

109
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,120
Oh, yes, dear friends.

110
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,040
This is Li Liqing.

111
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,220
A Chinese.

112
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:26,900
Genius.

113
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,180
And you are listening to the Hour of Slack on KNON in Dallas, Texas.

114
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,700
Remember, Bob is a comrade of all people.

115
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,420
Here in China, just like in America.

116
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,840
The people need slack.

117
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,300
In Chinese, we call slack Lu Tianpai.

118
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,160
But it must be true slack.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,980
Not the bad slack of the conspiracy.

120
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,240
It's a good thing.

121
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,580
That's right, yeah.

122
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,580


123
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,580


124
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,580


125
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,580


126
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,580


127
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,580


128
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,580


129
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,580


130
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,580


131
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,580


132
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,580


133
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,120
And it's, it's, it's, it's ludicrous.

134
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,040
It is absolutely crazy.

135
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,800
How can we as, I mean, I mean, we look back in history and we think, you know, where

136
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,740
they were primitive people, you know, they were practicing these, these, these, these

137
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,260
crazy rituals and, you know, and these crazy traditions of spirit worship and things.

138
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,640
Hey, man, wake up.

139
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,040
Nothing's changed.

140
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:26,240
You go to MJ Designs and you've got four aisles full of ghosts, goblins, witches, and, you know, and death and gloom.

141
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,080
And, you know, and what is going on here?

142
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,840
We need to realize that all we've done is just become more sophisticated in the same area.

143
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,200
We need to stand up against it.

144
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,740
We need to say no.

145
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,180
I will change.

146
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,480
We didn't leave with Lucifer.

147
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,580
The telephone rang.

148
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,180
It would not stop this President Kennedy calling me up.

149
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,240
He said, my friend Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?

150
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,680
I said, my friend John.

151
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,460
The subgenius must have flat!

152
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,420
The subgenius must have flat!

153
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,300
When you look down the street, it's like the city's getting ready for a Bob parade or something, man.

154
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:17,220
I mean, there's like, you just look down the street and there's like Bob staring at you.

155
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,940
He's a giant Bob.

156
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,940
Bob has a little one.

157
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,900
And we telephone, Paul.

158
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,840
We made them in day glow colors.

159
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,160
Big orange colors.

160
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,180
Yeah, and they look like Halloween bobs.

161
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,740
And pink.

162
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,260
You can see the pink ones really well, too.

163
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,400
Yes!

164
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,140
Oh, God, they're great.

165
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,360
And then, and then I saw her.

166
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:46,260
She was a bright red 64 GTO with fins and gills like some giant piranha fish.

167
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,840
Some obscene phallic.

168
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,600
She's a umbrella model on the road back in the

169
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,640
90s.

170
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,140
I was still red.

171
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,140


172
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,140


173
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,640
No.

174
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:13,640


175
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,760
I love the.

176
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,060
Hold on.

177
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,020
Hold on.

178
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,100
And at that moment, I thought of my mother.

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,820
That was easy.

180
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,960
Alakazing, I'm a telephone.

181
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,960
You don't have to answer that.

182
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,300
It's only me.

183
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,300
Now I've noticed.

184
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,040
Good morning.

185
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,720
Good morning, patrol.

186
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,840
I'll make you smile and I'll make you laugh

187
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,040
as I spin around on your phonograph.

188
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,520
Round and round I go.

189
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,360
Ouch!

190
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,260
Oops!

191
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,420
Be careful with that needle.

192
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,520
It scratches.

193
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,280
I'm sure glad you turned me over.

194
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,340
That fuzz on the phonograph

195
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,240
tickles.

196
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,080
I'll bet I can sing

197
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,760
Farmer in the Dell faster than you can.

198
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,820
The farmer in the Dell.

199
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,180
The farmer in the Dell.

200
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,980
Stop, stop.

201
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,980
Did you sing it that fast?

202
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,900
Oh, you did.

203
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,860
Well, I bet I can sing it even faster than that.

204
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,000
And there was no sound at all.

205
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,420
But the clock upon the wall.

206
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,180
And the door burst open wide.

207
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,260
And my daddy stepped inside.

208
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,980
And he kissed my mama's face.

209
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,080
And he brushed her tears away.

210
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,840
Oh, that's right.

211
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:07,360
It's the Princess Wee and Sister Mary Square Show.

212
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,320
Oh, that's right.

213
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

214
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,680
The magic is twisted.

215
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,580
Crazy.

216
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,540
Oops-shooby.

217
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,760
Hip-flip city.

218
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,240
My analyst told me that I was right out of my head.

219
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,720
But I said, dear doctor, I think that it's you instead.

220
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,400
Because I have got a thing that's unique and new.

221
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,060
To prove it, I'll have the last laugh on you.

222
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,480
Because instead of one head, I've got two.

223
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,680
And you know two heads are better than one.

224
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,020
Hey, man, don't badmouth the head.

225
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,500
Hey, we got a reward.

226
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,840
The head is cool.

227
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,620
I do not wish to appear stupid.

228
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
I do not wish to appear stupid.

229
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,120
Inside my steamer trunk, my eight-year-old son was losing his hair.

230
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,840
What shall I do?

231
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,220
What shall I do?

232
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,440
I do not wish to appear stupid.

233
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,560
Uh, so for all I know, maybe these.

234
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,400
Oh, yes.

235
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,460
Oh, we got this.

236
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,340
This is one of the callers that wanted to meet Reverend.

237
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,000
Spang at a cheap motel.

238
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,320
That comes with a $200 pledge.

239
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,160
Yeah.

240
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,120
Uh.

241
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:22,700


242
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,260
Uh.

243
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,080
Sire, there is no more money.

244
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,720
We gotta get some money.

245
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,600
That dirty Turkish hunk of a fat flat.

246
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,980
Well, tonight, dear friends, we're going to try a new money raising technique.

247
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,360
It's real simple.

248
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:46,320
The more you pay us, the funnier and yet, and yet more biting and trenchant and perceptive

249
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,980
our wonderful show will be.

250
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:54,800
Now, so far, only a few people have called in, so the show is still fairly silly and

251
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,660
immature, although still, no doubt, better than anything on television.

252
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,460
Eh?

253
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,640
Uh, wait a minute.

254
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,160
Hi, Waldo.

255
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,140
How the hell are you?

256
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,680
God, we're just having a little break.

257
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,580
Well, don't have a cow, Waldo.

258
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,800
Let's you and me go see what's cooking up at Bud's.

259
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,760
You mean where the corn dogs are puffing?

260
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,820
Hot chars?

261
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,120
That's right.

262
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,320
I'm going to go get some corn dogs.

263
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,320


264
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,320


265
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,320


266
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,320


267
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,320


268
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,340
Hey, Waldo, are you ready?

269
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:17,880
You?

270
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,460
Nope.

271
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,340
I'm afraid, dear friends, you aren't ready.

272
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:30,180
That one, that one's just, we haven't even reached that level of intelligence yet because

273
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,280
you haven't paid enough.

274
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,600
As more people pledge, the material in the show will gradually become more relevant,

275
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:45,080
more timely, more sophisticated, and when we've raised 500 bucks, we'll turn the wit

276
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,060
factor up to .5 degrees.

277
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:54,440
At $700, we'll achieve pithiness levels above, well above 97%.

278
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:01,380
And when we reach, dear friends, when we reach our goal of 1,000 American dollars tonight,

279
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:07,840
when we reach that point, if we can reach that tonight, by then it will be the greatest

280
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,000
audio production in the entire universe.

281
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,060
Now, for now, it's still pretty simple.

282
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,060


283
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:22,840
Stupid, I guess, and because we're not going to be smart for nothing, friends, we're subgeniuses.

284
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:33,140
We must have slack or money because, well, for instance, as it says here in Slackalonians

285
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:44,780
425, he was delivered, de-kidneyed, and eviscerated for our sins and was regurgitated from the

286
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:54,080
Gorge of Living Death, even for the justification of these, our grins.

287
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:04,200
Dobbs did not die, my dear radio listener, my un-pledging radio listener.

288
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,680
Dobbs did not die because he had to.

289
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:14,760
Wellman chose to kill him on stage for ye and everyone, but mainly for his own reasons.

290
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:14,760


291
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:14,760


292
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,780
These being unknowable and ineffable.

293
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:27,220
This man was glad-handed over and out to you by Dobbs' set purpose and knowledge, and you,

294
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,600
speaking to the people of Dobbstown, even with the second helping of Rugo's pinkish-eyed

295
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,780
ones, put him to death by nailing him to the crosshairs of Wellman's gun cycle.

296
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,760
For the sake of the people of Dobbstown, I have no reason to be happy.

297
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:44,760


298
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:44,760


299
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:44,760


300
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:53,820
For Bob so shoved the world that he gave up his only besotted Sunday Supplement subscribers,

301
00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:03,340
that he rather than they should have the effulgence of Slack unending, in order that they be sure

302
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:13,160
to endure eternal lice, yea, to itch his own even unto the hind end of the world.

303
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,740
The End.

304
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:14,740


305
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:24,000
And yet Dobbs regurgitated, freeing his epoptitude from the agony of Slacklessness, for it was

306
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,380
impossible for Nii-Gi, whose grunt is Nii, to keep its hold on him.

307
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:38,200
Dobbs went out on stage throughout the night of Slack for ye and everyone to prepare the

308
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,900
way for us to leave the house.

309
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,740
Moronicus too.

310
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:44,740


311
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:52,160
Bob, who being in very nature, or Dobbs, did not consider equality with anti-Bob something

312
00:16:52,160 --> 00:17:00,020
to be grasped, clutched, or palpated, but rather smoked in his living pipe like a fine

313
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:06,780
burly or rum-soaked shag, he himself nothing taking the very nay, sure, taking instead

314
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:13,020
the very nature of a salesman, never taking no for an answer.

315
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,720
And being in a position to say, I am a salesman, I am a salesman, I am a salesman, I am a salesman,

316
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,660
is the regurgitatedarts, grows sufficient.

317
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:19,660


318
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,420
dark of agalic LauraPC.

319
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:34,540
Not all that Essexian d handed out to ih almostTVto Grissom, but the flawlessойти

320
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,480
to the word.

321
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,240
Andall the good goods, in carnal olive, bargain-place, and holyness of the universe, too, drew

322
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,280
in Kathy'sத Swedish joke, at the veryфoe the boldest of them all and in the mostaptive

323
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,700
tone, a serious par Heaven in the world.

324
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:44,700


325
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:44,700


326
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:44,700


327
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:44,700


328
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:44,700


329
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,400
soil the tops of his shoes.

330
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,860
And now we are engaged in a great civil war,

331
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,980
testing whether this cult, that cult, or for that matter, any cult, should so long endure.

332
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,520
We are met on a great potter's field of that war.

333
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:09,440
These bland pinks, living and dead, shall little note nor long remember what we do here.

334
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,480
By the way, I forget, what is it that we are doing here?

335
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,560
Oh yeah, it is for we the living to confess that J.R. Bob Dobbs is dead

336
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,600
to the infinite gratification of Jehovah One, the Father,

337
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,340
senile, infinitely maligned space god.

338
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:34,920
Jesus came here as a servant, but Dobbs came as a salesman, pre-scriptures 2019.

339
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,740
And he came unto the daughters of the farmers,

340
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,460
and knew them well.

341
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:48,780
When there was no room for him to be by himself during the night.

342
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:55,380
And in the morning, before the sunrise, he continued traveling upon his route,

343
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,760
so that the franchise might not be usurped.

344
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,760
Yea, and to this day, it never hath been so.

345
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,820
Bobbs is still the route.

346
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,200
Bobbs is still the franchise.

347
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,540
And now, dear friends,

348
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,440
as soon as possible, we will be back.

349
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:19,380
Sister Basilica passes out among you as she sniffs the contents of the collection plate.

350
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,820
Each and every one of you, dear friends, should reach down, deep down, and give.

351
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,080
Huh!

352
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,000
Friends, give!

353
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,580
To the church of the powerful, blinding apostasy,

354
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:39,500
which fears no throne, but exults in its own freedom to scatter its fundaments on the earth,

355
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,660
soiling the uppers of its shoes,

356
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:47,000
to let down the inward-produced product of its concentration,

357
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:54,600
fertilizing the fields of science, sorcery, art, and religion.

358
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,560
Ah!

359
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,980
Ah!

360
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,900
For, lo, the frop cloudeth my brain, and my buckler and shield are ripped away.

361
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,640
I am naked before thee, Bobbs, all nagoi, thou who hast unbuckled me.

362
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:11,640


363
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,520
I have unbuckled my buckler and unsnapped my shield, which was my sole protection.

364
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:21,960
Yea, my buckler being so unbuckled, I am even as a pobucker buck naked before Bobb.

365
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,180
Bobb dashes a bucket of ice water over my loins.

366
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:31,100
The buck path is not for the buck and the doe dwell in the same forest.

367
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,900
The buck is Bobb.

368
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,800
He is bucking tradition.

369
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,300
He changeth brickbats into buckets.

370
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:41,620
He changes the field to a field.

371
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:41,620


372
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:41,620


373
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:41,620


374
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:41,620


375
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:49,600

howell

391
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,720
who actually wrote that

392
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,100
extremely areodite sounding and verbose

393
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:49,820
at this level our salesman can see the top of the ladder and as well on his waving

394

a revolting genetic accident take your smelly shell elsewhere see general buyback see how well ye Obeyе

396
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:05,800

00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:05,800


398
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,140
Loyal.

399
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,060
Stupid, but loyal.

400
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,620
But, little listeners, you may ask, is there hope?

401
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,000
Listen, you little listeners, whistling in the glistening mists.

402
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,280
Listen to these inspirational words from the Book of Lies,

403
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,300
Chapter 10, Bankruptcy, Verse 10, Ever.

404
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,380
The passage runs, and I quote.

405
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,680
If you be tired, if you've got that rundown feeling,

406
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,040
remember, you're not just anybody.

407
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,240
You're special.

408
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,420
You are living proof that God does not exist.

409
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,480
Yes, you, little listener,

410
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
if you're like most of the people who listen to this show,

411
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,860
are proof that no supreme being could ever exist.

412
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,660
The phones aren't ringing.

413
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,900
That phone number to get us to...

414
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,660
I've got a tape here that will absolutely blow your mind.

415
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,280
I was about to shift into the serious, socially relevant political part.

416
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,860
I've got material here.

417
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:58,040
This tape is so timely and so new that Joe Paulino and Mr. Trocar,

418
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,800
I believe that's his name,

419
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,360
a tow car, in San Francisco FedExed this thing to me

420
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,400
so I could get it on the air.

421
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,140
I've got a tape here before the election.

422
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,420
Actually, I've got a bunch of stuff that would be real good before the election.

423
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,280
I would like to play that material.

424
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,680
It's timely and urgent.

425
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,280
That's right.

426
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,300
But this is...

427
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:19,340
The point is, you're not going to hear this in any other station around here.

428
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,740
You're not going to hear anything even remotely like it.

429
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,480
So...

430
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,180
Well, my name is George.

431
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
You might have heard of me.

432
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,840
I ran the CIA back in 73.

433
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,680
Straight out of Kennebunkport.

434
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,840
I'm a Texas resident.

435
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,300
In 1980, I became vice president.

436
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,460
Hostage deals?

437
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,800
Never heard of that poop.

438
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,020
Contras and drugs?

439
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,360
I was out of the loop.

440
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,800
Besides, no one cares.

441
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,900
That's plain to see.

442
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,260
Because in 88, you elected me.

443
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,100
Eight years, a second string to the gipper.

444
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,120
Finally, I got the ball.

445
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,240
Well, I sold some arms to my buddy Saddam.

446
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,940
He turned around and gave Kuwait the slam.

447
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,760
So, I kicked his butt, bombed Iraq to rubble,

448
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,820
killed a bunch of schoolgirls,

449
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,040
killed kids without any trouble,

450
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,340
sent in the US team.

451
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,860
Yep, we cleared the benches,

452
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,360
buried Iraqi boys alive in the trenches.

453
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,940
Now, gasoline's cheap.

454
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,040
The message is plain.

455
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,580
Mess with our oil, you'll feel the pain.

456
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,740
At least your noncombatants will.

457
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,700
We're hell on decoys, too.

458
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,340
One day, my son Neil called me on the phone.

459
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,960
He said, dad, about this little savings and loan

460
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,700
called Silverado, it was giving him trouble.

461
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,260
And one day, it would burst like a big fat bubble.

462
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,560
I said, don't worry, son.

463
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,780
I'll save your neck.

464
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:33,820
I'll save your neck. I'll save your neck.

465
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:33,820


466
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,320
The US voters are gonna pick up the check

467
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,060
for all the SNLs.

468
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,100
And hey, that's not all.

469
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,640
You just wait till the rest of the bank system falls.

470
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,040
Never have trusted banks?

471
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,980
Put your money in plastics, I've always said.

472
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,160
Well, I went to Japan,

473
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,640
and I met a whole bunch of bigwigs there.

474
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,140
Then I lost my lunch.

475
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,840
The Japanese prime minister, he took it in stride.

476
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,280
He called for his limo, and we went for a ride.

477
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,940
He said, George, that stuff you barfed on my shoe

478
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,160
was our biggest US import since 82.

479
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,740
Yep, we own your fashion.

480
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:03,740


481
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,820
We run your banks.

482
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,580
George, you gave us the store.

483
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,380
By the way, thanks.

484
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,340
Very polite people, the Japanese.

485
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,660
You know they drive on the left side of the road?

486
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,420
It's been a great four years.

487
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,660
Just look what I've done.

488
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,100
We're the biggest debtor nation that's under the sun.

489
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,360
Unemployment's up.

490
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,940
A million people in jail.

491
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,340
The whole social system is ready to fail.

492
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,800
Abortion's still legal.

493
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
That's a matter of time.

494
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,660
You may believe Anita, but Clarence Thomas is mine.

495
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,920
So I'm out of here.

496
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,320
Done my Republican share to send the country off to God knows

497
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:33,580
where.

498
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,260
It's the Democrats' turn.

499
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,340
Let them do what they can.

500
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,640
We'll be back in 96 with a man named Dan.

501
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,260
Quail, that is.

502
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,840
Hey, you think that's scary?

503
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,860
Just wait till Pat Robertson runs.

504
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,320
Hey, you think Marilyn will let Barr and me visit the Oval

505
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,760
Office for old time's sake?

506
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,320
What?

507
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,720
Not conservative enough?

508
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,620
Why, I gave that boy a start.

509
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,860
Hell, I was in Dallas in 63 when he was in Knickers.

510
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,820
James, my Haldol, please.

511
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,480
Oh, yes.

512
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,120
Dear friends.

513
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,260
The George Bush.

514
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,080
Farewell.

515
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,340
Well, rap by Tokar and Paulino there in San Francisco.

516
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:20,380
And did you know that KNON, spelled backwards, is N-O-N-K?

517
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,500
NONK?

518
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:29,020
And that Dallas, said backwards, is SALAD?

519
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,040
And did you know that Cleveland backwards is D-O-N-K?

520
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,060
D-O-N-K.

521
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,060


522
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,060


523
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,060


524
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,060


525
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,480
And the one they don't know is KNON.

526
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:33,940
A-N-N-Y.

527
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,600
EPA, I top it off, you don't.

528
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,480
Press A, AND A LEVEL C.

529
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,320
HAVE YOU BEEN THERE OR ARE YOU STILL UP ON LEVEL A?

530
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,720
GET DOWN TO THE LEVEL C.

531
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:47,560


532
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,080
AND YOU WILL SEE.

533
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,240
THAT.

534
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:06,980
I have never heard such an eloquent description of the genetic compost here.

535
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,900
It is a mighty compost, isn't it?

536
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,880
Yep, Cleveland Backwards is DNA level C.

537
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,720
It's backmasking.

538
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,180
Did you know that if you take the phrase, Jesus loves you, and play it backwards on a rock and roll album,

539
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:32,040
and this is serious, this is true, the phrase, Jesus loves you, backwards, comes out as, we smell sausage.

540
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:41,240
But if you take the phrase, Bob loves you, and play it backwards, it says, we smell Bob.

541
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,600
By the way, that was discovered by an Akron, Ohio subject.

542
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:53,280
A genius alumnus, Mark Mothersbaugh, discovered that on his fancy computer doohickey, and informed us.

543
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,860
It used to be on his answer machine.

544
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,280
You know, I have a lot, a lot to thank Cleveland.

545
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,080
Mark Mothersbaugh was in Devo.

546
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,780
Yeah, he went in Devo.

547
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,480
He was in the Devo.

548
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,200
He was in the Devo.

549
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,940
That was a great band.

550
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,120
He used to whip it.

551
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,800
A whole lot of subgenius mutant hierarchs came from this area.

552
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,580
And some other things.

553
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,600
Especially Akron, especially the Akron area.

554
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,340
Palmer.

555
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,280
Vreedies of the Lies Foundation.

556
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:18,820
Yeah.

557
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,420
And, well, I guess that's about it.

558
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,420
I guess that's about it.

559
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:34,240
Now, how many, and now, Cleveland is pumping out like a gigantic zit, erupting with subgenius madness.

560
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,820
Pope Jimbo.

561
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,600
Pope Jimbo.

562
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,620
Pope Jimbo, I hope you're listening.

563
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,900
We thank you.

564
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,700
Well, I don't think we should announce over there what we have to thank.

565
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,480
We thank Pope Jimbo for in Cleveland.

566
00:29:50,180 --> 00:30:02,220
I got some letters from certain, well, committees and, well, the city government requesting that the Subgenius Foundation cease and desist.

567
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:08,000
And, Senator, I stand here to tell you that Pope Jimbo had nothing to do with any of that.

568
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,700
No, no, no.

569
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,620
You can't blame.

570
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,720
And I don't know who he is.

571
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,720
I don't know his real name.

572
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,900
And I'm not going to meet him tomorrow.

573
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,940
Well, okay, you've alluded to this man, and now you're not going to talk about him.

574
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,460
And now you're not going to talk about him.

575
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,640
Well, actually, I am going to meet him tomorrow, but I didn't want anyone to know that.

576
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
Because I don't know yet.

577
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,600
I'm not allowed to.

578
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,980
Is he a real hierophant?

579
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,720
I mean, does your church have a hierarchy?

580
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,100
You mentioned a hierarchy.

581
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,320
I thought you were gifted.

582
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,160
A rigid, rigid hierarchy.

583
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,720
A rigid hierarchy.

584
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:40,760
Well, I thought the only hierarchy was Bob itself, himself.

585
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,380
Well, it's sort of like the Sunnis and the Shiites, you know.

586
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,640
I forget which is which.

587
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,700
I think the Sunnis and the Shiites.

588
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:55,880
The Sunnis believe that there is no intermediary between God and man and Allah, all of it.

589
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,280
You know, everybody's their own preacher.

590
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,840
But then the Shiites believe that there are these imams.

591
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,500
Imams, yes.

592
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,260
Yeah, imams who stand in between.

593
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,020
And edmams.

594
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,320
And they're actual spokespeople for all of that and God and so forth.

595
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,500
As we all are.

596
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Yeah, and some of the subgeniuses are Sunni subgeniuses.

597
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:16,680
We're imams.

598
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,160
We're imams.

599
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,160


600
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,160


601
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,160


602
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,160


603
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,160


604
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,620
And then there's the other subgeniuses that hate the hierarchy and think we're a

605
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,300
whole bunch of fascist show-offs and blabbermouths.

606
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,580
We should be burned at the stakes.

607
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,000
Yeah.

608
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And then there's those who recognize that, in fact, we are closer to Bob than you pathetic

609
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,660
mere mortals out there with your $20 membership.

610
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,760
Oh, I meant to remember, and all of, I'm gonna tell Bob on you.

611
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,460
I'm on you.

612
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:38,740
You see there?

613
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,180
Christ, is that easily done?

614
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,760
I don't know.

615
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,400
I heard a preacher on the radio one time saying, I'm gonna tell Bob on you.

616
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:46,680
I'm on you.

617
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:46,680


618
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:46,680

your vote

649
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:47,740
money. I mean, we don't care who you vote for, Clinton. Well, we do, but we won't tell you who,

650
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:55,340
we won't, we won't tell you who to vote for. Bush and Perot hate you. Now, which do you want,

651
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:01,020
dear friends? I mean, you, this is, it's your time to make a choice. Uh, you can have the nice,

652
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,820
powerful shadow government that can do anything it wants for its own country club buddies without

653
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,780
telling you and at your expense, or you can have some commie who's so treasonous and un-American

654
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:17,000
that he smoked pot and slept around and was against the Vietnam war. Or you can have a

655
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,260
raving lunatic billionaire. Bless old Ross Perot's heart. You know, really he's the classic

656
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:30,300
rogue unsaved subgenius, but he's still just crazy as a tree full of fish.

657
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,840
Friends, come on now.

658
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,440
Uh, uh,

659
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:35,720
well,

660
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:45,380
I bet you Bush wins. I bet he does. That's my prediction. George Bush is going to win. Why?

661
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:52,640
Cause you, cause you're too tragically hip to actually go out and vote or pledge. You're too

662
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,260
hip to pledge. Oh no, man. I'm just gonna, I don't have a conscience. It doesn't matter.

663
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:04,600
Bleeding heart, bad, invulnerable heart. Good. I'm just so cool. Now friends,

664
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,300
if Clinton,

665
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,380
if Clinton gets elected and takes away all our guns and makes them teach communism and drugs and

666
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:17,440
homosexuality in the schools, along with witchcraft and forced, uh, pregnancy abortion combinations

667
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:25,020
every nine months and evolution, well, I'll be real surprised actually, because I don't think

668
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:31,160
you'll really see much of a change at all. And that's the sad thing, my friends, the conspiracy

669
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,580
is so much bigger than the Republicans.

670
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,260
Oh,

671
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:35,320
yeah.

672
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:42,640
Democrats. Cause they're all just a bunch of normals and they'll do anything to pass the buck

673
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:50,900
after taking as much of that buck as they possibly can. And it ain't going to change.

674
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,140
No, sir. Not in our lifetime. Ain't going to change a bit.

675
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:04,220
You know, they're all out to do it to you. Every one of them.

676
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:21,360
The other day I had to spend all day long dealing with a lawsuit, evidence of somebody stealing Bob's name to put on their record album so that it would sell better because they didn't really have their own name.

677
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:29,920
And so instead of working on our new book, I had to go deal with the trademark infringement evidence.

678
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,040
Ironic that we'd be suing somebody for copyright infringement.

679
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:41,000
I know, but this was extreme. I mean, this isn't like what we do. This is more like what they do.

680
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,320
Your friends like what you're doing to us sitting here listening, going,

681
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,460
I ain't going to pay no money. I ain't going to vote for you. I'm going to stupid, stupid, stupid.

682
00:37:52,320 --> 00:38:03,940
8237490 friends. Cause the same day I had to deal with that lawsuit, I was in the post office sending out truth and I dropped my checkbook.

683
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,880
The subgenius foundation checkbook.

684
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:15,440
And after waiting in line for half an hour, I realized that I dropped the checkbook and I ran back out looking for it while there was a man in the lobby holding the checkbook.

685
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,900
And he looked at me, said, is this yours? And I said, yeah.

686
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:27,240
And he handed it to me and he said, could you give me some money for returning your checkbook?

687
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,640
And friend, I, I looked at him and a sort of a.

688
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,380
A.

689
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,400
Grin of stupefaction.

690
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,040
And I just, I knew just what to do.

691
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,060
I pulled up my wallet.

692
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,580
He wanted a reward for returning my lost object.

693
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:49,200
So I pulled up my wallet and I offered him everything I had in there, which was $1.

694
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,160
He took my last dollar.

695
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,580
They all want a piece of your friends.

696
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,320
A vote is not a piece of you.

697
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,720
It's taking a piece out of the other one.

698
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:01,900
See.

699
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:07,620
Not voting does not show the system that you refuse to be a part of it.

700
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,520
Same with not pledging.

701
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,700
They'll just assume that you're too stupid to fight it.

702
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,680
And they'll be absolutely right.

703
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:23,200
And if you don't vote and pledge to your radio station that plays the hour of slack, your Reverend staying is going to be a shame.

704
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:23,940
I'm ashamed.

705
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,540
I'm going to tell Bob on you.

706
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,140
I'm going to tell Bob on you.

707
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,560
You, you can all pledge five bucks.

708
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,880
Every one of you has can pledge five bucks.

709
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,920
If you've got enough brains to appreciate this show, then five bucks should be no problem.

710
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,600
Only laziness could explain you're not sending five bucks.

711
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,560
And though I dearly love slack, I detest laziness.

712
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,420
They are not the same thing.

713
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,900
Slack and laziness aren't.

714
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,980
Do not let your butt rot.

715
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,540
Get off of it.

716
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,240
Call.

717
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,160
Pledge.

718
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:57,940
Vote.

719
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,180
Send in the money.

720
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,380
In that order.

721
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,020
Call.

722
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:01,980
Pledge.

723
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:02,840
Vote.

724
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,320
Send in the money.

725
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:04,960
Call.

726
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:05,860
Pledge.

727
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,580
Vote.

728
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,920
Send in the money.

729
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:27,840
What you believe tonight is the single most most important separating issue of this play.

730
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:39,680
Where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature.

731
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,200
Anything goes.

732
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,680
We can ask anything.

733
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,840
Anything goes.

734
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,640
Anything goes.

735
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,200
We can ask anything.

736
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,540
This issue is an issue that divides Americans and the people.

737
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,940
I'll talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-goggling.

738
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,820
There will be a giant sucking sound going south.

739
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,880
There will be a giant sucking sound going south.

740
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,140
How long can we continue with trickle-down economics?

741
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,320
Change for change's sake.

742
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,560
Change for change's sake.

743
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,620
Change for change's sake.

744
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,580
Isn't enough.

745
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,480
You'll have a shot at me in four years and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job.

746
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,440
You'll have a shot at me in four years and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job.

747
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,280
And I would welcome you to do that.

748
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,780
I've been and I say.

749
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,840
I would have voted with the majority if it was a close vote.

750
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,760
But I agree with the arguments of the minority.

751
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:37,940
You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again.

752
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,660
I got a little confused here because I'm a little confused here.

753
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,300
But I got a little confused here.

754
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,180
But I got a little confused here.

755
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,440
But I'm a little confused here.

756
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,100
But I don't see.

757
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,180
I got a little.

758
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,540
I don't see.

759
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:52,540
I don't see.

760
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,760
I don't see.

761
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,560
Swimming, hoping to swim or not

762
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,160
Got to keep on swimming

763
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,840
Cause I don't want to die

764
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,780
Who built this mess anyway?

765
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,920
Yeah, it's an old park player's turn

766
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,120
But sometimes you can

767
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,620
Use the old switcheroo

768
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,240
And it can be applied to

769
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,240
Frontal politics

770
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,800
What I mean is

771
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,460
Who was it that set up a

772
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,880
A system, supposedly a democratic system

773
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,680
Where you end up always voting

774
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,400
For the lesser of two evils

775
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,140
I mean, was George Washington

776
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,880
The lesser of two evils?

777
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,300
Sometimes I wonder

778
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,040
You got some guy that says

779
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,960
For God's sake, we've got to stop

780
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,220
Having to do this

781
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,520
Having to do this

782
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,020
While he's having violence in this country

783
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:59,260
While he's spending $60,000 a second

784
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,440
Snuffing gooks

785
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,600
I'm a little confused here

786
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,280
I got a

787
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,460
I'm a little confused here

788
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,740
I'm a little confused here

789
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,380
Because I don't see

790
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,160
I got a

791
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,300
I'm a little confused here

792
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,520
The country is coming apart at the seams

793
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,420
Who am I?

794
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,260
Why am I here?

795
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,080
You need to have a present

796
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,200
You need to have a present

797
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,440
And trust

798
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,540
Who am I?

799
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,620
Bill Clinton

800
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,620
Let the president have a shot at it

801
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,420
Let the president have a shot at it

802
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,960
I don't have any experience in creating

803
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,300
The worst public school system in the industrialized world

804
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,240
The most violent crime-driven society in the industrialized world

805
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,240
You have question my patriotism

806
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,260
You even write into the White House

807
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,120
To go into Russia in 69

808
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,760
Went over for American state

809
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,220
I honor your score too

810
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,420
I honor Mr. Uniform

811
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,140
Whoever saw a crowd of peace

812
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,920
And who supported you

813
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,180
But when Joe went around the world

814
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,700
And this attack patriotism

815
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,020
Wrong

816
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,580
Wrong

817
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,960
You're from Connecticut

818
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,020
Named push

819
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,640
You've right to stand party

820
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,980
To attack my trade

821
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,440
I was a poor but I'm country

822
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,940
President who bring the other

823
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,960
Not we've had enough

824
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,300
One of them

825
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,720
Who am I?

826
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,560
Why am I here?

827
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,220
The amount of time the candidates expect in this campaign

828
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,620
Trashing their opponents character

829
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,260
And their programs is depressingly large

830
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,840
We'll be on again Saturday night

831
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,200
Eight to nine o'clock on ABC

832
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:18,740
So

833
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,080
Okay, okay

834
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,060
It's time to love

835
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:21,520
Finally

836
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,400
Eight o'clock finally

837
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:23,840
We've been there, pal

838
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,100
Now

839
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:24,600
Job

840
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,320
Been Vice President Senator Gore

841
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,240
We've been to the Congress together

842
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,360
I've done the job as President

843
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,780
President, you never

844
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,600
What's your role

845
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,660
From time to time

846
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,200
And let me just where I

847
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:36,560
Fire

848
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,000
President Bush

849
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,740
To Malta

850
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:39,920
Time to meet with President

851
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,640
Meeting between President Gore's and Chau

852
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,180
Better than before

853
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,240
Broke out of the gun

854
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,320
The situation resembled the President

855
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,020
I know I made the President

856
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:47,840
The President

857
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,680
The coup was decontented in

858
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,480
The situation ended

859
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,400
So did Warme

860
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:01,880
This is weird

861
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:01,940
Especially like P isolate

862
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:01,940


863
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:01,940


864
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,040
Heende

865
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,040


866
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,740
What did you say about this at all?

867
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,540
Help me

868
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,080
You're still my boss

869
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,260
I am

870
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:12,260


871
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:12,520
Commander

872
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,540
He's sitting

873
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,100
We're the ladies

874
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:16,480
We're the gentleman

875
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,300
Wait it's not

876
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:17,320
Fairy

877
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,120
Yet

878
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:20,340
Then

879
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,160
Do you think

880
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,780
Radboro Poindexter examining long and short-term risk factors.

881
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,860
Vice President Bush drops by.

882
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,700
Elliot Abrams gets a deny.

883
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,980
Ever been at Ollie's Playhouse?

884
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,220
Amarander never told Poindexter to sell Hawks to Iran.

885
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,580
Gomez got withdrawal symptoms at a bank in Switzerland.

886
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,080
Hassan Bush got home for Christmas.

887
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:46,940
Woo-hoo!

888
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,580
Spokesman speaks, says bye-bye.

889
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,460
And he says when we get the dough, it won't review long, yes, you know,

890
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,440
because it came from the eye of your toe.

891
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:00,660
Reagan's in bed, he's always napping.

892
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,800
But even when he gets up, anything can happen.

893
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,080
They're gonna take out Casey's brain, give Casper and Schultzie a pain.

894
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:11,260
It'll be cuckoo, it'll be wacky.

895
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:14,900
He'll be covert at Ollie's Playhouse.

896
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,920
And it's this how I'm gonna stand up for what?

897
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,660
And besides me, wrong beliefs.

898
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,200
My team were about the United States.

899
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,980
Your vice president did the night of the...

900
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,880
How to make a decision.

901
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,980
Bill Clinton states that I've been innocent.

902
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,180
I would have voted with the majority.

903
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,180
It was a close vote.

904
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,180
But I agreed with the arguments of the minority.

905
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:00,740
I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan.

906
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,240
I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan.

907
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,420
I'd like to create more millionaires the old-fashioned way.

908
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,760
They're so heavy, they'd give you, you know, back and broken back.

909
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,520
He would target America.

910
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,160
Target America.

911
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,680
Target America.

912
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,500
Well, I want you to know.

913
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,760
We really appreciate that.

914
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,960
Expanding jobs, going to expanding base.

915
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,320
Right now, a flat job base, and we're going its minimum wage.

916
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,520
To really a base that's going to structure and invest our foreign competitors.

917
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:31,340
We're not.

918
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,300
We, $4 trillion budget and have the future of this country.

919
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,540
The revenue will go through a period of suffice.

920
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:39,920
It's got to be fair.

921
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,720
We've created, we have much to show.

922
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,140
And we have all I can say in a minute.

923
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,360
And I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag.

924
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,600
And I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag.

925
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,560
And I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag.

926
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,680
And I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag.

927
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:56,060
How much longer will it take, Dan, for trickle-down economics to work in your theory?

928
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,840
Well, we're going to have plenty of time to talk about trickle-down government.

929
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,580
What's your point?

930
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,800
Well, I'd like to hear the answer.

931
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,620
But the question is, the question is, which you have failed to address.

932
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,680
And that is, why is Bill Clinton qualified to be President of the United States?

933
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,800
You've talked about Jim.

934
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,160
Well, I'll be happy to answer that.

935
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,360
You've talked about Jim Baker.

936
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,960
You've talked about trickle-down economics.

937
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:14,560
No way.

938
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,460
You've talked about the worst economy in 50 years.

939
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,540
I'll be happy to answer that.

940
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:17,740
You haven't talked about one reason.

941
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,200
I haven't.

942
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:18,600
No question.

943
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,240
You're wrong.

944
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:19,560
You're wrong.

945
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:19,560


946
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,760
I'll be happy.

947
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,360
I'll be happy.

948
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,100
I want to go back and make a point.

949
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,460
Well, you've asked my question.

950
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,660
If you don't answer my question, I will answer yours.

951
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:26,680
I have not answered.

952
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:26,680


953
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,260
I made a...

954
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:33,440
Where have all our heroes gone?

955
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,320
What's come over our great land?

956
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,100
America is still my home.

957
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:49,540
America is still my home.

958
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,120
America is still the home to the people we hold.

959
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:58,440
But where have all our heroes gone?

960
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,180
You have not told us why Bill Clinton is qualified to be President of United States.

961
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,400
I pointed out what he said about the Persian Gulf War.

962
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,700
But let me repeat it for you.

963
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,620
Here's what he said, senator.

964
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,540
You know four words.

965
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,840
I'm making a statement and he can answer.

966
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,320
Now can we give Admiral Stockdale the chance to take a look at this?

967
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:16,680
I can't.

968
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,800
But he said, pal, here's what he said.

969
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:19,540
If I back down my steW Zusch часions, and I say Trump got the task assignment,

970
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:19,540


971
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:19,540


972
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:19,540


973
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:24,440
I mean, this is the Persian Gulf War, the most important event in his political lifetime.

974
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,540
Here's what Bill Clinton said.

975
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,840
If it's a close vote, I vote with the majority.

976
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,460
If it's a close vote, I vote with the minorities.

977
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,540
That qualifies you to be a president.

978
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,600
I say, vote America.

979
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,380
Let's listen very closely to this debate tonight.

980
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,300
I think America is seeing right now the reason this nation is in gridlock.

981
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:44,680
We never would have got there if we'd gone for the nuclear freeze crowd.

982
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,160
We never would have got there if we'd gone for the nuclear freeze crowd.

983
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:06,320
I saw a group of boys the other day standing in the corner of a playground,

984
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,800
looking and laughing at a magazine.

985
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,380
And I overheard one of the boys say, man, is he ever cool.

986
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,060
And he pointed to the man whose picture was on the magazine cover.

987
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,140
And every time he looked at the magazine, he'd say, man, is he ever cool.

988
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,640
And everybody kind of said under their breath, yeah, he's cool, all right.

989
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,280
And I got sick to my stomach.

990
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,340
Because I'd seen the cover.

991
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:32,380
And the man that they were talking about had instigated a riot in one of our major cities last summer.

992
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,560
And the magazine was writing about how the police were unkind to him.

993
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,860
The judges were unfair with him.

994
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,300
And how he talked back and slung his long hair about and cussed and did his thing.

995
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,740
And they made him into a regular hero.

996
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:52,480
And inside this magazine was the story of the baseball player who got involved with the gamblers.

997
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:58,320
Of the football player who said that football was not the end, just a means to an end.

998
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,560
Meaning the girls and the good times.

999
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,480
And a story of the folk singer who proudly claims to be both a member of a party alien to our government

1000
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,680
and a non-taxpaying citizen.

1001
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,080
These young boys read with open eyes and open minds.

1002
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,040
And I thought to myself, my God.

1003
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,520
Are these the people that these young boys look up to?

1004
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,380
Are these their idols?

1005
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,600
Are these the heroes of the now generation?

1006
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,800
Come on in, boys. Let's see what you got here.

1007
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,960
Nothing, nothing can stop us.

1008
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,000
He doesn't like trickle-down government.

1009
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:35,320
And what I don't like is trickle-down government.

1010
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:40,600
And therein, I think Governor Clinton keeps talking about trickle-down, trickle-down, trickle-down.

1011
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,420
And what I don't like is trickle-down, trickle-down government.

1012
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,160
At least you'll understand that I think that's fundamental in our country.

1013
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,380
You're getting into it.

1014
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,420
The word pain.

1015
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,820
The word pain.

1016
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:50,920
The word pain.

1017
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,420
Men's suffering, Jim.

1018
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,120
There have been suffering, Jim.

1019
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,100
It's irrelevant.

1020
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,380
It's irrelevant.

1021
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,000
Why is that a mistake?

1022
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,180
It's irrelevant.

1023
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:00,820
What hit?

1024
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,800
I think it is highly irrelevant.

1025
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:09,180
It's irrelevant.

1026
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,100
He has to do it.

1027
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:12,740
That is the law.

1028
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,640
But I don't think it's fair.

1029
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,200
I don't think it's fair.

1030
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,720
I think we've been fighting for...

1031
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,240
We've been fighting for day one.

1032
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,940
I think we've been fighting for day one.

1033
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,320
Price is time.

1034
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,940
The misery index.

1035
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,780
And all you hear about is how bad things are.

1036
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,100
Are you better off?

1037
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,500
Are you better off?

1038
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,400
Remember the question, are you better off?

1039
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,640
Are you better off?

1040
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:39,380
Everybody now knows the terrible price of pain by waiting until it's obvious to the brain dead that they have problems.

1041
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,560
I don't have any criticism, Mr. Froese.

1042
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,140
I've never heard Governor Clinton make a mistake.

1043
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,680
So my argument is not with Ross Proe.

1044
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,720
It is more with Governor Clinton.

1045
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,580
Everybody's nibbling around the edges.

1046
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,720
Let's go to the center of the bull's eye of the core problem.

1047
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:53,780
I'd rather...

1048
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,800
If you gave me two bad choices...

1049
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,060
Okay.

1050
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,920
I'd rather have people representing foreign countries working on their campaigns.

1051
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:08,100
And I don't think there's anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case.

1052
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,180
That's the American way.

1053
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,380
It's the American way.

1054
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,440
That's the American way.

1055
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,700
It's the American way.

1056
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,800
That's the American way.

1057
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,800
I'd rather have all our heroes gone.

1058
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:24,000
All friends, where have all the...

1059
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,320
Where have all the pledgers gone?

1060
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,660
Our great land.

1061
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,640
Oh, I just don't know what happened.

1062
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,980
I just don't know what happened to the subgeniuses of America.

1063
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,620
I know which ones do count.

1064
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:44,380
That's the ones who pledged tonight.

1065
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,720
And the ones who will pledge next week.

1066
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:47,840
Because we're going to have to do it again.

1067
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:54,400
In the meantime, dear friends, I am going to give you the...

1068
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:55,580
Why...

1069
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,460
The credits.

1070
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,140
What you've been listening to tonight.

1071
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,660
That very last thing.

1072
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:08,220
The collage of the debates called Master Debaters by Dad's New Slacks.

1073
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:13,560
The folks in Portland, Maine who played the hour of slack.

1074
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,740
Dear thanks, Dad.

1075
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,280
There are quite a few little clips.

1076
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:22,720
Thanks to Reverend Susie the Floozy in Atlanta who gave us a lot of those clips.

1077
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:26,900
A lot of clips came from the Lookout Miami media barrage.

1078
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,060
We still don't know who did Lookout Miami.

1079
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,140
Oh, gosh.

1080
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:37,860
Back from the beginning while we heard Jimi Hendrix, Ed Sanders doing some of those political songs.

1081
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,100
The Fugs, that is.

1082
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,680
The Yeasty Girls.

1083
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,720
The Princess We Are So Beautiful.

1084
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:44,720


1085
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,680
The Cardo and Sister Mary Squared show.

1086
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
A little bit of barrage from Dr. Legume.

1087
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:54,620
Friends.

1088
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:04,240
And quite a bit of cuts from WCSB radio in Cleveland where I was a guest on Lonesome Cowboy Dave's show.

1089
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,400
Well...

1090
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,240
Oh, and Ollie's Playhouse.

1091
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:14,000
The song Ollie's Playhouse was by Eugene Chadbourne.

1092
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:25,900
And the amazing George Bush Farewell was by Joe Paulino and Mr. Tokard.

1093
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:31,660
Friends, you've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1094
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:39,320
For more information on Church of the Subgenius, all you've got to do is drop a line to Bob.

1095
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,160
By the way, Emily, Tevis says hi.

1096
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:43,840
Hi.

1097
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,740
If I doubt if you're still listening at this point.

1098
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:59,860
Write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1099
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:07,260
Just drop us a line and see what normally goes on in this normal, normal show.

1100
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,400
Ah, yeah.

1101
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,100
Praise God.

1102
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:13,820
I was a post office.

1103
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:13,820


1104
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:27,500
I got killed because of the welfare inspires, and my apologies on behalf of all the school devices.

1105
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:28,800
Most of them were

1106
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,000
marked in the

1107
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,080
00 résult

1108
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:43,800
of my

1109
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,600
which I consider absolutely sick operation.

1110
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,540
Whose country is this? Whose country is this?

1111
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,280
It's a must-see.

1112
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,420
It was a remarkable event.

1113
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:57,960
We did try to bring Saddam Hussein, Saddam Hussein, Saddam Hussein, Saddam Hussein.

1114
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,840
We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations.

1115
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,820
And what you're seeing on all this Iraq gate

1116
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:08,800
is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war.

1117
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,980
Iraq gate. Iraq gate.

1118
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:17,000
Ladies and gentlemen, directly from the Oasis Lounge in the Sands Hotel,

1119
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,280
here he is, Saddam Hussein-Jerfield.

1120
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,400
Oh, thanks, Johnny.

1121
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,160
I'll tell you, I was okay last month, but now I'm in bad shape.

1122
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,100
Oh, I tell you, I keep trying to move a missile launcher and it gets blown to bits.

1123
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,940
I try to move my tanks and it gets blown to bits.

1124
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,480
Oh, man, I'm afraid to move my bowels.

1125
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,680
Then I said to my wife, Mrs. Hussein, I said,

1126
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,720
Hey, Debbie, what do I got to do to get a rise out of that bush?

1127
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,260
She said, buy me some flowers once in a while.

1128
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,760
Oh, it's like my doctor.

1129
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,340
You know my doctor, Vinny Al-Assad Boombatz?

1130
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,740
Oh, I said, Doc, hey, my missiles keep misfiring and I can't hit the target.

1131
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,340
He said, buy Debbie some flowers once in a while.

1132
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,360
Oh, I don't get no respect at all.

1133
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,560
Hey, hey, where's my Air Force?

1134
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,740
Come on, guys. Hey, I gotta go change the oil in the Gulf.

1135
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,480
Oh, America. Thanks a lot.

1136
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,820
Hey, give me a break.

1137
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:09,160
Come on, call that Ali guy. What's his name?

1138
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,540
Oh, I said to my son, Bud, I said,

1139
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,980
What are you gonna do after the war?

1140
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,680
He said, I'm going to Disney World.

1141
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,320
Oh, God, that America.

1142
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,360
Those guys don't give me no respect.

1143
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,980
I mean, they keep bombing me.

1144
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,760
And all I can do is bomb up here.

1145
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,280
Oh, I'm in bad shape.

1146
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,560
Gate, Iraq, gate.

1147
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,140
Come on, that's not leadership.

1148
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:31,880
George Bush continues to watch Bill Clinton's back in his troubled re-election race.

1149
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,500
And now behind him, Ross Perot's footsteps are getting louder.

1150
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,500
Jim Mikloszewski joins us now from the White House.

1151
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,160
Good morning, Jim.

1152
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:40,560
Good morning, Sarah.

1153
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:45,440
We have predicted that after the presidential debates and the TV campaign win,

1154
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:47,560
there'd be some movement in the polls.

1155
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:51,040
Unfortunately for the president, they're headed in the wrong direction.

1156
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,900
America is still my home sweet home.

1157
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:04,880
But where have all our heroes gone?

1158
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,500
I had heroes when I was a kid.

1159
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,480
We all did.

1160
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,980
And our heroes did their thing, too.

1161
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:17,200
Like General Douglas MacArthur, who returned like he said he would.

1162
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:22,460
Like Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, who chased the bad guys right off the screen.

1163
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,040
Like Lindbergh, who flew the ocean.

1164
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,420
And Jesse Owens, who showed Hitler.

1165
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,000
And John Wayne and Gary Cooper.

1166
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:33,180
After all, didn't they really win the war?

1167
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:39,260
And General Ike, bless your soul, because you made us feel safe.

1168
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,440
We've killed some of our recent heroes.

1169
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,700
The Kennedys and Kings.

1170
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:50,980
And even as great as their space feats are, how many of the astronauts can you name?

1171
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:51,780
Huh?

1172
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:52,720
How many?

1173
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:58,740
My heroes were people like Joe DiMaggio, who proved that nice guys can finish first.

1174
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:02,840
And Stan Musial, who never had an unkind word for anybody.

1175
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:07,460
And Winston Churchill, whose two fingers raised together meant victory.

1176
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,460
Not just to let your enemy have it all.

1177
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:10,460


1178
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:10,480


1179
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,220
A kind of artificial peace.

1180
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,860
This country needs a lot of things today, friends.

1181
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:20,640
But it doesn't need any one thing any more than it needs some real heroes.

1182
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:25,200
Men who know what it means to be looked up to by a grimy-faced kid.

1183
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:29,520
Men who want to sign autographed books and not deals under the table.

1184
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:33,320
Men who are willing to play the game with the people who made them heroes.

1185
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:38,220
Men who don't mind putting on a white hat and saying thank you and please.

1186
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:40,460
I wish I knew more men.

1187
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:47,600
Men that I'd be proud for my son to look up to and say, Daddy, when I grow up, I wanna

1188
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,300
be just like him.

1189
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:54,780
Where have all our heroes gone?

1190
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:06,700
Even Harry Truman didn't have to overcome desire.

1191
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,180
Snap.

1192
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:08,500
Snap.

1193
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,160
She came to my mom.

1194
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,380
I can't believe it.

1195
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,880
Warning, some new information.

1196
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,520
This country's going in the wrong direction.

1197
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:21,040
Vice President, you say we're poised for a vigorous economic recovery.

1198
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:21,960
Why do you say that?

1199
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,640
Because we've had inflation down, interest rates are down.

1200
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,440
I'm welcome to last for three years.

1201
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:36,060
Covered.

1202
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,620
Turn around.

1203
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,920
Farm debt is down.

1204
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,660
Low inflation as well.

1205
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:00,060
Yesterday on another program, on another network.

1206
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,720
Ross Perot is...

1207
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,140
...national debt in the deficit.

1208
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:30,620
He brags about balancing the budget in Arkansas.

1209
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,100
Are you...

1210
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,280
...the Ross Perot supporters?

1211
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,500
When they finally go in, they'll like Ross Perot.

1212
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:42,580
...on ple controller.

1213
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:47,300
Once the market is well targeted and the strategy is established ...

1214
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:47,300


1215
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:47,300


1216
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:47,300


1217
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:47,300


1218
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:47,300


1219
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:47,300


1220
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:47,300


1221
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:11,080
p
