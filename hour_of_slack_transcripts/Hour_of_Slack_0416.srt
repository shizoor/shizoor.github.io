1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:14,140
The veil between the psychic and the physical is wearing thin these days. You know those things

2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:21,620
you see out of the corner of your eye when you're out in the woods at twilight and the shapes that

3
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:29,680
move in the dark spaces under the furniture? The ones that disappear as soon as you turn

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:40,720
to look at them? They're really there. They are hiding under your bed. They live inside the phone

5
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:51,940
wiring. Some of them can get into your head and mutter to you. They want you to believe in them.

6
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:58,600
I assure you that this network will continue to adhere to the high standards we have maintained

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,660
through the years.

8
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:12,940
You are about to participate in a great adventure. You are about to experience the awe and mystery

9
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,300
which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

10
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,580
Power of Swag.

11
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,960
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

12
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,060
We'll be right back.

13
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, yes, dear friends. Once again, we throw together a dangerous show in an hour before

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,660
coming to the station. But it's good because, well, this tonight is our Halloween show.

15
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,240
We're not going to do it on Halloween because, well, you're not going to be listening on

16
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:13,160
Halloween. You'll be out. So will I if I can help it. There's some scary, scary things

17
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:20,920
out there and some scary things coming up. The most scariest of all is the book deadline.

18
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:28,220
Yes. Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon, the new subgenius book, has to be, the text has

19
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,240
to be finished and only.

20
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:45,340
15 days. And yet there are 17 chapters. Every day I have to cut one fifth, 22% of every,

21
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:57,860
each and every page. But it doesn't stop there. No, no. Even beyond that is this news article

22
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,420
here from the Chicago.

23
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:08,260
You can't go to the Chicago Sun-Time says the view from above. From the air, the river

24
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:14,980
looks as if it is filled with toothpicks. They are the logs and debris of the flood.

25
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:24,520
Someone spelled out, hi, Bob, in white sandbags for the National Guard to read as they fly

26
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,660
overhead in helicopters. The sandbags looked as small as sugar cubes from the National

27
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,660


28
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,660


29
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,660


30
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,660


31
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,760
Guard and the Literature Office. The

32
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:29,760


33
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:29,760


34
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,380
These newspapers are from the차

35
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:40,180
chopers. Até a tarde aqui no cose que or will now, is the man with the runs, hisaciolos,

36
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:47,620
and his cellular intellect. People watching the top Yongle Ba

37
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:59,640
Not shave both of you offles there, that's this good-looking cop with a pharmaceutical

38
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,400
Dear friends, it says here, New York, this was from this morning's newspaper, New York,

39
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,540
human embryos are reportedly cloned.

40
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,120
In an experiment believed to be the first of its kind,

41
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,420
a researcher in Washington has cloned human embryos into identical twins or triplets,

42
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,800
according to the New York Times.

43
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,360
Dr. Jerry Hall of George Washington University Medical Center

44
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,020
was trying to devise a method to create more embryos to implant

45
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:33,060
when couples do not produce a sufficient number for in vitro fertilization.

46
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,400
Dr. Hall wrote that by splitting the embryos into twins or triplets or quadruplets,

47
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,080
doctors could try to implant more embryos,

48
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,980
making it more probable that a woman could become pregnant.

49
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,940
Well, that's just fine.

50
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,680
It just means more clones for the clone ritual murders.

51
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,440
The real people can live it up.

52
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,980
Seen here on view screen three.

53
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,100
There they are.

54
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,900
Living it up.

55
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,900
But the clones have to be sacrificed.

56
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,360
What do you think the Challenger explosion was, dear friend?

57
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,040
See you later.

58
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,600
Yes, I'm ready.

59
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,120
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,780
She won't.

61
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,780
She's going to be a champion.

62
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,020
See you later.

63
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,160


64
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,360
See you later.

65
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,740
See you later.

66
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,580
See you later.

67
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,200
Yeah, well, happy Halloween.

68
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,680
The other thing here is Girl Scouts meeting.

69
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,920
OK's altering pledge.

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,200
Girl Scouts will be allowed to pledge service to God, Allah, the Creator,

71
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,140
or to anyone else they please under a measure adopted Saturday

72
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,320
at the organization's national convention.

73
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,580
The measure which takes effect immediately keeps the Girl Scout

74
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,980
promises official wording intact, but allows individual Girl Scouts

75
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,000
to substitute for God another word or words that they consider

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,800
more appropriate to their spiritual beliefs.

77
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,600
However, they have to have spiritual beliefs in order to be Girl Scouts.

78
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:26,080
So the little atheists cannot be Girl Scouts and say and pledge themselves to nothing and no one.

79
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,920
But for them, we would suggest that there's always Bob.

80
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,080
Yes.

81
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,120
There's those little Girl Scouts now.

82
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,300
And here's a little Girl Scout.

83
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,340
Happy Halloween, honey.

84
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,540
Dear friends, or should I say fiends, welcome to Slack to the Future.

85
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,660
I'm the Reverend Susie LaFluzie of the Church of the Subgenius.

86
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,060
I'm the Reverend Susie LaFluzie of the Church of the Subgenius.

87
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,580
And let me tell you, I am full of the spirits of the season.

88
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,100
We've got our slack-o-lantern blazing away here in the studio,

89
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,280
the sweet face of Bob luring like an incandescent foil over his minions.

90
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,480
Ah.

91
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,420
I know it's still kind of early for most of you, but hey, a little daub's will do you.

92
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,320
But you can never get too much Halloween.

93
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,600
Ha!

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,780
It's a subgenius Christmas, that time of year when the normals desperately try to outdo themselves to be weird,

95
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,040
to simulate the very difference between the two.

96
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,580
And it's the same with the

97
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:34,620
Ha!

98
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,160
Ha!

99
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,660
Ha!

100
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:37,660


101
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:37,780


102
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:37,980


103
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,240
I could be with you through and through the Christmas Island Parts,

104
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,240


105
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,240


106
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,240


107
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,200
In my Since 9-11 holiday season, I'm talking, Tu espera's homo...

108
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,460
rampant soul-shaking terror here, friends!

109
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,280
Try dressing up as something truly malevolent,

110
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,600
like Rush Limbaugh or Phyllis Shafley,

111
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,220
or Pat Robertson!

112
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,640
Imagine the absolute unmitigated horror of opening your door to a front porch full of demonic Republicans

113
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,700
or satanic Christian coalition stooges or the hellish harpies of Operation Rescue.

114
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,200
sucking normal vampires are the true terrors because they hold in their clawed

115
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,640
hands the power to destroy reason and freedom. Trick or treat? Ha! The trick is that

116
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,020
there is no treat and it's not just confined to one day of the year, it's a

117
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,620
continuous process. We here in the church not only condone the unusual, we exalt it!

118
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,860
The weirder the better, not just some sham once-a-year nose-putty and fake

119
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,400
fangs weird. We're talking unparalleled down to the double helix abnormality

120
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,760
here. This is our season to howl, dear friends, and how we shout until the

121
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,420
windows break and the moon comes down to shut us up. Halloween can and should be

122
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,860
enjoyed every day of the year. A joyous communion of the grotesque and bizarre. A

123
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,640
celebration of the fact that we subgenie are not normal. So pull up a cobweb

124
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,380
encrusted chair to your electronic heart sides as we present the best of the

125
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:23,380
Halloween season. We've got evil on vinyl, sin on CDs, and terror on

126
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:29,180
tape all for you. And the right rigid Reverend Mike Rowe phone is being

127
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,420
winched down from the rafters where he's been hanging upside down since the last

128
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,440
show, fueling his lovely expanded overman-sized brain with all that

129
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,140
nutritious hobgoblin hemoglobin. So while I'm fixing up that special injection to

130
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:47,960
bring him around, listen to this. And if you're not scared enough, just imagine

131
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,560
you just woke up to find they're building a Baptist church right across

132
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,780
the street from here.

133
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,100
—

134
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,120
I used to believe in monsters

135
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,880
My TV and magazines had monsters

136
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,220
Not I used to dream about them

137
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,600
Never did I ever doubt them

138
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,540
When I was young I used to believe in monsters

139
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,840
Then one day I found out there's a monster

140
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,380
There's a lot of my friends are monsters

141
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,140
There's a great wealth of stories

142
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,240
Great donors and employees

143
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,260
Yes, the day I found out there's a monster

144
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,820
I used to believe in monsters

145
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,020
As a poor fly I was a monster

146
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,920
I always frowned until I found monsters

147
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,200
Found that they're coherent races

148
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,600
Found that we're in human faces

149
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,560
People are more hideous than monsters

150
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,280
The day I found out there are monsters

151
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,000
People are more hideous than monsters

152
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,700
They surprised me

153
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,320
They made me

154
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,640
I was a yokel

155
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,240
I was now with the far-off collection

156
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,860
Pupsies on their backs

157
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,880
No토

158
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,060
Terrifying

159
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,380
Well I certainly wouldn't know

160
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,240
What the heck you're talking about

161
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,160
Lower flesh

162
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,320
Who won

163
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,380
енной

164
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:59,220
rolling. Your heart will bump, your nerves will paralyze, as you shall hear the strangest things

165
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:06,600
that never met your eyes. They're not that strange, Al. Yes, you will travel into the chilling,

166
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:13,460
thrilling, slimy, haunted radio station. Just sign on the dotted line, little boys and girls.

167
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,160
And now you've bought an interest in the Captain Beefheart Beefsteak Mine. There's a beautiful

168
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,660
vein of pure linguine running through these rocks, and I want you boys to have every opportunity to

169
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,480
become shareholders in this money-making... Now don't bother to read it, just sign your name on

170
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,980
the dotted line, and by soon you'll be a beefsteak tycoon. I promise you that.

171
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,640
That's what a dial-a-filo. Actually, Cleve, don't... This is Cleve.

172
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:05,280
I'm the boogeyman, the terrible, horrible boogeyman. I come in the middle of the night and frighten

173
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:13,180
bad little girls like you. Beware, better have a care. I'm going to follow you everywhere.

174
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:20,420
I crawl through the ceiling and the wall and call on bad little girls like you. I'll torture you

175
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,640
and haunt you. I've got you where I want you. I'll torture you and haunt you. I've got you where I want you.

176
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm a victim of my dark and dirty plot. And at the slightest whim, I'll tear you limb from limb.

177
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:36,640
In other words, I'll put you on the spot. Ooh, I'm the boogeyman, the terrible, horrible boogeyman.

178
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,380
I come in the middle of the night and frighten bad little girls like you.

179
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:22,600
I'm the boogeyman, the terrible, horrible boogeyman. I'll torture you and haunt you.

180
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:52,640
I'm the boogeyman, the terrible, horrible boogeyman. I'll torture you and haunt you.

181
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:58,620
Ooh, I'm the boogeyman. Ooh, I'm the boogeyman. Ooh, I'm the boogeyman. Ooh, I'm the boogeyman.

182
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:04,940
Halloween spooks outside my window. Halloween spooks behind the tree.

183
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,660
I wish that the children could see, but I can't find them for the life of me.

184
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,960
And there's Halloween spooks outside my window frame.

185
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:52,640
And there's Halloween spooks outside my window frame.

186
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,580
¶¶

187
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:38,520
¶¶

188
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:38,600
Yes, dear friends.

189
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:38,660
The...

190
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,740
The Plastic Ono Band.

191
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,120
Oh, no, that was...

192
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,720
No, that was Lambert Hendrickson Ross.

193
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,180
Old song, but some wonderful spaz singing.

194
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,220
I enjoy spaz singing.

195
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,780
Sent in there by Princess We Are Doe

196
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:14,120
of the Association of Consciousness Exploration

197
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,940
up there in Cleveland,

198
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,020
where they're listening on WCSB,

199
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,180
a noble station,

200
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,200
a truly noble station,

201
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,940
El Bon Noble DNA Level C.

202
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,640
Because, you know, my friends,

203
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,720
the wicked spirits are powerful,

204
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,580
and the Elder Gods are intent on keeping men,

205
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,900
yetis, and rebel gods from out-evolving them

206
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,440
while they sleep,

207
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,440
and beating them to slack.

208
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,480
So, the Elder Gods sleep with the sleep of one eye open,

209
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,640
interfering with our development

210
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,100
from the bottomless pit between the dimensions,

211
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,900
and pushing our cultures toward mass human sacrifice

212
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,940
so as to pry open the Cleoaphe,

213
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,700
opening their doorway.

214
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,800
They can see everything on Earth

215
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,180
and exert imprecise forces toward us,

216
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,340
even to the point of physical externalization.

217
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,220
They drive people crazy by whispering into their brains

218
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,740
instructions, nonsense,

219
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,320
false cosmic revelations,

220
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,460
murder directives, etc.

221
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,840
But they must operate through a veil,

222
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,720
a borderland populated by their lesser agents

223
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,420
who descend to Earth to keep us in fear and confusion.

224
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,340
The ghosts, invisible whirlers, UFOs, Deiros, fears,

225
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:50,320
and the like.

226
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,880
Zones, poltergeists, green energy demons, and so on.

227
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,420
They automatically dampen those brains

228
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,800
which become curious about them.

229
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,440
They also curse objects, texts, music, even thoughts

230
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,060
by planting psychic booby traps

231
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,980
which bring on a weird causational sickness

232
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,640
on the physical plane.

233
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,340
It is much easier for them to cause depression and madness

234
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,300
in normal life,

235
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,540
worse than in subgenie,

236
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,820
whose brains move in a more slippery way.

237
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,820
When the brain is uncentered and blunted,

238
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,540
like a normal's,

239
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,480
they can cause waves of irritation

240
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,500
during which trivial things seem much worse than they are

241
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,560
and provoke so-called senseless violence.

242
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,720
Yes, so-called, dear friends.

243
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,300
The Elder Gods are allied with the negative gods.

244
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,580
The Elder Gods of the negative time stream,

245
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:02,820
both of them seeking to sap the slack force of our universe.

246
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,820
They set in motion a plan which may soon come to fruition.

247
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,900
There is a gate which they themselves closed,

248
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,180
but which they timed to open at the time intersection

249
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,400
in the 22nd century.

250
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,240
If the Mayat current from the backwards time dimension

251
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,400
fuses with the Horus current

252
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,540
from the post-Exodus conspiracy false church,

253
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,320
as they hope,

254
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,580
it will annihilate all matter and energy

255
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,240
from this time continuum.

256
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,000
The conspiracy,

257
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,720
both through global efforts and tiny fringe cults

258
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,920
like the Black Sect of Tibet,

259
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,120
is trying to open little gateways,

260
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,380
so-called, for communion with the Elder Gods.

261
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,520
They actually want to awaken

262
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,120
and free these beings.

263
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,800
All modern-day releases of electromagnetic and nuclear energy

264
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,500
help weaken the seal on the bottomless pit.

265
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:03,140
A nuclear war with ensuing release of souls

266
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,880
into a radioactive medium

267
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,420
would create an etheric earthquake

268
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,080
that would snap the Elder Gods

269
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,240
into full consciousness and manifestation,

270
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,520
negating our reality.

271
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,500
Already they have their code of conduct

272
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,680
and their collective foot in the door.

273
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,460
Hence, all world chaos.

274
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,940
Although nothing can halt the time intersection,

275
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,060
we may be able to help the Rebel Gods

276
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,400
to alter its equation,

277
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,300
so that the opening is too thin

278
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,160
for the Elder Gods to get through.

279
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,040
It is a race, my friends,

280
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,040
for if anyone but the Exes gain control on X-Day,

281
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,420
the seal on the bottomless pit

282
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,040
will be sufficiently weakened

283
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,220
to allow the utter disintegration

284
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,760
of the entire.

285
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,440
Cosmos.

286
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,180
When the sleeping wake,

287
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,840
those now living will not die,

288
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,520
and those now dead shall stumble

289
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,260
through the cities of madness,

290
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,780
whirling electromagnetic energy

291
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,320
during the night of bomb.

292
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,120
The book shall be rewritten.

293
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,380
Its pages scrawled with the terrifying writ

294
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,320
of the child that has come.

295
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,280
Best as happening in 3.2 billion years.

296
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,740
Someone must be there to help that child.

297
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,900
Our bodies are the Luminati.

298
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,220
No power, no power,

299
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,540
let's give the only movement

300
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:43,540


301
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:43,540


302
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:43,680
force.

303
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,100
A maning force,

304
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,700
with themind,

305
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,420
to absorb thebirth.

306
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:46,660
below.

307
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,160
I could find a turn up the grapevine hill.

308
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,680
I hadn't met a truck after rolling still.

309
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,360
Tried to cut between two headlights there till I found out

310
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,180
there was a matching pair.

311
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,260
I lived my life over just before the crash

312
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,960
if a chance ever took me. Went by in a flash.

313
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,900
I smelled rubber burning and I heard gravel whine.

314
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,820
A little voice said, Charlie, end of the line.

315
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,700
While the crash was echoing across the plains,

316
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,160
it was tidy enough, my last remains.

317
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,060
Before you could say, Brody, you're oversized pot,

318
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,700
I was down here shoveling and it's mighty hot.

319
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,840
The devil standing there with a pointed tail

320
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,420
was cracking a whip at his worst jail.

321
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,260
He had little black horns on top of his head,

322
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,900
his teeth were green and his eyes were red.

323
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,760
He hated to see a man out of work.

324
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,240
He kept things stern, you couldn't shirt.

325
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,120
We're really jumping in a lower level joint.

326
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,800
If you didn't understand, you soon got the point.

327
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,020
It's not dull down here, he says to me.

328
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,800
This is the hot rod section, we're full, you see.

329
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,400
A new batting line, a new batting line.

330
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,340
That's today and more tomorrow.

331
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,120
That guy over there keeps yelling for Laura.

332
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,240
Tell Laura I love her.

333
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,820
Aw, shut up.

334
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,800
Shut up.

335
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,980
Based for loot to buy a ring for his chick,

336
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,660
he should have went to work, his tires were slick.

337
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,500
He was pouring on the cold, his spinners were a-humming.

338
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,620
I had the fire good and hot,

339
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,540
because I knew he was a-coming.

340
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,680
Back then, I'm sure I was with an eagle on his back,

341
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,260
totaled out his cycle on the Cadillac.

342
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,080
An ash rambler guy we called second gear,

343
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,640
finally got in high, and he landed here.

344
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,280
I kept pouring into Hades in a steady stream,

345
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,960
when I woke up from this awful dream.

346
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,100
I called my pop and said,

347
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,500
you can quit drinking, because I'm jacking up

348
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,520
with that hot rod Lincoln.

349
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,320
Ooh, boy.

350
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,580
That's just a little bit of what makes Halloween

351
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,200
so special for us subgeniuses.

352
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,300
Oh, the wonderful musical lore.

353
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,800
We just heard a little snippet from Plan 9 from Outer Space,

354
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,560
truly a million dollar monster classic.

355
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,460
Then we heard Monsters by the Pink Lincolns,

356
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,800
who are going to be here Halloween night,

357
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,820
somewhere, I'm not sure yet.

358
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,600
After that was a 1934 tune called Boogeyman

359
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,780
by Todd Rollins and Chick Bullock

360
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,520
from a wonderful CD called Halloween Something or Other.

361
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,160
London Dungeon by the Misfits,

362
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,160
and that last night,

363
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,460
I remember it's from 1961,

364
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,860
Charles Ryan and the Timberline Riders

365
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,220
doing Hot Rod Hades,

366
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,560
their answer to what happens after the Hot Rod Lincoln wreck.

367
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,200
But, oh, friends,

368
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,980
it looks like Mike's coming around.

369
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,800
Wakey, wakey!

370
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,980
Oh, yes.

371
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,140
Oh, yes.

372
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:35,560
Oh, hi.

373
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,880
Yes, uh, yes, Sister Susie.

374
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,140
Broadcasting system under affiliated stations.

375
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,340
Oh, wait. No, no.

376
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,980
We have to stop it there, because it's a funny little bit.

377
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,980
It's coming up, and I'll play that on the side, too, of show.

378
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,720
Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack show.

379
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,280
Once again, a show put together at the last minute,

380
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:01,180
and partly consisting of pieces from the New Testament,

381
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,320
you might say, of the Subgenius Church.

382
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,900
In fact, I've brought, oh, where is it?

383
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:12,040
Yes, I've brought in the contents page,

384
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,860
so I can tell some of you Subgenius fanatics just what's in it.

385
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,680
Actually, it's almost all described on the, uh,

386
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,540
at the end of the prescriptures in the first book,

387
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,400
where it says what we did not put in this book.

388
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,060
If you look back there, that's pretty much what this is.

389
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,620
Uh, we, there's, uh,

390
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,160
chapter one, of course, starts with the pitch,

391
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,780
followed by the fine print, and it's truly fine.

392
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,120
Chapter two, the 10,001 essences of Bob.

393
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,260
Which is inspiring.

394
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,560
Chapter three, on the conspiracy,

395
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,900
which will make you mad and very depressed.

396
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,360
Chapter four, the lost gospels of Bob.

397
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,980
In this case, the gospel according to Philodrummond.

398
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,660
Chapter five, Mondo Connie, for women only.

399
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,020
I haven't even been able to read it.

400
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,620
Chapter six, Man and the Subgenius.

401
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,400
It's a racist, or a speciesist, you might say.

402
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,260
I shouldn't say racist.

403
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,960
It's a speciesist tragedy.

404
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,200
It's a fact.

405
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,340
Uh, seven, birth of the true butants.

406
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,400
The subgenius creation myth.

407
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,520
Original sex among the yetis of mutantists.

408
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,560
Uh, chapter eight, there's only one,

409
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,360
there is only one sin.

410
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,580
It's a list of sins and temptations.

411
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,380
Chapter nine, heaven and hell.

412
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,440
We've been reading on that.

413
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,960
We've been reading on that the last couple of weeks.

414
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,240
Uh, chapter 11, UFOs, gods, and monsters.

415
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,680
That's been tonight.

416
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,260
And chapter 11, Exodus.

417
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,860
Also does survival instructions for before and after the end of the world.

418
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,740
Uh, history of the future and prescriptures.

419
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,080
Uh, God happens.

420
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,980
Victory through hate.

421
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,800
Cosmic slack versus cosmic pain.

422
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,140
And your mission should you choose to accept it.

423
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,880
Which is a list of compulsory activities for exploiting your abnormality.

424
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,140
Uh, things to see, say, and do, one might say.

425
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,800
Uh, followed at the very end by the epistles.

426
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,500
Uh, advice and instructions, dogma and forbidden sciences.

427
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:19,440
Rituals, chants, numerology, and uh, Bobby-hating material.

428
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,640
So, uh, well it looks like our side is about done here.

429
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,220
And I'm afraid I, well things are different around the station here.

430
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,220
I'm gonna be forced to play this.

431
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,840
And has this ever happened to you?

432
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,920
You're at home.

433
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,700
You're going to sleep.

434
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,760
You wake up.

435
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,780
Your shoes are gone.

436
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,360
And you're away on business and you reach for your rubbers.

437
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,060
They're gone.

438
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,720
Hello, I'm Andy Kapt of the Freida Heights Citizens Foot Police with a device that will

439
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,660
halt this unwanted theft of your feet coverings.

440
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,820
The club foot.

441
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:02,260
Just put the club foot by your shoes as you turn in for the evening.

442
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,540
Would-be rubber-rabbers see the club foot.

443
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,480
And want no part.

444
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,080
Of your feetly belongings.

445
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,640
The club foot.

446
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,160
The club foot.

447
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:17,600
Fools would be bony thieves into thinking your whole foot locker is for the handicapped.

448
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,520
It's bedtime.

449
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,000
Do you know where your shoes are?

450
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,200
Better get the club foot.

451
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,120
Now.

452
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:24,920
Now.

453
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,840
Now.

454
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,400
He searched the land in this restless land.

455
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:52,140
harbor devotee while l'm in the middle of them to

456
00:29:52,140 --> 00:30:05,480
leave what

457
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,280
Well, we continue now

458
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,480
with this special...

459
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,500
Now, we have to reiterate,

460
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,260
this is only a Halloween special.

461
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,480
This was broadcast originally on WREK, Atlanta.

462
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,600
Sister Susie the floozy sent in this tape of this show

463
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,920
that she did with this fellow coming up,

464
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,780
Reverend Mike Rofone, with his report.

465
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,320
Thank you.

466
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,600
Columbia Broadcasting System and its affiliated stations

467
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,540
present Orson Welles and the Mercury Theatre on the Air

468
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,240
in The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells.

473
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,700
Is anything happening?

474
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,220
I mean, will they...

475
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,080
Will you turn the right knobs?

476
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,040
I mean, we're on the air.

477
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,220
Is that good?

478
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,820
Oh, you say we're getting there.

479
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,660
Oh, fine.

480
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,440
Any minute now.

481
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,480
I'm sorry.

482
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:36,480


483
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:36,480


484
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:36,480


485
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,000
Ladies and gentlemen, we regret the technical difficulties.

486
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,300
We are coming to you live now from the Sperm Bank Science Center

487
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,660
in DeKalb County, Georgia,

488
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,720
where we are about to observe a night deposit

489
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,480
which is going to be made by men from Planet X

490
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,660
in Dimension X, Zip Code Y, Subsection Z.

491
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,400
We are standing by, awaiting the deposit.

492
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,440
I don't know where to begin.

493
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,360
Enter your word, take the same thing before my eyes.

494
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,080
That's something out of a modern Arabian night.

495
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,020
Well, I just got here.

496
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,200
I haven't had a chance to look around yet.

497
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,780
I guess that's it.

498
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,660
Yes, I guess that's the thing directly in front of me,

499
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,700
half buried in a vast pit.

500
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,920
Must have sucked with terrific force.

501
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,120
The ground is covered with splinters of a tree.

502
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,820
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are standing by the fire extinguisher

503
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,320
outside of the bathroom near the janitor's closet,

504
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,780
and something is happening.

505
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,540
It's...

506
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,940
It's a terrifying thing, ladies and gentlemen.

507
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,060
A night deposit is being made in the sperm bank

508
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,260
by men from Planet X, Dimension X,

509
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,520
and thousands of, thousands of saucers are landing outside.

510
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,980
We see them coming down like little drops of dew,

511
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,560
and little children are catching them on their tongues,

512
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,880
and it's an amazing sight.

513
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,440
I can't explain it.

514
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,140
They're coming down. There's thousands of them.

515
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,940
Oh, the humanity of it all, ladies and gentlemen.

516
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,500
The humanity of it all.

517
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,420
They're like jet-flying things in the mirror,

518
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,680
and they're basically advancing men.

519
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,440
Strike them head-on.

520
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,300
They're turning into flames.

521
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,200
Now the whole field's caught up by the woods.

522
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,900
The fires are...

523
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,040
They're gas-packed, blanked, and the automobiles are spreading everywhere.

524
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,260
Telling you, 20,000, about 20 yards to my right.

525
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,240
Ladies and gentlemen, we regret the interruption of that broadcast.

526
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,540
We switch you now live to Conyers, Georgia,

527
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,000
in a field right outside of Grover's Farm,

528
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,680
where some cattle are in the process of being mutilated by...

529
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,240
We have just been informed by authorities

530
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,860
that are connected with the Church of the Subgenius

531
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:51,780
that these are the same denizens that are expected to be arriving on...

532
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,440
...1998 to fry all...

533
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,420
...quote, to fry all normals.

534
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,520
We're standing by.

535
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,780
Eighteen cattle so far have been lifted...

536
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,960
...through some kind of device into the hovering craft that's just above us.

537
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:18,640
Someone is on the scene from a local television station trying to communicate with them.

538
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,300
And the Virgin Mary has appeared, ladies and gentlemen.

539
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:29,140
The Virgin Mary has appeared, and she is being taken aboard the craft.

540
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,180
It's indescribable, ladies and gentlemen.

541
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,440
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Orson Swells.

542
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,960
Out of character to assure you that these happenings have no further significance

543
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,100
than is the holiday offering they were intended to be.

544
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,840
WREK's own version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush,

545
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:04,980
and then...

546
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,720
...cutting your head off and disemboweling you

547
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,660
and wrapping your intestines around a telephone pole.

548
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,220
Starting now, we couldn't do that to all of you by tomorrow night,

549
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,700
so we did the next best thing.

550
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,700
We annihilated the entire world,

551
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,500
your entire concept of what the future will hold for you

552
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,700
before your very ears, an utterly destroyed WREK.

553
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,100
You will be relieved, I am sure, to learn that we didn't mean it

554
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,980
and that both institutions are still open for business, unfortunately.

555
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,040
So, goodbye everybody, and remember please for the next day or so

556
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,120
the terrible lesson you have learned tonight.

557
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,480
That glowing, grinning, globular invader of your living room

558
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,680
is an inhabitant of the pumpkin patch,

559
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,340
and if your doorbell rings and no one's there,

560
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:53,360
that was no Martian, it was a man from Dimension X.

561
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,820
Over the rooftops and down, down, down

562
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,680
to the edge of the great misty swamp,

563
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,560
where they called the ancient creatures of Halloween Eve.

564
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,040
And soon, they began to arrive,

565
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,580
all the scary, weird, glittering, half-invisible, glimmering, shivery creatures.

566
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,040
There were banshees, and hobgoblins, and werewolves, and trolls,

567
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,420
and monsters, and vampires, and scary spirits, it's impossible to describe.

568
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,720
And as the unearthly horde,

569
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,680
they gathered, they filled the great misty swamp

570
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,820
with a sound of terror, and a chill descended upon this Halloween Eve.

571
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,100
Well, we don't have any cows!

572
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,700
The tale-bearer will be at the judgment.

573
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,280
I suspect that here will be a special place in hell for such beings.

574
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,220
David the Psalmist said in Psalms 15, 1 and 3,

575
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,500
Lord, who may abide in thy tabernacle,

576
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,900
who may dwell on thy holy mountain,

577
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,980
the man of blameless life,

578
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:08,360
who does that which is right, and speaks the truth from his heart,

579
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,420
who has no malice on his tongue,

580
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,560
who never wrongs a friend, and tells no tale against his neighbor.

581
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:21,120
At the judgment, there will be those who with their malicious tongue

582
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,620
have destroyed the lives and reputation of others.

583
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,480
These gossipers will be cast into the Lord's hands.

584
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,160
The lowest, darkest pit of eternity.

585
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,500
Call the next defendant.

586
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,200
Kay Bridges to the bar.

587
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,820
The End

588
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,440
The End

589
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,860
The End

590
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,620
The End

591
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,640
The End

592
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,400
Silence, Kay!

593
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,780
Yes, your hands are covered with the blood of a thousands of souls that you have murdered.

594
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,540
Murdered?

595
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,080
But I never murdered anyone.

596
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,920
Not with a sword.

597
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,440
But you have sentenced a thousand souls to hell with your malicious tongue.

598
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,360
It would have been a thousand times better

599
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,580
had you murdered them with a sword.

600
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,220
Oh, no.

601
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,080
But I never said anything about anyone except what was true.

602
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,980
I only spoke the truth.

603
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,380
No, Kay.

604
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,100
You spoke that which you wanted to be true.

605
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,860
But granting that you did only speak the truth,

606
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,140
who gave you license to defame and destroy the character of others?

607
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,940
The serpent with his venom and his ire,

608
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,620
with his slimy, slithery foes and his noiseless crawl,

609
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,700
with his deadly call and fatal fang,

610
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,200
is the only fit emblem of the man or woman

611
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,080
who stabs and kills the character of another.

612
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,800
Let your own words condemn you.

613
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,520
May 10, 1973.

614
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,880
Linda's been such a good friend in spiritual health.

615
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,760
Well, when you've known her as long as I have,

616
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,500
you'll really get to know her.

617
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,000
What do you mean?

618
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,440
She's not as concerned about your spiritual life

619
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:17,680
as you are about her.

620
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:17,940
What do you think?

621
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,800
But I'm not one to say anything.

622
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,180
You just call me when you need advice.

623
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,100
Well, I've got a lot to do.

624
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,680
I have to go.

625
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:28,880
Goodbye.

626
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:31,740
Goodbye.

627
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,900
Well, I didn't think being a Christian was going to be like that.

628
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,540
I don't believe I want any part of it.

629
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:42,900
Oh, no.

630
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,560
Oh, my God.

631
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,440
My God, have mercy on me.

632
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,680
I never realized.

633
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,040
Have mercy on me.

634
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,080
You, Kay, with your gossipy tongue,

635
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,680
have driven the babes away from my church.

636
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:03,080
You have in your lifetime destroyed the weak among my flock.

637
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,740
You never knew what it meant to show mercy.

638
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,160
Would you dare ask this court of mercy?

639
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,340
There is no mercy for you.

640
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,660
You are sentenced to hell where you will want to be haunted

641
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,420
forever by the souls you sent there.

642
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:16,680
No.

643
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,880
I don't want to go to hell.

644
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,280
You can't send me to hell for something I didn't know.

645
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,600
I didn't know.

646
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,360
I only repeated what I heard.

647
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,140
You didn't know that the most fearful of all crimes

648
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,920
is the crime of gossip.

649
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,200
Your record will speak for itself.

650
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,260
April 7th, 1970.

651
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,420
You, did you not sue?

652
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,180
Go unto the subgeniuses and mock them

653
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,280
and pay not your dues?

654
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,180
Your mighty $20 going up to 30 one year from today?

655
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:57,480
Uh, no, Kay, whatever your name is,

656
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:03,120
you must be sentenced indeed to face the future.

657
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,000
They're going to put you back on earth

658
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,620
and let you live amongst the Yucatismas.

659
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,540
You know, dear friends,

660
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,600
if the exes come and find a planet,

661
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:17,680
you know, dear friends, if the exes come and find a planet,

662
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,280
full of pinks,

663
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,980
they'll spray the planet for humans

664
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,260
just as we would throw our parasite-ridden dog

665
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,160
into a bath of flea dip.

666
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,760
If the anti-exes, the Yucatismas,

667
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,340
arrive on earth first,

668
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,140
they will reduce the planet to cinders

669
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,760
and probably literally, physically rape it,

670
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,960
no matter who is in charge.

671
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:52,820
For the Yucatismas are almost at the godlike level of the exes,

672
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,600
but are entirely material.

673
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,560
In fact, they are machines,

674
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,560
evolved machines,

675
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:04,060
purely mechanoid and soulless.

676
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:09,800
No one knows whether or not there ever was anything one could call life

677
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,780
inside the Yucatismas,

678
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,800
but they display such maliciousness

679
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,600
that it's hard not to assume there's some perverse,

680
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,700
guiding intelligence.

681
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,280
The Yucatismas aren't merely efficient killing machines,

682
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,320
they're implacable,

683
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,140
deliberately cruel killing machines.

684
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,140
They delight in tearing things up.

685
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,420
That's their equivalent of sex.

686
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,760
Theirs can't just be a cold cybernautic intelligence,

687
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,520
they're meaner than any computer could be.

688
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,280
Which implies a soul,

689
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,620
albeit

690
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:49,400
a black or negative soul.

691
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,340
Being super material,

692
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:57,680
the Yucatismas are the opposite of the Elder Gods,

693
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,020
but function as their hired mercenaries.

694
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:05,080
In size, they are miles tall.

695
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,980
Their feet alone could crush entire cities.

696
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:14,800
They can shed millions of what are to them fleas,

697
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,600
but which are to us monstrous,

698
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,900
mechanoid combinations of Predator,

699
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:19,540
Alien,

700
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,440
Terminator,

701
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,780
and Velociraptor,

702
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,700
all rolled into one to the tenth power,

703
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,900
bristling with chainsaws,

704
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,020
razor blades,

705
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,760
machine cannons,

706
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,600
and can openers.

707
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,440
Enough of them could take anything apart,

708
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,280
even a small star.

709
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,580
The Yucatismas are able to transform themselves into energy

710
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,600
for traveling between stars and galaxies,

711
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,680
but they have to recharge on life force.

712
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,820
That is when they are most hazardous,

713
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,380
for theirs is a victim-powered,

714
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,500
faster-than-light drive.

715
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,500
For them, stopping for gas is causing a sun to explode,

716
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,820
and as the heat wave destroys the biospheres around it,

717
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,240
the Yucatismas suck all the souls through their intakes

718
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,680
and blow them out the exhaust,

719
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,160
careening off to the next star.

720
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,580
One Yucatisma can tap a fire,

721
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,740
and they can get to one solar output per unit.

722
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,900
Collectively, they probably require the equivalent

723
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,960
of a dozen large spiral nebulae a day.

724
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,180
There must be that much dissolution,

725
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,800
pain, and destruction for them to thrive

726
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,260
and maintain the collective Yucatisma energy.

727
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,960
It's lucky for us that they've been dismantling

728
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,340
other reaches of the galaxy.

729
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,000
The strange galactic upheavals spied by astronomers

730
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,940
mark the spots where they've already trashed

731
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:49,620
the cores of galaxies just for fun.

732
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:55,820
And nothing, nothing can make the Yucatismas stop.

733
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,820
They exist only to take other things apart

734
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,180
and build crueler, colder, and harder

735
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,180
Yucatismas out of them.

736
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,000
They turn whole planets into machines

737
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,060
that tear each other into tiny particles.

738
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:13,060
They won't quit until they've taken everything apart.

739
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,480
They are a destructive force so powerful,

740
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,320
it has become a creative force.

741
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,540
They cannot merely make things seize,

742
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,160
but must break them down and remake them

743
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,060
into ever bigger Yucatismas,

744
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,360
capable of decimating even larger things

745
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,080
and making themselves yet faster,

746
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,780
and so on and on for perpetuity.

747
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:40,600
The concept of souls apparently irritates the Yucatismas.

748
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,740
They don't like intangibles, unquantifiables,

749
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,940
but they relish human hate.

750
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,100
That's something they can understand.

751
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,320
They find they can be much more destructive

752
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,860
while high on compressed hate.

753
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,540
Only a very few megabredes of hate

754
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,720
can inspire a single Yucatisma

755
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,560
to level the central part of a galaxy.

756
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,880
Unfortunately, whereas the Exes prefer their soul refined

757
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,000
and delivered by Bob in little cylinders,

758
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:16,240
the Yucatismas are wont to run berserk

759
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,600
across the face of a planet,

760
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,400
literally sucking and nobbling the fear and hate

761
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,760
out of the inhabitants,

762
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,740
geometrically increasing their fear.

763
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:32,280
The better for the Yucatismas to feed.

764
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,860
Listenopolis

765
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:15,260
She was with that Jackie White mama

766
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,560
I killed them both

767
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,000
And they're buried under Jenkins' sycamore

768
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,560
You think I'm psycho, don't you, mama?

769
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,300
Mama, pour me a cup

770
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,800
You think I'm psycho, don't you, mama?

771
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,380
Get better, let them lock me up

772
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:46,180
Don't hand me Johnny's pup, mama

773
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,640
Cause I might squeeze him too tight

774
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,320
I'm having crazy dreams again, mama

775
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,980
So let me tell you about last night

776
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,680
I woke up in Johnny's room, mama

777
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,360
Standing right there by his bed

778
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,840
With my hands around his throat, mama

779
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,200
Wishing both of us were dead

780
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,780
You think I'm psycho, don't you, mama?

781
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,380
I just killed Johnny's pup

782
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,960
You think I'm psycho, don't you, mama?

783
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,460
Get better, let them lock me up

784
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:43,120
You know that little girl next door, mama

785
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,560
I believe her name was Daddy The Mama

786
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,260
Oh, don't tell me that she's dead, mama

787
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:55,920
Cause I just saw her in the bar

788
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:02,420
We were sitting on the bench, mama

789
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,140
Thinking up a game to play

790
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,360
It seems I was wrong to keep you on my mind

791
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:09,360


792
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:09,360


793
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:09,360


794
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:09,360


795
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:09,360


796
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:15,300
Holding a wrench, mama, and then my mind just walked away.

797
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,680
You think I'm psycho, don't you, mama?

798
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,460
I didn't mean to break your cup.

799
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,860
You think I'm psycho, don't you, mama?

800
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,500
Oh, mama, why don't you get up?

801
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,900
Whoa, pretty scary there, dear friends.

802
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,660
That's, uh, uh, who did that?

803
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,120
Well, we don't know.

804
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,860
Reverend Susie the Flusie got that tape, played it on her show.

805
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,140
I played it on my show, but we don't know.

806
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:01,600
We just don't know, but we can sure figure out something.

807
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:09,000
Because you are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

808
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,940
From here in beautiful Dallas, Texas.

809
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:17,460
And, uh, we'd like you to write away for free information from Bob.

810
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,680
Yes, you can learn a lot more about the beings on the other side.

811
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,540
The other side of everything.

812
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,740
And I'm about to give you that post office box number.

813
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,040
Please take that pen and pencil.

814
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:36,140
Why, you know, a self-addressed stamped envelope would really get you the fastest service.

815
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,320
And just write to...

816
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:46,400
Bob at post office box 140306.

817
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:50,880
That's P.O. Box 140306.

818
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,200
In Dallas, Texas.

819
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:58,780
75214.

820
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,120
75214.

821
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,420
Ah, so, so, what a lovely number.

822
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,840
I like to say that so much, but I'm going to shut up and just let you listen.

823
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,300
To Doctors for Bob.

824
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,280
Here in the background for a minute, because they're Doctors for Bob.

825
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:04,960
Here in the background for a minute.

826
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,180
Here in the background for a minute.

827
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:08,180


828
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:08,180


829
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:08,180


830
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:11,500
They warned me that I didn't listen.

831
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:15,580
They put it ahead and tried to fright me.

832
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:24,320
They said just one time, it won't hurt you.

833
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,000
What?

834
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,080
That ain't a lie, do me.

835
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,120
Ah!

836
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:32,540
Ah!

837
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,400
So that's our background track, huh?

838
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,480
Yeah, what I need.

839
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,680
Herb Alpert at 16.

840
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,460
What I need to do is make a...

841
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,100
I don't know what...

842
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,760
This is soundtrack for Cleve walking home.

843
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,260
Light it.

844
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,520
The lonely Cleve walking home late at night.

845
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,860
He's had, well, you might say, one too many.

846
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:13,900
And suddenly...

847
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,260
Oh!

848
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,520
He ran into the brick wall.

849
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,620
Oh, my head.

850
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,180
What happened?

851
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,000
Where am I?

852
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:28,000
The last thing I remember, I was trying my first hit of frog.

853
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,760
Oh, what has it done to me?

854
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,480
I never should have joined the church.

855
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,340
It was...

856
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,220
It was...

857
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,200
There's only one thing left to do.

858
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,340
I must kill Bob.

859
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,280
Yes, yes, that's the answer.

860
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:03,440
It is my duty to kill Bob.

861
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,540
In fact, just to prove to Bob that he's his own master,

862
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:17,040
he informed him defiantly that he'd be taking his first acid trip that very day.

863
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:18,940
Bob was disturbed.

864
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,460
What was happening to Chuck and the others?

865
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:22,260
Simple.

866
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,300
Acid.

867
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,020
LSD.

868
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,320
What is the truth about it?

869
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,080
The real truth.

870
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,860
Maybe it isn't so bad.

871
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,500
Bob decided to find out, not from being told by anyone else,

872
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,820
Cole or Kahn.

873
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,780
He'd make his own inquiries.

874
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:48,160
The library provided ample scientific information about the drug itself.

875
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,180
The surgic acid diethylamide, 25,

876
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:55,060
was first synthesized in Switzerland in 1938

877
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:58,080
by a biochemist, Dr. Albert Hoffman,

878
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,020
while studying a parasitic fungus that attacked European rice fields.

879
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,660
And speaking of parasitic funguses,

880
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,080
I said it doesn't make any sense.

881
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,480
I tried.

882
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,280
Jesus never showed up.

883
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,020
In the desert?

884
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:12,580
Yeah.

885
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:13,280
Wow.

886
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,500
Yeah, sure.

887
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,480
But Jesus never showed up.

888
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,520
It ended up doing us thinking about dinosaurs, as usual.

889
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,520
And naked women.

890
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,380
Not at the same time.

891
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,480
Naked dinosaur women.

892
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,800
This all happened in the year 1661.

893
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:28,940
Bill?

894
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:29,340
Bill?

895
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:29,700
Bill?

896
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:30,260
Bill?

897
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:30,840
Bill?

898
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:31,760
Bill?

899
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:32,320
Bill?

900
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:32,700
Bill?

901
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:33,200
Bill?

902
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,140
Bill?

903
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:34,200


904
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:34,200


905
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:34,920
Bill?

906
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:34,920


907
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:34,920


908
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:34,940
Bill?

909
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:34,940


910
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:34,940


911
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:34,940


912
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:34,940


913
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:34,940


914
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:34,940


915
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:34,940


916
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:34,940


917
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,300
Bill?

918
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:36,300


919
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:38,440
Bill?

920
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:45,440
Will?

921
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,120
Bill?

922
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:58,120


923
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:58,120


924
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:58,120


925
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:58,120


926
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:58,120


927
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:58,120


928
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:58,200
Bill?

929
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:58,700
Pearl button!

930
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,100
For kids, calm down.

931
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,740
nothing evident will be here in just a minute.

932
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,840
What are the books?

933
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,940
Mine are about Andes.

934
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,440
I'm sure it was on forever.

935
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,040
And what about Philo, too?

936
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,840
Okay, figuring Philo machine now.

937
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,160
Beep.

938
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:15,880
Ah!

939
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,580
Is this the Philo drumming triangulation device?

940
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:22,900
I'm afraid so. These are Philo's ashes.

941
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:27,260
Well, this whole bank of instruments seems to be calibrated by Guy Duel.

942
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,800
Okay, figuring Guy Duel now.

943
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,340
This is the first lay of the rest of your life.

944
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,720
Oh, I see. Now that was Frank Bent.

945
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:39,580
Oh, wrong code here.

946
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:40,760
Frank Bent, the fake everything.

947
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,560
The fake Guy Duel, the fake show.

948
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,680
The fake everything.

949
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,920
I mean, why did they even try?

950
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Why did they just go to sleep?

951
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,200
Well, this is the fake show today, I can tell.

952
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,360
Yeah, fake old stoopy show.

953
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:53,540
But what happened to that peanut pad who was going to play the organ for us?

954
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:54,420
Sounds all edgy.

955
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,400
Oh, well, here, let's...

956
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,380
Not that that's great, but I mean...

957
00:58:59,380 --> 00:58:59,580
I know.

958
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,780
You know, it's just Ian Brooke on the outpost.

959
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,500
But there he is.

960
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,980
Look at that jolly old fellow pounding the keys now.

961
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:14,780
Yes, the show improves as soon as we hear the dulcet sounds of Marvin at the organ again.

962
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,640
And frigid light plays into my distanced pupils.

963
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:27,960
A little too much clarity and light and love and order and harmony here.

964
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,940
It's kind of making me sick, but I asked for it, so I'd better ride it out.

965
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,780
Folks, does life get you down?

966
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,500
Does it, huh?

967
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:39,980
Hmm?

968
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,860
Well, I'm not surprised.

969
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:49,980
I'm not surprised.

970
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,440
I'm not surprised.
