1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,360
Bob is fictional and purely coincidental.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,320
All names used on this program refer to real people either living or dead.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,060
I feel happy.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,120
The Self Genius.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,040
Power of Swatch.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,440
And now we are at your service.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:18,860
No.

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,040
If you are unhappy.

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:20,980
No, no.

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,540
Yes?

11
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,720
Who said I was unhappy?

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,180
I'm happy.

13
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,920
I'm very happy.

14
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,140
Very, very happy.

15
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:27,640
Yes.

16
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:28,780
Unhappy.

17
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:28,960
Unhappy.

18
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:29,720
Oh.

19
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,400
Very happy.

20
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,060
From PR News in Washington, I'm touring Europe.

21
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,600
The EU's top trade official says Robert is there.

22
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,280
She's not sure how.

23
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,860
PR's far right former wife has more.

24
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,640
He then moved on to Zurich.

25
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,280
So Switzerland.

26
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,980
Hungary is on our side.

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,040
Like PR News.

28
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,460
President Trump is going to vote in a special Tuesday.

29
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,520
As PR's report reports, Democrats say PR News.

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,400
The gunman who killed three mental health workers, that this is PR.

31
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,780
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Friday that attacks on PR News cannot go unanswered.

32
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:21,280
The Pentagon has released plans for aircraft, but there will be no PR News in order to protect the street pavement in Washington.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,280
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,540
Yes, yes, dear friends.

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:40,640
Last week we were reading from The Agent and Mr. Dobbs by Reverend Teeters LaVerge.

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,140
Actually, it's a document that Reverend LaVerge found.

37
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,140
Well, he came into possession of this document.

38
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,440
It was written in 1962.

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,900
And but was found in 1989 on the body of a.

40
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:06,600
Transient party clown that had been shredded and had to be assembled back together, which was not easy.

41
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,520
We read part one and a little bit of part two last week.

42
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:28,380
And I decided that even though I'm not in the studio with the fancy microphones at WCSB, my studio at home here in the slacker mansion with this microphone is close enough for.

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:28,680
So.

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,560
Some genius work.

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,740
That's what she said.

46
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,400
So we will continue.

47
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Actually, I'll I'll read the last paragraph from last week to help refresh your memory.

48
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,880
The agent, the unnamed agent was had fallen in with Mr.

49
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,560
Dobbs.

50
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,120
I awoke.

51
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,660
I'm not sure when on a garbage strewn beach in some tropical or subtropical location.

52
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,600
I recall the sound of ocean waves breaking on the shore.

53
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,720
And that of a Mambo band.

54
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,060
I almost choked when I was offered a daiquiri by the dictator.

55
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,780
F blanked out.

56
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,400
C blanked out.

57
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,200
We assume Fidel Castro.

58
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,220
And I'm just going to say that from now on.

59
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,360
Who is sitting next to me on the beach towel.

60
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,840
I drank the beverage only out of a severe thirst.

61
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,000
It was tasty.

62
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,200
However, you can't beat good Cuban rum.

63
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,740
Sitting on the other side of me was Dr.

64
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:27,740
Oswald.

65
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,420
Who was.

66
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,380
Removing the cash from my wallet.

67
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,900
Mumbling about that.

68
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,140
Damn Bob never pays me on time.

69
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,040
I was so overwhelmed that I did nothing to counter his actions.

70
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,880
Fidel Castro kept serving me daiquiris.

71
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,520
And so in a very short time,

72
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,700
I found myself intoxicated again,

73
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,700
though my actions may seem un-American bear in mind that I considered myself still undercover.

74
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,760
I eventually extricated myself.

75
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,860
By saying I needed to urinate in the ocean.

76
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,960
While doing my business.

77
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,460
I was startled by Mr.

78
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,520
Dobbs shooting up out of the water in front of me like a deranged dolphin.

79
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,560
His pipe miraculously still smoking.

80
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,440
He mentioned that the water was quite a bit warmer here.

81
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,240
And if I would not mind if he lingered to warm himself up a bit.

82
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,140
I of course never told him of the source of warmth.

83
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,300
I was startled again by what I initially thought were Mrs.

84
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,580
Dobbs Connie's hands rubbing the strain out of my back.

85
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:39,680
Bob sat in the water in front of me smiling while I felt all the tension being massaged from my shoulders.

86
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:47,880
It was incredibly relaxing until a slim gray hand popped another Dobbs Co.

87
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,360
Pill in my mouth and smoothed it down my throat.

88
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,420
It was not Mrs.

89
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:52,980
Dobbs.

90
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,280
It was that damnable gray creature from that horrible first movie.

91
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,620
I was on my first night at the Dobbs residence.

92
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,140
Bob found my confusion and fear amusing.

93
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,920
He laughed and jumped up and down in the water screaming Bob wants one too.

94
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,200
Bob wants one too.

95
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,360
Mr.

96
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,740
Dobbs received a large handful of pills.

97
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,560
Pills by the way is spelled with one L throughout this manuscript.

98
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,240
Strangely the pills seemed to sober him up.

99
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,280
Unlike in my case where the hallucinations began in earnest again.

100
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,380
I could have sworn I saw Mr.

101
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:38,080
Dobbs soon after absentmindedly battling a giant shark while lecturing both Fidel Castro and Dr.

102
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,140
Oswald on some convoluted concept he called Slack.

103
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,380
The next event I clearly remember was having martinis in a jet with Mr.

104
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:49,800
and Mrs.

105
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,640
Dobbs, the president and his wife and that abominable gray creature.

106
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Mr.

107
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,840
Dobbs was bemoaning the reliability of Dr.

108
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:07,560
Oswald while the president was assuring him that though he had a tendency to whine about being left out that all in all he was reliable.

109
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:08,940
Mrs.

110
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:16,380
Dobbs, the president's wife and the gray were defining the future from the entrails of a squid.

111
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,960
All three seemed deeply concerned.

112
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,620
Feeling bold and being sick of the constant drugging.

113
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,400
When the first thing that was taking place I stood up and demanded to know what was really going on.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,500
Initially I was ignored until I tried to grab the pipe out of Mr.

115
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,540
Dobbs' mouth.

116
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,100
It would not budge.

117
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,220
It was like it was part of his bone structure but it did grab his attention.

118
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,960
He looked at me straight in the eye.

119
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:51,580
His constant grin seemed to get bigger and his face dissolved into a mass of tiny luminescent dots.

120
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,760
It was then that I knew he had the power.

121
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,860
I backed away in fear and awe until the president beckoned me over stuttering in his annoying New England accent.

122
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,640
It's alright son.

123
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,740
Bob's got things under control.

124
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,380
I thought to myself that this buffoon, this magician, this slacker has things under control.

125
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,460
But it appears that he did or does.

126
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,720
I was then quickly sold.

127
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,480
I myself was sold like in an auction by our president to Mr.

128
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,620
Dobbs for a stack of Styrofoam cups and a game of tic-tac-toe which Mr.

129
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:40,100
Dobbs declared he had to win and a carefully chosen donut from a squished box that lay at the president's feet.

130
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,120
I felt exhausted.

131
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:50,640
I felt that I somehow had let down my country even though I was in essence commanded by our president to obey.

132
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:59,440
It pained me to think that I was sold to this man-god-beast for some junk.

133
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,480
Then I remembered my oath.

134
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,560
Then I remembered all the junk laying around Mr. Dobbs' mansion.

135
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,560
The severed heads.

136
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,720
I was just part of a bigger plan.

137
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,300
I knew then it was my duty to play the game through.

138
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,360
Still, my insides burned with shame.

139
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,700
For the rest of the flight, I sat back.

140
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:20,700


141
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:20,980
I was brooding.

142
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,020
Nothing could bring me out of my funk.

143
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,780
Not Mr. Dobbs' childish and obvious magic coin tricks.

144
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,480
I knew very well he had it in his hand when he pulled the quarter from behind my ear.

145
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,520
Neither the president's poor impersonations of cartoon characters could pull me from my funk.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,280
It was only the pills that got me in the swing of things and that was a shame to me in and of itself.

147
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,700
The Dobbses, the Greys and I were dropped off in Miami Beach.

148
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,640
Where the Dobbses had a residence.

149
00:08:52,980 --> 00:09:01,600
While the president mentioned that he had to go to some secret base in New Mexico until things, quote, cooled down a bit, unquote.

150
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,900
The Dobbs' residence was not at all like their mansion.

151
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,840
It was small and neat.

152
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:17,440
I was ushered into the bathroom and told to take a shower for, according to Bob, I smelled like, quote, the older ones on a binge.

153
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,680
The shower immediately stopped.

154
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,900
I was sobered me up and I found that I was famished.

155
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,700
Dinner, however, was a disappointment.

156
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,200
It was cold rice with a bit of rat meat.

157
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:38,240
Bob said he had learned this hangover remedy from one Uncle Ho and that I'd better get used to it.

158
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,800
It was disgusting.

159
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,980
I feigned eating, hiding the half-chewed scraps in my napkin.

160
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,140
Bob did not eat but puffed away on his pipe.

161
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,840
Connie, however, ate with gusto.

162
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:58,180
After dinner, I insisted that we go to this tiki lounge I knew of nearby for ham and pineapple.

163
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,640
I told him it was on me, though I had no cash after Dr. Oswald's thievery.

164
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:11,300
This excited Bob to such a degree that he jumped up on the table and started to do his Friday night dance again.

165
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,260
It took Connie some time to quiet him down.

166
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,660
That is the end of part two of The Agent's Diary.

167
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,540
Rick Bob, read by an unknown agent, delivered or —

168
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,700
you few who see it in the slide,

169
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,840
by Reverend Titus LaVurge.

170
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,620
Cabina D Reddit

171
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,040
Rif...!

172
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:42,000
I will read part three.

173
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:49,260
Forgive me, Tribe,

safe and cozy in your bed

187
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,300
off.

188
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,060


189
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,520
nar

190
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,480
dream

191
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:01,860
dreams

192
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,720
dreams

193
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,440
dream

194
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,000
dreams

195
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,700
green

196
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,500

197
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,780
1700

198
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:24,740
yourself to have quiet dreams, they will be quiet. You can sleep and wait for a dream,

199
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:33,060
and when it comes, it will be happy or pretty. You can dream about things that are fun, because

200
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:40,940
you know that everyone loves you so. You will sleep happy, and now you can tell yourself,

201
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:48,900
when I go to sleep, I will be happy, because everyone loves me, and all my dreams will be

202
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:59,760
happy dreams. That was by the Rathole, Royal American Temple of the Holy Order of Lower

203
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,600
Evolution. The Rathole Clench. Spooky! Before that, we've been hearing an old reading of the

204
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,000
newly published subgenius novel that's not yet in our catalog, but will be soon.

205
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,720
Hopefully, before we finish reading the whole book out loud on this show.

206
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:27,060
This is part three of The Agent and Mr. Dobbs. The music, by the way, in the background is the

207
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:36,640
soundtrack from the Kenneth Anger movie called Lucifer Rising. No connection, just happened to

208
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,440
be a nice long piece of music. No reason we picked it.

209
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:51,140
Music of that title, performed by that particular set of former Manson family inmates of a prison.

210
00:14:51,760 --> 00:15:02,340
This music was recorded on death row. Anyway, to further on here in The Agent and Mr. Dobbs,

211
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:10,220
part three. Bob decided that we would walk while Connie would take their pedicab. I had never seen a

212
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:16,960
service here in our great nation, although I was beginning to be immune to the insanity that

213
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:22,420
permeated my experience around the Dobbses. I actually vomited a little in my mouth when I

214
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:29,200
saw the creature that was pulling the pedicab. It was A, and here it's blanked out again, A.H.

215
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,080
Blanked out. His mustache was shaved, but it was him. I could see the stitch-marked scars around

216
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,600
the top of his head where his brain had been re-inserted.

217
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,440
I was always led to believe that the Soviets burned his body but sold his brain isn't

218
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:55,520
it strange for the secret that those folks we found in our blanked out New Mexico…

219
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:04,180
sold us in exchange for the bodies of their comrades. WHAT A REVELATION! As is known, I lost my

220
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,560
big brother to the Germans in the big one, so every cell in my body wanted to strangle that terrible

221
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:15,600
things standing by the curb, but seeing him dressed in a tutu with rabbit ears

222
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,120
on his head, I was moved to pity. It was quite obvious that he was near

223
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,940
brain-dead at this point. He could also, I might add, haul that pedicab pretty damn

224
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:31,400
fast in those six-inch stiletto heels. Further down the sidewalk on that

225
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,620
moonlit, humid night, I had to finally admit to Bob that Dr. Oswald had stolen

226
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,720
all my money. Bob snickered and nodded knowingly, saying,

227
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,900
He is a little worm, but I've got plans for him.

228
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:50,400
I was pondering this potentially dangerous comment when Bob suddenly stopped and bent down

229
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:56,420
to tie his shoe. I then walked to the front when a brick from nowhere hit me square

230
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,040
in the head. Thank God for the steel plate I had placed there after the

231
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,460
accident, for if Bob had not stopped to tie his shoe, I'm sure that he would have

232
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:06,600
been the one who would have been the one to have been the one to have been the one to have been

233
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:13,780
brain. Although now I wonder if he could ever be hurt. He has the most persistent

234
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:19,040
luck of any man I've known. When Bob had finished tying his shoe,

235
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:25,400
ignoring my yelps of pain in the violent flow of blood flowing down my face, he

236
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,700
came back up with a wallet. Miraculously, he said that he knew this

237
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,620
man, the owner of the wallet one Dr. Tim Leary. It would seem that they were

238
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,320
old friends.

239
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,480
Bob mumbled to himself that the SOB owed him as he proceeded to take all the cash

240
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,020
from the wallet, a sandal warehouse charge card, and a folded slightly blue

241
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:54,320
tinted piece of paper that was perforated into many small squares. This

242
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,880
object Bob seemed most excited about for he shoved it into his mouth and mumbled

243
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,080
something like, let him try to read my mind again. He then started to chuckle. He

244
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,180
chuckled until we walked into the Tiki lounge. At least we had over a hundred

245
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:17,020
dollars in cash that Bob now had. Connie was already seated at a table with two

246
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,020
cabana boys dancing for her. Bob took me by the arm and led me up to the bar

247
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,100
where filling one hand with a wad of colorful Monopoly money and the other

248
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:34,300
with a wad of strange smelling sticky tobacco and a chewed up old pipe. He told

249
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:34,760
me to

250
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,120
frop up a bit and get something to drink. He glared over at Connie, hitched up his

251
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,660
pants and mumbled that he had to take care of a few things and damn those boys

252
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:53,220
stole my dance moves. I found myself engrossed in this strange tobacco. It was

253
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,720
not as the youth of today called Mary Jane. It had a foul odor and taste but

254
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:04,500
for some reason I found that it not only soothed my spirit but that the pipe seemed to be

255
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,440
stuck in my mouth. I was not clenching my teeth down on the stem yet I could not

256
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,020
extract it. It was as if it glued itself to my mouth. That fact made eating dinner

257
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,860
rather difficult. I apparently was oblivious under the influence of this

258
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,260
weed when I heard the sounds of breaking glass. I knew it must be Bob.

259
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,640
Surely enough he had pushed all the plates and glasses off the table and was

260
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,800
dancing with the boys on the tabletop. Connie looked away apparently in disgust as she

261
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,600
She filed her nails with what looked like the severed hand of a gorilla or some other sort of great ape.

262
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,620
Bob then threw a salt shaker, which hit me square in the forehead, causing it to bleed.

263
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:53,380
I must now add that no one had mentioned the fact that my face was already covered in fresh blood or that I was not wearing trousers.

264
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,520
Bob had still not given them back to me yet.

265
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,920
He yelled to me,

266
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,180
Get those damn Mai Tais! I have a powerful thirst!

267
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:08,160
I proffered the Monopoly money to the bartender in my fropped-up state.

268
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,560
He looked at Bob and back to me, shook his head, and produced a picture of the drink.

269
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,880
There was fear in his eyes.

270
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:24,560
Is this Bob a member of a criminal group, the criminal group that does not exist?

271
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,740
It may have been some strange influence of the frop,

272
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,160
but the twenty feet and the few steps,

273
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,860
the seconds that it took to get to our table seemed more like a mile and an hour.

274
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:43,840
I wonder now if there was not some sort of space-time distortion brought on by the frop,

275
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,140
for when I arrived at the table it was neatly set with plates of appetizers,

276
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:53,000
which very much looked and tasted like flambéed monkey brains.

277
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,620
Tasty, though.

278
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,000
Bob's were raw.

279
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,680
Plus, there was a youngish-looking man that was introduced as Timmy Boy.

280
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:08,840
Bob said that he had big jumbo, big giant colossal plans for him.

281
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,680
It was apparently the Dr. Tim Leary whose wallet Bob had just found on the street.

282
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,360
I began to wonder if I were being set up.

283
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,760
But reviewing the strange luck that Bob seemed to have,

284
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,880
I had to admit to myself that maybe this guy was more than extraordinary.

285
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,640
He already had shown that he had at least as much power as the President.

286
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,620
Bob did give Dr. Leary back his wallet, but claimed that some young punks jumped us.

287
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,120
He pointed convincingly to my bloody head and shirt, stating that my bleeding head was good.

288
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,820
I still don't understand what he meant by that.

289
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,360
Dr. Leary tore through his wallet in an angry manner.

290
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,480
He grabbed Bob by the wrist, stating, not asking,

291
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,780
You took the blotter?

292
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,880
Bob just stuck out his tongue with the messy, faded and chewed wad of paper,

293
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,540
and then he started sitting there.

294
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,100
His tongue was extraordinarily long and lizard-like.

295
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,940
He snapped it back with a grin.

296
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,420
Dr. Leary drew his hands back to himself and pouted.

297
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,940
Dinner went surprisingly well.

298
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,820
The conversation was adept and civilized,

299
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,260
though the Dobbs seemed to have a language of their own,

300
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,120
which Dr. Leary and I could somehow follow.

301
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,800
The other two disconcerting issues I remembered was that

302
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,800
every time I tried to pour a drink for myself,

303
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
Bob would knock it out of my hand.

304
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,660
He would start shouting, stating,

305
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,220
Frop before booze, you can't lose.

306
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,220
Booze before frop, you'll wish you were dead.

307
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,460
The other issue I had was that

308
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,120
what I thought was Connie's smooth hand rubbing my knee

309
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,800
was, however, of course, not hers,

310
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,320
and no, not the gray either.

311
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,020
It was that damned A blanked out, H blanked out,

312
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,740
A-H,

313
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,120
under the table begging for scraps.

314
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,480
I kicked the thing away, but out of mercy,

315
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,800
did give it the cold monkey brains that I could not finish.

316
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,300
This frop has the odd ability to make one hungry,

317
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,580
but at the same time make the act of eating

318
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,080
very, very strange and uncomfortable.

319
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,320
I wanted to chew the food, but was not able to swallow it.

320
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,480
Bob, on the other hand, did eat heartily.

321
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,660
A half a pig, all of the raw monkey brains,

322
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,020
a light bulb,

323
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,820
I do not know where he got it.

324
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,960
The tropical flower set in the table in what I feared to think

325
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,740
was a human heart,

326
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,100
raw.

327
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,160
A-H had to pull us all back to the Dobbs bungalow.

328
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,620
I did not pity him at this point.

329
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,380
For the whole trip back, Bob kept looking up at the night skies,

330
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,160
pointing out constellations that were not there,

331
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,780
muttering, Gort, Klatu, Veranda, Nixon,

332
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,940
or something.

333
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,300
Whatever was in the monkey brains he ate sure seemed to have relaxed him,

334
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,760
for when we got back to the house,

335
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,680
the Grey had messed it up while we were out to dinner.

336
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,840
Bob seemed pretty peeved, but accepted this situation with grace.

337
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,520
He put on some very strange music on the hi-fi,

338
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,780
lounged back into an easy chair, and lectured me.

339
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,940
I quote as best as I can remember.

340
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,680
Young man, thou hast much lee,

341
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,120
to unlearn.

342
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,780
I sayest thus out of pure spite.

343
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,560
Thou hast disunderstood everything

344
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,860
I haveest revealedest to thouest,

345
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,280
which in mine eyes is unre-unnerving,

346
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,300
and thou dost screw me over?

347
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,160
I replied, Mr. Dobbs, I was sent on a mission that you requested.

348
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,100
I have only held back one truth, and that is that you are a wanted man.

349
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,200
Wanted by our great nation to smite our enemies.

350
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,880
I was told that you have the powers to do that.

351
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,620
Then why don't you?

352
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,740
Bob wriggled around in his chair.

353
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,080
I feared another dance session emerging.

354
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,180
But he seemed un-Bob-like nervous.

355
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,540
Look at you, monkey boy.

356
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,120
I just ate the brains of your great-great-great uncle with a bit of lime juice.

357
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,040
Do you want to de-re-unevolve back into our natural state?

358
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,100
Or evolve into a pile of ashes?

359
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,760
I sat staring at his classical face,

360
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,000
pondering what he had told, not asked me.

361
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,280
His face and body began to shimmer,

362
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,920
flicker like a film projector gone haywire.

363
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,240
Bob scrunched his face up and let out a fart

364
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,780
that literally shook the house.

365
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,620
This emission propelled him up into the air,

366
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,520
to the point of hitting his head on the ceiling.

367
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,020
He slowly descended back,

368
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,600
to the exact spot he had previously been sitting.

369
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,780
A change came over him.

370
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,220
His eyes had glassed over, and he looked confused,

371
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,220
as would an elderly man with dementia.

372
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,160
So, he said out of the blue,

373
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,800
let's get some hookers.

374
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,800
I know of a great place next to Cape Canaveral.

375
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,500
And friends, so ends part three of The Agent and Mr. Dobbs.

376
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,020
We will resume with The Agent and Mr. Dobbs part four.

377
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:28,740
Later.

378
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,660
The music in the background, once again,

379
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:40,440
is from Lucifer Rising by Bobby Boussalaile.

380
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,720
I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing his name right,

381
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,860
but he was one of the main musicians in this.

382
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,720
One of the Manson family.

383
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,980
I think he was executed or died in jail or something.

384
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,240
And this music was done for the movie Lucifer Rising

385
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,360
by Kenneth Anger.

386
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,280
Price Bobbin now, this.

387
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:45,820
I know if Goldie said nhoo-hah,

388
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:45,860
I want to kill myself.

389
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:45,860


390
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,900
Gunshut up the

391
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,560
door.

392
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:56,140
And shoot him straight in the наш

393
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,240
Thank you.

394
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,860
Thank you.

395
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,040
Thank you.

396
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,880
Thank you.

397
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,400
It almost goes without saying

398
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,840
that that instrumental entitled

399
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,120
Welcoming the...

400
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,080
The Bandaged Mule

401
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,780
is by the Rudy Schwartz Project.

402
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,080
Look up that on YouTube.

403
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,040
And now, back to our story.

404
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,940
The Agent and Mr. Dobbs

405
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,260
Part 4

406
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,140
Submitted by Reverend Teeters LaVerge

407
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,140
Bob drove,

408
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,340
if one could even call it driving,

409
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,820
for he never once had his hands on the wheel.

410
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,120
He approached

411
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,080
and appeared to steer with his knees,

412
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,860
but mostly with another part of his anatomy

413
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,400
that seemed to have a literal mind of its own,

414
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,680
at least according to Connie.

415
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,620
Bob never looked out the windshield.

416
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,800
The whole time he was behind the wheel,

417
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,800
he had his head sticking out the driver's side window,

418
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,280
nostrils flared to an incredible degree,

419
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,660
and his tongue hanging out like a dog's.

420
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,160
I myself had my foot pushed hard on the floor

421
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,120
against a non-existent wall,

422
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,940
and my hands clenched on the door handle.

423
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,020
Bob was constantly looking around

424
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,800
and up into the night skies.

425
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,240
He said he was looking for them

426
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,040
and p-sniffing,

427
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,180
actually pronounced it p-sniffing,

428
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,600
around for the skunk ape,

429
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,380
a version, he told me, of the Himalayan yeti.

430
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,460
He said there were lots of them around this part of Florida,

431
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,600
that they were friendly,

432
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,360
but also that they had glands

433
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,140
that contained a powerful aphrodisiac.

434
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,740
So either way, if you run into one, you are lucky.

435
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,480
It was not long until he slammed on the brakes

436
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,280
and we skidded off into a ditch.

437
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,700
Bob bounded out of the car

438
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,700
and started to run into a swampy area to the west.

439
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,160
I followed out of stupidity,

440
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,660
for the bramble and the vines growing in the swamp

441
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,080
cut up my legs bad.

442
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,800
I still had no trousers.

443
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,060
I should mention that Bob did not actually run.

444
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,960
He leaped and bounded more like a gazelle.

445
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,180
Quite graceful.

446
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,980
When I finally caught up with him,

447
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,600
he was rolling around in a large patch of trampled down cane

448
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,020
that certainly looked like the bedding of a great ape-like creature.

449
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,040
The smell was sickening,

450
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,700
but it did have a strange allure to it.

451
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,180
Bob was in ecstasy as he rolled around in the stinking muck.

452
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,580
Must be in here!

453
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,680
He was in heat, he exclaimed as he got up.

454
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,520
Oddly, his clothing had not one speck of dirt or mud on it.

455
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,300
When I mentioned that, he just giggled

456
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,660
and for the first time acknowledged

457
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,280
that I was wearing no trousers, saying,

458
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,220
we'd have to remedy that.

459
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,380
Once we were back in the car,

460
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,520
Bob let out a sigh that sounded almost sad.

461
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,360
Skunk ape is one hot to trot yeti,

462
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,740
he whispered something in a language to himself

463
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,180
as he played pocket pool

464
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,940
in his pants.

465
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,640
Well now son, off to get you some trousers.

466
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,520
We had not driven far, maybe a mile to the edge

467
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,640
of a small run-down town full of white trash,

468
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,920
as they say in the South.

469
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,840
Bob's nostrils started to flare again

470
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,780
as he p-sniffed about in the air and chuckled to himself.

471
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,420
We'd pulled off onto the side of the road

472
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,900
next to a ramshackle house that was more down than up.

473
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,960
The incongruity was not lost on me,

474
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:25,440
at least.

475
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,720
Bob dressed to the T with his battleship-sized Cadillac

476
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,280
compared to this hovel we were now at.

477
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,380
However, Bob showed no sign of noticing.

478
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,880
He simply knocked on the door.

479
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,720
Soon, a much degraded man of indeterminate age answered.

480
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,840
Bob, without introductions, offered to sell this man

481
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,160
a haircut in exchange for the incredibly filthy overalls

482
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,760
he was wearing.

483
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,800
The degenerate hillbilly agreed to the deal without haggling.

484
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,160
In fact, I would say, he was a little too old to be a man.

485
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,160


486
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,760
I would say that he seemed ecstatic.

487
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,280
He seemed to swoon.

488
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,900
The haircut Bob gave him was perfect.

489
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,540
He even styled it exactly like his own,

490
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,860
using hair gel from a tube he had in his jacket pocket,

491
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,360
telling the man that,

492
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,480
now, he emphasized,

493
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,400
things are going to change for the better.

494
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,660
Though I did see Bob absentmindedly place one hand

495
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,420
on a rickety wooden shelf

496
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,440
and grabbed what looked like a government check,

497
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,140
while with the other,

498
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,920
he regally handed the man a five-cent plastic comb,

499
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,020
grinning as if he'd just done him a favor.

500
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,160
I don't think Mr. Dobbs is a thief, per se,

501
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,660
nor a kleptomaniac.

502
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,360
He may simply not have control over himself and his desires

503
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,600
in the same way that we normal people do.

504
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,340
For myself, I'm glad that I did not have a mirror

505
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,660
to see myself so shamefully dressed.

506
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,460
The standard jacket, tie, white shirt, wingtip shoes,

507
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,140
and the filthiest, smelly outfit I've ever seen.

508
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:55,320
I was the only one who could imagine

509
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,320


510
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,100
of the most luxurious pair of overalls that could be imagined.

511
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,960
Bob took an uncomfortably close pwiff of me

512
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,760
and nodded his approval.

513
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,260
Hmm, now you smell useful.

514
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,320
Again, I must emphasize that this man

515
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,700
is by nature uncanny and powerful.

516
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,940
He is a force to be either feared or harnessed,

517
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,320
if that is even possible, and I doubt that it is.

518
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:25,100
I have a gut feeling that we may find it advantageous

519
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,720
to adapt ourselves to him.

520
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,980
With Bob driving well over 80 miles an hour,

521
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,480
we made it to the Cape Canaveral area fast.

522
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,840
By this time, I'd given up worrying

523
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,340
and decided to follow whatever path Mr. Dobbs might drag me along,

524
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,720
for it occurred to me that, so far,

525
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,780
through all the experiences I'd been through,

526
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,920
I'd suffered little permanent physical damage.

527
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:54,460
Mental damage, on the other hand, was possibly extreme, maybe.

528
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,520
I say maybe because I think I was beginning to understand

529
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,600
this incredible man and his wisdom,

530
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,180
if one can even say that Mr. Dobbs can be understood,

531
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,060
at least with our stunted minds.

532
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,520
Instead of the expected whorehouse,

533
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,800
we drove to a large modern factory

534
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,780
that was at least in sight of Cape Canaveral.

535
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,960
Bob said that it was one of his disembodiment stations

536
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,900
and that he had to go number three.

537
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,400
I assumed that he meant he needed to defecate

538
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,320
but was drunk and misspoke.

539
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,560
The factory, Bob told me,

540
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,940
made a substance called dumbass putty.

541
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,140
The substance they produced worked in the same way

542
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,560
as the child's plaything silly putty,

543
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,600
but was an utter failure, Bob told me,

544
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,960
because of the extreme toxicity of the materials used.

545
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,900
But I also assumed because of its name.

546
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,760
Mr. Dobbs did not lament the ongoing failure.

547
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,240
In fact, he shrugged it off, saying something about

548
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,360
a few less pinks, possible good mutations,

549
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,520
and a huge tax write-off.

550
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,940
This man is sinister,

551
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,940
but this man may be our only hope.

552
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,540
I shall explain why later in the report.

553
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,940
For a toy factory, it had better security

554
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,000
than I had seen even at our base X.

555
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,980
Not only were there 20-foot concrete walls

556
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,960
topped with embedded glass and razor wire,

557
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,240
there were guard posts every five feet or so,

558
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:38,080
so that the guards could pass notes and pipes back and forth.

559
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,060
Even Bob was ID'd at the entrance,

560
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,460
which was more like the heavy gates that lead into a castle than anything.

561
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,040
He even had a moat around it with what looked like alligators.

562
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,940
They, I eventually assumed,

563
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,120
turned out to be alligator people,

564
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,060
the cast-offs from one of Bobco's genetic enhancement laboratories.

565
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,360
This factory was like none I had ever seen.

566
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,660
Sure, there were huge machines pushing out some putty-like substance

567
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,860
into large vats that, oddly, had stenciled on them the words

568
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,380
Tuna Surprise.

569
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,180
And come to think of it, the food canning part of the factory

570
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,800
had machines with the same title stenciled on them.

571
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,620
However, I was shocked when Bob led me into a room

572
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,560
the size of an aircraft carrier that was filled with

573
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,340
the most advanced computers I had ever seen.

574
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,760
There were hundreds, if not thousands,

575
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,400
of Nancy Reagan-y Davis look-alikes

576
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,640
pushing punch cards into the slots.

577
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,100
Bob and I walked through the cavernous affair,

578
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,620
me with my mouth agape and Bob with his typical grin.

579
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,740
That is, until he slapped one of the Nancy Reagan women

580
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,460
on the behind.

581
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,540
His hand bounced back, wrapped around his midsection

582
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,340
as if it were made of rubber, and smacked him on the back of the head.

583
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:02,220
He glared at the woman and coughed as a key then shot out of his mouth.

584
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,760
He rubbed the back of his head as he picked it up, telling me,

585
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,640
Number 807 is a feisty one.

586
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,440
Hmm, I thought I'd lost this key.

587
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,480
It was the same key he used to unlock his office door.

588
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,720
This time, his office, in contrast to the office door,

589
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,500
the other one I saw, was well-appointed and typical

590
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,820
for a powerful executive.

591
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,440
Bob sat himself down behind a large desk

592
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,080
and gathered up huge, neatly piled stacks of paper.

593
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:35,500
He then very deliberately laid them on the floor in two piles.

594
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,680
One pile he dove into and rolled around in vigorously.

595
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,600
When he got up, he smoothed his suit, breathing heavily.

596
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:48,400
He told me that those particular contracts would be signed,

597
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:52,900
and that they, whoever they were, could no longer refuse them.

598
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:58,200
Then he got on all fours and snuffled around the other pile like a hound dog.

599
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:03,700
Using his tongue, he pulled out a few sheets, undid the zipper on his pants,

600
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,340
lifted a leg, and urinated on them.

601
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,280
These were the ones he told me that he had just signed.

602
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,760
Sure enough, as if an invisible ink were revealed,

603
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,620
the name J.R. Bob Dobbs, Esquire,

604
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,340
slowly appeared on the papers, albeit in thick, childlike handwriting.

605
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,460
Bob, exhausted, then lay down to take a nap,

606
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:31,020
but first making sure that he had securely locked me into the room.

607
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,180
I could not be sure at first if he were exactly asleep,

608
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,480
for he lay down with his arms to his side, stiff as a board, like a corpse.

609
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,540
I was sure he was trying to fool me somehow.

610
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,200
It wasn't until he started passing gas,

611
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,840
like a snorer would snore,

612
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,600
that I took the opportunity to search the room.

613
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,340
The papers, I dared not touch the befouled ones,

614
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,700
were standard contracts, though some seemed to speak of deals for human flesh,

615
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,400
human souls, and unimaginably vast amounts of money.

616
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,680
His desk, however, was filled with cotter pins,

617
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,220
broken pens, and jars of urine.

618
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,220
I'm sure it was urine,

619
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,220
for each one was labeled P.E.

620
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,820
with a date and the initials J.R.

621
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,480
and a little note, like,

622
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,960
good vintage, a little salty though,

623
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,300
removes A souls,

624
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,140
bad day, and so on.

625
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,460
One drawer was entirely filled with money clips.

626
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:42,580
The one below it was filled with severed and dried human hands.

627
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,000
I reeled in fear, for,

628
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,140
at that exact moment, Bob, still mumbling loudly in his sleep, said,

629
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,000
You're next, boy.

630
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,140
Forgetting that I had long lost the trousers of my own,

631
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,700
I reached into the pockets of the filthy overalls

632
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:02,560
and pulled out a diamond-encrusted money clip that contained hundreds of dollars.

633
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,400
I backed up against the wall as Bob came toward me

634
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,520
with glowing red eyes that seemed filled,

635
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,060
not with greed, but an animal-like lust.

636
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,780
His ever-present grin wider, bigger, scarier than ever.

637
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,580
He pinned me there.

638
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,340
His breath smelled like a mix between fresh paint and garlic.

639
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,260
His breathing was heavy, frightening.

640
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:30,820
He took one hand down and slipped the money clip from my limp fingers, saying,

641
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,320
This is mine. I gave the haircut.

642
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:39,460
This was the first time that I was truly afraid of what Mr. Dobbs might do to me.

643
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,840
Even though he grinned, his lifeless eyes,

644
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,480
or maybe eyes too full of life,

645
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,980
spoke of some abyss,

646
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,680
of something that I could never understand.

647
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,780
He then brought his pipe-filled lips next to my ear.

648
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,940
The sizzling of the tobacco in it sounded like bacon,

649
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,820
but smelled like some used diaper that had been forgotten in a defunct rubber factory.

650
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,560
The vomit rose in my throat.

651
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,120
He whispered, telling me to look in the forbidden drawer,

652
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,920
having no idea what drawer that would be,

653
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,900
I pulled a drawer out of a file cabinet adjacent to myself.

654
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:22,040
My hand rummaged around in it while my eyes were fixed to his.

655
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,440
I pulled out a stack of papers and pulled them close to me.

656
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,800
Every sheet had a few typewritten lines on them.

657
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,680
I tried to focus on them.

658
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:37,340
To my relief, they were all bad, very bad, one-liner jokes that you hear at cheap burlesque houses.

659
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:41,880
Bob glared at me, his grin becoming sinister,

660
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,620
or should I say more sinister.

661
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,500
Yet, I must admit, his gaze was hypnotizing.

662
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,260
This was the first time I dared look so deeply into his eyes.

663
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,700
Relief only came when he loosened his grip, chuckled and said,

664
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,180
if I remember correctly,

665
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,000
Seen my secret stash.

666
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,440
Head didn't explode.

667
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,960
Passed the test.

668
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,380
I leaned more relaxed against the wall, sweating profusely.

669
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,860
Bob rhythmically said,

670
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,180
nodded his head as if to some tune that only he could hear.

671
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:22,100
Now ye shallest gazest uponest the timelessest,

672
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,360
ofest the mostest, gruesomestest of horrorses.

673
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,220
Again he tried and failed to sound biblical,

674
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:36,900
yet now I wondered that if truly the ancients in the good book did not speak with an affected drawl.

675
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,860
This Bob was obviously not of our realm as we know it,

676
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:48,320
or he may just simply be semi-retarded and very, very lucky.

677
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:53,980
He ushered me into a room filled with junk that he called Bull Dada.

678
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,920
I assume, what with all the Bobco pills that he'd been popping,

679
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,920
that he meant Dada art.

680
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,220
Seriously, it was junk.

681
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:06,740
Odd balls of carefully wound, used and dirty string.

682
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,360
A newspaper and magazine clippings of male models.

683
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,360
Oddly, they all looked like Bob.

684
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,540
Poorly painted monster movie plastic models.

685
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,500
And greenish stone figurines of strange-looking sea creatures.

686
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,800
Mr. Dobbs put his hand on my shoulder and gestured wildly with his other hand

687
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,700
as if I should appreciate some great treasure of art.

688
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,240
I still don't understand his pride with that room of junk,

689
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,880
nor what I should greatly fairest about it all.

690
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,840
It's still a mystery to me.

691
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:47,160
It was apparently time to go, for Bob, after wiping a tear from his eye, said,

692
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:53,280
I must attend to bidness, as he guided me down a long fluorescent-lit hallway.

693
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,820
It was then that I noticed, in my sobriety,

694
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,980
that he seemed to be floating a fraction of an inch off the ground.

695
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,380
That would explain the lack of dirt that ever sullied his person.

696
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,860
But it may also explain the lack of dirt that ever sullied his person.

697
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,400
But it may also explain the lack of dirt that ever sullied his person.

698
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:11,420
But it may also explain the lack of dirt that ever sullied his person.

699
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:16,840
I think he is too stupid to recognize his own mortality,

700
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,880
let alone the fact that he's walking and that gravity matters,

701
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:26,540
so that just like the leader of that Russian pre-Soviet spiritual movement,

702
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,700
Bulatavism, Bob just breezes through the act of living,

703
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,320
never worrying or contemplating his next or any next movement.

704
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,840
Because he may be too mentally retarded,

705
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,820
to even understand it in the basic way that rules apply.

706
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,660
We came to a door that had the words,

707
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,180
Janitor Place, crudely painted on it.

708
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:56,240
I sighed, thinking it was just another of Bob's ruses to get me alone, again.

709
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,640
However, when he opened the door, I was nearly blinded by the bright lights.

710
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,440
It was no janitor closet.

711
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,660
It opened to a huge research center that would put our efforts to great shame.

712
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,840
It opened to a huge research center that would put our efforts to great shame.

713
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,360
With hundreds of men, women, and things,

714
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,240
in white lab coats, all scratching away at chalkboards,

715
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,680
squinting over slide rules, arguing, generally looking like brilliant scientists.

716
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,600
I have little understanding of zero-gravity physics,

717
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,480
but from what I saw of our quick walkthrough,

718
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,460
these people and things were onto something big.

719
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,140
Bob seemed very unimpressed.

720
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,900
In fact, he pushed me along, saying,

721
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,340
I really, really need to go number three.

722
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:47,680
We made it to a sealed doorway. Bob pushed aside a few feeble greys as he inserted his head inside a vertical toilet-looking device.

723
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:55,140
He groaned with pleasure as he turned the pages of a cheap monster movie magazine with his toes.

724
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:01,280
I repeat, I do not know what he did with his head in that device, but I do know that he said,

725
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,680
Taking a number three is better than pesex.

726
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:11,280
Mr. Dobbs seemed much relieved after taking this number three.

727
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,460
He had more of his trademark relaxed self about him.

728
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:22,520
He even gave me back the money clip, without the diamonds and cash, and patted me on the shoulder like a benevolent father.

729
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:28,420
The clip did contain a piece of paper that, in his childish scrawl, said,

730
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,360
I owe you stuff.

731
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,600
This incredible factory seemed to have no end.

732
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:41,400
We wandered for miles, it would seem, with Bob either admiring his image that shone from his highly polished shoes,

733
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:47,380
or flipping a quarter that always landed on its edge, which he seemed a little ticked off about.

734
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:57,620
Bob nonchalantly opened a regular-looking steel door that led into a huge playground-like room filled with primates.

735
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,960
These were no ordinary primates.

736
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,520
They all wore lab coats, business suits, party dresses.

737
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,660
Some of them were even wearing a pair of pants.

738
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,500
Some of them even dressed like Harlem Hepcat pimps.

739
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,120
All these primates were most definitely busy at work of all sorts.

740
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,800
Equations were being written on blackboards.

741
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,840
Martinis were being deftly made by the females of the group.

742
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:25,680
The business ones were hunched, brows knotted with stress over little desks, scribbling away with fountain pens.

743
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,760
However, every once in a while, they would all drop their stumpy trousers,

744
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,220
defecate, and throw the feces at one another,

745
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:34,640
and they would be shrieking.

746
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,040
High-pitched screams.

747
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:42,360
Bob said that he liked to come here to relax, especially after doing a number three.

748
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,180
They know exactly what they do.

749
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:51,700
Bob made a gesture, all too real with sound effects of defecating and throwing feces.

750
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,180
I likes it, he declared.

751
00:49:54,540 --> 00:50:01,340
His grin got wider as he too jumped up and down like the primates, mimicking their movements and voices.

752
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,300
He bounded around the large room amongst them.

753
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,500
In essence, becoming one of them.

754
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,920
And yes, he did defecate and throw his feces around.

755
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:15,920
But, but it made sense.

756
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:25,280
And friends, that has been part four of The Agent and Mr. Dobbs,

757
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:34,440
written by an unnamed agent and submitted to us by Reverend Teeters LaBerge.

758
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,660
It Mom and Dad At the Buddists

759
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:40,840
It goes up to part seven, I believe, and then another novel starts,

760
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,600
The Agent goes to Dobbstown.

761
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,360
Uh,

762
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,620
And we'll be reading from that later.

763
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,380
Another novel begins

764
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,080
secondico2ajnt.com

765
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,000
How to recall,

766
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,000


767
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,000


768
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,260
And a few little facts

769
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:54,260


770
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,680
How to getуш

771
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,600
In The Debbie Buchanan Game dessert

772
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:04,640
Modules digitally, tight boxes

773
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:23,900
He is holding this crown

774
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:31,120
Sickles out and she is down and out

775
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,560
A new challenger approaches the scene

776
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,020
So sneaky, so sneaky

777
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:45,980
But really cool inside my belt

778
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,400
Battle to the death between four challengers

779
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,060
And Yagra bombs

780
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Battle to the death between four challengers

781
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,700
And Yagra bombs and Bromelain

782
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,300
Oh

783
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,880
So sneaky, so sneaky

784
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:03,640
But that was, of course, the up-and-coming band Rubix

785
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,620
With an actual title, Rubix

786
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:04,620


787
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,100
Rubix Pube with a P

788
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,880
Rubix Pube from their album HypnoStank

789
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,700
As seen on Bandcamp

790
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,240
The song titled

791
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:18,480
A Battle to the Death Between Corn Chowder and Yagra Bombs

792
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,580
Proof that as the old doctor bands of boomers fossilized

793
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,540
New doctor bands continue to be born

794
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,240
As if in defiance of all pinkness

795
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:34,120
You can find more such by way of subgenius.com

796
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:41,460
The music in the background is Nino Rota from Philemon's Eight and a Half

797
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,880
We have some big plans in the works

798
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:44,960
Big, big plans

799
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,260
Both here, there, and everywhere

800
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,660
To quote my one-time rival Jim Jones

801
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,300
And look at him now

802
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,800
We close this hour of Slack with a piece of ESO radio

803
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,920
From WCSB Cleveland and the time of December 2000

804
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,860
Lonesome Cowboy Dave's History of World War II

805
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:03,620
Praise Bob

806
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,480
Down at the beach when we walk by

807
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,500
The other girls give him the eye

808
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,960
Cause my man stands out

809
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,080
Yes, my man stands out

810
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,160
I'm crazy about the way my band stands out

811
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,560
I don't swing that way

812
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,280
I like the way he moves around

813
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,500
And the way he goes down

814
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,720
Cause my man stands out

815
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,900
I don't want to do this to you

816
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,500
Yes, my man stands out

817
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,280
I like the way he moves around

818
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:34,600
Yes, my man stands out

819
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,520
I don't want to do this to you

820
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,700
Okay, just force me to

821
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,580
That's right

822
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,960
You're gonna be sorry

823
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,520
It's all forced movement, man

824
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,280
Point A to point B

825
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,000
Nice move

826
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,160
Okay, I'm gonna throw you right now

827
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,340
The judges are looking

828
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:50,040
Just keep a smile on your face

829
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,440
Hey, this dancing stuff's fun

830
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,480
That's right

831
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,520
You're digging it a little bit

832
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:55,680
Hey, when things work out

833
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,700
We'll take a little swig

834
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,740
Take a ride in my car

835
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:58,860
And have a little drink

836
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:59,460
What do you say?

837
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,760
My man stands out

838
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,940
Now put my hand back there

839
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,980
A little lower down your back

840
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:04,420
Ha!

841
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:04,620


842
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,340
Hey, hey, hey, hey

843
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,260
I don't mean to get fresh

844
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:07,760
That's all right

845
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,640
Attention all American citizens

846
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,140
And ships at sea

847
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,440
Better listen up

848
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,460
You are now being sequestered

849
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,740
To the state of New York

850
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,320
The reason I love him so much

851
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,940
He has the skin I love

852
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:22,040
Everybody

853
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,340
Please report to the transport unit

854
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:28,260
The transport units are descending promptly

855
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,460
The executions will begin tomorrow

856
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,180
The open-headed zipper boys

857
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,920
With the Coast Guard service

858
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,600
And the Naval Service

859
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,260
Seals, please remove the jelly

860
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,960
And exit to the rear of the Union

861
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,960
The building is getting much larger now

862
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,640
So we'd like all you boys and girls

863
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,300
And Marine suits

864
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,960
And all you other fellows in the service

865
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,300
Remember, we're fighting Tojo and Hitler for you

866
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,340
So make your way quickly

867
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,180
And no stops for a smoke

868
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,280
Dave, how does marching us soldiers

869
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,300
Into that arena

870
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,000
And us being machine-gunned

871
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,520
By those other soldiers

872
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,460
For a cheering crowd

873
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,600
How does that help

874
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:04,580
Help the soldiers?

875
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,660
Well, we're fighting Hitler and Tojo

876
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,960
Well, son

877
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,000
Didn't that happen

878
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,080
Wasn't that like a hundred years ago?

879
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,160
No, son

880
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,900
The fight between Tojo and Hitler

881
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,280
Just stopped last week

882
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,040
You see, there was this place called Munich

883
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,440
And it was 1939

884
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,360
And your grandpa, Onion Breath Bald Boy

885
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,260
He was the first one to be dressed

886
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:23,880
1039

887
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,100
Yes, of course it is

888
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,080
The time intersection is due in only 40 years

889
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,300
Well, we're not waiting for those 40 years to elapse, son

890
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,140
We're gonna

891
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:34,560
Just wait a minute

892
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,460
I've got a kind of fatherly tone to my voice now

893
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,660
I guess I'm kind of wizened and gray

894
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:39,980
I'm confused, man

895
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,440
No, there's just pumpkins around my knees

896
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,360
Well, anyway, we'll just continue on as usual

897
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,200
You see, Tojo and Hitler

898
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,980
Had a secret crystal

899
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:51,700
It was buried in a cave below WCSB

900
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,360
A long time ago

901
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,320
When the aliens was mining salt

902
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,140
Out of the Great Lake Erie

903
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:00,400
The greys decided to sell their technology

904
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,120
To Reichsmarschall Skorfen von Fleissneffer

905
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:04,560
And they were going to sell it to Hitler

906
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:06,000
Now, von Fleissneffer

907
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,920
Had a penchant for sadomasochistic pornography

908
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,180
And a love of dueling

909
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:15,620
But he also had a bad forehead

910
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,680
And that's, well, that's why we're stuck

911
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,420
And he hit the crystal

912
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:19,040
Yes

913
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,440
And that's why we're stuck in this frozen car right now

914
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,880
But, you see, the struggle goes on

915
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,700
It's like Guadalcanal, Bougainville, Iwo Jima

916
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:34,080
All them places where Americans fought their hearts out

917
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:34,560
And they were killed

918
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,480
We're doing it again today

919
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,960
Only we're slapping our own selves, Stanley

920
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,800
But it seems like it doesn't help anyone

921
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:46,140
It's like we're all dying just so that those rich people up in that box

922
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,320
Close your eyes, close your eyes

923
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:47,720
Here they come

924
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,780
Pretend you're dead

925
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,080
What are we supposed to do?

926
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,140
Fight or run or just die?

927
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:54,540
Just play dead

928
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:55,580
Close your eyes and play dead

929
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,520
They won't shoot you again if they think you're already dead

930
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,080
Is that where we put in the sound effects?

931
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,480
I don't know

932
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,460
It's really putting...

933
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,060
The sound effects

934
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:09,560
But I think we can maybe stick a bayonet in between the ribs of one of these two Portuguese sausages

935
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,140
I hope to God those were sound effects

936
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:11,560
Yeah

937
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,720
Just so long as they keep them coming hot and fresh

938
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,280
Like something laughing from the oven

939
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,040
This gun doesn't work

940
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,820
I'm tired of the subscript

941
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,860
Useless German equipment

942
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:27,400
No wonder we lost the Eastern Front

943
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,260
In the Western Back

944
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,220
This one needs...

945
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:34,400
Look at the silly...

946
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,640
Expressions on that one

947
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,940
You remember that...

948
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,540
What's it say?

949
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,140
Bob...

950
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,200
Bob Dobbs

951
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,620
See back in the old days?

952
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,500
The pipe is frozen in his mouth

953
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,220
The other one is wearing a cowboy hat

954
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,360
The other one is wearing earmuffs

955
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,020
With little decoders inside them

956
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:55,740
What?

957
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,660
Bob don't die on me now

958
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,680
Bob don't die

959
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,200
Stand clear from the doors

960
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,340
Please stand clear

961
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,640
From the closing doors

962
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:09,120
Please stand clear from the closing doors

963
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:09,960
There's sausages everywhere

964
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,560
Bob!

965
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,740
Bob don't you see they're frozen?

966
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,800
I had a wonderful dream

967
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:17,820
About...

968
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,560
It was the third rice showing

969
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,140
But it was the fourth and fifth and final one

970
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:28,140
And they were wearing these big dog booties

971
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,180
And strange pants and hats

972
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,860
And all the hats were so lovely

973
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,540
And they marched out of the house and said...

974
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,780
And they marched until our little poopers cried

975
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,560
And our feet were as bloody as the stones under Jesus

976
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,840
And then the rice marshals lined us up

977
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,880
And we danced and danced

978
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,040
And danced
