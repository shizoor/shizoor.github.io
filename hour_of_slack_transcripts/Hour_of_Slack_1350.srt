1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,780
This is Hour of Slack something.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,560
We are about to leave on a very long trip.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,980
We've just packed the car, and the timing is just horrible

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,000
because I have a terrible cold.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,340
So we'll be having the adventure of a lifetime,

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,820
or rather embarking on another adventure of this lifetime.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,960
Sick as a dog.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,380
A dog, I say!

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,040
Like a dirty dog.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,100
A low-down dog.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,740
It's funny because I haven't had a cold in, I mean, like five years.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,680
This is the first time I've been sick in that long,

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,920
and I'd have to get sick just on the day of packing and leaving,

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,380
which in the case of Subgenius Foundation,

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,280
packing is pretty complicated

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,300
because I have to take the entire mail-order business on the road

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:57,800
and I have to get it done.

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,040
All the computers, all the data, all the manufacturing equipment,

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:11,220
CDs, paper, boxes, pens, membership packs, everything, books,

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,420
takes up the whole back of the I-van.

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,720
And then the whole front is taken up with survival goods and crap.

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
Christmas presents.

23
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,720
Christmas presents, yes.

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,280
X is less than S-M-S presents.

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,480
Yes, this is actually December 2nd.

26
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,860
I'm hoping to make it to Texas,

27
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,860
Stangville, Stang Ranch, by December 16th.

28
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,960
This may be the last time you hear from us without

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,860
engine noise or puking.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,520
You're normally such a slacker.

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,580
It's the first time you've heard of me.

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,240
Are all four of you guys in here?

33
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:51,880
Is Phil in there?

34
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,800
He just, yeah, yeah.

35
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,220
Can we?

36
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,460
Doing with four?

37
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,120
Yeah, all four.

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,640
Okay.

39
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,200
What are we doing?

40
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,620
How do we?

41
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,000
This is...

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,920
This is...

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,200
Oh, yeah.

44
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,620
How about this is Phil, Phil, Pete, and Dave of the Firesign Theater.

45
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,300
This is Phil.

46
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,020
Phil.

47
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,560
Let's take it again.

48
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,940
Oh, Pete and Dave.

49
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,620
Okay, there we go, yeah.

50
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,780
All right, you over here?

51
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,800
You just shut up.

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,120
This is Phil.

53
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,400
Phil.

54
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:13,820
Pete.

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,220
And Dave of the Firesign Theater.

56
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,340
And we're listening to The Hour of Slack.

57
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,720
Hack, hack, hack, hack.

58
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,780
Because we're subgeniuses and we're slacking off.

59
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,840
And we've just...

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Decided not to leave today because I'm just too sick.

61
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,340
I mean with illness, not the way you're used to.

62
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,140
We're...

63
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:47,320
We decided that rather than drive into West Virginia on a Friday night,

64
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,000
going over twisty, twisty, twisty, turny hills

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,940
full of West Virginian drunks,

66
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,260
at 11 at night wasn't a good idea.

67
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,960
Instead, we're going to begin our vacation here at home by slacking off.

68
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,960
It seems to be a brainwashing facility of some type.

69
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,920
Wherever there's a brainwashing cult,

70
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,680
there's always a power-hungry leader behind it all.

71
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,740
Hurry home early.

72
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,200
Hurry on home.

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,940
Boom, boom, and scene is fighting.

74
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,800
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

75
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,820
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

76
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,980
Congratulations, Bob. You just hired me.

77
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,700
I live here, Bob.

78
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,140
I'm not looking for work anyway, Bob.

79
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:31,900
Good night, Bob.

80
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,880
I don't need any help from that damn Bob.

81
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,180
He offered me a job.

82
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,100
How would you guys support yourselves?

83
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,040
Haven't you ever heard of Bobby?

84
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,260
The best thing you can do is just lay on your back,

85
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,820
and you're going to bob around,

86
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,260
fairly high up in it.

87
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,700
I want full newspaper coverage.

88
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,120
I want magazine stories.

89
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,420
I want books.

90
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,280
I want films.

91
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,360
I want TV.

92
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,260
I want radio.

93
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,960
I want us on the air 24 hours a day.

94
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,920
This is our moment.

95
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,440
And a billion people around this planet

96
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,780
will watch it,

97
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:14,980
hear it,

98
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,600
and read about it

99
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,420
from the

100
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,220
Self Genius Hour of Swag.

101
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,700
There's no news.

102
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,760
Like bad news.

103
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,180
Bob News, everyone.

104
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,780
The Large did it.

105
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,800
And with this episode,

106
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,940
we begin a series weaving

107
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,220
the, uh,

108
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,680
oh, regular, quote-unquote,

109
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,660
hour of slack material

110
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,900
with on-the-road reports

111
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,880
from the 2010-11

112
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,320
subgenius family vacation

113
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,420
working and wonking

114
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,400
road trip,

115
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,060
which had a rough beginning and end,

116
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,680
but a great middle.

117
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,820
But first,

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,180
from Lemur,

119
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,160
this.

120
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,500
From PR News in Washington,

121
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,980
I'm in an alleged plot

122
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,100
to murder a Swedish cartoonist

123
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,080
for drawing a cartoon of tax breaks

124
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,300
for individuals and businesses

125
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,900
that expired in 2009.

126
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,100
A cartoonist would be eligible

127
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,200
to receive benefits

128
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,280
through the end of the year.

129
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,380
On Wall Street,

130
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,120
26, 10, 578,

131
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,940
11, 2343.

132
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,580
Iraqi election officials say

133
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,840
you're listening to PR News,

134
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,260
which is affiliated with

135
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,700
Northern Ireland's legislative

136
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,240
assembly.

137
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,880
The Northern Ireland assembly

138
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,440
was perhaps noisier

139
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,200
despite personal lobbying

140
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,720
by George W. Clinton,

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,200
88 to 17.

142
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,020
After a historic vote,

143
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,220
the White House is condemning

144
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,740
PR News.

145
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,200
The wonders of

146
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,420
subgenius family vacation.

147
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,640
We postponed our trip

148
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,660
for a day because

149
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,040
I was so sick,

150
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,760
I couldn't do anything but cough

151
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,340
and then groan in pain

152
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,300
because the coughs

153
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,720
were so ravaging on my throat

154
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,180
that my throat became

155
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,220
a bloody sore,

156
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,280
one might say.

157
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,800
His body was all coughing

158
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,220
and wracked with pain.

159
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,620
Yeah, so I laid in bed

160
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,440
all night long,

161
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,560
waiting for the next cough,

162
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,160
basically,

163
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,660
and a hawking spewed him down

164
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,440
into a little

165
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,400
trash can next to me.

166
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,140
I missed a few times

167
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,680
as I discovered in the morning

168
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,180
there was this,

169
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,120
like, collection of

170
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,260
yellow, green, brown

171
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,720
snot on my bed.

172
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,840
Now we're on our way

173
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,880
to Potter and Petal Nostrils

174
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,220
place in West Virginia.

175
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,540
We'll still end up driving

176
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,940
through twisty-turny

177
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,140
West Virginia hillbilly roads.

178
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,920
I still feel like crap,

179
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,820
but before I felt like,

180
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,160
well, what's worse than crap?

181
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,040
I guess I only feel like pee,

182
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:55,580
now.

183
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,340
I feel like pee,

184
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,580
but it's better than feeling like crap,

185
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,620
and it's still gonna be

186
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,620
somewhat dangerous,

187
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,840
but what the heck.

188
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,340
Hear how much better it is?

189
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,020
Uh-huh.

190
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,180
Sounds great.

191
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,000
It's actually a little bit

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,160
more productive now.

193
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:15,320
Comparatively.

194
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,640
And I've got a,

195
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,380
soon I'll have an empty cup

196
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,900
next to me to put my spew to me.

197
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,400
Ew!

198
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,760
I'll have a collection.

199
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,280
Hello, you.

200
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,720
You're on the air.

201
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,180
Oh, Dr. Sinister.

202
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,300
Ah, Reverend Stang.

203
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,320
How's your journey going?

204
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,560
Oh, it's fabulous.

205
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,260
I have been spreading

206
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,120
the Cleveland cold,

207
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,080
or the Clevelandia flu,

208
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,420
as the subgeniuses are calling it,

209
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,240
all the way from Ohio to Texas.

210
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,000
Everybody that we stayed with,

211
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,140
which was quite a few

212
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,080
of the better-known subgeniuses,

213
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,300
all got sick.

214
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,660
It affects every person,

215
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,100
completely differently.

216
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,640
For instance, I got it in my lungs

217
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,000
and coughed like a dinosaur

218
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,140
all night long, every night,

219
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,480
for a week and a half.

220
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,180
Had to sleep sitting up

221
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,220
like the elephant man.

222
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,860
Princess Wee, it caused her

223
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,700
to have a high-pitched squeal

224
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,760
in her right ear.

225
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,560
Impacted stuff.

226
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,840
That happened to me,

227
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,820
actually, recently.

228
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,600
The ear thing.

229
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,980
Well, we went to a party

230
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,640
in Madison, Ohio, just, you know,

231
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,420
it was at Thanksgiving,

232
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,120
and the host of the party

233
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,920
had it then.

234
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,500
Several other people that we know

235
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,620
got it afterwards.

236
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,660
One of them hallucinated,

237
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,240
got a high fever and hallucinated.

238
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,820
Those are the best kind of hallucinations,

239
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,120
the fever-induced ones.

240
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,220
I had a couple of nights of fever,

241
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,940
and it caused me not exactly fever dreams.

242
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,200
It was more like a completely random surrealist,

243
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,660
or more like a Dadaist slideshow,

244
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,500
because there wasn't anything

245
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,160
interesting or fun in it.

246
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,500
It wasn't pornography.

247
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,440
It wasn't memories.

248
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,680
It was just, you know,

249
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,320
an image of an ironing board,

250
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,300
an image of a sink,

251
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,620
an image of a cup.

252
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,900
You know, just like really stupid

253
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,900
hallucinations.

254
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,960
I'm over it now,

255
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,740
and I'm hoping to pick up

256
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,920
a new stomach virus

257
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,660
from my sister-in-law here.

258
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,120
Oh, that's great.

259
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,880
I'm going to get it west.

260
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,600
But, yeah, they're calling me

261
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,260
Typhoid Ivan now,

262
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,420
or Patient Zero.

263
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,980
There you go.

264
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,260
Or Captain Trips,

265
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,900
as I prefer.

266
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,600
Stain County, Texas.

267
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,760
Come for the lungful of phlegm.

268
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,880
Stay for the fever-induced hallucinations.

269
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,420
Well, we're about to leave

270
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,600
Potter and Petal Nostrils Place

271
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,340
in West Virginia.

272
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,780
Had a good night's sleep

273
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,180
and got fed wonderfully.

274
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,060
Mm-hmm.

275
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,440
And I'm still sick.

276
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,640
Pure slack was served.

277
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,060
Well, and that medicine,

278
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,640
Jane Hash's killer death medicine,

279
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,500
the potion.

280
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,700
Keeps us alive.

281
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,440
Yeah, it was pretty strong stuff.

282
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,400
It's like onion, horseradish,

283
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,500
ginger, hot pepper, garlic.

284
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,960
And cider vinegar.

285
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,800
All stewed together.

286
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,320
And garlic and garlic.

287
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:21,820
Pure raid.

288
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,680
Nothing cooked.

289
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,880
Yeah, I was hoping it would...

290
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,200
Raw.

291
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,440
I was hoping it would have instant effects,

292
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,020
but it didn't.

293
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,160
We can give you another dose.

294
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,600
It's a potion, best sir.

295
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,060
Yeah.

296
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,120
Yeah.

297
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,260
It's got food on your stomach.

298
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,400
Anyway, we have to leave

299
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,200
and try to make it to...

300
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,220
Find your way out of America's own third world.

301
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:42,920


302
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:42,920


303
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,360
You must find your way out of

304
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,760
America's own third world.

305
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,080
Oh, but we have a GPS.

306
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,860
That's a first world machine.

307
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,320
It'll tell us everything.

308
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,460
That's our GPS, Jack.

309
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,120
Jack sometimes doesn't know shit.

310
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,200
Because he will often direct us

311
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,800
in just the opposite way

312
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,540
that our friends direct us.

313
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,380
And I'm beginning to suspect

314
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,600
that Jack was programmed

315
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,060
by redneck cannibals.

316
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,200
To take you ever further

317
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,360
into redneck cannibal land.

318
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,860
You know, it's like technically,

319
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,200
yeah, this might be a quicker way

320
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,540
as the crow flies,

321
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,600
but we're not crows.

322
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,020
And its natural tendency

323
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,740
is to put you on the interstates,

324
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,140
but sometimes we want to take

325
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,060
the scenic routes,

326
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,440
and we disobey Jack,

327
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,320
and he has to recalculate.

328
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,700
Sometimes he's cooperative,

329
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,840
and other times what he says just...

330
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,880
doesn't make sense.

331
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,000
Potter said to go into Charleston

332
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,720
to get on 60,

333
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,380
but Jack was going to send us

334
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,100
into redneck cannibal territory

335
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,240
first to get on 60.

336
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,940
And I just don't trust Jack that much.

337
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,840
No, he's twisted.

338
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,520
I think you're right.

339
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
I think he was programmed

340
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,200
by some redneck...

341
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,620
Cannibals.

342
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,520
Cannibals, yeah.

343
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,380
Yeah.

344
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,640
Chainsaw Massacre folks.

345
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,340
West Virginia Chainsaw Massacre.

346
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:24,780
Yeah.

347
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,940
You sure have a pretty mouth, boy.

348
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,800
Why don't you just drop them panties?

349
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,860
I want you to pray,

350
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,300
and you better pray good.

351
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,420
It might be worth it in terms of

352
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,280
fun dilapos to photograph.

353
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,920
Or lappies.

354
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,460
We've shortened it now to lappies.

355
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,000
On our first trip,

356
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,540
we were always looking for

357
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,520
dilapidated buildings,

358
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,680
which got pretty quickly shortened to dilapos.

359
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,600
But now we're just basically going,

360
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,720
oh, that was a good lappy.

361
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,800
I think I got a picture of it.

362
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,220
The best is yet to come.

363
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,900
Are you driving on those vibrating wheels?

364
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,660
We did.

365
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,220
Yeah.

366
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,440
We're going to the

367
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,900
The vibrato stress.

368
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,320
Yeah, it drives me nut.

369
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,120
But the point is that we're free here,

370
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,320
free to bendy about the most offensive,

371
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,820
concept. We had Nazis

372
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,760
on our stage belching

373
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,460
forth hatred and

374
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,560
we've had terrible fights

375
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,400
in our midst with

376
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,220
radios being smashed,

377
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,160
crockery fractured,

378
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,020
and tears and

379
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,480
departures of indignant

380
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,760
subgenie and subgeniettes in a huff.

381
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,780
So sad.

382
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,040
As the fatal hour

383
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,580
grows closer,

384
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,540
so will not the tensions

385
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,580
until finally

386
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,740
like a boil giving

387
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,280
way to erupt in

388
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,460
turbulent matter, the

389
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,700
tensions will resolve themselves

390
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,680
one way or the other. That's why we

391
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,500
need that big hygienic

392
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,280
gleaming to come down

393
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,680
and save us from our

394
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,880
human predicament.

395
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,240
We're

396
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,680
still trying to get those

397
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,660
exists to pay attention

398
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,360
to our navigational signal

399
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,740
and when they

400
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,200
do,

401
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,120
we'll get this little matter of the landing

402
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,240
fixed.

403
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,940
And that's my ruin.

404
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,240
So we're traveling along,

405
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,980
jogging along the ancient roads

406
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,780
of subgenius doctrine.

407
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,220
It's like a dream.

408
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,200
I wish I'd brought more bob heads.

409
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,700
Somebody oil my wheelchair.

410
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,240
I wish I'd brought about a half a dozen bob heads.

411
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,880
There's old man Stang,

412
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,060
a victim of senile dementia.

413
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,520
Cranky, liable as anything to whack you with your

414
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,040
special steel tipped, gold bob headed cane.

415
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,020
I know Bob Dobbs for what he was.

416
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,400
I know subgeniuses for what they were.

417
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,440
What's that old timer?

418
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Speak into the rectifier here for our listening audience.

419
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,480
While crossing the plains, my family was rubbed out

420
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,540
by a tribe of wild subgeniuses.

421
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,420
They were massagers, masseurs?

422
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,580
I was raised among them.

423
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,460
At least they had that effect.

424
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:41,820
I learned their ways.

425
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,240
Hmm, their ways, eh?

426
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,020
Later I became a wild subgenius.

427
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,800
I was a wildlife photographer and I became the Jane Goodall of the pagans.

428
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,400
They would accept me among them and I was able to photograph their strange rituals.

429
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,140
That's pretty...

430
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,320
They's just like monkeys to you.

431
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,500
Well, I...

432
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:09,120
No, don't you confuse chimpanzees with monkeys and pagans.

433
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,660
Absolutely.

434
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,320
They're different.

435
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,680
They's just like chimps to you.

436
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,000
They are quite different, the monkeys and pagans, and especially chimps.

437
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,420
Well, chimps and pagans are quite similar.

438
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,000
They make good girlfriends and boyfriends for subgeniuses.

439
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,920
I had a chimp.

440
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,140
But what about that story?

441
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,480
He was a pagan chimp.

442
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:34,300
That story that Russian scientists tried to create a hybrid of chimpanzee and human as

443
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,500
a perfect soldier for the scientific socialist state.

444
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,960
That explains a lot.

445
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,620
I was reading that same article in Playboy at Pappy's house.

446
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,480
It's true.

447
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,600
There was a history article.

448
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:46,980
They brought him to the hospital.

449
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,580
They brought him to the hospital.

450
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,700
And the Russians really did try to create a hybrid.

451
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,180
And it's not entirely clear that they didn't.

452
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:53,940
I know.

453
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,780
That's the terrifying thing.

454
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,680
They...

455
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,480
They're...

456
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,900
You can't know for sure that they did, but there's also no evidence that they did not.

457
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:02,920
Hello.

458
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,180
You're on the air, in a manner of speaking.

459
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,620
Are you there?

460
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,560
Dierks.

461
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:11,580
Dierks.

462
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,120
Dierks.

463
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,800
Dierks.

464
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,360
We're about to be in Dierks.

465
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,580
We're going to be in Dierks.

466
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:16,860
Amen.

467
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:16,980
Dierks.

468
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:16,980


469
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:16,980


470
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:16,980


471
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:16,980


472
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:16,980


473
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:16,980


474
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:16,980


475
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:16,980


476
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:16,980


477
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:16,980


478
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,000


479
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,260
My leg hurts, but I'm fine now.

480
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,340
I remember Dierks.

481
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,460
Dierks.

482
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,420
Dierks.

483
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,020
Dierks has a cafe in it!

484
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,460
Dierks has a gas station.

485
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,160
Dierks has a gas station!

486
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,500
Dierks.

487
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,980
Dierks.

488
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,280
We're going to be in Dierks in a second!

489
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,840
Dierks!

490
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:46,980


491
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:46,980


492
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:46,980


493
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:46,980


494
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:46,980


495
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:46,980


496
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:46,980


497
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,900
Dierks

498
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,040
The first assembly of God is in Dierks

499
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,280
There's the Church of Christ

500
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,340
I remember this

501
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,360
I remember it's up in that hill

502
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,480
It don't look like a church

503
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,860
It looks like a junkyard

504
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,660
It's beautiful

505
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,040
It's the Lord's

506
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,540
It's where the Lord lives

507
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,760
There's top of the hill

508
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,200
Dierks Drive-In

509
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
Dierks is my favorite town

510
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,880
The Forestry Commission Headquarters is there too

511
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,420
Here in Howard County

512
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,740
Hello my friends in Dierks

513
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,920
I'm happy to see all you folks in Dierks

514
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,640
Oh there's a good lappy

515
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,200
I'm lappy happy

516
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,400
I like them to lappos

517
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,880
Outlaw Quick Clean

518
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,840
Outlaw Quick Clean is the best

519
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,300
Here's the Mayor's House

520
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,380
Oh

521
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:46,460
Oh

522
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,680
Sorry it closed

523
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,940
Down here at the end of the street

524
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,600
There's the place we stop in

525
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,960
To see my girlfriend

526
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,760
Your girlfriend?

527
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,220
Yeah

528
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,100
Don't you remember my girlfriend from Dierks?

529
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,060
No

530
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,580
My girl in Dierks

531
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,920
There's Dierks Pharmacy

532
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,020
Farm Bureau

533
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,320
Mattress

534
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,760
Trans Clothing Boutique

535
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,460
What's gone wrong with you?

536
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,280
What's going on with Dierks?

537
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,380
Ravens Flower and Gifts

538
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,400
They have beautiful things in there

539
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,100
Dierks is so beautiful

540
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,240
Dierks is my favorite town

541
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,060
This is it

542
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,320
That's got the whole super stop

543
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,180
Am I supposed to stop there?

544
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,800
Well it is Dierks

545
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,460
And it is the super stop

546
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,640
But that's okay

547
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,460
We can find a Cheeboogie

548
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,440
Maybe there'll be a Cheeboogie there

549
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,620
Cheeboogie here in Dierks

550
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,660
They modernized quite a bit

551
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,420
Dierks has grown up

552
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,160
Dierks is a big city now

553
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,840
There's the prayer center

554
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,380
It's not very big

555
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,280
God can hear tiny prayers

556
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,000
You did see that Newt Gingrich

557
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,900
Wants to have a giant lunar city

558
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,740
Constructed by the end of his second term

559
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,320
In office

560
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,420
And it'll be the 51st state

561
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,280
Man that sounds cool

562
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,400
Yeah no other candidate

563
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,360
Has announced that

564
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,320
That gets my vote

565
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,480
For that one thing

566
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,100
I don't care about anything else

567
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,320
Herman Cain's Plan 9 from Outer Space

568
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,700
That was a good one too

569
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,340
So they have Moonbase Zero

570
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,320
Dimension 4

571
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,920
Moonbase Zero with Commander Newt

572
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,120
At the head of

573
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,500
Do you think they'll have like shuttles

574
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,180
That go to the moon and we can go up there

575
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:44,860
And check it out

576
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,220
First

577
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,820
The guy's got to get elected

578
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,780
This is your radio operator

579
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,500
Doug Smith

580
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,360
We'll bring you a piece of that green cheese

581
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:52,940
For sure

582
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,880
We're recording

583
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,260
I'm gonna vote for Newt

584
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:55,760
Just because

585
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,080
Everything's going fine

586
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,120
Just because

587
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,100
If he gets

588
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,720
If he does

589
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,040
I just thought I'd try the

590
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,980
The phone thing

591
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,880
Yeah try the phone again

592
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,820
Anybody there?

593
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,280
Hello?

594
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,800
Is anyone there?

595
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,420
Is anybody out there?

596
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:08,940
I heard somebody

597
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,260
I don't hear anyone the way I'm supposed to

598
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,640
But now I pull it near

599
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,900
Near my hate

600
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,300
I'm now speaking to you

601
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,220
I'm speaking to Pete Goldie

602
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,080
But he can't be heard

603
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,660
Over the equipment

604
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,140
Because of a strange

605
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,600
Electrical disturbance

606
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,160
Try holding the

607
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,980
But as you know

608
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,880
We're doing the

609
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,180
Can we be heard over the equipment?

610
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,000
Subjects All Stars show here

611
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,900
And I hope you're enjoying it

612
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,360
Up to now

613
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,040
Hold Pete up to the mic

614
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,220
And see if we can hear

615
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,160
A tinny little Pete voice

616
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,500
Pete?

617
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,460
Pete?

618
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,500
Yeah he could turn on his speakerphone

619
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,620
Leslie suggested

620
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,300
So I can hear him

621
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,060
Alright

622
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,960
It's like a ghost

623
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,800
It's just too

624
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
He's got a deal working with

625
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,120
Newt and his moon colony

626
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,260
I'm gonna see if I can amplify

627
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,100
Yeah he sounds like he's coming from

628
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,780
Simple thing

629
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,520
I'll just keep talking about

630
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,940
My future on the moon

631
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,400
Which I cannot wait

632
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,460
To join the other moon colonists

633
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,020
And live in the moon

634
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,500
That's right

635
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,880
I wanna vote for Newt too

636
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,740
It'll be a wonderful time in the moon

637
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,860
And the best part about

638
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,720
Yes but

639
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,080
We will finally have the chance

640
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,000
To beat the moon people

641
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,500
It'll be great

642
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,720
Once and for all

643
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,540
Thanks to Newt

644
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,980
Thanks to Newt

645
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,900
Thanks to someone with foresight

646
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,060
It's going to be a wonderful time

647
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,640
Thanks to near Kingridge

648
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,340
Me and all the other supporters

649
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,540
Of Space Commander Newt Kingridge

650
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,360
But he has to be elected first

651
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,240
And also Neil deGrasse Tyson

652
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,060
Was saying he was off base

653
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,860
So to speak

654
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,960
Bring back Dr. Howe

655
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,560
Do you think he'll really keep

656
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,460
That campaign promise though

657
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,740
About making the moon base?

658
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,780
Absolutely

659
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,240
Newt Kingridge is the man of his word

660
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,600
We have never seen him

661
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,520
Who's backed down

662
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,940
On anything he's ever said

663
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,280
He is the man who will take us

664
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,920
To the moon

665
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,180
And defeat those moon people

666
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,620
Well you know Dr. Goldie

667
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,620
The Ask Dr. Howe show

668
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,900
Doesn't give political endorsements

669
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,500
To potential candidates

670
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,340
I know he's never backed down

671
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,260
On two marriages

672
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,440
We're not asking for your endorsement

673
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,460
We're just asking for your acquiescence

674
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,500
To the overpowering vision

675
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,920
Of this moon man

676
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,840
Well I brought him here

677
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,380
To put it up didn't I?

678
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,820
I thought it was worth mentioning

679
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,320
Didn't I?

680
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,300
So

681
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,460
It is important

682
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,160
And thank you for bringing it

683
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,020
To our attention

684
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,140
That's right

685
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,200
Why's that?

686
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,460
Yes

687
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,960
Now remember folks

688
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,160
You can be an atheist

689
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,640
And a subgenius

690
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:45,840
Right?

691
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,020
Because you can be alone

692
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,720
With Bob

693
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,920
And Bob's not necessarily

694
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,160
Your god anyway

695
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,380
I'm returning

696
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,140
And thank you so much

697
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,320
Pete Goldie

698
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,120
I mean I don't want to

699
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,340
Worship him like a god

700
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:58,920
That's okay

701
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,240
When they get to the moon

702
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,000
They're going to find

703
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,640
A British flag there

704
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,000
Put there in the year

705
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,960
Of our lord 1899

706
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,980
You can turn your mic down now

707
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,600
Dr. Howe

708
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,560
I will

709
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,920
And I'm terribly sorry

710
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,320
I had it turned completely up

711
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,120
Because of that

712
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,340
That's why I kept saying

713
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:15,440
Stay away

714
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,260
You need to stand back

715
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:16,880
Yes

716
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,840
It was the

717
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,320
The Pete Goldie

718
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,240
I was about to slug you

719
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,740
Well I'm glad that we

720
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,960
Now you can turn it up

721
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,880
Before then

722
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,100
I think you need to be louder

723
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,720
I sometimes

724
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,060
Think of

725
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,440
Daffodils

726
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,520
Hollyhocks

727
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,240
I'm not a control freak

728
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,700
Tiny

729
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,040
Juttering

730
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,160
Leprechauns

731
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,680
Weeping over them

732
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,420
We're going to get some food man

733
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,800
Yes you need to satisfy

734
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,560
The inner man

735
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,180
To get some beef

736
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,540
That will stick to your ribs

737
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,300
Maybe beef ribs

738
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,140
So

739
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,500
I

740
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,640
A bean burrito would work

741
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,780
Bean burrito

742
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,920
Ah well

743
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,680
They have those

744
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,820
A plenty

745
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,700
I like them

746
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,020
Because they bark back later

747
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,660
I want to

748
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,480
When I go back

749
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,340
We're going to go through

750
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:58,960
Gilroy

751
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,440
And try the garlic ice cream

752
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,680
It's an unfashionable belief

753
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,600
In the atheist community

754
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,520
But truth

755
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,180
Just needs to be stated

756
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,900
It doesn't have to be hyped

757
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,880
I know

758
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,080
I do a lot of hyping of atheism

759
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,460
But remember what Bob Dobbs said

760
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,120
I'm not a fan of atheism

761
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,320
I don't practice what I preach

762
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,060
Because I'm not the kind of person

763
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,860
I'm preaching to

764
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,720
There is no God

765
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,920
And that's a simple truth

766
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,820
If every trace of any single religion

767
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,760
Were wiped out

768
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,280
And nothing were passed on

769
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,720
It would never be created

770
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,180
Exactly that way again

771
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,780
There might be some other nonsense

772
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,520
In its place

773
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,280
But not that exact nonsense

774
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,680
If all of science were wiped out

775
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,820
It would still be true

776
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,360
And someone would find a way

777
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,660
To figure it all out again

778
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,460
Reverend Penn Gillette's

779
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,040
Audio book

780
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,080
Of his autobiographical musings

781
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,760
Called God Know

782
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,640
Quoting Bob

783
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,000
That book is hilarious

784
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,840
And brilliant by the way

785
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,920
At least the audio book is

786
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,960
And now a clip

787
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,900
From WCSB Cleveland's

788
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,220
Radio Synesthesia

789
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,700
Called Into from California

790
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,240
By Philodrum and Puzzling Evidence

791
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,820
Yours truly

792
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,940
And the buzz of Lonesome Cowboy Dave

793
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,660
I'm experiencing a funny sort of an echo

794
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,800
Philo's on the other side of the closet from me

795
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,000
And yet when he speaks

796
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,080
I hear him on the phone

797
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,300
About half a second later

798
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,180
You're like doing the Groucho and Zeppo

799
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,760
Like mirror routine

800
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,500
That's like talking to people

801
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,400
That was a classic man

802
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,320
On their way to the moon

803
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,140
I used to have

804
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,820
I used to have that movie

805
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,760
It was a duck soup

806
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,740
That was what it was in right?

807
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,640
Yes

808
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,740
I used to have that

809
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,640
A VHS tape of that movie

810
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,220
And I wish I did

811
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,740
It takes a long time to get

812
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,360
To the other side of the closet

813
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,620
Reverend Stang

814
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,460
The big closet

815
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,940
I've personally had nightmares

816
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,740
There are really big scary closets

817
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,560
In this place

818
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,160
Yeah

819
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,760
Each closet has another sub-closet

820
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,520
Behind it

821
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,500
It's like the closet

822
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,560
That Dr. Stanger Gary or something

823
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,800
Each one is inhabited by this tiny little creature

824
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,980
That sings or something

825
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,280
Or maybe that's a lady

826
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,720
In the radio

827
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,380
Or a radiator or something

828
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:14,920
But you know what I mean

829
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,800
The Akashic Records

830
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,380
Kind of

831
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,500
A little tiny singing lady

832
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,060
No bigger than a pipsqueak

833
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,740
Yep

834
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,680
As new as

835
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,320
Large as

836
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,420
Little radiator twins

837
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,960
That bring Mothra

838
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,900
Only in my version

839
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,180
Oh yeah

840
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,480
David Lynch

841
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,440
I love those ladies

842
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:33,740
Mothra

843
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,100
Tinkerbell

844
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,640
Mothra

845
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,000
For instance

846
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,720
I like that

847
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,200
Tinkerbell is a good example

848
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,980
I don't believe in fairies

849
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,660
I don't believe in fairies

850
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,540
I don't believe in fairies

851
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,260
I just killed three of them

852
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:47,820
You just killed?

853
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,340
I just killed three

854
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,660
It's like shooting fish in a barrel

855
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,340
I can't believe how

856
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,460
I am

857
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:55,780
Hey man

858
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,260
I am

859
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,980
I am

860
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,840
I am Dr. Sinister

861
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,160
Okay

862
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,720
Right

863
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,860
You know

864
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,500
You are a cruel and evil type of guy

865
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,620
And so you

866
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,380
You feel

867
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,900
You're compunction to go around

868
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,360
Killing millions of fairies

869
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,020
Just by disallowing their existence

870
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,520
In your

871
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,340
You know

872
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,560
I'm trying to remember this

873
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,280
I had this conversation

874
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,220
The other day

875
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,020
Talking about some

876
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,700
Some you know

877
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,920
Pen and paper role playing game

878
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,340
And I'm trying to remember

879
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,020
Which one it was

880
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,380
There was

881
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,420
There was some kind of game

882
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,060
In which like

883
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,140
People would use magic

884
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,720
But like

885
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,440
You could have like

886
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
A skepticism skill

887
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,320
Or something like that

888
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:24,700
And like

889
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,140
If you scored high enough

890
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:26,700
On this role

891
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,820
To disbelieve

892
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,540
Then you could nullify

893
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,400
Someone else's magic

894
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,080
Did that actually happen or not?

895
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,680
I can't remember

896
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,320
If that was a particular game

897
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,480
It was a game

898
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,300
A role game

899
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,280
I want to say

900
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:36,760
It was in some

901
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,560
It was in some

902
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,700
I want to say

903
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,160
It was in some game

904
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,580
I played once

905
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,140
But I don't remember

906
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,820
Real life

907
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,200
I don't

908
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,400
I don't believe

909
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,240
I don't believe

910
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,040
I don't believe

911
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,760
I don't believe

912
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,640
Then all the religions

913
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,480
Would go away

914
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,380
And God would get some rest

915
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,160
For a change

916
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,460
Without all that whining

917
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,420
And whimpering

918
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,960
People begging for stuff

919
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,800
All the time

920
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,240
Really?

921
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:57,980
Oh my

922
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,040
I concurred with that

923
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,320
Naturally

924
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,680
I just love it

925
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,000
How like

926
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,660
Athletes

927
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,540
Become like

928
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,460
Really super religious

929
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,160
So they're like

930
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,820
They thank God

931
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,700
For their victory

932
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,840
Yeah

933
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,120
Yeah

934
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,060
Because

935
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,640
They proclaim all their deity

936
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,300
And so forth

937
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,240
And give everybody

938
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,940
Athletes

939
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,200
Feats

940
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,380
The nice deity

941
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,280
Did help them

942
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:15,780
They did

943
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,200
They did

944
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,580
They did

945
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,600
See if they just

946
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,500
Let Jesus wash them

947
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,360
They wouldn't have that problem

948
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:19,980
That's right

949
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,240
If the Lord would sit down

950
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,980
For a little while

951
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,500
And have a little

952
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,360
Footy wash

953
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,740
Cheeky smooch

954
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,320
And everything would be

955
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,700
All about

956
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,140
Logos

957
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,780
Placebo

958
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,200
Fire

959
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,640
To smoke

960
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,480
Their enemies

961
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,380
Behind them

962
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,300
Aaron

963
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:34,700
David

964
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,160
Or

965
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
Somebody

966
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,760
Moab

967
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,100
Or

968
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,160
Jason

969
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,240
The Argonauts

970
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,180
The Shepherds

971
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,840
The Argonauts

972
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,440
Something like that

973
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,740
Yeah

974
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,780
That's all I could understand

975
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,000
Was something about Moab

976
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,680
Being you know

977
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,160
While he's a

978
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,000
I may have gotten

979
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,860
Some of the details

980
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,620
Confused

981
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,260
But it's something like that

982
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,360
Pretty close anyway

983
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
You could you know

984
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,940
Delete the first few sentences

985
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,780
And invert the other part

986
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,700
But then

987
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,340
It wouldn't make any more sense

988
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,180
Than it did

989
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:08,940
Yeah

990
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,140
It wouldn't make any more sense

991
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,880
Than it does now

992
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,400
That's right

993
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,900
Well that's for sure

994
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,800
Whoever said it had to make sense

995
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,720
Yeah

996
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,640
It's a

997
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,900
You don't use your mind

998
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,160
To think about your religion

999
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,200
That's wrecked it all up

1000
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,540
You're trying to make

1001
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,060
You're trying to make sense of it

1002
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,980
What's the point of having a religion

1003
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,900
It doesn't make no sense

1004
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,140
That's why it's a religion

1005
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,080
I think your brain's exposed

1006
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,200
Saving your skull

1007
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,720
With those

1008
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,800
Spoons again

1009
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,260
I'll

1010
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,880
Do something about that

1011
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,180
You can't taste your tongue

1012
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,880
You can't smell it

1013
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,640
Yes you can actually

1014
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,240
I mean what's a booger gonna smell like

1015
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,540
But

1016
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,120
Actually

1017
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,680
What does a booger smell like

1018
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,440
Actually you know what

1019
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,760
I'm going to say that I do know

1020
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
What my tongue tastes like

1021
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,020
And I

1022
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,100
Do know what a booger smells like

1023
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,840
What does a booger smell like

1024
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,420
Are you eating a booger

1025
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,260
It's actually not very pleasant

1026
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,240
Is it all your bodily parts

1027
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,820
Or the essence and juices

1028
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,240
It's got kind of a mucusy smell too

1029
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,680
I think you know what a booger smells like

1030
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,560
But this could be subject to debate

1031
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,560
I knew of people in the school

1032
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,840
When I was very young

1033
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,880
They had the old radiators in them

1034
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,660
The old buildings

1035
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,740
And if you put your booger

1036
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,200
On the radiators

1037
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,920
It would make this really rank smell

1038
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,360
That would get you thrown out of class

1039
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,780
As a troublemaker

1040
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,380
And that's true

1041
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,400
It would get you high though

1042
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,160
That's the question

1043
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,820
That's

1044
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,480
See that was the secret to my childhood

1045
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,020
You know it's like

1046
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,660
I tried to get into as much trouble as I could

1047
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,380
While I was still young enough

1048
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,100
To get away with it

1049
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,400
And still be able to levitate too

1050
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,340
At the same time

1051
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,900
Cause you know

1052
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,060
When they start shooting at you

1053
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,740
I was never able to levitate

1054
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,100
You can't embezzle

1055
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,300
Fifty million dollars

1056
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,280
When you're like

1057
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,660
You know in fourth grade

1058
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,020
Everybody got pissed

1059
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,580
Guess now you better not do that again

1060
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,760
You do it when it's grown up

1061
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,020
Oh

1062
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,180
All of a sudden

1063
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,100
It's federal offense

1064
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,300
Seriously trying to take

1065
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,080
All the fun out of life

1066
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,240
I think Stan is speaking directly

1067
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,720
To a very important issue

1068
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,540
We should all be trying

1069
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,120
To get children

1070
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,780
Who's yodeling?

1071
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,440
A pickle

1072
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,300
The gherkins

1073
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,280
I think it's a

1074
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,240
Lonesome pickle

1075
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,100
That's my yodeling pickle

1076
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,040
Don't be

1077
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,340
Don't be jerking us you gherkin

1078
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,640
No it's the jerking

1079
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,780
It's the only thing I could

1080
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,100
It's an intelligent pickle

1081
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,120
They grow them out here

1082
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,440
And it's the only thing

1083
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,860
We can teach it is one thing

1084
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,280
And I taught this one to yodel

1085
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,200
Yodeling

1086
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,360
Huh

1087
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,720
Now that

1088
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,120
That to me sounds like a

1089
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,840
You know what

1090
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,160
This is

1091
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,420
I had to think for a minute

1092
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,140
What cruel game was he playing?

1093
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,440
WCSB Cleveland

1094
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,800
That's correct

1095
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,260
Now look inside Mr. Danger

1096
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,980
What do you see?

1097
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,860
That's easy

1098
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,640
That's a good one

1099
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:42,960
A pickle

1100
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,240
Very good

1101
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,420
Now I think you're ready for this

1102
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,140
New and improved pickle

1103
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,960
Yep

1104
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,880
That's how it works

1105
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,600
See that sounds like

1106
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,520
Rocky Rococo

1107
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,220
Doing the old

1108
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,000
Seven-five on the jive hive

1109
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,380
Is that what's up

1110
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,340
With down in the land

1111
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,540
Of Piccolo Pocono, Daddy?

1112
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,160
That's where all of the

1113
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,260
Inspiration comes from

1114
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,100
The Fireside Theater

1115
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,180
And the committee

1116
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,420
And the association

1117
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,020
And

1118
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,400
Nick

1119
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,440
Oh Nick

1120
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,200
I just noticed

1121
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,640
You were

1122
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,380
In the address

1123
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,400
And a pair of

1124
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,360
Which gave birth to

1125
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,840
Second City

1126
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,700
Which gave birth to

1127
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,300
Saturday Night Live

1128
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,380
Which gave birth to

1129
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,260
Dierks

1130
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,200
What is Dierks?

1131
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,660
Dierks is in our past now

1132
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,960
Well at least we still got

1133
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,100
Dequeen to go

1134
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,060
King and Dequeen isn't it?

1135
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,020
King is near Dequeen

1136
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,480
But we don't go through King

1137
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:31,900
No

1138
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,200
Dierks is a city of beauty

1139
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,420
And culture

1140
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,980
Center of culture in

1141
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,000
Western Arkansas

1142
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,020
I did not have sex with that woman

1143
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,360
He came to Arkansas and his voice turned into

1144
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,840
William Jefferson Clinton

1145
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,160
Bill Clinton even

1146
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,500
My brain doesn't work anymore

1147
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,840
The spirit of William Jefferson Clinton took over

1148
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,040
And I did not have sex with that woman

1149
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,040
I jacked off on her face

1150
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,240
And got a little bit of a blow job

1151
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,480
A couple of times

1152
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,980
And I just said

1153
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,680
I came once

1154
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,180
I did not have sex with her

1155
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,200
Sex is when you put your dick in their pussy

1156
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,600
Blow job isn't sex

1157
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,340
No I didn't have sex with them unless you count blow jobs

1158
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,400
Stumpy don't mind

1159
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,600
Stumpy don't care

1160
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,100
Stumpy doesn't mind

1161
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,060
Stumpy doesn't mind

1162
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:04,140
Uncle I have a big revenge on Edward

1163
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,220
FÍjas

1164
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,960
ASMR

1165
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,660
on my right ear, and I hear it later in time B in my left ear.

1166
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,760
He's freaking him out.

1167
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,720
He's freaking him out.

1168
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,700
Mental vertigo.

1169
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,540
Mental vertigo.

1170
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,340
Mental vertigo.

1171
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,100
This has been a season of time control.

1172
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,460
Right.

1173
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,400
It's not synesthesia.

1174
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,080
With that kind of...

1175
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,820
Wait, it is synesthesia.

1176
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,720
It is synesthesia.

1177
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,320
It is synesthesia.

1178
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,200
I think they're trying to steal the contents of your mind, Dang.

1179
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,580
That's what's going on.

1180
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,660
We just emptied them out.

1181
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,940
You can't steal what ain't there.

1182
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,040
We're going to start to scale our reproduction.

1183
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,620
Right, yeah.

1184
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,540
I was going to say.

1185
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,040
I don't think we have a lot of population.

1186
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,740
This mind isn't everything, isn't it?

1187
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,420
Hey, let's steal this empty box.

1188
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,280
Hey, who's kissing the donkey back there in the background?

1189
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,300
Stand up or be fleshed out.

1190
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,580
I can see you.

1191
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,940
I know who you are.

1192
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,060
Is somebody imitating me, you know, copulating with a burrito or something?

1193
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,360
Really?

1194
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,780
That's an automatic noise that comes out of...

1195
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,800
Speaking of which.

1196
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,980
We've got to pause to remind everyone.

1197
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,300
This portions of the following broadcast will be objectionable to some members of the audience,

1198
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,920
which is why we advise listener discretion.

1199
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:21,420
The views and opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of WCSB or Cleveland

1200
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:21,960
State University.

1201
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,860
And let's continue.

1202
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,200
Not necessarily.

1203
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,660
I like that.

1204
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,280
Or any other station that might get played on later.

1205
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,180
You know what I heard?

1206
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,080
I heard an awesome...

1207
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,800
I heard an awesome...

1208
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,460
I heard an awesome, awesome story yesterday from our general manager.

1209
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,940
So those of us who live here in Cleveland and listen to this podcast, we're going to

1210
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:46,720
the station locally over the good old fashioned FM airwaves, are probably familiar with

1211
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,100
this situation where this Canadian Christian station kind of bleeds in on us sometimes

1212
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,440
due to an atmosphere condition.

1213
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,380
Apparently...

1214
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,820
Apparently...

1215
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,640
Apparently it works both ways.

1216
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,000
Oh, very good.

1217
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:07,360
And apparently there was a lot of interference from us on that Canadian Christian station's

1218
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,720
broadcast during a program called...

1219
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,780
During a program called The Satanic Rites of the Day Man Lost.

1220
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,380
Yay!

1221
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,260
Which airs every Thursday night from 9 to 11.

1222
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:18,960
Wow.

1223
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,020
How could it get better than that?

1224
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,800
Documentary radio work.

1225
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,800
I mean, that's...

1226
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,000
And we apparently...

1227
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,500
Apparently some listeners from that station actually contacted us and said...

1228
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,720
Man, what is up with those screams?

1229
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,920
I find that kind of obnoxious.

1230
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,500
They're dirty haxters.

1231
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,920
That's phylogrammins being obnoxious.

1232
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,400
How could you do that to a bunch of innocent Ontario natives sitting there thinking of

1233
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,920
the Lord Jesus X Cripes in the middle of the night?

1234
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,060
Their basement or some other near place.

1235
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,980
How could you do it?

1236
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,160
And then they get to hear the song Slut Cutter.

1237
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,000
Did they play the song Slut Cutter during...

1238
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,360
I don't know.

1239
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,040
I know...

1240
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,000
I know Hughes plays that quite a bit.

1241
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,460
Right now you're in the subgenius funhouse.

1242
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,400
Yeah, at least...

1243
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,640
Yeah, it's a shame that it didn't bleed over during one of WCSB's religious shows.

1244
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,960
Like Hour of Slack.

1245
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:09,840
Right.

1246
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,080
Or...

1247
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,420
Right.

1248
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,020
Atheist shows like Synesthesia.

1249
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,940
Oh, I'm not just an atheist show.

1250
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,400
That's just part of my perspective.

1251
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,320
You're a Christ killer.

1252
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,700
A Buddha killer.

1253
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,580
You'd even kill a mere philosophy if you could get your hands on it.

1254
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,940
A mere philosophy?

1255
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,160
Even a mere philosophy?

1256
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,940
All philosophy is bunk.

1257
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,120
The younger it is, the happier he'd be to kill it.

1258
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,860
If it's a baby philosophy, all the better.

1259
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,260
A helpless baby religion.

1260
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,580
I suppose you hate the Mormons.

1261
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,260
Oh, I don't hate anybody.

1262
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,940
I hate the Mormons only part of the time.

1263
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,180
I'm not one of those eloquent incestue rarities that you hear in the background.

1264
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,440
I love the Mormons because LDS is almost like LSD.

1265
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,360
It is like LSD.

1266
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,540
It is like LSD.

1267
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,380
If you believe Joseph Smith saw the future and the past at one time, it could...

1268
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,200
That's my great-granduncle, by the way.

1269
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,120
That's right.

1270
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,460
Well, did you know that the Mormon church has much...

1271
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,140
Not only in New York State and out there in Utah, but right here in Cleveland, Ohio.

1272
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:15,780
Kirtland, Ohio.

1273
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,620
Kirtland, Ohio.

1274
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,300
Did you know of the Kirtland Temple, Rob?

1275
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,260
I have not.

1276
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:26,740
And, yeah, I have not actually been to the temple, but I'm aware of its existence.

1277
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,380
There was a...

1278
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,320
One of the earliest Mormon settlements was in Kirtland.

1279
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,280
Is it still an operating Mormon spiritual gas station?

1280
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,600
Yes, and it...

1281
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,380
Well, I don't know.

1282
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,760
I think it's more of a museum now, but it's very brightly...

1283
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,220
It's painted.

1284
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,560
It looks rather gaudy.

1285
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,120
It's a spiritual gas station.

1286
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,000
Are you calling it a...

1287
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,340
Are you saying that the Mormon church is full of gas?

1288
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,080
Is that what you're saying?

1289
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,660
No, you're saying you can...

1290
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,660
Any old church is full of gas.

1291
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,840
You can just pull in there and fill up.

1292
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,640
No, not yet.

1293
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,220
You just plunk over one of the pews, and they stick it right up where the sun...

1294
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,040
You know?

1295
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,500
Yeah, the sun won't shine.

1296
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,140
And you just walk away and have a grand old time.

1297
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,360
Well, they don't say that...

1298
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,560
At least that's the way it used to be.

1299
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,280
That's the thing.

1300
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,400
Now they're reapportioning everything, and it's tiered.

1301
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,160
Yeah, Kiro is redeveloping it.

1302
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,880
They have Deacon, and there's the Beacon Deacon,

1303
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,740
and then there's all these other little incendiary devices below that.

1304
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,620
And then there's some explosive laughter accompanied by a loud vomiting.

1305
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,360
As far as I'm concerned, you can take the entire lot and send them back to Jabzibu,

1306
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,180
or whatever they call it.

1307
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:32,740
The Mormons teach that if you're a good enough Mormon, your skin will become lighter colored.

1308
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,460
White and delightsome.

1309
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,900
I like the Mormon you love to do this.

1310
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,800
I heard they actually try and say that.

1311
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,300
To people in South America and Africa, when they try and convert them.

1312
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:44,540
Yeah.

1313
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,500
I've heard that's a selling point.

1314
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,580
Well, I worked with a lot of American Indians.

1315
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:55,860
Well, oddly, I know a guy who's half English descent, and half Ute Indian, and he claims to be a Mormon.

1316
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,720
You mean the lost...

1317
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,300
You don't mean Native Americans.

1318
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,640
You mean the lost tribe of Israel.

1319
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,940
The lost tribe that was dark.

1320
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:02,820
Yeah.

1321
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:09,100
They've gone to the Buchenwald and places like that, just taken the names, wrote them down, said they're Mormon now.

1322
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:09,660
Same thing.

1323
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,640
Baptism of the dead.

1324
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,580
Baptism of the dead.

1325
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,120
Now this is...

1326
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,000
They had already condemned them to hell, and they'd already gone to hell.

1327
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,020
Now this is...

1328
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,440
And then down there, like, one million years...

1329
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,080
Let me tell you something about a little conflict.

1330
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,720
...the rivers of B.C.s.

1331
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:22,960
Yep.

1332
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:32,120
And then suddenly, a week later, Granny prays for them, and they come flying out of hell so fast, they're back in heaven.

1333
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:32,480
Yep.

1334
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,620
Let me tell you a little story about a...

1335
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,100
...treatment, bath oils.

1336
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,780
Let me tell you a little story about a...

1337
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,040
...bath oils, bath balls.

1338
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,220
They just made them re-baptized.

1339
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,780
Okay, I'm sick of having to say, can I tell you a little story?

1340
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:44,620
Okay.

1341
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:44,840
I want that.

1342
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,120
Review mirror.

1343
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,400
A little story about a conflict...

1344
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:48,640
I'm not even making this up.

1345
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,260
Okay, shut up, dude.

1346
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,620
I want to hear a good story.

1347
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:57,700
A little story about the, uh, about the conflict that's actually arisen between, uh, between Satanists and the Mormon church, because of that whole practice of baptism of the dead.

1348
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:08,200
Alright, because we all know that, you know, that true Satanic witches will make an ointment out of the rendered fat of unbaptized babies, and it allows them to fly when they wear this ointment.

1349
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,080
And what'll happen is a Mormon will baptize that dead baby...

1350
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,260
...and the witch falls from the sky.

1351
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,000
While the witch is flying and the concoction of the con-

1352
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,060
While the witch is flying and the concoction of the con-

1353
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,580
...and the witch, yep.

1354
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,160
...and the concoction of the con-

1355
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,160


1356
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:22,580
The Mormons have conducted a number of strikes against the Satanic, uh, witch community.

1357
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,120
And there's no regulation to...

1358
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:32,040
Satanic witches are flying across the sky, minding their own business, and the next thing you know, there's a Mormon praying for a dead baby, and the witch goes crashing to the ground.

1359
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:32,880
Mormons are mean.

1360
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:38,020
And the, and the witch, better caveat, are emptor because the buyer has to beware.

1361
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,460
Yeah.

1362
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,900
The buyer of the witch.

1363
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,140
And they have strange, uh,

1364
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,640
Like the witch was on her way to a job.

1365
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,500
Actually, I remember seeing, like, commercials...

1366
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,680
She was just on her way to her job! She wasn't minding, she was minding her own business!

1367
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,620
I remember seeing commercials for the Mormon church when I was a kid.

1368
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,320
Where they'd say, hey, it's good to be different! Like, and it was a commercial for the Mormon church.

1369
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,340
Did the baby even know the difference?

1370
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:57,820
Yeah.

1371
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:00,420
Yeah, right now on YouTube and other media outlets, there's one...

1372
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,580
Hey, it's good to be homosexual, where pink bell bodies and unborn...

1373
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,320
...showing you how normal they are, and...

1374
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,160
...and have earrings that...

1375
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,180
I, I would almost...

1376
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,720
...be tempted to join, except I'd have to quit drinking.

1377
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,400
Oh, man.

1378
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,280
Yeah, and you have to move to Salt Lake City and, like, get in the desert with a hundred men.

1379
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,680
And you have to quit, like, wanting to have more than, you know, ten wives.

1380
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:20,660
Yeah.

1381
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,260
Ten wives.

1382
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:27,420
Dude, I can't even imagine having one wife, let alone ten. That would just be, like, exponentially harder to live with, I would imagine.

1383
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:32,280
Well, if you were in a real grossly panicked, patriotic, anarcho-macrosnical...

1384
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,200
Patriot, psychotic, anarcho-materialist?

1385
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,880
...society, you would just order the damn wench to do as you... wenches... to do as you please.

1386
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,400
I just wanna wear the fancy underwear.

1387
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,320
The magic underwear.

1388
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:45,340
Magic underwear.

1389
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,440
Well, you can do that just by joining the Masons.

1390
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,040
You know, the subgeniuses have magic underwear.

1391
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,680
What kind of dental plans do the Masons have?

1392
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,400
Yeah, there's certain Jewish groups that have magic underwear, too.

1393
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,580
Yeah.

1394
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:59,480
The dental plan that the Masons have is pretty good, but it's not actually as good as the ones...

1395
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,560
I think the Church of the Sphinx...

1396
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,440
...that the, uh, that the Tylers have in the...

1397
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,720
...the Carpenters have.

1398
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,180
...the Carpenters have.

1399
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:05,700
The Carpenters have a better one.

1400
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,780
...Rubinstein, we need to make some magic underwear.

1401
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,260
I know the church followers would wanna have some.

1402
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:12,640
Yeah.

1403
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,560
I, uh, I, I, I had a pair of magic underwear, but I kinda soiled it.

1404
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,060
Everybody had magic underwear, and like, where are we today?

1405
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:20,720
That's what you need for magic underwear.

1406
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,620
It's just a perspective of time, I suppose.

1407
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,180
It's just spiritual soil.

1408
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,140
You can't really see it.

1409
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,320
It may be lost long...

1410
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,240
It's spiritual soil, so it's pure as the wind-driven snow.

1411
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,160
...in a few incorrect directions.

1412
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:34,840
But overall, we can only assume that things have been better.

1413
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,120
This... this magical soil...

1414
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:35,480
Here.

1415
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:35,720


1416
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:35,720


1417
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:35,720


1418
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:35,720


1419
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:35,720


1420
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:35,720


1421
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:35,720


1422
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,880
Feces is like pure gold.

1423
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:38,620
...definitively like pure gold?

1424
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,240
Your magic underwear...

1425
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,000
...is made of pure gold?

1426
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:41,160
...is made of pure gold?

1427
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,900
Let me get this wrong.

1428
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,300
Well, the magic, the magic pants, the magic, uh, underwear...

1429
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,700
Woven from the Golden Fleece.

1430
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,180
... coun likes the alchemical reaction.

1431
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:50,900
Oh, OK.

1432
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,240
... cause the alchemical reaction of the earth."

1433
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,960
We slipped some on Reverend Stang earlie....

1434
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,160
It's woven from the Golden Fleece that, uh, that, uh, Jason stole.

1435
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,520
Uh, and then...

1436
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,040
But first you can pull it over your nose, too.

1437
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:01,840
You know, he could be like...

1438
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,780
Yeah, the golden feces become the golden fleeces.

1439
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,480
Endangered feces.

1440
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,820
Endangered feces.

1441
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,060
A coprolite in the mind of God.

1442
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,860
That's this planet Earth, a coprolite.

1443
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,320
Engendered and endangered at the same time.

1444
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,820
For your listless pleasures.

1445
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,160
For your listless pleasures.

1446
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,640
It's human feces from the years that so dig it while you can.

1447
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,780
Wow, frozen coprolite.

1448
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,340
I saw a...

1449
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,440
When I was in biology class in high school,

1450
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,340
the teacher showed us a video called The Wonderful World of Dung.

1451
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,640
Hey, nice.

1452
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,360
Where's that tape?

1453
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,540
It is The Wonderful World of Dung.

1454
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,860
It sounds like a Broadway musical.

1455
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,880
I mean, well, no, not...

1456
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,800
Well, we figured out on some show...

1457
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,580
Somewhere that dirt is mostly feces, and feces is mostly corpses.

1458
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,880
Right, and the earth was...

1459
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,160
It's like a world of corpses.

1460
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,580
There's rocks, sticks, and corpses, and that's about it.

1461
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,360
Yeah.

1462
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,500
And animals like that.

1463
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,400
The actual earth was only about as big as a golf ball in the beginning.

1464
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:09,980
Right.

1465
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,960
And by then, you had to accumulate so many turds and other...

1466
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,720
The rocks and animals, sticks and vegetables, and corpses are animal.

1467
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,940
And yet they're still teaching creationism and evolution in schools.

1468
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,220
It's crazy.

1469
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,760
They're teaching cooking classes.

1470
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,220
Everyone knows that in the Garden of Eden, Jehovah One made Adam out of feces.

1471
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,260
Oh, you never would have said that.

1472
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,080
In my Bible classes, women there are...

1473
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,460
And then Adam made pornography out of more feces,

1474
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:43,280
and then God was ashamed and made Eve to distract Adam.

1475
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,440
Yeah, but what if it was real luminous...

1476
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,360
And woman has been nagging man ever since.

1477
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,720
And Adam and Eve was Adam Weishaupt.

1478
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,420
Adam Weishaupt, yeah.

1479
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,320
Oh, man.

1480
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,000
What if it was...

1481
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,540
That's...

1482
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:55,380
The mother of the Bavarian...

1483
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,980
Madam, I'm Adam.

1484
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:57,260
Yeah.

1485
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,980
Oh, madam, I'm Adam.

1486
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,180
Go hang a salami.

1487
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,060
I'm a lasagna log.

1488
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,420
It's Stern Commanderson.

1489
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,000
It's a miniature.

1490
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,020
Oh, it's a little prescription to view in our mind.

1491
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,900
I had this book once.

1492
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,980
I think it was called Crazy English by Richard Lederer.

1493
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:18,180
There was a chapter about this guy who spoke only in palindromes.

1494
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:19,980
Good Lord.

1495
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,920
That's hard work.

1496
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,720
It was funny.

1497
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:28,140
Well there is a weird owl take off on Bob Dylans song.

1498
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,260
Didn't we say, one of the palindromes being an island?

1499
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:29,540
When I draw really.

1500
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,000
Well really.

1501
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,420
Right, right right.

1502
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,140
Really?

1503
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:32,960
Really.

1504
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,800
Right, right, right, right, right.

1505
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,800
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right,

1506
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:35,920
right.

1507
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,240
Right, right, right, right, right.

1508
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:37,240


1509
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:37,740
Hey, brother.

1510
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:40,620
Stephen, Eric, John Keaton, correct?

1511
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:40,620


1512
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,360
But that means, we are almost in tingling.

1513
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,960
Turn right on.

1514
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,580
There is a very big clean in the queen.

1515
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,340
There really is.

1516
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,800
goal произош on parking.

1517
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:01,180
Yes, I know. There's a Sonic and a Burger King and a Dairy Dick Queen in

1518
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:10,740
Dequeen and look, Dequeen is right near Fort Smith and I know Smith. I don't think many people know Smith, but I know him.

1519
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:16,760
A Dairy Dick Queen? Dairy Dequeen. Dickween.

1520
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:24,600
Oh, I can't wait to get to Dequeen. It's almost as beautiful as Dierks.

1521
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:34,620
Well, this would be the worst subgenius family vacation because I'm still sick and really sick.

1522
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,960
He is sick. I shouldn't be laughing.

1523
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,620
But our hosts are so nice.

1524
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:41,700
Yes.

1525
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:46,740
We're at Pisces and Suds in historic Charlottesville right now.

1526
00:48:47,660 --> 00:49:04,000
And the way here was really fun. We went on sort of a back road that was through West Virginia that was loaded with one of our favorite kinds of sites, which is dilapidated buildings.

1527
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,940
The dilapos were fabulous coming down here.

1528
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,720
Uh huh.

1529
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:14,680
People have accused us of being classist elitists.

1530
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,740
And they may be right.

1531
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,100
But the fact is that things falling apart look cool.

1532
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:27,140
And that life after people thing fills me with joy.

1533
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:31,720
I like to see nature destroying the works of man.

1534
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,440
Especially when they're easy to destroy like old abandoned barns.

1535
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,500
They are cool looking.

1536
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,740
After coughing all night and then sleeping all day.

1537
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:46,740


1538
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:57,360
We're venturing out into the city of Charlottesville to look at the weird occult symbols of this old, old town.

1539
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:02,000
So we're a walking disease factory.

1540
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,320
Or I am. Princess Wee doesn't have it.

1541
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:12,680
We're coming up to the Rugby Secret Society according to this map that was hand drafted for us by Suds Pasha.

1542
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,580
Uh huh.

1543
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:18,880
We'll take a good picture of it for you, the radio audience.

1544
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,640
Lots of brick and columns.

1545
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,580
Yeah, it's pretty colonial around here.

1546
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,440
Oh, there. Look to the right.

1547
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,960
We're supposed to be looking at Monticello.

1548
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,080
When we look over this thing with the columns.

1549
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:39,500
There's an ancient mansion somewhere on that hill that's Thomas Jefferson's house.

1550
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,340
So I can sort of see a lump over there.

1551
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,120
Yeah, that lump is Monticello.

1552
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,120
Okay, now we're seeing Monticello. Let's go.

1553
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,220
I want to go down in there.

1554
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,060
Okay.

1555
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,160
Look at this crumbling brick wall.

1556
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:53,480
That's cool.

1557
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,140
Don't get me wrong.

1558
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,800
I, like my fellows of Genie E, am far from perfect.

1559
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,880
I admit that I am guilty of many acts of stupidity.

1560
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,020
Some more recent than I care to admit.

1561
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:11,320
And some I look back on and wonder why I'm even still here after pulling such a stupid stunt.

1562
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:18,040
Well, the old proverb, wise as the admitted dumbass, has never been truer.

1563
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:27,380
And this dumbass looks back on his experiences with hard-earned wisdom, humility, and a better understanding for the stupidity all around us.

1564
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,540
Six billion points of stupid.

1565
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:40,360
Of course, I speak of the mindless, glorps, pinks, and asshole figureheads within the conspiracy who robbed the slack of the true Yeti.

1566
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,580
Tools. Every last one.

1567
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:50,860
Unworthy of the edict of Bob they bumbled to and fro, stupidly clinging to any shred of false slack they think they have.

1568
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:56,640
Praising their lord for giving them something they've never known and wouldn't recognize it if they had.

1569
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,120
Those who continue to piss in our cornflakes.

1570
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:08,140
Those who love nothing more than to stick their dick in the birthday cake and, quite frankly, I'm a little tired of it.

1571
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,340
All around us, the mental health of the people who are in charge of the society.

1572
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:10,340


1573
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,400
The mental midgets of the pink race, bobbing their heads to the pronouncement of morons.

1574
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:18,360
Their eyes glistening in a bovine glaze of intellectual laziness.

1575
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:22,420
Utterly oblivious to the cliffs the conspiracy shepherds them towards.

1576
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,480
Flagrantly disregarding scruples while aiding criminals aiding criminals.

1577
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,200
Guilty of the very crimes they themselves try to create.

1578
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:36,500
And all under the umbrella of thunderous applause and thudding back-patting over the fattening of coffers.

1579
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,680
On all sides they come.

1580
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,320
Armed with the stinking madness of their fear.

1581
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,440
They file in, shoulder to shoulder, jackbooted fools.

1582
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,440
Baying and bleeding like legions of demented sheep.

1583
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:53,200
Launching their blitzkrieg of bullshit and incompetence on the heads and hearts of all they do not understand.

1584
00:52:53,900 --> 00:53:00,060
Decimating the very ground under their feet with the sheer weight of their crusade against rationality and common sense.

1585
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:08,440
This inundation of the most vile and despicable creature to ever slither and slink its way up from the depths of the primordial sludge.

1586
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:08,660
This inundation of the most vile and despicable creature to ever slither and slink its way up from the depths of the primordial sludge.

1587
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,380
This inundation of the most vile and despicable creature to ever slither and slink its way up from the depths of the primordial sludge.

1588
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,840
Those who are unworthy of sucking farts from the arse of Cthulhu.

1589
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,620
Who bleat monotonous amounts of mental deficiency.

1590
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,160
Regurgitating ineptitude at levels that even most pinks are incapable of.

1591
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:28,340
These putrid imperfections of protozoan puke permeate the dark recesses of the church far more than I ever dared to believe.

1592
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,420
Hiding behind their dobbs head t-shirts.

1593
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,640
Pretending to know the paths to frenzy.

1594
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,660
Blindly following the edicts of those who would and will take advantage of them for their own good.

1595
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:38,660


1596
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:41,840
Their own deliciously demented yet tastefully slackful purposes.

1597
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:46,640
Do not underestimate these vile and disgusting abominations.

1598
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,980
Watch them wobble like bobby heads in the hot wind of nuclear destruction.

1599
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:57,440
Listen to them cheer for the spiritual enema hand delivered unto them by their own obsession.

1600
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:01,680
You moron go back to giving yourself a spiritual swirly.

1601
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:07,040
Take a hearty dose of sit the fuck down with a tall glass of shut the fuck up to watch it down.

1602
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,640
You shit for birds.

1603
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:08,640


1604
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,800
You brain's pink ass motherfucker.

1605
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:14,420
I'm about to unleash a serious round of overman rage on your candy ass.

1606
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,860
Oh yeah motherfucker.

1607
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:23,960
Just because you think your hot shit doesn't help the fact you're a pink dumb fuck whose lady luck ran off with your best friend who was smart enough to pay his thirty fucking bucks.

1608
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,740
You needle dicked incompetent fucktard.

1609
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:33,240
You and your twat booger girlfriend can go back to Podunkinville ass hatsaw before I shove your head down your throat now you're fucking asshole.

1610
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,480
You degenerate feces flinging monkeys have wasted our time.

1611
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:42,300
Worse you've wasted our slack and that is unforgivable.

1612
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:47,580
As for your punishment we shall continue to use and abuse you for our own entertainment.

1613
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:54,260
You shall suffer never knowing the reasons why Bob has never seen fit to grant you true slack.

1614
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:58,920
Your suffering will be delicious candy for all across the corporate galaxy.

1615
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:07,380
Your actions shall be remembered come next day when the legions of card carrying church members shall be enjoying the immaculate madness.

1616
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,300
Of sex hurt and ooze squirt.

1617
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:14,980
Laughing with the uber sex goddesses over the destruction of you bobbies and your pink brethren.

1618
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,300
And in any case Bob will keep your money.

1619
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,460
That's subgenius.com.

1620
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,520
The dot com bank.

1621
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,140
And this is the hour of slack.

1622
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:34,580
And that was Reverend Frodis Suds Bashaw from his YouTube video sermons with Suds part six.

1623
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,360
Uh before I put my disease on hold.

1624
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,120
I'm going to put my disease in him.

1625
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:48,860
For he and his fiance priestess Pisces uh against our advice let us stay in their home and they both got the Clevelandian virus.

1626
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,180
And you can too at subgenius.com.

1627
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,540
Uh after planting the parasite in its new host we and I moved on.

1628
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,380
And so next week more victims.

1629
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,660
Uh the music in the background here is the Rudy Schwartz project.

1630
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,680
The year they switched to cornmeal.

1631
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,260
Praise Bob.

1632
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,440
And uh thank you all.

1633
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:24,380
We're leaving Charlottesville and we've been driving around looking at the University of Virginia.

1634
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,680
Which is ancient and cool looking.

1635
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,160
Yeah.

1636
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:33,200
We just saw a statue of my ancestor George Clark of Lewis and Clark.

1637
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,560
Conqueror of the Northwest.

1638
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,160
He was on a horse.

1639
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,780
He looked like he was about to run down a bunch of Indians.

1640
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,420
He looked really pissed off.

1641
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,800
I don't think that's what the impression was supposed to be.

1642
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,680
But that's kind of.

1643
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,100
They had to cram every all the figures together.

1644
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,840
So that's kind of how it comes off.

1645
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,620
Boy we sure were treated like visiting royalty by Suds and Pisces.

1646
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,200
Yeah.

1647
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,960
Well they're they treat everybody real nice.

1648
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,280
Or actually they treat everybody as they deserve.

1649
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,500
That's what I like about Pisces.

1650
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:15,480
If you're a real jerk she treats you the way I would treat you.

1651
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:16,900
Like a jerk.

1652
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,820
She's just better at it.

1653
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,860
She's really quite diplomatic about it.

1654
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,300
You wouldn't.

1655
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,160
Despite what people say.

1656
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:32,660
Their apartment was pretty loud with people late at night.

1657
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,620
I'll take your word for it.

1658
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,780
I couldn't hear much of it.

1659
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:38,440
I was glad I had the earplugs in.

1660
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,360
How could you hear it over my snoring?

1661
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,520
Now what Jack? Forward or turn?

1662
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,920
Here I'll turn Jack's voice on.

1663
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,220
Instead of Jack off we'll have Jack on.

1664
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:07,820
Recalculating.

1665
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:17,420
Well we can't be as funny as Dr. Zeronius and Todry Milktoast when they were driving through Kansas.

1666
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,740
Because we're not as miserable.

1667
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,500
Because this isn't Kansas.

1668
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,720
It's rather scenic here although it's rainy today in Virginia.

1669
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:35,720
We're heading for North Carolina and the house of Reverend Pockets and Dr. Leguien.

1670
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,020
To put our disease in them.

1671
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,940
They can get down with our sickness.

1672
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:53,360
Mmm. I haven't looked inside my coffee mug full of phlegm yet.

1673
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,660
When the cops pull us over that's the first place they're going to look.

1674
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,220
And he's going to go, okay I know what this is.

1675
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,060
Jinkum. You're busted.

1676
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:09,540
It's like what? Position of excrement is against the law now?

1677
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,080
Do you want me to give up all of my excrement sir?

1678
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,640
Move over. Let me pull my pants down.

1679
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,000
I'll give you all my jinkum.

1680
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,800
It's your lung.

1681
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,220
Yeah. Yeah actually that is what it is.

1682
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:30,660
Well lung technically is scraped from the lungs of a person who's died.

1683
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,100
Who was a very heavy prop smoker.

1684
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:38,820
And so it's like concentrated lung hash.

1685
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,120
As opposed to jinkum which is butt hash.

1686
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,000
That's butt haze.

1687
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,300
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1688
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:56,580
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1689
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:01,680
Not just this show but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1690
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:08,740
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you.

1691
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:16,180
You should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages.

1692
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,560
And help out financially as best you can.

1693
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,920
Now we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty.

1694
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:27,580
And we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1695
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,500
But some of you still have jobs.

1696
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,820
Even five bucks makes a big difference.

1697
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,440
Even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1698
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,780
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1699
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:48,620
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1700
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:54,080
We also take checks and money orders to subgenius foundation.

1701
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:59,460
P.O. Box 181417.

1702
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:06,560
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1703
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,780
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
