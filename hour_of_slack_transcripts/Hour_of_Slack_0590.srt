1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,620
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the moon.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:14,940
We subjected it to careful editing to eliminate elements which we might consider in questionable taste for late night viewing.

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,640
As it will be shown, it is well within the restrictions of the television code,

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,460
which is even more restrictive and stringent in many areas than the industry code.

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,420
So, we are sensitive to the concerns which prompted your letter.

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,120
We're sorry.

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:40,200
And assure you that this network will continue to adhere to the high standards we have maintained throughout the years.

8
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,680
We won't do it again.

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,760
Thank you.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,960
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,800
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,280
To the...

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,820
Subgenius Hour of Slack.

14
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,820
Welcome, potential initiates.

15
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,700
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:20,180
Yes, friends, it's so good to hear Reverend Bleepo Abernathy doing that show intro with his voice

17
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,800
because, friends, we're going to be listening to Reverend Bleepo Abernathy a whole lot tonight.

18
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,820
Yes.

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:41,940
Because, friends, I'm in a big hurry to get the artwork out for the Steve Jackson Games subgenius game.

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,220
Yes, we're doing one.

21
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,160
It's a hundred cards of sort of a...

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,660
Not exactly a role...

23
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,340
I guess you'd call it a role-playing game.

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,780
It's part of Steve Jackson's popular and famous...

25
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,960
Illuminati game.

26
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,840
It stands alone.

27
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,560
You can just play it with only the subgenius cards

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,240
or you can work them into the greater Illuminati conspiracy.

29
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,400
In this fantasy world that Steve Jackson has helped create,

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,400
the Illuminati sort of controls the church of the subgenius

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,560
rather than the way it is in real life, the other way around.

32
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,700
So, friends, the artwork...

33
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,300
It's going to be reduced down real tiny,

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,620
but it is so fine.

35
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,840
It is so fine.

36
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,380
The greatest artistes of subgeniusdom,

37
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,940
most of whom you've never heard of,

38
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,400
are all represented,

39
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,320
including yours truly.

40
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,060
And I'm on a deadline.

41
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,400
I'm building Dobbs Town right now inside my computer

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,460
and really have to get back to it

43
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,080
and spend as little time on this show as possible.

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,520
And luckily, dear friends,

45
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,320
there was a...

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,440
There was a...

47
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,440


48
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,920
There was a wonderful subgenius live radio show

49
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,400
produced at Starwood this year in New York.

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,440
I wasn't there because I had to be here.

51
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,000
But Reverend Bleepo Abernathy and the Lord Jesus

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,840
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz Smith,

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,740
Einstein's secret orchestra,

54
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,660
were all together and Regis recorded it

55
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,920
with his mobile sound truck so well.

56
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,760
And Ace drew such a wonderful crowd of weirdos.

57
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,680
This is at the same place that the X-Day drills are held at

58
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,240
in Sherman, New York, Brushwood Campout.

59
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,600
Only this was like a pagan event with a thousand people there.

60
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,780
And I'm glad I wasn't there this time

61
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,680
because Einstein's secret orchestra

62
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,900
and Reverend Bleepo did such a great job.

63
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,080
And Jesus and his...

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,580
Oh, by the way, I should mention that

65
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,500
during this entire DeVival recording,

66
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,680
there's a naked, a beautiful, young, naked woman

67
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,940
dancing professionally,

68
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,240
particularly when Bleepo starts talking about sex hurt.

69
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,000
That's Mary Magdalene, Jesus' new consort,

70
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,360
I guess you'd say.

71
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,480
She was all body painted up,

72
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,480
and it was beautiful anyway.

73
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:24,820
All right, friends,

74
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,780
let's go to that DeVival recording in progress.

75
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,520
Ah, yes.

76
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,880
Praise God.

77
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm scared.

78
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,200
You're too reckless.

79
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,420
Slow down.

80
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,140
Slow down.

81
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:54,820


82
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,500
Bleepo Abernathy calling Bleepo Abernathy.

83
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,020
You don't know what you're doing.

84
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,140
We got to wait for Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

85
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,520
He's a big star, so...

86
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,640
Does it too?

87
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,940
No, you don't.

88
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,980
Why did you do that?

89
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,060
Oh, hi, officer.

90
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:19,340


91
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,800
All right.

92
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,540
Praise Bob.

93
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,840
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

94
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,260
Subgenius Club Swank.

95
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,940
Kick back, relax, and feel the beautiful vibes of hate.

96
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,720
We've got a lot of great things for you tonight.

97
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,640
As always, we are recording live, an hour of slack.

98
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,740
Unfortunately, Reverend Ivan Stank is not here with us tonight.

99
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,520
But we have Reverend Bleepo Abernathy, the great,

100
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,400
who will be explaining to you many things

101
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,440
and telling you amongst other things why Reverend Stank couldn't make it tonight.

102
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,340
We have some holy sacrament.

103
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,040
We have go-go dancers.

104
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,080
And we have slack.

105
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,240
We're waiting for our notes right now, so they'll be here any minute.

106
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,420
Oh, who am I?

107
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,520
I'm Jesus.

108
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:22,980
Christ.

109
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,520
Hi.

110
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,520
Thank you.

111
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:30,860
I'm back.

112
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,280
Somebody asked me, one of my kids, amongst other things, amongst being the Savior,

113
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,720
I do the team programming here.

114
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,580
And they said, well, you know, if you're Jesus, why are you here?

115
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,020
This is like the absolutely worst place you could be.

116
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,780
And I'm like, no, no, no.

117
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,500
See, I must be amongst the sinners.

118
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,520
That's the way it's always been.

119
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,220
So.

120
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,720
Well.

121
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,380
Cut to the chase.

122
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,180
I'm not going to tell you all about the Church of the Subgenius

123
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,400
because Reverend Bleepo Abernathy is going to be getting into all that.

124
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,520
But the advantage of listening to heart sounds and blunders

125
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,020
is that of using words to describe them.

126
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,480
Yes.

127
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,080
It's somewhat like eating an apple and trying to describe how it tastes.

128
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:10,820
Yes.

129
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,680
Recordings lend themselves well to repetition.

130
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,140
And it is on this basis that one can train himself

131
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,840
to more accurately distinguish different abnormalities.

132
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,660
Much of the difficulty arises,

133
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,620
from hearing too many things at once.

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,440
And it is suggested that you practice listening for just one thing at a time.

135
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,700
So I'd like just to clear up one quick thing.

136
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,580
And that is, people believe that the Church of the Subgenius is a church of hate.

137
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,380
A lot of people believe that.

138
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,200
And that's not true.

139
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,060
I'm here to tell you, we are a church of love.

140
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,400
We just happen to love to hate.

141
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,860
We love to hate the conspiracy.

142
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,380
We love to hate the pigs.

143
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,000
We love to hate the normals.

144
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,940
So with that in mind, I'm going to now introduce you to a God amongst men,

145
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,380
and one of our greatest preachers of all time,

146
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,060
who's going to be giving you a nice introduction on the Church of the Subgenius,

147
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,540
the kind of Subgenius 101.

148
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,520
So ladies and gentlemen, please welcome,

149
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,740
Reverend Blipo Abernathy, with Reverend Blipo Abernathy's Neighborhood.

150
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,840
Thank you.

151
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:20,840


152
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:20,840


153
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:20,840


154
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,420
.

155
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,460
.

156
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,980
Hello, how are you today?

157
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:33,620
.

158
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,180
Can you say, slap?

159
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,100
.

160
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,720
Very good, you're so responsive.

161
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,380
I like that.

162
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,660
Did you know that you're very special here at Starwood?

163
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,300
.

164
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,520
Who here has never heard of the Church of the Subgenius?

165
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,740
Anyone here never hear of it before?

166
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:53,520
.

167
00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:02,380
Alright, who here is this their first subgenius type of introduction to anything subgenius?

168
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,160
Do I see any?

169
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,160
I see, yes, there's a few in the back there.

170
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,640
Well, just to give you the simple, basic explanation of what the Church of the Subgenius is.

171
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:17,400
The Church of the Subgenius was started in 1953 by Bob.

172
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:17,860
.

173
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,740
Now, Bob's full name, of course, is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

174
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:31,420
And he was an ordinary vacuum cleaner salesman who went door to door helping people pick out the right vacuum cleaner.

175
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,940
Helping to guide them to the sort of appliances that could help benefit their lives.

176
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,120
He saw himself as a humanitarian.

177
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:46,740
Even then, even though he knew he was making money off these people, he saw it as an ethical thing.

178
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,100
.

179
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,520
Can you down the music just a little bit? It's just a little loud for me.

180
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,200
.

181
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,980
The music is a little softer.

182
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,040
.

183
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
It's hard to concentrate.

184
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,020
.

185
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,420
Would you like two more thingies? That's good. Thank you.

186
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:12,420
Anyway, so what happened to Bob was he was, he had what I guess what is referred to now as a close encounter with people from the Planet X.

187
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:12,740
.

188
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,460
.

189
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:20,180
And as you may or may not know, the people from the Planet X are the people who are going to come and enslave the normals on July 5th, 1998.

190
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:20,960
.

191
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:29,480
When their pleasure ships will come down and zap everybody who wasn't, you know, a fully fledged member of the Church of the Subgenius.

192
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:29,880
.

193
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:36,240
And when that happens, the Subgeniuses will rise in the pleasure ships. They will be taken into the pleasure ships.

194
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,880
.

195
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,260
.

196
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:37,800
.

197
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:44,520
And they will have all the candy and sex and everything that they could possibly desire that they could ever need forever.

198
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,400
.

199
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,100
And it'll be a wonderful thing. They will have eternal slack.

200
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,320
.

201
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,680
But Bob was just an ordinary man like you or me.

202
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,360
.

203
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:07,780
I'm trying to tell the story though. I sort of should flash back here. Basically Bob was also a model. You may recognize Bob's face. He was, of course, a male model between the 1930s and the 1930s. .

204
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:07,780


205
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:07,780


206
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:07,780


207
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:07,780


208
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:07,780


209
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:07,780


210
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:07,780


211
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:07,780


212
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,140
.

213
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:22,360
And he was the handsome smiling dad with the pipe who would, you know, come up and say hello to Junior and hello to Sister and sit down and, you know, smoke the pipe while they were watching TV.

214
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:22,680
.

215
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,300
And it was a wonderful, normal thing. And he did that too as well as selling the vacuum cleaners and stuff.

216
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,300
.

217
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,140
.

218
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,140


219
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,140


220
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,700
.

221
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,020
.

222
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,060
.

223
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,100
.

224
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,200
.

225
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,260
.

226
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,260


227
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:44,380
Once he got immunized, immunitized by the echelons from Planet X, he became illuminated and he could no longer be photographed by ordinary means.

228
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:44,580
.

229
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,900
So they had to issue drawings of him for his modeling assignments.

230
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,700
.

231
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,060
The only way you can take a picture of Bob now is through Curlie and Photography.

232
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,660
.

233
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:52,900
.

234
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:52,980
.

235
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:52,980


236
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,140
.

237
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,300
.

238
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,300


239
00:11:53,300 --> 00:12:00,160
because the entire zeitgeist of the Church of the Subgenius is slack.

240
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,000
And slack is what you all have here at Starwood.

241
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,760
That's what helps make you special.

242
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:12,640
And I think it's important to remember the specialness of Bob

243
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,860
and the specialness of you.

244
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,680
And if anyone has any more beginner questions

245
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,340
about the Church of the Subgenius,

246
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,900
I'll be pleased to answer them after today's program.

247
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,500
But as it is right now,

248
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,900
it's time for us to invoke something

249
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,560
that we've been trying to invoke for a while now,

250
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,200
and that is Club Swank.

251
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,200
If you'll excuse me just one moment

252
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,000
while our DJ puts on the appropriate Club Swank music

253
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,700
will effect this transformation.

254
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,040
Please stand by.

255
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,880
Hey, what's happening everybody?

256
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,560
Hey, Swanky Cats.

257
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,560
And people all around the place,

258
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,260
welcome to Club Swank.

259
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,120
Yes, this is your Starwood event, Club Swank,

260
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,700
where everything is swanky

261
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,720
and you're always a member as long as you pay your dues.

262
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,300
Hey.

263
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,260
But you know, Bob isn't just about paying your dues.

264
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,740
Bob is about having you pay the dues of the people

265
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,260
who don't pay their dues.

266
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,260
Because there's a lot of people out there

267
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,480
who haven't been giving their money to the church, you know.

268
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,380
And because of that,

269
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,580
unfortunately, it's just,

270
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,320
this is, we are in the final year,

271
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,620
as you know,

272
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,360
because July 5th, 1998 is coming up.

273
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,940
We have less than 300,

274
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,700
what is it?

275
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,800
I don't even know what it is, Jesus.

276
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,540
It's only a few more months, really,

277
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,700
until it's the end of the world.

278
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,720
So basically now is the time

279
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,740
when the most money has to flow into the church.

280
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,800
This is the final year.

281
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,400
This is the final moment.

282
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,240
So please buy our church membership cards and pamphlets, etc.

283
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:51,880
Jesus has all of them.

284
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,280
He has all of these wonderful things, the pamphlets, etc.

285
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,860
And please support your church at the sub-G's

286
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,360
because after all, we are the only church

287
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,040
that admits that we're in it for the money, basically.

288
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,580
That's why Stang's not here, as a matter of fact.

289
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,520
Stang was not offered enough money to come here.

290
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,180
And so he left basically Jesus and me holding the bag.

291
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,240
And we're going to use this, Jesus and I,

292
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,200
and wherever he went there,

293
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,640
Mr. Musician there,

294
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,780
we're going to have a musician,

295
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,520
Segway up here eventually, I think.

296
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,340
Anyway, I forget his name.

297
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,640
Einstein's Secret Orchestra guy.

298
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,860
Hey, Einstein's Secret Orchestra guy, what's your name?

299
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,700
Chaz Smith.

300
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,160
Right, Chaz Smith is going to give us a hand here in a minute or two.

301
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,580
But anyway, what we wish to invoke here today,

302
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,560
many of you may be familiar with the Reverend Ivan Stang.

303
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,920
Reverend Ivan Stang has been to several Starwoods in the past.

304
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,740
And he's an interesting fellow.

305
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,620
He's kind of gone from short hair to long hair, back and forth.

306
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,320
There's times when you'll meet Reverend Ivan Stang,

307
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,680
and you'll think he's the most ordinary guy in the world.

308
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,760
He's Joe Average.

309
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,520
He's Mr. Regular.

310
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,840
There's other times you'll meet him and he'll have long hair,

311
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,240
and you'll think, wow, what a freaked out geek acid head this is.

312
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,080
And, but he's been, you know,

313
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,760
fronting this church of the subgenius for many, many years.

314
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,240
And he's quite successful at it.

315
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,460
In fact, it's made him millions and millions of dollars.

316
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
So that's why he doesn't feel it necessary to come around here.

317
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,740
And he sends his lackeys like Jesus in his stead.

318
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,260
I myself come from New York City and don't live in Dallas, Texas,

319
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,780
as does Jesus with the Reverend Ivan Stang.

320
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,680
But this is the moment in which I'd like you people who are in touch

321
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,140
with your knowledge of Reverend Stang and the fact that he does this

322
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:40,180
X-Day thing here that's separate from Starwood, you know,

323
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,040
even though his whole introduction to Brushwood was through Starwood.

324
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,080
He's basically, let's face it, folks,

325
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,660
Reverend Ivan Stang has left us, his flock, in the dust.

326
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,780
He doesn't give a shit about us.

327
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,860
Let's face it.

328
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,060
I'm sorry.

329
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,220
I know you're going to have to believe that, Stang, when you play the show.

330
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,560
But I want to try to invoke some hate here.

331
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:06,280
Because in the church of the subgenius, we've learned to take our hate and channel it.

332
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,640
You see, a lot of people around here in this New Age kind of thing, in fact, I like to

333
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,400
rhyme those two words the way my friend Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller often does.

334
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,800
He calls it New Age.

335
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,160
He calls it sewage, see.

336
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,760
In this New Age, we're going to be talking about the New Age.

337
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:21,760


338
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:21,760


339
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,720
And this is kind of New Age philosophy that you hear a lot of.

340
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,420
But there's a lot of talk of peace and love and never ever having angry feelings.

341
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,600
And anger is bad and all that sort of thing.

342
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,440
So right now, I'd say that Jesus and I are beginning, you know, we've been feeling certain

343
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,580
first, I had to explain that when we first came here, Jesus and I felt this sort of like,

344
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,460
oh, gee, Stang's not going to be here.

345
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,000
We felt this sort of sadness.

346
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,720
And then the sadness sort of segued into regret.

347
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,140
Gee.

348
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,480
You know, the show really would be better if Reverend Stang was here.

349
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,340
And the regret kind of segued, as it were, into sort of an annoyance, I would say, with

350
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,380
Reverend Stang and his whole sort of uptight, hey, you've got to pay me lots of money attitude.

351
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,020
Because, of course, Jesus and I are doing this for free.

352
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,900
As is Reverend Mary Magdalene as well.

353
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,460
And, you know, it started, we were sitting over a cup of coffee this morning, and it

354
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,120
segued, really, we decided, you know, I'm going to do this.

355
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,180
And, you know, we hated it.

356
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,940
We hated Ivan Stang.

357
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,960
So, and so what we want to do now is we want, Stang is playing this right now on the air,

358
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,200
even though it's on tape, he's playing this on the air on his Dallas radio show that's

359
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,580
syndicated all over the universe.

360
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:42,200
So, Stang, we want you to know that everybody here really resents your uptight, hypocritical

361
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,500
attitude.

362
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,320
And even though we love you.

363
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,060
We love you.

364
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,500
Thank you.

365
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:49,880
Thank you.

366
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,620
Thank you.

367
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,520
We hate you too.

368
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,820
Praise Bob.

369
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,940
I hear you.

370
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,640
I hear you, man.

371
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,140
Okay, we're going to spell it out here.

372
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,780
Give me an I.

373
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:00,940
I.

374
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,200
Give me an H.

375
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:02,900
H.

376
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,080
Give me an A.

377
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,800
A.

378
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,640
Give me a T.

379
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,360
T.

380
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,320
Give me an E.

381
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,000
E.

382
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,100
Give me an S.

383
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,660
S.

384
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,420
Give me a T.

385
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,320
Give me an A.

386
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,680
Bleepo knew perfectly well that this was just the way to get my goat.

387
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,140
What's the spell, everybody?

388
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:17,900
I.

389
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,580
I.

390
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:18,580


391
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:18,580


392
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:18,580


393
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,040
Okay, stake.

394
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,940
Is that good enough for you?

395
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,440
What are you.

396
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,120
Yes.

397
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,100
Let's hope so.

398
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,460
Very good.

399
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,040
Thank you.

400
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,480
Thank you ever, ever so much.

401
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,680
Sarcastic bastard.

402
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,980
You know, the whole theme of the church, the church is about a theme and the theme

403
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,200
was written down on my piece of paper which I had ... Where is that piece of paper?

404
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,760
I can't even remember the theme of the church.

405
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,220
God, it's Bob, man.

406
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:47,420
Anyway, as I was coming here to Starwood this time, I found myself sort of meditating

407
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,320
meditating on the lack of slack and how hard it is in today's world to be a subgenius.

408
00:18:53,060 --> 00:19:02,120
No matter where you go, subgeniuses are subject to all sorts of oppressive activities and repressive, you know.

409
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,180
In other words, if you're a subgenius and you're in a job, you probably hate your boss.

410
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,880
Because you were one of those people in the back of the classroom saying, you know, ha ha ha, giggling at the teacher.

411
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,180
And then the teacher would say to you, hey, young man or woman, what's so funny?

412
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,480
Anyway, would you care to share it with the class? Wipe that smile off your face.

413
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,240
If that happened to you, you know that you are indeed a subgenius.

414
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:32,420
And the thing that's happened to me over the years, I used to have a big conspiracy radio job with a huge conspiracy radio corporation.

415
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:40,360
It's now run by, it's run by the guy, it was run by the guy who now runs like the entire CBS television network actually.

416
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,960
He used to run the radio network I worked for.

417
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,160
And they slowly started to sell it.

418
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,260
And they started to suck the soul out of me, even though I didn't realize that.

419
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,100
And over the years, I worked for them for like 20 years, over the years they actually sucked my soul out of my body.

420
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,920
At least partly. They didn't get the whole thing.

421
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:08,540
But it wasn't until I was able to get out of that job, and they actually corporately downsized me, that I realized, you know, just how evil the entire corporate communication system is.

422
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,240
And I could not help but to feel this hate, even as I sought other jobs.

423
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:20,140
So I was hired by another huge corporation, known by Disney, I can't tell you what the broadcasting arm of that is called at this time.

424
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,580
But they hired me for exactly three weeks to work at their radio station with Rush Limbaugh and those people.

425
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,180
And they just couldn't take it. They couldn't take a subgenius working there.

426
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,880
Because no matter what I did, my hatred of Rush Limbaugh would always show up, even though I never ever expressed this to them.

427
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,060
It would come out in little subtle ways, like during the Marines commercials.

428
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,220
I had to like dub the Marine Corps commercials onto the little cards.

429
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:48,400
And during them, I would like turn the volume on my mic up just a teeny weeny bit, and I'd say,

430
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,380
They're lying. Don't believe them.

431
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,240
You know, way, way, way in the background.

432
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,660
Mixed down so hard that you could never even tell it was there.

433
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,980
And somehow, this didn't meet with their approval.

434
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,380
These uptight cats.

435
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,760
So they got rid of me, and then the Mormons hired me, and I worked for the Mormons for about three weeks.

436
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,440
Also, and the Mormons own a radio station in New York City called 105.1 FM, The Buzz.

437
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,200
If anybody knows what that is.

438
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,280
It's a big commercial station.

439
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,020
No one knows it's owned by the Mormons.

440
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,120
It used to be Mix 105.

441
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,340
And they told me that they wanted me to create promotional announcements for them, jingles and so forth.

442
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,540
But they wanted attitude without swagger.

443
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,640
And they wanted irreverence without insult.

444
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,600
Now, my friends, you can't have irreverence without insulting somebody.

445
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,940
And you can't have attitude without wiggling your butt just a little bit.

446
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,940
Okay? There's just no way around it.

447
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,200
So, no matter what I did, I was like,

448
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,680
I'm gonna do my job, I'm gonna do my job, I'm gonna do my job.

449
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,060
And then my subgenious self kept on showing through until around Christmas time,

450
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,880
I was making a Christmas promotional announcement,

451
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,900
and it was supposed to be a Santa Claus announcement.

452
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,300
There would be, you know, more six-song-in-a-row sets of six wrong songs in a row right after this commercial message.

453
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,000
So I said, so I had Santa Claus say,

454
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,500
Ho ho ho, keep your pants on!

455
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,100
There's another six-in-a-row coming up right after this!

456
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:10,380
And at this point in time, the program director still trusted me to just make these little tapes,

457
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,760
and give them to the DJs, and the DJs just threw them on the air.

458
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,700
Of course, this one ran around December 22nd.

459
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,280
And he called me up and he was like,

460
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,600
What? How can Santa Claus say, Keep your pants on?

461
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,400
You can't have Santa Claus saying, Keep your pants on.

462
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,900
That's suggestive.

463
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,880
So, can't him say, Keep your shirt on?

464
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,360
Of course, if Santa Claus is saying, Keep your shirt on,

465
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,200
that has no attitude whatsoever.

466
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,360
So, I realized something.

467
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,260
The main reason why I was working there

468
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,680
was to work with the incredible, fantastic equipment there

469
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,000
and do all my little subgenius radio things on the side.

470
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,680
And that's really what I was trying to do.

471
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,760
I was trying to get something for free

472
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,000
by working for the conspiracy.

473
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,300
And friends, you can't do that.

474
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,880
It does not work.

475
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,960
As, uh, where did he go?

476
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,200
Well, this morning, I basically came up with

477
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,300
what we call the paradox of procurement.

478
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,280
And this is something that all subgeniuses must remember, okay?

479
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,400
And follow this paradox carefully, folks.

480
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,680
If you can't buy it,

481
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,480
repeat after me, please.

482
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,420
If you can't buy it,

483
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,140
get it for free.

484
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,640
If you can't get it for free,

485
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,780
borrow it.

486
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,580
If you can't borrow it,

487
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,340
steal it.

488
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,240
And if you can't steal it,

489
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,740
buy it.

490
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,560
So, in other words, if you can't buy it, get it for free.

491
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,440
If you can't get it for free, borrow it.

492
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,460
If you can't buy it,

493
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:37,660
get it for free.

494
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,880
steal it, and if you can't steal it, buy it. That's the paradox of procurement. Whatever

495
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:50,020
it is you're looking for, your answer will be found there. Okay, now, folks, I've been

496
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:55,380
kind of dissing Ivan Stang now, and I realize that really we haven't officially, this whole

497
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:01,460
thing has just sort of been an introductory pre-ramble to the actual event itself, be

498
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:06,760
honest to myself or anyone else. And so at this moment, please, I'd like to cut all the

499
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:12,180
background noise. Could I please cut the instruments just one second, please? Can we cut the background

500
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:17,020
music just for a moment here? We'll bring it up in a second here. And Stang, I just

501
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:24,940
want to say, this is for you. I would like all of you subgeniuses now to bow your heads,

502
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:36,220
clear your mind, and I want us all just to enjoy a moment of sacred.

503
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:36,980
No!

504
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:53,020
Yes! Yes! Praise Bob! This is a revival, a devival! This is a club swank! This is a club

505
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:58,320
where you women can have as many orgasms as you want, and you men can have all the squirts

506
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,460
you want, and we can just get all the stuff we want! And- and- and- and- and- so there!

507
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,940
So there, conspiracy!

508
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,420
Here we are! Yeah!

509
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,100
Okay, so, uh...

510
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,980
Okay, so, uh, did we, uh...

511
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,100
Did we do it? Yeah.

512
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,920
Okay, at this point, at this point in time,

513
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,860
how many of you people would call yourselves

514
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,440
faithful subgeniuses?

515
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,640
Uh, okay, all right.

516
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,060
How many of you trust us?

517
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,980
Well, how many of you are foolish enough

518
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,260
to just let go of that distrust

519
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,500
and try something really wacky anyway?

520
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,000
I mean, this has happened before historically.

521
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,140
You know, a lot of people, when the media sees us

522
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,060
hanging around and trying to be our bachelor pad

523
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,360
kind of selves, our kind of subgenius star

524
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,180
with pagan selves, bachelor or bachelorette,

525
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,520
you know, I'm sort of trying to invoke

526
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,300
an early 60s kind of cocktail kind of mode here.

527
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,600
Well, how many of you,

528
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,020
uh, folks out there, uh,

529
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,980
enjoy a cocktail once in a while?

530
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,120
And how many of you enjoy cocktails

531
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,140
that are unnatural colors?

532
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:18,720
Okay.

533
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,980
Well, you know, when the media sees us

534
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,040
and they might portray us,

535
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,460
it's like CBS TV were to come here and look at us.

536
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,160
They would say, oh, it's one of those coats.

537
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,280
What?

538
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,380
I mean, after all, we got the symbol

539
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,740
blinking over our faces.

540
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,480
We got the symbol blinking over the hot tub

541
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,080
with a little star twirling around.

542
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,260
So if we sort of close our eyes

543
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,720
while we're lying back in the hot tub,

544
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,020
we get indoctrinated with the thought of the star.

545
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,800
You know, no matter where we go,

546
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,020
we see that little star, right?

547
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,760
So this cult here, the cult of the subgenius,

548
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,340
is the only cult that is fanatically opposed

549
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,300
to fanaticism.

550
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,960
So as you see here, our very own dear, sweet Jesus

551
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,300
and the incredibly beautiful and provocative

552
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,380
Mary Magdalene

553
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:12,620
are pouring out our electric blue subgenius

554
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,140
Kool-Aid cocktail.

555
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,560
Drink it.

556
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,120
So if you, if you dare, try it again.

557
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,200
It won't hurt you.

558
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,540
Drink.

559
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,360
You'll probably find yourself with

560
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,740
most of your mind in the morning.

561
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,460
Probably.

562
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,140
We can't guarantee it.

563
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,980
We hope you're drinking it of your own

564
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,240
energy.

565
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,720
You know, delicious.

566
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,900
But rest assured, there's nothing in there

567
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,860
that would harm normalcy.

568
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,460
Okay?

569
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,700
So if you dare, you know, accept the sacrament of Bob.

570
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,460
And in Bob's name, it has to be.

571
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,720
I dig that swinging, swinging sound.

572
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,520
Smoothie.

573
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,540
Yeah.

574
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,440
Oh, it's in Bob's name, brother.

575
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,920
So you can't drink it all at once.

576
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,140
All right.

577
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,620
Do we have more to go around or?

578
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:08,960
Oh, yeah.

579
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,420
Okay.

580
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,380
So we're going to take our time and pass this out.

581
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,360
Now, I was wondering if anybody out here

582
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,860
has been hurt recently by the conspiracy.

583
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,560
Anybody out here been hurt recently by the conspiracy?

584
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,700
Can I see some hands?

585
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,860
Who here has been hurt recently by the conspiracy?

586
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,500
All right.

587
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,280
In.

588
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,840
In 25 words or less, I'd like to invite you one at a time

589
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,500
to come up here and testify how the conspiracy has recently

590
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:43,980
hurt you.

591
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,060
Any of you who want to come up and just give us

592
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,540
a little testifying.

593
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,860
I just want to hear a personal life experience.

594
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,860
Any of you who have been hurt by the conspiracy recently?

595
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,360
Please.

596
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,040
Come on.

597
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,300
Somebody.

598
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,020
Somebody come on up.

599
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:58,700
Tell us.

600
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,240
What has the conspiracy done for you or against you?

601
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,020
I work for the federal government.

602
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,500
Oh.

603
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,660
Oh, my God.

604
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:14,260
We're the weirdest weirdos in the whole federal government.

605
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:20,560
And they just put us on charge during reengineering.

606
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,080
So.

607
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,100
Business process reengineering.

608
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,460
They took the weirdest and the most free-mindest people,

609
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,940
and they put us in charge.

610
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,480
Think about it.

611
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,340
I sit on the board of directors at the hospital now.

612
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:34,500
Oh.

613
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,060


614
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:35,420
Oh.

615
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,200
Oh.

616
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:36,680


617
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,000
That's intense.

618
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,600
That's intense.

619
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,140
There's an example right there.

620
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,040
That just shows you how important it

621
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,700
is to get in touch with your original slack.

622
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,840
Because the conspiracy has been trying

623
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,940
to take your slack away from you ever since the day you're born.

624
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,760
They tell you when you're in fourth grade, they say, hey,

625
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,620
wipe that smile off your face.

626
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,920
What's so damn funny anyway?

627
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,760
And then they say, oh, no, we're going

628
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,880
to track you because of your academic record, because

629
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,660
of the certain knowledge.

630
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:06,840
Because of the numbers.

631
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,700
Because of the things you decided to pay attention to.

632
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,040
The things that they care about more than you,

633
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,120
they're going to judge you.

634
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,140
And it will all go down in your permanent record

635
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,440
and following around for years.

636
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,460
This takes away your slack.

637
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,160
When you go to a job and they say, oh, yeah, sit at this desk,

638
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,240
but please don't think creatively.

639
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,020
And please, pay no attention to that boss

640
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,840
who's sexually harassing you.

641
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,380
Pay no attention to that.

642
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,380
Pay no attention.

643
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,080
Pay no attention to that guy next to you

644
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,660
who's the other boss's nephew who's

645
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,140
making $40,000 a year more than you do

646
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:52,000
and does 10 times less while you cover his pathetic ass.

647
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,520
It's so true.

648
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,240
Well, Bob will help us get in touch with our slack.

649
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,440
If you give your money to Jesus right now,

650
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:13,240
or later, or send a dollar, just send a dollar to P.O. Box 140306,

651
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,940
Dallas, Texas 75214, then you will receive some of that slack.

652
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,720
Of course, if you get a full membership,

653
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,320
you'll get even more of that original slack back

654
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,580
until you'll find the subgenius church will give you the ability

655
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,120
to do whatever you want.

656
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:32,980
Wow.

657
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,520
And you can do anything you like.

658
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:35,800
Yes.

659
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,220
Yes, Jesus.

660
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,400
I'm ready to make the toast.

661
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,520
I already drank some of this.

662
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,860
Don't drink it yet.

663
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,580
Don't drink it yet.

664
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,160
We're going to do it together.

665
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:50,140
I think we passed out about 300 cups, so this should look pretty good on nightly news tonight.

666
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,820
If you're not sitting down, sit down when you drink this.

667
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,500
Yes, please make sure you're seated.

668
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,700
We don't want you to fall down on top of anybody.

669
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,720
If you have small children, I know there's a small child there,

670
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,440
you might want to just force it down his throat.

671
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,420
Okay.

672
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,540
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

673
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,600
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

674
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,820
Down that Jesus.

675
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,500
All right.

676
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,240
Praise Bob.

677
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,300
And he's still standing.

678
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,820
Now, that shows you how powerful the church of the subgenius is

679
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,000
because if he were a normal, that would have just killed him.

680
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,720
Anyone?

681
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,880
Everyone's still standing.

682
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,740
I think it's amazing.

683
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,860
It's a miracle.

684
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,040
It's a miracle.

685
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,740
Praise Bob.

686
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,180
I think there is sugar in that, right?

687
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,140
Oh, yeah.

688
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:40,620
Yes.

689
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,420
Cyanide.

690
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,260
Thank you.

691
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:42,940
All that good stuff.

692
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,520
I did have a visual aid for you tonight.

693
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,960
She's passing out juice still, though.

694
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,240
Tell Mary Magdalene to come up here real quick.

695
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:52,700
Come here.

696
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
I hear the mystery.

697
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,700
The visual aid.

698
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,160
I know a lot of you are familiar with the church of the subgenius and our doctrines,

699
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,080
and Reverend Blebo did a great, great job of filling us in.

700
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,500
But here's something that I want you to remember.

701
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,460
So I figured this would be the best way for everyone to remember it.

702
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,660
Oh, T-shirts is one thing.

703
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,540
T-shirts only $12.

704
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,420
Don't forget that.

705
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,740
Come here.

706
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,580
So here's my...

707
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,340
Turn around.

708
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:31,220
July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m.

709
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,580
Stare at it.

710
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,120
It grated in your face.

711
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,140
It's a great day.

712
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,140


713
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,140


714
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,140


715
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,140


716
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,140


717
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,140


718
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,140


719
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,140


720
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:41,900
I believe that the Lord was displaying this phrase written on the side of his girlfriend.

721
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:49,620
The naked Mary Magdalene body painted up.

722
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,400
Oh, yes.

723
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,100
All right.

724
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,580
Thank you very much, our lovely assistant.

725
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,100
Now, Jesus is here tonight also to give us his healing power.

726
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,340
The Bhagwan.

727
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,240
The other Bhagwan.

728
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,700
He helped heal you tonight with the power of hate because I am a Christian.

729
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,120
I am a Christian.

730
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,120


731
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,960
I believe a lot of you have been sickened by the conspiracy.

732
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:06,700
Yeah.

733
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,420
I would like everybody once again who said before they had been hurt by the conspiracy

734
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:10,920
lately.

735
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:11,840
No kidding.

736
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,740
Raise their hands once again.

737
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,500
I'm with you, man.

738
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,000
Okay.

739
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:15,860
Come.

740
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:16,740
Come.

741
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,660
Form a line, please.

742
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,520
Form a line.

743
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,240
Get in line.

744
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,480
Come all up here, please.

745
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,520
I'm a waiter.

746
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,400
I'm a waiter.

747
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,840
Here it goes.

748
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,840
Here it works.

749
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,400
Here it works.

750
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,000
Praise Bob.

751
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,200
Praise Bob.

752
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,140
Praise Bob.

753
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,500
He's been sickened, friends.

754
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,620
He's been sickened.

755
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,040
He's been sickened at.

756
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,120


757
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:33,300
He's been sickened.

758
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,920
I'm a man who can handle conspiracy and all the people work.

759
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,100
The conspiracy wants me to pay the cost.

760
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,320
Wait a minute.

761
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:38,900
He's been sickened.

762
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:39,200
Friends.

763
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:40,820
What?

764
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,060
Hallelujah.

765
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,960
Look at that.

766
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,920
Look at that, friends.

767
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,580
How could we lie to you?

768
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,400
Are you employed?

769
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,280
Yes.

770
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,320
I free you of your job.

771
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,980
Oh, thank Jesus.

772
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:53,960
It's a miracle.

773
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,500
What's wrong with you, brother?

774
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,400
I work at McDonald's.

775
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:58,880
Oh, God.

776
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,200
My God.

777
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,880
Good Lord.

778
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,980
Sicken this man.

779
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,120
Oh, my God.

780
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,120


781
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,120


782
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,120


783
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,120


784
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,120


785
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,120


786
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,500
for the feeling of Bob.

787
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,160
Do you reject the conspiracy at all?

788
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,440
Do you reject the conspiracy?

789
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,940
Oh, praise Bob.

790
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,000
Yes, it works.

791
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,120
The power works, friends.

792
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,800
And you, friend, come up.

793
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,420
Come up, please.

794
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,160
Don't be scared, children.

795
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,820
I have friends in jail for marijuana.

796
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,160
Oh, the worst of all problems.

797
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,720
Okay, well,

798
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,280
do you believe in Bob?

799
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,660
I believe in Bob.

800
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,460
Praise Bob.

801
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,640
Oh, it just warms the cockles of my heart.

802
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:38,820
Miracles.

803
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,660
Friend, step up, little friend.

804
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,240
If there's anyone who doesn't have any problems,

805
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:43,940
come on up.

806
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,720
We'll give you some problems.

807
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,300
Please.

808
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,460
Ask my ex-wife.

809
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,820
I'm not allowed to drink on the job.

810
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,900
Oh, my God.

811
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,200
Oh.

812
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,040
I just want you people to know something.

813
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,760
All right?

814
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,840
I don't abuse drugs.

815
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,140
Wait, just one moment, Jesus.

816
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,220
Okay, you can keep healing.

817
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:07,580
Keep healing.

818
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,220
I don't abuse drugs.

819
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,700
I'm a sober individual.

820
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,100
However, I managed to get myself a job

821
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,060
with High Times Magazine.

822
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,480
Anybody know High Times Magazine?

823
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,760
All right.

824
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,560
It was because I held on to my slack

825
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,040
and I didn't let go that I finally got this dream job

826
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,480
of my life by doing this radio show

827
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,840
for the High Times Magazine.

828
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,500
It's the people who have all the great weed on their cover

829
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,360
and all the fun and stuff

830
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,060
and the really weird music and stuff.

831
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,420
And just so you know,

832
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,380
come on up, children.

833
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,180
Come on up, children.

834
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,120
Bob, this is the power that Bob will give you.

835
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,980
I now...

836
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,500
He just said that the other fellow said

837
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,720
that he wasn't allowed to drink on the job.

838
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,480
I am forced to smoke the best pot in the world

839
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,080
in my job.

840
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,220
That's what Bob forced me to do.

841
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,240
I'm going to help you, brother.

842
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,700
Whether I like it or not,

843
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:01,880
I'm going to help you.

844
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,340
He's kicked out.

845
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,140
He's kicked out of his apartment.

846
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,200
Oh, my God.

847
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,300
Did you pay your landlord?

848
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,540
Your landlady?

849
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,480
Your landlady did what?

850
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,440
Kicked me out.

851
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,980
I'll free you of all your rent.

852
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:18,900
All right.

853
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,720
Come on, come on up, children.

854
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,400
Come on up.

855
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,120
I have more slack in my life

856
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,760
than should be allowed by law.

857
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,980
Hate Bob, then.

858
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,660
Yes!

859
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:30,720
Yes!

860
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,060
Yes!

861
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:31,800
Yes!

862
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,360
Bob!

863
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,260
Yes!

864
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,120
We can give you...

865
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,860
We can give you the hate,

866
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,780
and we can give you the love.

867
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:44,880
All right.

868
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,900
All right.

869
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,580
Jesus, are you all right?

870
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,540
Good, see?

871
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:49,940
It's okay.

872
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,860
It's because of Bob.

873
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,900
It's because of Bob, friend.

874
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,380
Come on up, children.

875
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,060
Yes, sir.

876
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:57,780
Can I help you with...

877
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,740
Oh, my job robs me of my slack.

878
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,580
You reject the conspiracy,

879
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,440
and all the people work.

880
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,900
Oh, hallelujah, friends!

881
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,540
Come on up here, Mary Magdalene.

882
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,220
Come over here.

883
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:12,920
Come on.

884
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,880
Be by your husband's side.

885
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,420
For we all know

886
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,220
that the secret doctrines of Jesus

887
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,680
are that he and Mary Magdalene

888
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,160
knew each other.

889
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,080
And indeed they do, friend.

890
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,780
I have to do the fucking budget

891
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,340
for the VA medical center,

892
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,640
and it's driving me insane!

893
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,840
Praise Bob!

894
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,480
Oh!

895
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,140
Look at that!

896
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,920
Look at that!

897
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:37,700
Hallelujah!

898
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:39,920
Hallelujah!

899
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,040
Come on up, children.

900
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:41,640
Come on up.

901
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,300
My father is an apostolic Pentecostal minister.

902
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:44,880
Oh!

903
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,520
Oh!

904
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,100
Whoo!

905
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,660
Everyone's gonna have to help me with this one.

906
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,660
Everyone, hands in the air.

907
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,840
Hands in the air.

908
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,020
A lot of hands.

909
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,340
She's been sickened by the church, friend.

910
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,560
Hallelujah!

911
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:01,560


912
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:01,560


913
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:01,560


914
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:01,560


915
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:01,560


916
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:01,560


917
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:01,560


918
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:01,560


919
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:01,560


920
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:01,560


921
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:01,900
Hallelujah!

922
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:01,940


923
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,080
Great job, Bob!

924
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,080


925
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,080


926
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,080


927
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,760
Um, my mom works for the government

928
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,820
and my dad's a lawyer,

929
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,640
and I can't find any hallucinogenics.

930
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,000
I think I'm blowing out of my mind.

931
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,360
Oh!

932
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,000
Oh, hell!

933
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,400
But you have nice teeth.

934
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,300
Check out those teeth.

935
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,800
Ah, a true Yeti.

936
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,960
Praise fucking Bob!

937
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,040
Whoo!

938
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,580
Bob, we'll give you more slack

939
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,440
than you could ever dream of, friends!

940
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:25,940
Come on!

941
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,900
I'm the school chief, you know I'm responsible

942
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,980
for educating the youth of America.

943
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,540
Oh, my God.

944
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:31,540


945
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:31,540


946
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:31,540


947
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:31,540


948
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:31,540


949
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:31,540


950
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,400
She's a school teacher responsible for teaching the youth of America.

951
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,540
Yes! Yes!

952
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,440
What did you do to that one? I missed that.

953
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,640
Reject the conspiracy and all it's evil works.

954
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,940
We'll heal everyone here.

955
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,000
Okay, good. Just check. I just want to make sure this is fine.

956
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,680
Yeah, okay.

957
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,580
Yes, sir.

958
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,180
I thought this was the line for the floor flushers.

959
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,560
Thank you.

960
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,220
Thank you.

961
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,940
No problem. We can direct you anywhere you want to go.

962
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,780
You can go there.

963
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,060
From the Church of the Subgenius Friends, no matter where it is.

964
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,920
The woman I'm falling in love with has been trained me to be a psychoanalyst.

965
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,600
Faith and vigour. It worked.

966
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,860
Okay, everyone put your hands one more time in the air.

967
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,720
Anyone who needs healed, we're going to do a mass sickening.

968
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,680
Do you reject the conspiracy and all it's evil works?

969
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,440
Praise fucking God!

970
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,200
Hey!

971
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,240
Hey!

972
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,120


973
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:56,360
But you know, friends, the Church of the Subgenius is more of a church than those Pentecostal sort of crazy wild Jimmy Swaggart, Faith and Vigour, Fire and Brimstone, Snake Oil healings.

974
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,600
The Church of the Subgenius is an intimate church.

975
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:13,280
The Church of the Subgenius, friends, is a church much like mist on a fog-shrouded marsh.

976
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,000
Gorillas in a nest.

977
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:26,660
Yeah, there's times when the Church of the Subgenius is a serene feather floating to the ground in a zen-like fashion.

978
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,900
And you can feel...

979
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,520
You can feel...

980
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,680
You can feel the funk of Bob.

981
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:45,320
And you can smell his psychic stench as the feather floats down and touches the ground with a loud boing.

982
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:56,320
But the thing is, this is Bob's way of showing you the subtlety of the sex hurt.

983
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,360
The sex hurt isn't always an obvious thing, friends.

984
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:01,680
No.

985
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,220
The sex hurt is...

986
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:12,940
Is the essence of doing something not because it hurts, but doing something so pleasurable,

987
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:27,060
so incredibly, ecstatically, maddeningly, joyously, beautifically, blissful, that it hurts, friends.

988
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,200
Yes, yes, you get to the point where you're experiencing so much pleasure.

989
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:31,400
You say,

990
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,620
Stop!

991
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,160
No, Bob!

992
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:32,380
No!

993
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,500
Bob, I've had enough!

994
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,680
Oh, God, you're the best!

995
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,700
You are the best!

996
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,460
But no, no, no, hold off for a moment.

997
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,600
No, no, Bob, no more.

998
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,080
Hold off, please.

999
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,860
Please, Bob, because too much of it is flowing in my direction.

1000
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,620
Like that man said, he was having...

1001
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,260
He was having too much.

1002
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,680
And you tell Bob,

1003
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,440
No, no, stop, Bob!

1004
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,640
I came already.

1005
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,100
You don't have to do it.

1006
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,700
You don't have to massage the gland anymore, Bob.

1007
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,160
Please.

1008
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:58,640
Please.

1009
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,320
Please.

1010
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,120
Please.

1011
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:01,300


1012
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,380


1013
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,380


1014
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,380


1015
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,380


1016
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,380


1017
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,380


1018
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,380


1019
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,380


1020
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,380


1021
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,380


1022
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,380


1023
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,960
Please.

1024
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:03,560


1025
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:03,560


1026
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,960
After you're satisfied,

1027
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,380
you kind of go,

1028
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,420
Oh, come on.

1029
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,220
Quit it.

1030
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:09,600
Quit it.

1031
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,260
It's like when you were wrestling with your big brother,

1032
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,160
that kid in school,

1033
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,280
and he'd like hold you down,

1034
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:16,620
and he'd say,

1035
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,620
Have you had enough?

1036
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,220
And you'd say,

1037
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:19,540
Yes.

1038
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,560
And then he'd say,

1039
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,420
Well, here's some more.

1040
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,320
No other church,

1041
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,260
no,

1042
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,320
no other church

1043
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,020
will offer you this kind of complete,

1044
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,440
Money back, guaranteed satisfaction.

1045
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:40,000
Yes, friends, if on X day, is this still true?

1046
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:40,920
Is this offer still in effect?

1047
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,180
Okay, yeah, pretty much.

1048
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,980
I'm assured this offer is pretty much still in effect.

1049
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,780
Okay, if it all goes down as Bob has predicted,

1050
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,040
and when it all goes down as Bob has predicted,

1051
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:00,220
and the people from Planet X come,

1052
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,060
and you've paid, what is it, $40 now?

1053
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,280
$30.

1054
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,560
You've paid your $30 membership to the church of the subgenius,

1055
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,520
PO Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214,

1056
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,980
email address subgenius at AOL, no.

1057
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,900
Yeah, Jesus, you can write to him at jesusatsubgenius.com, yeah.

1058
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,040
Email address.

1059
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,060
And also, Stang is also at stangatsubgenius.com.

1060
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,020
Just, yeah.

1061
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:26,640
If you got the, yeah.

1062
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,080
Praise Stang.

1063
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:28,820
Hate Stang.

1064
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,780
Can I hear hate Stang?

1065
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:30,480
Yeah.

1066
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,520
All right, thank you.

1067
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,220
Friends, where was I?

1068
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,480
I completely spaced out.

1069
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,220
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1070
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,400
As you do this, you will see that it,

1071
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,780
basically what happens is the luck plane from the day you're born,

1072
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,900
the day you're born, the luck plane is at an even angle to you.

1073
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,380
You are standing, you know, as an infant, you could stand.

1074
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,020
You could stand.

1075
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,060
You'd be basically standing at a 90-degree angle to the luck plane.

1076
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:04,320
It would be stretching out before you as a promising vista of golden horizons.

1077
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,500
As the conspiracy works against you all throughout your life,

1078
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:14,140
the luck plane, for most normals, tends to tip further and further away from you

1079
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,560
so that the luck actually starts to flow out of you

1080
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,380
and down the luck plane to other people at the other end of it.

1081
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,320
It flows basically into the subgeniuses.

1082
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,020
And, uh...

1083
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,140
What the wonderful thing is about the church and subgeniuses,

1084
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,920
you learn how to be on the...

1085
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,060
Either one of two things happens to you when you join the church.

1086
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,640
Either the luck plane tilts up towards you

1087
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,300
and starts pouring the luck in your direction,

1088
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,860
or they give you the instructions, they give you like a map

1089
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,880
how to walk to that part of the luck plane that's tilted down

1090
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,080
so that it flows onto you.

1091
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,600
Either way, you get it.

1092
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,540
Yeah, yeah.

1093
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,300
But, no, we admit we're in it for the money, sir.

1094
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:55,640
All right.

1095
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:56,020
All right.

1096
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,020


1097
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,040
Are you accusing us...

1098
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,000
...of being a rip-off?

1099
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,400
We wouldn't lie to you, friend.

1100
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,400
We guarantee you.

1101
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:05,600
Yes.

1102
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,060
Oh, yes.

1103
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,240
So what I was saying is the guarantee.

1104
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,000
That's where I was.

1105
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:08,400
The guarantee.

1106
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:12,380
If on July 5th, 1998, X Day comes,

1107
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,140
when it comes, of course,

1108
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,920
if you, a dues-paying subgenius member,

1109
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,100
are not taken up into the pleasure ships

1110
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:25,900
and are instead just wiped out by the exes from Planet X,

1111
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,700
like you'd kill a dog that's been injured on the side of a road,

1112
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,020
if that happens to you, you will get your $30 back.

1113
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,260
We guarantee...

1114
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,300
Because Bob has sold the rights.

1115
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,400
Bob has sold the rights to the human race to the exes.

1116
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,900
And the only way to get your share of it back

1117
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,760
is to give him your money, just so you know.

1118
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,340
But, yeah.

1119
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,600
Back to the sex.

1120
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,480
Back to the...

1121
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,780
Bob is a mighty sex god.

1122
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,820
That's why I love him.

1123
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,820
He's given me, if not a bigger...

1124
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,760
You know...

1125
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,940
Yeah.

1126
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:12,140
If not that, then at least the illusion that I have that.

1127
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,220
And isn't that what counts, friends?

1128
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,220
I mean, let's face it.

1129
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,180
The conspiracy's always telling you bigger is better.

1130
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,920
And Bob isn't gonna necessarily just make you happier with what you got.

1131
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,080
He'll make you so convinced

1132
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,020
that you have more than you can afford.

1133
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,020


1134
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,020


1135
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,020


1136
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,020


1137
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,020


1138
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:26,740
More than you already do.

1139
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,640
That you'll believe it.

1140
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,020
And it won't matter.

1141
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,200
That's the miracle of Bob.

1142
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,620
That's one of the many miracles of Bob.

1143
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,340
And so, with this thought in mind,

1144
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,340
I know there are many people, animals,

1145
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,540
inanimate objects and stuff,

1146
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,800
at this event that sort of hook up with each other.

1147
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,360
There's sort of a...

1148
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,620
All those drums going on all the time

1149
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,900
kind of causes a love vibe.

1150
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:53,940
And...

1151
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,020
And as is happening,

1152
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:56,020


1153
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,280
you know, people get together.

1154
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,840
And of course, only safe sex occurs.

1155
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,300
Right, friends?

1156
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:02,900
And...

1157
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,080
And what happens is, you know,

1158
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,600
we may be polyamorous and stuff,

1159
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,300
and we're all like,

1160
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,340
hey, everybody can do whatever they want or whatever.

1161
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,480
But people kind of tend to couple up.

1162
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,720
And also inanimate objects.

1163
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,540
People with inanimate objects,

1164
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,580
people and animals, whatever.

1165
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,140
So if you find friends

1166
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,220
that during this event

1167
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,520
or even just during this ceremony,

1168
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,180
there's somebody that you feel close to

1169
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,020
that you feel it would be beneficial

1170
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,640
to the two of you

1171
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,540
to be married

1172
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,180
under the auspices of the church.

1173
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,380
A short-duration marriage.

1174
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,080
These are short-duration, 24-hour marriages

1175
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,000
that we perform here.

1176
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:37,840
That's true.

1177
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:38,880
And today...

1178
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,820
We at the church...

1179
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,740
Yeah, we at the church feel...

1180
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,500
Is this on?

1181
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,080
All right.

1182
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,980
Yeah, we at the church do perform

1183
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,820
short-duration personal marriages.

1184
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,460
They last for...

1185
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,360
Tonight we'll be doing them for 24 hours.

1186
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,460
They could last for an hour, a year.

1187
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:54,900
Yeah.

1188
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,940
It doesn't...

1189
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,140
It goes away with the messy divorces.

1190
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:57,600
They just...

1191
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,060
They end.

1192
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:58,920
They end.

1193
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,780
You know, because it is a hectic pace.

1194
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,240
We also have short-duration personal saviors.

1195
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,620
Right, right.

1196
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,700
Such as Bob himself.

1197
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,140
We're going to perform this...

1198
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,080
We're going to perform this...

1199
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,220
We're going to perform this marriage...

1200
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,020
Yeah, a mass marriage ceremony.

1201
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:14,800
Beautiful mass marriage ceremony.

1202
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,640
So what we'd like to do

1203
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,440
is we'd like all of you couples,

1204
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,940
any, you know, men and women, please.

1205
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:20,640
Men and men.

1206
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,400
We can't marry you to your wallet.

1207
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,200
Women and dogs.

1208
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,740
We can't marry you to yourself.

1209
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:25,720
Men and women.

1210
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,060
Farm animals.

1211
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:26,720
We can't marry you to

1212
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:28,980
really much anything

1213
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,360
that you want to be married to.

1214
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,020
Rabbits and fish.

1215
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,300
Frogs and leopards.

1216
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:32,640
Whatever.

1217
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,280
Come on.

1218
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:33,700
Come on.

1219
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:34,660
What?

1220
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:35,660
Let's...

1221
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:35,840
Let's...

1222
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,140
Let's...

1223
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,300
Oh, anyone.

1224
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:38,840
Anyone.

1225
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:39,740
Come on up.

1226
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:40,360
Come on, friends.

1227
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,400
Oh, there has to be someone

1228
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:41,600
who's filled with love.

1229
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,940
If you want to declare your love for each other...

1230
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:44,100
Come forward.

1231
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,500
...through your love for Bob.

1232
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:46,800
Come forward.

1233
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:47,940
All right.

1234
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,720
That's it, friends.

1235
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,260
It's as meaningful or meaningless

1236
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,680
as you want it to be.

1237
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:55,360
It's a...

1238
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,220
It means exactly what you want to mean.

1239
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,080
This will allow you to consummate the marriage

1240
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,560
completely legally.

1241
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,240
Oh, praise Bob.

1242
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,560
He's going to do it again, folks.

1243
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,160
This is going to work, friends.

1244
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,300
It's guaranteed to work.

1245
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,060
And this is something we're giving you today

1246
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,040
for free.

1247
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,120
Neither Jesus or I

1248
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,000
or any of the people here right now

1249
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,900
are being paid

1250
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,660
for this promotional announcement.

1251
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,700
These six people are going to marry each other.

1252
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,040
He's going to marry his master.

1253
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:19,620
Yes.

1254
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,100
Yes.

1255
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,720
You are marrying your wallet.

1256
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,020
Marry your entire wallet.

1257
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:25,960
Praise Bob.

1258
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,440
Praise Bob.

1259
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,300
This family of four...

1260
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:28,960
This is a...

1261
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,540
This is a subgenius family.

1262
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,300
Right here.

1263
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:33,980
Three...

1264
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,420
One man and three women.

1265
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:35,840
Oh.

1266
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:36,820
It's so...

1267
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:37,280
It's beautiful.

1268
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,180
It's beautiful.

1269
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,080
I love this.

1270
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:39,840
Come forward.

1271
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,400
Come forward.

1272
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,160
You can just stand up in your seats

1273
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,740
where you are

1274
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,100
if you'd like to take place in a marriage.

1275
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,660
Do you know...

1276
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,980
Raise your person in marriage?

1277
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:48,340
I don't know.

1278
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:48,500
Do you?

1279
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:48,880
No.

1280
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,060
Oh, gosh.

1281
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:53,440
All right.

1282
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,340
We're not doing the authentic marriage.

1283
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:55,340


1284
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,320
We're doing the version, folks, tonight.

1285
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,740
We're not doing the Stang-approved version.

1286
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,780
But we're doing...

1287
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,360
We're going to have to wing it.

1288
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,040
We're going to make it up.

1289
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,460
This is the Dobbs trance-induced version

1290
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,480
of the short-duration marriage right now

1291
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,540
as improvised by myself

1292
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,580
and Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

1293
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,360
Dearly beloved...

1294
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,360
So repeat after...

1295
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,640
Yes, repeat after Jesus, please.

1296
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,640
Well, actually, repeat after Jesus.

1297
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,820
Dearly beloved, we gather here today

1298
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,880
to unite these people, things, objects, and each other

1299
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,920
in united...

1300
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,340
United...

1301
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,880
In holy matrimony.

1302
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:27,820
Do...

1303
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,140
Now you can repeat after me.

1304
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,620
Do you...

1305
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,180
Person A...

1306
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,520
B and C...

1307
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:37,700
B and C.

1308
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,680
Take person and object and or wallet

1309
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,400
D, E, F, and G...

1310
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,940
And or any others not mentioned in the above list

1311
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:50,340
to have and to hold until time that you grow tired of each other...

1312
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,260
And or sometime later or before that moment...

1313
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,240
For at least a 24-hour period...

1314
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,020
With or without any further stipulations

1315
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,920
that may or may not be mentioned at this time.

1316
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:03,280
In the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs and...

1317
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,040
Either legally or illegally...

1318
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:04,580
Fill in the blank.

1319
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,240
And fill in the blank.

1320
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,700
Say, I do.

1321
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,460
I do.

1322
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,420
Shake on it and say, it's a deal.

1323
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,700
It's a deal.

1324
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,640
I now pronounce you man and wife and wallets and...

1325
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,500
And everything. Praise Bob.

1326
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,560
Yes.

1327
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,200
Thank you.

1328
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,180
It worked.

1329
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:25,340
It worked.

1330
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:25,340


1331
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:25,340


1332
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:25,340


1333
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:25,340


1334
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:25,340


1335
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:25,340


1336
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:25,340


1337
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:25,340


1338
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:25,340


1339
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:25,340


1340
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,060
Look at that, Jesus.

1341
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:26,640
It worked.

1342
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,220
It's a miracle.

1343
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:28,680


1344
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,880
Friends, I've seen so many miracles here today.

1345
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,460
You may now kiss each other.

1346
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,040
Oh, this is exhausting.

1347
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,720
I can't believe...

1348
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:38,900
We have one...

1349
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,900
We have another ceremony.

1350
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,260
The last ceremony.

1351
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,240
We...

1352
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,320
Uh, Bleepo had said earlier today,

1353
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,140
you can't always believe what a subgenius preacher tells you.

1354
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,200
Uh...

1355
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,100
Oh.

1356
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,540
Oh, wow.

1357
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,280
Yes.

1358
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:52,620
Whoo!

1359
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:53,960
I didn't know it was going to happen that quickly.

1360
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,760
All right.

1361
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,140
True love.

1362
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,580
Uh, Stan is really not a millionaire,

1363
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,500
although we are trying very hard to become millionaires,

1364
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,380
because we believe at the Church of the Subgenius

1365
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,020
that to destroy the concept of money,

1366
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,340
it's going to take a lot of money.

1367
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:09,780
A lot of money.

1368
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:10,340
Exactly.

1369
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,240
This is why...

1370
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,840
So once again, friends, if you can't buy it, get it for free.

1371
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,700
If you can't get it for free, borrow it.

1372
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,340
If you can't borrow it, steal it.

1373
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,320
If you can't steal it, buy it.

1374
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:23,600
Yes.

1375
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,980
I have in my hand an authentic American one-dollar bill,

1376
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,220
which somebody gave me, thank you very much,

1377
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,360
and in one of our greatest subgenius ceremonies...

1378
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,820
It's a windproof...

1379
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,740
As the smoke from this dollar bill rises up above...

1380
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:40,340
This is a windproof cheap...

1381
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:44,740
This is made by one of the last free objects made in free British Hong Kong.

1382
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:49,940
This cheap ripoff that actually works very well of a windproof lighter.

1383
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,080
Oh.

1384
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:51,580
Oh.

1385
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,260
This cheap, along with cheap and cheap EKün's can be drunk...

1386
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,660
It would be cheap to sell...

1387
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:03,800
...and eventually to have a stamp home and,

1388
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:03,800


1389
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,400
Unlike the west side of the vendetta,

1390
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:11,360
which just, actually,breached the sampling rules of €Эanych...

1391
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,120
bleibt...

1392
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:16,000
It is that kind of bomb blasted here.

1393
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,320
You know, folks...

1394
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:16,320


1395
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:16,560
Obvious estás bien estuviendo aquí y tengiendo...

1396
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,140
Dicha bomb stripspathée de Sleepingқ

1397
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,560
look at her friends.

1398
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,380
yes friends

1399
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,740
and now

1400
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,000
as a final final act

1401
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,820
of tonight's

1402
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,600
subgenius

1403
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,600
club swank extravaganza

1404
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,820
I would like to offer

1405
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,840
to destroy time

1406
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,600
yes friends

1407
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,860
any of you

1408
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,340
who has a watch

1409
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,480
that you would like us to smash

1410
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,300
and not be able to restore

1411
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,940
that you would be entirely responsible for

1412
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,660
when you wake up the next morning and say

1413
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,220
holy my god

1414
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,120
that man smashed my watch

1415
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,480
and you won't kill me or Jesus

1416
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,580
even if you want to

1417
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,980
any of you people that has a watch

1418
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,520
that you would want to smash

1419
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,040
have smashed

1420
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,400
by me and Jesus

1421
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,740
under these circumstances

1422
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,280
with all of these disclaimers

1423
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,160
he's got the brick

1424
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,620
now remember

1425
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,520
the church of the subgenius

1426
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,360
will give you control over time

1427
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,800
but only if you let us

1428
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:20,640
smash

1429
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,320
and destroy

1430
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,620
there's got to be one of you

1431
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,820
take off the shackles of the conspiracy

1432
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,860
take off satan's handcuff

1433
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:28,780
bring it up here son

1434
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,200
bring it up here

1435
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,380
yeah okay you want to do it yourself

1436
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,780
alright I'm going to take it out in front

1437
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,720
wow that's a nice watch

1438
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,340
are you sure

1439
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,900
praise fucking bob

1440
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,320
take off the shackles of the conspiracy

1441
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,680
this watch will be

1442
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,800
healed only on the astral plane

1443
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,520
and only

1444
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,840
in the subgenius dream time

1445
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,120
which is the only real time

1446
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,020
there is friends

1447
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,900
this time is an illusion

1448
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,620
the time of bob is the true stone

1449
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,880
