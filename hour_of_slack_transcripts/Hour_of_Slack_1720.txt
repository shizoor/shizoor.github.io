The mind of man has always longed to know what lies beyond the world we live in.
Explorers have ventured into the deeps and the heights.
Of these explorers, some are scientists, some are mystics.
Each is driven by a different purpose.
The one thing they share in common is a wish to cross the borderlands that lie beyond...
The subgenius power of slack.
Stand by. Stand by please.

From PR News in Washington, I'm sexually abused by Catholic priests over decades.
Leading to catastrophic PR news.
According to Twitter, he added, we look forward to identifying together the most effective sexual abuse.
President Trump is rejecting the bill.
He's rejecting an official government tally.
Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló posted on Facebook that the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico, quote, deserved their pain.
The Vatican has announced Pope Francis has ordered an investigation of PR.
And Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan says there's no reason to dispute.
PR reports Weinstein's lawyer says this is PR news.
Yeah, we can make it work.
We, the Christians, can make it work.
Every time.
So we better get up, stand up for your rights.
Or someone would say we're coming in from the cold.
Or another one would say the sun is shining and the weather is sweet.
And someone would say is this love.
And everyone would say everything.
Let's move it.
Preach a man, oh, tell me if heaven is on the earth.
I know you don't know what life is really worth.
Is that all that glitter is gold?
After story and everything told.
So now you see the light.
Hey, you stand up for your rights.
Because
Now, in the midnight hour.
Stand up for your rights.
We're the rebel, yeah.
Don't give up the fight.
Don't give it up right now.
In the midnight hour.
Stand up for your rights.
Stand up.
We're the rebel, yeah.
Don't give up the fight.
Most people think.
Great God will come from the sky.
Take away everything.
And make everybody feel high.
But if you know what life is worth.
You would look for yours on earth.
And now you see the light.
Yeah, you stand up for your rights.
Because
In the midnight hour.
Stand up for your rights.
We're the rebel, yeah.
Don't give up the fight.
Don't give up the fight.
In the midnight hour.
Stand up for your rights.
Stand up for your rights.
We're the rebel, yeah.
Don't give up the fight.
We're sick and tired of your easy-kissing game.
Die and go to heaven in Jesus' name.
Lord, we know and we understand.
Almighty God is a living man.
You can fool some people sometimes.
But you can't fool other people all the time.
So now we see the light.
What you gonna stand up for?
Yeah, and I...
What we gonna do?
No time for pointing the finger at me.
That's right, we gotta stand up.
Let's hold on...
Hello, we're the rebel, yeah.
And now you see the light.
Stand up for your rights.
And now you see the light.

Yy-k has arrived
We're k-y'd up
We're going to slide Home Free
He gots slide Home Free, baby
On the X, X-ray

X cheers zero
I love prophecy, seriously.
But this time we've learned our lesson.
We can't rely on invisible monsters from outer space.
We can't even rely on Bob.
We have to learn how to escape Earth
without being dependent on the conspiracy or any extraterrestrials or salesmen.
Sure, send in your 30 bucks, but
build your own ship!
You may not have to, but just to cover your ass.
Build your own ship!
Even better, go buy Hangar 18 or Area 51 or Cape Canaveral or Studio 54
and steal your own ship!
Ah, yes.
Extract your own fuel.
And while you're at it, friends,
let's swap the deck on the spaceship that we're already stuck together on.
We're already riding on the spaceship.
And it's in bad shape.
And it's high time we cleaned it up.
Earth, we must get off!
Whether we leave it or leave it a cinder.
Whether we blow it off or blow it up.
Just don't blow it, friends.
That $30 to Bob proves that you consider your life to be worth $30.
You don't spend that much on prancing rock stars anymore.
Oh, but some people think,
well, Bob might be lying again.
Oh, no.
Friends, Bob makes a million dollars every time he screws up.
By screwing up last time, he made $10 billion.
This next day, when the saucers do arrive,
he won't lose that $10 billion,
because we already did!
We're out our $30.
His fuck-up already happened.
He has nothing to gain by us losing.
So this time, we will win!
And, uh, you know, even if X-Day didn't work out,
we'll go for Sex Day!
We want you people to dance into the new century.
Screw into the new century.
Sleep and eat your way into the new century.
Whatever you're doing in the moment of turnover
is what you'll be doing forever.
So make sure you're not asleep.
Make sure you're not watching TV.
Make sure you're not listening to Pat Boone.
Make sure you're not reaching for an itch
you'll never be able to scratch.
Friends, you're floating in a sea of pills.
A sea of Bob's pills.
But you're just too blind, deaf, and dumb to see them.
Oh.
Oh, friends.
I know you're not the dumb, ass-dicated type.
I know you're the smart-ass-dicated type.
Oh, but people say,
Reverend Stagg, what is slack?
I want you to tell me what slack is.
You know, friends,
the television doesn't have to watch you
as long as you are watching the television.
And a lot of people,
a lot of people think that slack is that Miller beer commercial.
Where everybody's good looking,
and you're rich, and your team just won the game,
and you're drinking Miller beer,
and your favorite show is on.
And you know that's bullshit,
because slack is not laziness, friends.
Slack is getting into the zone.
It's being awake and alert
and doing what you wanted to do
until your eyes snap open
and you're smart enough to realize
that you are God.
Life is worth living.
And everything is just as simple.
It's as psychedelic as an old T-shirt
that you can't get into anymore.
Now hold that thought.
Hold it in your head.
Because that is what slack is all about, friends.
Slack is something for nothing.
As you know, we don't have a river to dunk you in.
But we cleaned out the muck sink.
And, um, yeah, you might just want to take off your shirt.
Okay, nope. See, I can't do this.
I'm sorry. I really want us to get along.
I do.
But I can't pretend to believe in something I don't.
And I don't.
Chatwin, we've all had our doubts.
No, see, this isn't doubts.
I believe in science.
I believe in evolution.
I believe in Nate Silver and Neil deGrasse Tyson
and Christopher Hitchens, although I do admit
he could be kind of an asshole.
I cannot get behind some supreme being
who weighs in on the Tony Awards
while a million people get whacked with machetes.
I don't believe a billion Indians are going to hell.
I don't think we get cancer to learn life lessons.
And I don't believe that people die young
because God needs another angel.
I think it's just bullshit.
And on some level, I think we all know that.
I mean, don't you?
The angel thing does seem kind of desperate.
Look, I understand that religion makes it easier
to deal with all of the random,
shitty things that happen to us.
And I wish I could get on that ride.
I'm sure I would be happier.
But I can't.
Feelings aren't enough.
I need it to be real.
And that little rant comes from the TV show called
Orange is the New Black,
which I've been watching out of solidarity with prisoners,
even though it's basically just a funny TV show.
That big ranting with music,
that comes from a devival that I did
with Einstein's Secret Orchestra in the Pufferdome
at Starwood Festival in the year 2000.
Our titles and news are from Limer.
And that mashup of Bob Marley and Billy Idol
is from a video by Bill McClintock,
which I got off YouTube after I was turned on
to this guy's stuff by Reverend Susie the floozy.
In fact, there's another one by,
uh,
Bill McClintock coming up in about three minutes
after this song,
Low Road,
by the band called Massive Hot Dog Recall
with Al Mothersbaugh on vocals and trombone.
I got my guitar,
I got my guitar,
I got my guitar,
I got my guitar,
I got my guitar,
I got my guitar,
I got my guitar,
I got my guts in the glove box,
I got my Dukes ten and two,
My better judgment is asleep in the backseat,
I'm looking for you.
Bumper tap in the left lane,
I'm gonna pass you on the right,
Chubby truckers on their CB radio,
Saying mofo's tight.
Not taking the high road,
though I probably should,
Spitting gravel on the low road,
Does me a desk cloud of good?
Not a deserted justification,
I'm wavy all night,
Switchbacks don't mean a thing,
I'm not coming back,
Listen,
Not gonna waste all my time,
Waiting for you to come correct,
Gonna get to you,
Feeling restless,
This chicken's gonna back back,
I got that!
Low road feels good in the moment,
Only if you do it right,
Low road is a necessary evil,
When you wanna take a bite,
Not taking the high road,
Though I probably should,
Spitting gravel on the low road,
Does me a desk cloud of good?
Not a deserted justification,
I'm wavy all night,
Switchbacks don't mean a thing,
I'm not coming back,
Listen,
Not a deserted justification,
Over the hill I'll hit it,
First time I'm driving fast,
While moving is the only way,
And I'm the only one who knows fast,
highest my braille,
Makes things much a little weirder,
There will be an Representation,
Like Trump there!
Who unite?
That's just black and white,
Whoτο 계.�
Mmmm,
Not taking the high road
Though I probably should
Spitting gravel on the low road
Does me a dust cloud of good
Not incertitude and justification
I'm way beyond that
Switchbacks don't mean a thing
I'm not ever coming back
Living just enough
Just enough
Living just enough
For the support
Of the people
Yeah
A boy's born in Hotline, Mississippi
Surrounded by a world that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong, moving in the right direction
Living just enough, just enough
Living just enough for the city
Just enough
His father works some days for 14 hours
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scroll the floors for many
And you best believe she'll hardly get the penny
Living just enough, just enough
Living just enough
Living just enough

For the city
His sister's black, but she is shown the pretty
Her skirt is short, but little legs are sturdy
To walk to school, she's got to get up early
Her clothes are old, but never are they dirty
Living just enough, just enough
Living just enough for the city
Just enough
Her brother's smart, he's got more sins than many
His patience long, but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
Cause where he lives, they don't use colored people
Living just enough, just enough
Living just enough for the city
I'm saving for the city
A saving for the city
Just a saving
Save for the city
Save for the city
Just a saving
Save for the city
Bill McClintock did that mashup of Stevie Wonder and Guns N' Roses, and now, from KPFA Berkeley, some puzzling evidence.
Now we're going to start by splicing Gene Shellick down the street here.
Then we'll splice Gene Hoffman and Gene Simmons.
And Gene Simmons to Gene Seabird.
I was fighting the collars off with a pipe, you know.
Oh, ye.
Heading down to Coral Landers.
Oh, you're on here.
And unaware in your underwear.
The collar tried to kill show with special signal.
Hello, you're on.
Special sound effect.
Not possible.
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I know this collar.
Cut him off.
All right, let's try the other collar.
I don't want that other one on.
That collar doesn't know the meaning of fair play and good 100% Americanism.
Oh, I see.
And as an American and a subgenius, I resent these collars trying to make this show their own personal playground.
This am not show.
This show, mister.
Hey.
Why do I get confused with the show?
This is rotten.
I've tried everything.
It's not cool.
I remember those parties we used to have.
We'd have the subgenius beach party.
We'd all go down there.
Subgenius beach party.
Hey.
Subgenius circus time.
You were invited.
Come on down to the subgenius beach party.
Yeah.
We got hot dogs.
Subgenius beach party.
Ice cream.
You prepared that?
And it's getting hot.
It's getting better.
You won't imagine, come on.

Advisor, sir.
It's been some practice.
How long have you Behavioral and Behavioral Sports?







fallait in turn that.
Easter wanted to invite.
But still a rest it def Michel fell,
I can bear.
Of course I apologize to the editor.


Coco multivariate.
Well, you didn't have to wear tongue such as a female compare.

I see the bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightning
I see bad times today
Oh!
Kill it in the name of
Oh!
Don't go around tonight
Let's finally take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
I hear hurricanes a-blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I hear rivers overflowing
I hear the waves overflowing

Boys are raging ruin
We know you're doing what they told ya
Don't go around tonight
Let's finally take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
Oh!
Thorns who died are justified
But wearing a badge ain't a chosen one
But wearing a badge ain't a chosen one

Thorns who died but wearing a badge ain't a chosen one
But wearing a badge ain't a chosen one
Hope you got your things together
Hope you got your things together
Hope you got your things together
Look like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taking for a nap
Don't go around tonight
Let's finally take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
Don't go around tonight
Well, it's fine to take your life
Yeah, the bad moon on the rise
Now you do what they told you
Don't go around tonight
Well, it's fine to take your life
Yeah, the bad moon on the rise
Bad moon rising
I won't do what you tell me
Quite prepared to die
I won't do what you tell me
We're in for nasty weather
I won't do what you tell me
The boys are right here to ruin
I won't do what you tell me
Oh!
That one was mixed by, or at least posted to YouTube by, someone named Pixel Shifter.
And now this.
Hundreds of New Yorkers at a religious revival chanting the name of a modern-day prophet.
Bob.
Bob's teachings are the foundation of a church that does little more than parody cults and American consumerism.
It's called the Church of the Subgenius.
Tom Vitale has this report.
You will pay to know what you really think.
But if you give us money, we will tell you what to think.
And not only have you paid to know what you really think, but once you will get value for your dollar.
Americans will buy anything, and they're getting sold short.
That's the message of the Church of the Subgenius, as delivered by the Pope of all New York, David Meyer, at a recent revival.
Meyer also instructed the enthusiastic crowd in how to get slack, how to get right with Bob, and how to pull the wool over your own eyes.
For they shall see God.
It's still true.
God still speaks in special ways to each of us today.
But my feelings toward him are still so brittle and sour.
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care anymore.
Tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired.
I can't tolerate it.
I can't live with it.
And that's how I became a subgenius.
Children of the great St. Lenny Bruce said, American society cripples you and arrests you for limping.
Here in the Church of the Subgenius we say,
Cast off those crutches and crawl with pride.
You can crawl again.
You can crawl again, children.
I may sound like a Bible beater yelling up a revival at a river crossing camp meeting,
but that don't change the truth, no.
I want to see if one person, one single person,
will have the courage of their convictions and come down here and open up to Bob and give me their wallet.
I don't just want your...
money.
Don't just want your credit cards.
We want your library cards, your voter registration.
Give it all up now.
Give it all up now.
Give it all up now.
Give it all up.
Now, now, now.
Well, there once was a man.
The world's greatest salesman.
And he led the way.
Had to find a plan to get the shackles from my feet
Oh yeah, but now he's gone
A martyr for the cause, far to follow
And he's coming again
Who knew that the first shot
Was gonna be the last shot
But he's got a hard driving pipe
The gas won't go through the night
And although he may be hurting the universe
He'll keep on squirting all the fun, oh
And he's coming again
guitar solo
He can save us from the men in black
With just a shot from his mighty sack
If only he could make it back
From the land of the dead
But until that happy day
We can only drink and say
Far to follow
And he's coming again
I know he can make it
Without him we can't take it
We'll lose the pieces of our minds
To the pink boys and the reds
And the whims
Until the day that he comes back
It'll be a world without sack
Far to follow
And he's coming again
Far to follow
Far to follow
Far to follow
Far to follow
And he's coming again
If we don't want the X's upon us
Then we need far to be honest
Far to follow
Far to follow
Far to follow
And he's coming again
Great gunning going through me right now
Far to follow
Again
Far to follow
From our video called Arise
That was Brother Cleve Duncan
Doing his classic hymn

But now
I'm afraid it's time for the show.
This time with Dr. Philo Drummond as their guest.
You know,
Fid.
Peas,
I'm trying to interview our guest.
Well,
move it along.
Okay.
Five dollars.
It costs five dollars to live in America for one minute.
That's a deal.
It does seem like a good deal if you think about it.
But I mean,
you get any kind of food,
any,
any kind of food that you want,
you can get here.
It's not like in Pakistan,
you're hard pressed to get Mexican food in Pakistan.
I would think,
I think like maybe there's a Taco Bell,
but you know,
there's not a Roberto's for sure.
And so what would you do for Mexican food in Pakistan?
But here in the United States,
we have all,
we have Pakistan food next to a Mexican food place.
So I think it's pretty good.
Paco Bell.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The water in Pakistan isn't nearly as good as it is in Mexico.
There's not nearly enough camel in my taco.
So Philo Drummond,
you know,
since we have a mutual love of crack the sky,
and I always thought you were funnier than staying.
Don't tell him I said that it'll hurt his feelings.
But I wanted to ask you if,
if you'd ever been employed at a Chuckie,
cheese in,
in Maryland or not.
No.
Okay.
I haven't employed at churches,
fried chicken in Houston.
Oh,
well,
I,
I never,
uh,
I've never pooped in the ball crawl at churches,
fried chicken in Houston,
Texas.
I don't even know if they have a ball,
ball crawl,
but if they don't know,
Oh man.
Hey,
you want to go in on a franchise on a church's franchise with me,
Philo,
and,
we can put in a ball crawl and I can,
we can crap in it.
Um,
I'm really good at it.
Um,
I'd make you,
I'd make you proud.
I'll let you break the ground on that.
Is it true that churches chicken puts excessive amounts of testosterone in their chicken to facilitate the,
uh,
quicker death of African-Americans?
The huge death,
the huge,
huge breast.
It makes huge,
huge,
huge chicken breast for some reason.
Yeah.
Those chickens were all virgins.
Oh,
yeah.
Those chickens are only like six months old.
I feel like churches is the worst of the chicken.
Chicken titties.
You know what I used to do?
I was a cook there at churches chicken and I could cook.
Um,
it was nine chickens per stove and I'd do three stoves and I'd do that.
Uh,
there was eight parts per chicken.
So that was,
there was 81 pieces per stove.
Do those three in 11 minutes.
Is it a,
is it a,
now is that like a oil based pressure cooker that you cook?
That's no,
it was an open hot grease,
360 degrees.
You just throw the grease,
throw the chicken in there and dip them out.
It's awesome.
I used to go in there and take the breasts,
a tear off the big chunk of white meat off of about five or six of them.
And then I double,
double batter them and then make this giant chicken tender.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.




















I invented chicken tenders.
Now was,
was that anybody else had chicken tenders?
Was that authorized?
I invented those.
That was that authorized chicken tender.
That's my boy.
It was aware about that.
Your employer condones that kind of behavior.
Of course.
No,
no,
they would,
they would have fired me if they knew it would have fired.
So you had to keep that.
Yep.
There you go.
Sega does what chicken in 10.
Don't see.
I sacrificed my credit for perpetual,
uh,
fame and fortune just for a few bites of fried chicken tenders.
Now,
do you go into a churches now and kind of eyeball the layout and see what
changes they've made and go,
Hey,
yeah,
that's good.
I see what they did over there with that griller.
That's,
that was a good call.
Or do you not yet?
I'll have an interest in that.
Any,
I haven't been in one and 40 or 50 years.
Wow.
40 years anyway,
maybe now,
I could,
I was in one in Oakland,
California.
The last 10 chicken attendees is the only truth.
Philo Drummond.
You need to find chicken.
Christ.
Philo Drumstick.
Philo Drummond.
Uh,
you should know I named a chicken.
I did actually name a chicken after you.
Uh,
his,
his name was Colonel Philo Drumstick overcock,
but Bach,
but Gawk,
and he was a real,
real live chicken.
That,
uh,
seems like,
it seems like a cat's name.
I was in Delaware near very close to the,
the Tyson chicken factory and a truck went by and this little chick fell off that was
bound for the factory.
And I picked him up and I breastfed him and I raised him as my own.
And what did I name him?
But yes,
Colonel say it again.
That's right.
Nice.
What was the rest of his name?
Uh,
Colonel Philo Drumstick,
uh,
overcock,
but Bach,
but Gawk.
All right.
Very well.
Well played.
Julie,
he's dead now.
He's dead now,
by the way,
he's dead.
What happened to him?
What happened to him?
Oh,
well,
actually the government,
the government killed him.
Damn the government.
They said everybody eventually government stepping on my aviary rights.
Obama took away my chicken.
Did our Patreon funds pay for it?
That one can go a lot.
Well,
he was president at the time.
I'm just saying he was president at the time and the government came and took away my chicken.
You,
you guys do the math.
Okay.
That's sad.
That's a real sad story.
This one.
Did you invent anything with your chicken though?
I'm going to follow.
It's got this great story about how he invented chicken nuggets and then didn't get the credit
for it because he had to do it on the down low.
So his boss would whatever,
whatever they could do it on.
It just depends on you could have chicken system for chicken tendy redemption.
So
you're about to lose a lot of 10 D's.
You're about to 10 don't purposes.
And yes,
I like 10 didn't.
But wouldn't you rather have chicken chunks instead of chicken chunks?
Sounds like a little girl's.
Yeah.
Like,
like a chicken chunks.
Is it kind of a manly sounding?
What about,
uh,
what about lady fingers?
Please.
Yeah.
That sounds like you're not going to get full at the end.
Yeah.
Could I have a chicken?
Can I have a plate of lady fingers,
please?
Yeah.
You know,
you might as well just give me some of them chunks.
I need chicken chunks.
You guys don't understand marketing.
So a lot of you may have heard Philo Drummond recently on the sheriff's slice book.

I'm not sure if you're aware of this podcast because,
uh,
I don't know if you were aware of this.
But Sean is always copying us.
That's why the sheriff's slice podcast is,
uh,
of a member of the free think radio.com family.
So you did,
uh,
you did the,
the actual good show and now you're doing our show.
Lady tenders.
This is the chicken nuggets show.
I guess,
man.
I,
I'm pretty sure.
I'm really confused.
Well,
I,
I haven't been here a long time.
Maybe this is all old hat to everybody else who's been here for the last month.
But again,
the guys wouldn't let me be on the black history month shows.
So,
uh,
this is called an old hat.
Old hats.
Because,
because it was a familiar piece of equipment for you.
Oh,
okay.
That's what I'm thinking.
That's why I'm thinking they did that.
Eric.











I'm sorry.

My left nut is tingling and that means it's time to do the blind eyes.
Oh,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,



blah,
blah,
blah,



blah,
blah.
Yeah,



You know what I mean?
So just let go of it.




Well,
phylo.
This is the part of the show where,
um,
you know,
because,
you know,
you can't stop ISIS from killing everybody all of the time.
So we figured you're not,
that's right.
So,
so we feel like the best way to handle that is,
uh,
to every week on the show,
because we have a very high ice or ISIS,
uh,
listenership.
Very high.
that we feel like we'll just tell them who they can kill,
who we don't like, to get it out of their system,
and we'll turn a blind eye to it,
and that's why it's called the Blind Eye Segment.
Hit me with that cowbell, please.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
So we'll all take turns.
Cue the Wishbone Ash tune right quick.
Play that Wishbone Ash riff.
Do it, B's.
Blind eye.
Blind eye.
Oh, we might have to play that next time we do a Blind Eye Segment.
Open that segment with Blind Eye by Wishbone Ash.
Blind Eye.
Are you writing this down, Dr. Fox?
Okay, I'm going back to work now.
Blind Eye by Wishbone Ash.
Thank God.
Wishbone Ash.
Wishbone Ash.
All right.
Philo with the producer credit.
They're an awesome band.
So I'm curious, before we break out on this,
you know, a lot of announcements,
and I know that, um,
what do you mean before?
All right, go ahead, Phil.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, B's.
No, no.
You have a lot of announcements
before we break into the bit that we just introduced.
A lot of announcements.
I wanted to ask my friend Phyla Drummond some questions,
but that's fine.
Let's go.
Let's move it along.
Well, I'm glad you waited
until after I said we were doing the Blind Eye.
I really held back.
I really held back.
Blind Eye.
Blind Eye.
I did all that, man.
I worked really hard on that.
I practiced all day.
And now you're like, you're really like, you know.
Didn't practice all day.
Don't lie to me.
You're really giving me a flat tire over here, P's.
All right.
Who's your Blind Eye?
My Blind Eye?
Yeah.
Well, uh, John, my Blind Eye.
Yes, Mr. Reagan.
It's very, it's a deep Blind Eye.
God damn it.
You don't have one again.
It's a heavy, heavy, heavy.
All right.
No.
Dr. Fox, buy him some time.
My Blind Eye this week for any terrorists
that were to kill these people.
I'm not saying to, but people who make up new sports.
I think it's, there's only, I'm not a, I'm not a sportsman.
You know, I'm not good with, with the ground ball.
I'm not, I'm not good with the, with the throwing ball.
I'm not good with the discs.
I'm not good with, with, with the, the chucking, the lobbing, the lifting, the running.
You're not bad.
You're not bad with the shafts.
The looking at it, looking at sports isn't really my thing, but when people try to come
up with new ones, the only reason we've got what we've got today are because these are
somewhat comprehensible.
But when you go to riding go-karts and sports,
slinging high lie balls or, or, or playing a tag football with a bag of marshmallows
strapped to your upper shin and you go to, and then you go to kick your friend, you go
to kick your friend and the marshmallows come out.
Get them.
You have to, you have to meet at the 50 yard line and mate hot cocoa.
Cause this is, this is the Dutch way of football.
This is how they do it.
So you're basically turning a blind eye.
To Calvin ball.
Calvin balls, a sport.
Okay.
It's a sport.
It's an ultimate Frisbee.
No, I die.
Not a sport.
Okay.
Ultimate Calvin ball.
Yeah.
And did you say Calvin ball?
Because Dutch people were Calvinists, uh, during the religious reform and that tied into the whole
Dutch aspect of the football thing that he was talking about.
Why else would I have brought it up?
I thought it was pretty, I just wanted to make sure because
I thought it was brilliant.
Fit.
But there you go.
Put bag.
I fucking hate it.
At the foot bag competitive foot bag.
Do they hear the effect in the discord room?
Yes they do.
Terrible.
It's awful.
They just took a round of applause for show robot.
30.
Does he have a back story?
Does he even have a name?
Does show robot have a name?
Like he's guy.
Show robot has a name.
His name is show.
His name is Sho Rogan.
All right.
Well, I'm going to stop recording now, and we can go to bed.
Got it in the can.
Thank you very much, everybody.
We'll see you next time.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.











The swear words, we are trying to be friendly to families, and I don't know which family
they're talking about, because, like, the Manson family.
The one big happy family.
The, I don't know.
The all in the family.
You know, that was a kind of messed up family.
They.
Yeah.
That's what I'm saying.
Social workers might have gotten involved, and it would have been better off.
Those kids were raising themselves.
Yeah.
That was dangerous.
I thought they were all adults.
That was a lot for two single parents to take up.
Two single parents.
Two single parents.
Have you, yeah, do you not remember this yet?
It was two single parents.
Anyway, that's besides the point.
Their future was already doomed.
I'm talking about ours.
If we were to continue to do this, we can no longer say certain words.
Those words being, uh.
Bleep.
Jeez.
That, sheesh.
Okay, yeah, but that's one of them.
Bleep is on the top of the, you're right.
There you go.
Okay.
I can't say fornication.
Excrete.
Then there's also, diddly is one of them.
Doody.
Yeah, doody is right out.
Doody.
That is still funny.
You said doody.
Sorry.
Pencil shavings.
Can't say pencil.
Galdarnit.
Dagnabbit.
Carbuncle.
Oh, gosh, no.
You cannot say carbuncle.

What about propuscular?
No.
No.
And none of the dirty words.
No.
No.
Soil.
Sand.
Mulch.
Grit.
None of that.
No granite.
No grit.
No.
Mud.
No.
No mud.
Goiter.
You are a pervert.
You are just so sick.
I'm going to vomit.
Oh, that is.
Sorry.
How about.
Oh, that is even.
Tarnish.
No effing and jeffing.
What about shimmin and fimmin?
None of them either.
They're not invited.
They're no longer invited to the party.
It's just like apparently it's just too nasty for some people and their dirty, dirty minds.
They take what we say and turn it into other things.
Like was we for us as as sailors on shore leave.
Yes.
We we we just talk like that.
Yeah.
It just falls right the F out of our mouth.
How are you going to know where the bleep to put the anchor?
Right.
And if if if I if something if well, if something hits me in the shin, I'm going to expletive.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
The expletive out of there.
And I'm going to, you know, anyway, but the most important thing.
Watch out.
Somebody might hoist the hall here throat.
Whoa.
You get too dirty on the air.
Right.
Right.
So.
So because there's like the censorship board or something like that.
I don't know how bored you have to be to do that for a hobby.
But I'm so bored on the censorship.
I'm bored.
Really?
So like, yeah.
Yeah.
You know, darn the nation.
They have very easy buttons to push.
Really?
Like greasy.
So you just don't have to try and get pressed.
Yeah.
People come with their own buttons.
But I have a whole bunch of buttons here to push.
Like there's a red shiny one that says, please don't.
I can push that one.
I just am not supposed to.
Well, you know, I will.
Can I push this one?
No, no, no.
Wait.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Of course you can.
You can push all the buttons.
I don't have any buttons.
I just have knobs.
You have knobs?
Yeah.
Just knobs.
No buttons.
What are you?
Analog?
Yes.
Not analog.
No touch screen.
No, I'm animal.
It's nice to meet you.
Analog.
Animal.
So.
Yeah.
So.
So.
So.
So.
So.



These knobs, I guess.
Yeah, but no, that's true too, though.
I mean, like I also have, yeah, but our knobs are up to like 11 and they can't handle that
with their digitized equipment.
See?
Yeah.
No, their knobs are like below decibel levels.
Right.
Like sub-hearing.
Yeah.
It's like you don't even have to say things.
They can hear you think them and then the buttons get pushed and suddenly there's an
explosion.
Yeah.
It's thought crimes, I think, is what those are considered.
Explosions look like monetary fines.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I need to send all my money to the Church of the Subgenius.
Oh, that's it.
So instead of saying beep, they can say send money to the Church of the Subgenius.
Okay.
So say an expletive.
So instead of Flemming.
You can say.
Flemming.
Send $35 to the Church of the Subgenius.
In.
Yeah.
That would be a great soundbite.
Yeah.
There you go.
Send $35 to the Church of the Subgenius.
I would definitely rather have that than somebody telling me not to say something.
Somebody could just put that over.
All the kneecaps.
You know, all this stuff that I would rather say.
Bonesburgs.
Oh.
Yeah.
All that.
The thing is, it's like, because we, you know, we're cross-talking all the time and sometimes
they have to bleep both of us at the same time.
It's true.
Which is understandable because we are foul-mouthed humans.
Yeah.
But that's.
Send money to the Church of the Subgenius.
Fine.
And so.
I was just thinking the other day.
Maybe we could make up new cuss words.
Okay.
That are acceptable to families.
But I need to find.
I think if they just, by definition, you call them cuss words, they'll become unacceptable.
Or expletives or whatever.
I was like, hey, can I borrow your family so I can try out some new cuss words at them?
You could call it colorful phraseology.
Ooh.
I like colors.
Yeah.
People like colors.
Like if they like art and they're not colorblind.
I don't like colors, actually.
I don't want a monochrome world.
I want everything.
It's painted black.
But, you know.
There's already songs about it.
Yeah.
I'm just saying, if we call it cuss words, they're going to come at it with a closed mind.
But I bet in today's world, there's a few people that would lend us their families to cuss at.
To see if they are offended or not.
Like, hey, I just want to see if you get offended at these.
And if they don't get offended, but I can still say it.
Could we.
Isn't that like a win-win?
Yeah.
It's true.
We could even read them Shakespeare for Fonzies.
Oh, that's.
I don't think we have.
No, that's just naughty.
That's.
That's.
That is.
Yeah.
Well, maybe if they offer to pay extra, we'll read them Shakespeare.
Possibly.
But, in the meantime, you know, we're just going to have to send $35 to the church and
say, genius.
Or whatever.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think that's a great idea.
I think so, too.
Cool.
High five.
Davey.
Davey Crockett.
The King of Gear.
Born on a hill.
Born on a bar.
When he was only three.
Davey.
Davey Crockett.
The King of Gear.
He went off to Congress and served a spell.
Davey.
Davey Crockett.
Serving his country.
Gear.
So.
Don't come up to me saying, oh, Reverend Stang.
I spent my $30.
I went to the subgenius show.
I saw all the preachings.
Heard all the bands.
But.
I didn't get slack.
Where's my slack?
Give me my slack.
My friend.
If that's the way you're thinking, then you never heard anything Bob said.
You never understood a word he wrote in the book of the subgenius.
Because the day that we can sell you slack is the day the conspiracy has won.
You make your own slack.
Bob is not the answer.
But neither is anything else.
You must learn to think for yourself.
But only Bob can show you.
You have.
Question authority.
Or helps.
And fuck them if they can't take a joke.
Praise Bob.
Tell me somebody.
Good night.
Einstein's secret orchestra.
Field your own shit.
Be all the soft.
I don't need you no more in this world.
I'm going to be a man.
I'll see you on the next one.
And don't.
Be.
Late.
Praise Bob.
My dad, you never know how to stay in touch with your mom and dad.
Good night.
Good night.

Good night.
Good night.

Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
And do heart of the moon crazy!
Can be fully
Do as you wish.

Yes.
You got.
All right?
It is picture어가.
And you're a woman.
you.
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side, yeah
We chased our pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
Can you still recall the time we cried
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Hey!
Come on!
Hey!
Everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby
She get high
She get high
She get high
She get high, yeah
On it lights
Hey!
guitar solo
I found an island in your heart
Country in your eyes
On the train of eyes aligned
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, oh
Oh yeah
Made to see week to week, day to day
Hour to hour, day to straight, deep and wide
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, break on through
Break on through, break on through
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Break on through to the paranoid side

and this is when we end the show
by telling you that everything you need to know
such as all the secret and public
subgenius Facebook pages
and access to our website
our books and videos
and events
are all at subgenius.com
Our two biggest events are coming up
X-Day from July 1st through 7th
and Starwood Festival
July 9th through 14th
Dr. Hal and I and Princess We will be there
and apparently President Vermin Supreme
and there will be the Bibles and Feasts
and music and saucers
and the end of the world
and slack
Let there be slack
From PR News in Washington
I'm Barefoot in response to a Costa Rican
sex abuse and forced women's rowing and basketball
at the Asian Games in Ireland last weekend
in Costa Rica
PR's reports
don't end on, don't arrest
It's the first ever Gold PR News
Ah, but that's just the end of the broadcast version of the show, friends
Now I'm talking only to internet listeners
for whom it is not illegal for me to hard sell our cool stuff
And this is the time for me to do some hard selling
because Princess We and I are now officially broke
from having to pay for two houses
for an entire year
due to unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances
Actually, two and a half years ago

we were in the half houses
The Slacker Mansion in Cleveland is nearing readiness to be put on the market
and then you, you, dear listener, will be able to buy it
Cheap!
But meanwhile, I need to have a word with you freeloaders and rewardians
You've been listening to this show and getting slack from it for years now
For free!
Don't you think it's time to both put some back in



and purchase yourself the keys to salvation
plus the most interesting folks on the whole planet
plus a package with like 25 different cool religious paraphernalia items
from the Church of the Subgenius
And did you know our books
our books are much, much better than our radio shows?
Did you know that?
We wrote and illustrated those before all the brain damage set in
When that subgenius feature documentary got cancelled,


and a while ago wouldn't even have paid to run and up a famous novel
isn't this work of the devil


The type of adventure in which all of us after all
have come from
Grrrr
Magma

your
Get in on the top floor of a lucrative old cult now.
Well, it'll be lucrative once you jackanate non-members finally buy something.
Heck, for that matter, friends, you can easily just give us money for nothing.
Just because you like Bob.
Because there's donation buttons on the homepage of subgenius.com
and on the radio page of that massive archival website.
So get it or get with it, man.
In fact, why not both?
It's just like having your cake and eating it,
but still having it to eat all over again.
Forever, if that's what you want.
And I know what Bob wants.
Bob wants your money being PayPal'd to me.
Subgenius.com.
And don't miss X Day.
Any X Day could be the last, by definition.
In fact, each one was supposed to be the last.
You're just lucky they weren't.
So hop to it, because cadets don't be a gimme Bob.
The kind that posts on the unofficial subgenius pages, Facebook pages,
without even knowing how to spell Bob right.
And believe it or not,
most of y'all don't.
Get on the stick and praise Bob like you know you want to.
With your wallet.
And I'll let Jimmy Ryan take us out.
