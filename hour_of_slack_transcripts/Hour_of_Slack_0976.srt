1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,660
A malignant cancerous growth eating at the spiritual health of the American people.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,020
I refer to Bob.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,600
That settles it.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,820
We'll show this lunatic who's Bob.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,560
Good night.

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,220
Good night.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,280
And now, let's hear what a typical housewife thinks about.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,100
Hi out there.

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,960
And speaking of hi, I'd like to show you the...

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,380
Oh, jeez.

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,200
Oh, jeez.

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,580
Hey, yes, dear friends.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,240
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 976.

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,100
And this is a particularly unusual Hour of Slack

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,500
because we're not in our home laboratory studio

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,100
but are assembling the show in Texas at the Stang Ranch.

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,780
In fact, we're doing it all outdoors.

18
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,960
But, but, we're using recordings from the European Subgenius Tour

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,980
and free radio patented.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,920
From Amsterdam.

21
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,060
And even some bits from Starwood Festival last year.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,080
And yet, and yet, this is a special educational episode

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,440
on the subject of drug abuse.

24
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,340
Yes, we have lately seen an increase in the use

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,260
by subgenius youth

26
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,700
of cheap conspiracy street drugs

27
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,860
such as...

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,980
cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, LSD, television, et cetera.

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,360
And we as elder ministers in the Church of the Subgenius

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,460
are concerned.

31
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,620
And we intend to do something about it.

32
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,700
And really, I'm supposed to get off.

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,680
We're all supposed to get off, aren't we?

34
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,620
Earth, we must get off.

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,980
But are there any questions or anything pertinent?

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
That I could go...

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,560
That's always fun.

38
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,280
Where's all this hoo-ha?

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,080
What is all this hoo-ha?

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,660
Well, you know, that's the question that every subgenius asks itself

41
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,120
when it first drops that first hit of acid.

42
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,080
What is all this hoo-ha?

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,140
And think of all the crap that people are doing right now.

44
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,480
Think of all the crap that's going on in the world right at this minute.

45
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,980
God, I had that thought when I was a kid.

46
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,540
I had that thought one time.

47
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,420
Oh, I spent weeks writing this essay about how fragile the ecosystem was

48
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,980
and how we mustn't ever let nuclear weapons destroy the world and so forth.

49
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,080
Oh, spent weeks writing that.

50
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,000
Five or six people thought it was quite well written.

51
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,520
So, why are...

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,800
You all should have gone to see Harvey Wasserman talking about how to beat Bush.

53
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,600
Where is it?

54
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,160
Well, it's over now.

55
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,200
You came here instead.

56
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,360
You wanted slack for yourself instead of for those poor Iraqi children, you bastard.

57
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,460
You should feel shitty about that.

58
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,580
Yes, the little boy in the wig.

59
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,080
I'm Mel Gordo. I'm a subgenius from...

60
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,440
I joined in 98. I paid my $20.

61
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,920
I've married three couples and they're all still married.

62
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,860
Anyway, I got a question.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,440
I lost a library book. It's somewhere in my basement.

64
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,080
Do you know where it is?

65
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,560
No.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,980
Are you sure?

67
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,760
Yes.

68
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,900
Well, I was pretty quick on that one, wasn't I?

69
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,480
You are much better than I am on that one.

70
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,940
Let me tell you something, man.

71
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,220
I've had some real problems with people thinking I was going to be able to read their mind.

72
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,720
So, I'm usually the first to say,

73
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:56,040
No, I'm actually really dumb and if you have a problem, you have to tell me.

74
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,700
Because I can't read your mind and I don't know where your lost library book is.

75
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,240
I can feel you inside there, Sting. I can. I can feel you inside there.

76
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,360
All these kids these days, they figure, oh, I'm going to get high.

77
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,840
I'm going to get high and go to one of them spaced out trance-so concerts.

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,700
I'm going to get high on, you know, I'll try some of that mace mixed with DMT mixed with marijuana,

79
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,520
mixed with Everclear.

80
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,520
Man, if you want to be really cool, you'd sever the connection between your right and left brains.

81
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,560
Now, if you want to get buzzed on, dude,

82
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,440
you won't be able to tell the difference between your car and your glasses.

83
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,280
Reagan achieved that state without even trying.

84
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,680
And Bob was born that way.

85
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,120
If Bob actually wanted to vanquish his enemies, he'd send them a fax and they'd die from the paper cut.

86
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,900
Bob has, he would never kill them directly.

87
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,180
It was like they would end up killing themselves by some stupid error.

88
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:19,040
And die in a humiliating way without Bob's having to lift a finger.

89
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,960
And it would be people like, this happened to his school teachers when he was a child.

90
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:31,700
His school principal, his teacher, people, anyone who crossed him would go through this hard,

91
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,340
he once said, I hope you get paper cut to death.

92
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,220
And this teacher actually fell into the paper slicing machine at the newspaper plant

93
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,540
while taking the kids on a school trip through it.

94
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,960
That's a kind of weird effect.

95
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,720
When Bob was a child, he was able to do miracles, actually.

96
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,240
Like the baby Jesus was.

97
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,700
Little known fact.

98
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
He could fly.

99
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,780
And the infant Bob was a bank robber at the age of two.

100
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,480
While he was in the terrible twos, he would watch bank robbers on television.

101
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,180
And he flew.

102
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,340
And the authorities almost had to put him to death.

103
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,040
But, and, you know, it almost kept secret.

104
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,800
But you know how Bob's luck is.

105
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,180
Somehow, the key people all forgot the records were burned.

106
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,540
The courthouse burned down.

107
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,620
The tornado took the judge away.

108
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,260
This is my question, though.

109
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,320
Can Bob be killed?

110
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,800
Can Bob be killed?

111
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,120
Well, Bob has, technically Bob has been killed.

112
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:45,180
And there is a Bob corpse preserved in Lucite at the top of the old subgenius Foundation skyscraper,

113
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,200
which is unfortunately now owned by Sony.

114
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,100
We'll get that Dobbs corpse back eventually, I'm sure.

115
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,160
But, and, you know, I think that's a good thing.

116
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,740
And there is the Bob who is now out selling or fishing or whatever.

117
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,000
And actually all the other corpses.

118
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,060
There have quite a been, and the historical Bob corpses.

119
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,740
Mummies exist of earlier Bobs from many cultures.

120
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:15,400
There have always been salesmen, yes, of what we call snake oil.

121
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,000
Salesmen of faith.

122
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,520
Salesmen who had something.

123
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,680
People would pay anything for.

124
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,140
They sold hope.

125
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,380
They sold magic.

126
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,160
Yes.

127
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,560
They sold slack, essentially.

128
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,940
They sold the knowledge of slack.

129
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,100
They sold the reminder that you do have slack.

130
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,940
When it says the subgenius must have slack,

131
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,340
that doesn't mean that we don't have slack now and we misguided.

132
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,100
It means that to be a subgenius, you must have slack.

133
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,880
You must.

134
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,500
Little known.

135
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:50,780
Little known secret.

136
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,300
There's a lot of good eating on them corpse.

137
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,580
Mmm, gizzards.

138
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,040
It's good eating.

139
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,060
And people smoke the Bob corpses.

140
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,360
And the McKenna brain.

141
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,180
I noticed McKenna brain was going for it.

142
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,160
Well, I forget what it was.

143
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,080
Way out of my price range.

144
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,480
Well, there's some at one of those magic mushroom or magic whatever.

145
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,520
At magic smart brain shop.

146
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,860
McKenna brain and Bob lung.

147
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,780
You know, in the States,

148
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:26,160
they're now smoking dried up lung of dead heavy drug users.

149
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,980
It's called Lunk.

150
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,400
The Lunkheads are the bane of the urban.

151
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,240
Because, but it's actually not too bad because it's very,

152
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,440
you have to, it's hard to get.

153
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:43,400
You have to be in the society of Lunkheads because essentially that's the only way to get it.

154
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,020
You have to legally declare that your lungs are going to go to this Lunkhead society.

155
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,700
So that when you die, you can smoke Lunk.

156
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,320
Now, you know, you can get Lunk and smoke it,

157
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,780
but that means the next generation is going to be,

158
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,680
in a way, each generation gets slightly stronger Lunk.

159
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,980
Oh, hell, that's just too many for me.

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,940
Give me one of them drugs that's all like numbers or something.

161
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,420
So, friends, be careful about hard drugs.

162
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,900
Now, I'm a fella with a heart of gold,

163
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,820
the ways of a gentleman, I've been told.

164
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,280
The kind of a guy that wouldn't even harm a flea.

165
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,660
But if me and a certain character met,

166
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,380
the guy that invented that cigarette,

167
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,960
I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree.

168
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,360
Now, it ain't cause I don't smoke myself,

169
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,520
and I don't reckon they'll harm your health.

170
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,960
I've smoked them all my life and ain't dead yet.

171
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,420
But nicotine slaves are all the same.

172
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,000
At a petting party or a poker party,

173
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,420
or a poker game, everything's gotta stop

174
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,640
while they smoke that cigarette.

175
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,540
Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette.

176
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,640
Puff, puff, puff that if you smoke yourself to death.

177
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,720
Tell St. Peter at the Golden Gate

178
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
that you hate to make him wait,

179
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,220
but you just gotta have another cigarette.

180
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,380
Prop is the mind killer.

181
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,140
That's okay, we don't need any minds.

182
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,500
It's a good thing, though, that prop is not a drug.

183
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,840
Because you'd be in terrible trouble then, surely,

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
if you say you have restricted drug laws.

185
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,020
And, you know, I think we've found some prop out here,

186
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,940
but it doesn't seem to be generally available.

187
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,000
I mean, a lot of people seem to make the mistake of thinking

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,460
that prop is the marijuana that we see

189
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,980
on many street corners here.

190
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,120
But I'm given to understand it's absolutely not the same thing.

191
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,880
It's a sacred herb.

192
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,760
If only it was, if that was prop.

193
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,660
But see, that would destroy the city.

194
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,160
It'd be like that movie 28 Days Later.

195
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,800
The way a normal would react to real prop

196
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,640
would be equivalent...

197
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,640
That's what the Night of the Living Dead

198
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,740
really is based on.

199
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,480
It would be like that.

200
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,260
So it's best that they sell...

201
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,060
Here in Amsterdam, they only sell

202
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,560
plain, ordinary, what we call dirt prop,

203
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
or, you know, the castaway.

204
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,780
And you can see what's happened.

205
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,120
There's a bowl of real prop going around,

206
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,640
and you can see what it's done to the city.

207
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,420
And you can see what's happened to the studio audience here.

208
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,640
Oh, damn.

209
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,680
Stang, stang, stang, keep it quiet.

210
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,280
Stang.

211
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,920
Stang, get...

212
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:27,820
Prop.

213
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:28,980
Prop.

214
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,100
No, friends.

215
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,000
Whereas marijuana is a habit-forming, addictive drug,

216
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,680
prop doesn't wear off.

217
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,540
Never goes away.

218
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,160
So you only have to do it once or twice.

219
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,820
You can only get higher.

220
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,760
You can never come down.

221
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,900
Oh, and we should mention that it does give you a headache.

222
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,660
A slight headache, which will last about a year.

223
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,060
So just keep that in mind, kids.

224
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,880
As Bob said, too much is always better than not enough.

225
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,100
But there was actually a torn-off little section on the end

226
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,440
that said, but it's almost as bad.

227
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,920
Which doesn't sound as good, so he left it off, apparently.

228
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,740
It was interesting to find that life-saving.

229
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:16,880
I'll put it down here.

230
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,900
And find that all those alcohol overdoses by college students

231
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,060
excused that they thought were excused by Bob

232
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,300
were actually just foolishness.

233
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,380
Those overdoses and mental illnesses,

234
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,540
those were just part of the satire, Your Honor.

235
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,500
That was just part of the joke.

236
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,580
It's a religious take-off.

237
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,140
We're a mirror reflecting the ills in society around us.

238
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,080
Lenny, to quote Lenny Pierce, quoting,

239
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,020
what you always say to the cops,

240
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,940
Oh, we were making an anti-drug film, sir.

241
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,180
I've had to say that one several times.

242
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,300
Oh, and here's the one that I've had to say the most.

243
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,980
Well, officer, have you ever seen Mad Magazine?

244
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,600
That's the one I've had to say the most.

245
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,760
Well, officer, did you ever read Mad Magazine?

246
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,920
Oh, Mad, oh yeah, Alfred E. Newman, hilarious.

247
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,200
What do you mean?

248
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,980
Well, we're just comedians.

249
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,720
Just not as famous or as good or funny.

250
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,700
That's all.

251
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,160
Well, get out of here, you make me sick.

252
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,480
That's how we escape, you see.

253
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,260
We pretend it's all just a little joke.

254
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,680
We live to run away and come back,

255
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,260
and then he drives off with the nails in his car tires with a slow leap.

256
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,420
Termites set the foundation, friends.

257
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,160
That's what we are.

258
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,400
Then rats in the walls.

259
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,360
The rats in the walls.

260
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,340
The slow termites.

261
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,660
It's all we can do, you know.

262
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,120
And remember, they have poison.

263
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,780
So you must, they'll use to exterminate you,

264
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,780
so you must build up an immunity straight through disfigurement.

265
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:08,740
Go live the subgenius life and eat the subgenius industrial diet.

266
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,380
Get up in the morning and have some nice healthy food.

267
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:13,380


268
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:19,180
Small food, low fat toast and butter, and a big greasy sausage.

269
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:26,560
And for lunch have, eat at McDonald's and eat four rusty nails.

270
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,940
And drink a quart of whiskey.

271
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:40,440
Then for dinner have only the finest French restaurant food mixed with gravel.

272
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,360
And you can smoke a cigarette.

273
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,800
And drink a shot of vodka.

274
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,240
And go to bed.

275
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,520
And never ever come down and dream of Bob all night long.

276
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,280
I hear the tide of Bob coming in.

277
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,460
On and off the road to Bob

278
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,360
We are marching forward blind

279
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,060
He has gouged out both our eyes

280
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:15,660
And he's laughing close behind

281
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,840
He will sell us back our eyes

282
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,500
When we join his noble plan

283
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,860
For just $19.95

284
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,220
And a taste of our wood brand

285
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,060
On and off the road with Bob

286
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:53,560
He has handed us the wheel

287
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,060
And he cuddles up with fun

288
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:05,300
As he counts himself a field

289
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,040
Our eyes are on the road

290
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,040


291
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:16,580
But Bob forgot to say

292
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:22,660
That the steering wheel went fast

293
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,180
The road carries us away

294
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,800
On and off the road for Bob

295
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,780
We forgot why we came here

296
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,340
We have quit all of our jobs

297
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,280
Like a headlight frightened deer

298
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,840
He has lit the sacred pipe

299
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,880
And he's smiling at us now

300
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,000
On and off the road he's Bob

301
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,880
He's our bull dada

302
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,640
We are his cow

303
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,580
We are his sheep

304
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,540
We are his men

305
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:47,540
We are his bull

306
00:17:48,700 --> 00:18:01,020
He's right ava

307
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,860
We are his sheep

308
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,720
search and fetch satellites

309
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,180
which we shot in space. They know, they're tracking

310
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,420
the ashes of Timothy Leary around the earth now.

311
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,900
They know where it is.

312
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,240
He's still being watched, yes.

313
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,200
Well, you know, he always liked the attention, I think.

314
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,000
I think so too, yeah. But they're actually building this

315
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,280
search and fetch

316
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,520
bots

317
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,400
which are going to shoot into space and fetch the ashes in order to smoke it.

318
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,720
They really want the ashes.

319
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,760
What would they do with the ashes? Snort them?

320
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:47,540
I think the easiest thing you can do with ashes is snort them.

321
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,280
There was a lot of other Leary brain ash

322
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,780
that the conspiracy had left, but the stuff apparently is really habit forming enough

323
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:02,980
that they'll send a space shuttle up to get that last few lines that were sent,

324
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,380
or initially just sent as a message.

325
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,280
It was a token gesture.

326
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,180
You know, a space-edness.

327
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,780
Uh-huh.

328
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,640
They should have burned, they sent his ashes up this, his brain up into space,

329
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,600
but they buried his heart in hell.

330
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,880
Actually, Princess Wee and I knew Dr. Tim.

331
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,380
I had to open for Dr. Tim several times when he spoke.

332
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,100
Yes, I had to open for him.

333
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,880
Well, you know, he's a big star.

334
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,380
He was a big star, and, and, uh, he was a big star.

335
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:40,020
And, uh, you know, we, we, uh, actually he always, he always would bum a cigarette from me.

336
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,260
He was always trying to quit smoking, supposedly, and would bum a cigarette.

337
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,520
Oh, can I get, can I get two?

338
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,060
And then he'd tell you about his latest new project.

339
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,820
And, you know, very friendly.

340
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,840
Actually, he was a very funny performer.

341
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,640
Very funny stand-up comedian.

342
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,480
That was what I always saw him doing.

343
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,420
I never read any of his books, took any of his acid.

344
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,360
Didn't know him.

345
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,080
Didn't know about that stuff until it wasn't cool anymore.

346
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,300
I didn't, I didn't know him until he was a stand-up comic.

347
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,340
Oh, that was Wavy Gravy, who's also a friend of ours.

348
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:23,800
Uh, because the Starwood Festival, see, now we can do an ad for not only X Day,

349
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,360
there's, uh, the Subgenius Holiday on July 5th,

350
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,220
which happens in Europe as well as the United States.

351
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,580
At this nudist campground in the U.S.

352
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,880
in far, in far western New York.

353
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,260
Far, it's not upstate.

354
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,660
It's far western New York.

355
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,620
Upstate is far north, near the, near Canada.

356
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,440
No.

357
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,640
Yeah, you've been to the wrong one.

358
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:57,100
You've been, no, there's, uh, and, uh, also there's this festival called Starwood,

359
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,200
which a lot of, uh, uh, hipsters, beatniks, uh, and so forth,

360
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,600
malcontents might be interested in,

361
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,460
although it's, it's partially a pagan festival,

362
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,160
which is heavy on the corniness.

363
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,880
It's also a sort of general, um, consciousness, uh, exploration festival

364
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,700
put on, do, put on by ACE, A-C-E,

365
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,160
the Association of Consciousness Exploration.

366
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,720
They haven't been on it for a while.

367
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,000
Who are they, Kraken the Poor?

368
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,040
I think we went to the wrong one.

369
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,260
Uh, www.rosencomic.com,

370
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,700
and that's how we met all those famous dead drug users.

371
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,080
We, we knew, uh, and Terence McKenna spoke out there,

372
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,000
and Pope Bob, Robert Anton Wilson, has been there several times.

373
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,220
So, this, this is how we know the ancient creaking, uh, forefathers

374
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,380
of, uh, heavy, heavy psychedelic use,

375
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,400
whose brains we now, and body parts we now try to buy smoke.

376
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,460
Stuff they sell on the street is not really Leary Brain or McKenna Gland or...

377
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,540
Oh, this stuff's awesome.

378
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,360
Yeah.

379
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:17,040
I promise you, the, uh, the stang, the stang-gleet that you see advertised on the internet

380
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,400
is not real.

381
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,360
That's somebody else's gleet.

382
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,720
I'm afraid I can prove it, too.

383
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,180
We have...

384
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,840
Oof, alright, we're going for another drink.

385
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,280
anyway, I那個...

386
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,820
Nothing good happened.

387
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,240
Okay.

388
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,820
So, Far parsley, thanks for your help OH MY GOD

389
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,140
Thisすごynчик

390
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,140


391
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,020
This 650S thing I really know.

392
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,400
Oh wow, the guy who stole the money

393
00:22:59,400 --> 00:22:59,900
Great.

394
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,820
was from Reverend Artemia Salina.

395
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,040
And before that, we've been listening to some clips

396
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:11,480
from Reverend Lord Yeti's free radio patapoo in Amsterdam

397
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,000
with Pope Mickey Finn and Lord Yeti, Carl X, and others.

398
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,820
The song, On and Off the Road to Bob,

399
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,680
was by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

400
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,860
Smoke That Cigarette was, well, to tell the truth,

401
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,880
it just says hillbilly on my notes.

402
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,600
I don't know who that was.

403
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,700
And the ranting, the ranting at the very beginning

404
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,600
was yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

405
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,200
preaching at Starwood 24 last summer

406
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,860
with titles by Mr. Fernandanande Lemaire.

407
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,300
Now, friends, about these drugs,

408
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,120
there is such a thing as too much,

409
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,260
and we have the tapes to prove it.

410
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,840
The European subgenius Taurus,

411
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,140
or is organized by subgenius Pope David Lee Black,

412
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,820
a former American.

413
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,260
And in some of the rare recordings to come,

414
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,360
you'll hear examples of what happens

415
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,280
to even the soberest sacred scribe and space princess

416
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,420
when they attempt to follow one such as Pope Black.

417

¶¶

435
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,400
I'm trying to control my motor skills and I'll click in my chair without a care.

436
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,360
I've got this, you're standing there.

437
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,440
A couple of lines, lines of Akatak.

438
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,860
I have a ton of chronic smoke tonight.

439
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,900
I feel alright.

440
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,740
Have it or do not.

441
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,020
Pathetic.

442
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,480
Just pathetic, friends.

443
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:59,640
Well, that's the name of the band that did that piece of music.

444
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,400
Pathetic.

445
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,000
Yes, pills are bad.

446
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,760
Unless they're the good pills.

447
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,440
And luckily we had those pills in Europe.

448
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,620
But sometimes pills aren't enough.

449
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,620
But look at Kurt Cobain.

450
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:19,340
Sometimes pills, millions of dollars, fame, bimbos and heroin aren't enough.

451
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,340
I have to lodge a complaint now.

452
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,780
Since I'm with the High Subgenius Council, I want to lodge a serious complaint.

453
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,020
I don't know if I want to come over here and do a Deval tomorrow.

454
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,380
Why is that, David?

455
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,140
I don't want to do that.

456
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,200
You know why I don't want to do it?

457
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,060
But we like this place. Why not? Why wouldn't you?

458
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,520
Because Kai comes up to me and he goes,

459
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,480
I can only offer you guys two cases of beer and three bottles of vodka tomorrow.

460
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,680
And that's all I can do.

461
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,940
No! We won't accept those terms.

462
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,160
We want to accept those terms.

463
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,180
We want to accept those terms.

464
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,800
Ten cases of vodka.

465
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,080
God damn it!

466
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:59,360
God damn it! I can't bear to do a Deval in this place here with that pittance they're offering us for alcohol.

467
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:06,620
Can you imagine? Somebody has given us a place to stay and then expects us to just turn up and be paid that?

468
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,500
It's a dry spot to sleep.

469
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,780
They're taking the piss.

470
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,820
This is the worst, this is the worst, worst in the thousand summers in America where you can't get any weed because it's dry.

471
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,780
Hey, last time I was paid in London.

472
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:20,780


473
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,360
I was paid in London for lottery tickets.

474
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,980
Come on.

475
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,620
They were used.

476
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,900
Why isn't the question mark over the exclamation point?

477
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,040
That's what I want.

478
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,460
Yeah?

479
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,920
Ladies and gentlemen, you know what?

480
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:39,860
The most faithful of the church of the sub-genius and those who believe in Bob are still standing here now.

481
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:46,780
I have witnessed the whole damn evening people running in and out and in and out of this place.

482
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,100
People talking amongst themselves.

483
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:49,680
What?

484
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,980
People are preaching the word of Bob because they do not care about Bob.

485
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,460
They're still talking and they don't care about Bob.

486
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,940
Well, my friends, there's one thing that I would like to say to you right now.

487
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,940
Do not turn your back.

488
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:17,720
Do not turn your back on J.R. Bob Dobbs because this is what will happen to you.

489
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,140
Do I hear a praise?

490
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,480
Praise Bob!

491
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,680
Praise Bob!

492
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,060
Do I hear a praise Bob?

493
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,040
Praise Bob!

494
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:33,240
Now, without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, all the way from Zwolle, Netherlands, the Reverend Lucky Bastard.

495
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,180
You can clap now.

496
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,340
You can cheer.

497
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:37,960
Come on.

498
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

499
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,020
Oh, yeah.

500
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,300
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I just need us to take a piss.

501
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:54,840
And when I was taking a piss, I jumped down and I smacked my head on the ground.

502
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,360
I mean on the floor.

503
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,160
It's called the ceiling.

504
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,420
So I smacked my head on the ceiling.

505
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,380
I fell down.

506
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,440
I'm a real jackass, but that's subgenius.

507
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,560
But, you know, the conspiracy's been eating my words every fucking day.

508
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,700
In Holland now, we have no freedom.

509
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:17,820
No!

510
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,060
You say something and they're gonna kill you.

511
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,540
They're gonna say...

512
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,680
They're gonna slit your throat.

513
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:31,120
When subgenius hits his head on the head on the ceiling, it means something.

514
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,000
It means that...

515
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,580
That unoriginal happens to original.

516
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,860
I've been brain damaged and hypnotized by the conspiracy.

517
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,640
I've been acting not like I used to be.

518
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,100
Slack, what is it?

519
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,960
Why this?

520
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,360
I don't know what it is

521
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,720
because Slack has been taken away from me every fucking day.

522
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,660
Slack is taken away.

523
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,400
Then I take a vauban, and everything goes back to normal.

524
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,980
Am I normal?

525
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,080
I don't think so.

526
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,840
I totally fuck up.

527
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,100
Totally because the conspiracy fucks me up.

528
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,700
My name's DJ Konicat. Not for nothing.

529
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:23,160
I smoke everything, because I smoke lungs every day, I take every fucking drug there is, and anyways, I'm screwed up.

530
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:29,920
Not because I'm a subgenius, but because the conspiracy wants me to be screwed up.

531
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,960
And Bob is the only guy who can screw my ass.

532
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,420
I'm a bit brain damaged from hitting the scene just now when I was taking a piss.

533
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:53,940
But that's all because the conspiracy programmed me with some kind of nanotechnology they have, which I know, and only subgenius knows.

534
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:03,120
That was Reverend Lucky Bastard from Holland at the Foundry in London, that's where he was ranting.

535
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,380
Ranting while with an actual concussion.

536
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,960
He really did bonk his head on some pipes.

537
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,400
And was ranting.

538
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,880
Ranting with a concussion.

539
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,320
So you see, altered consciousness can come in so many ways.

540
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,880
You don't have to take drugs.

541
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:24,520
Like Reverend Lucky Bastard, you can just slam your head against metal pipes.

542
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,480
Also, that's your other possibility.

543
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:39,740
Anyway, let's go back to the European subgenius tapes and this delightful moment from the D-Vival in Germany at the Fundbüro in Hamburg.

544
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,380
All I give a shit about is Bob.

545
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,060
All I give a shit about is being Bob and us doing one more song together.

546
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,640
Because you're a bunch of fucking fashion maggots and I hate all of you.

547
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,820
Just like Ninslo with me.

548
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,500
I fucking hate you.

549
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,020
I hate everybody in this place.

550
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,200
Look at you.

551
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,100
You're walking around and you're posturing.

552
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,300
Posturing.

553
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,720
You're fucking posturing.

554
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:09,720


555
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:09,720


556
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:09,720


557
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:09,720


558
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:09,720


559
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,220
Posturing trying to be somebody you're not.

560
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,460
Fuck you.

561
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,100
Fuck you and everybody else you wrote into your goddamn fabric.

562
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,140
Fine.

563
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,320
Get out of my church if you want to.

564
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,420
That is tremendous.

565
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,820
It really is.

566
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,780
It's Pope Black in the flowing light.

567
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,200
With Bob pulling his zipper down.

568
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,160
Praise Bob!

569
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,600
Praise Bob!

570
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,120
Is anybody getting any alcohol?

571
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,380
You drank it all.

572
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,940
What happened to that six pack of vodka?

573
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,360
Yeah, well that's his.

574
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,680
We've only been through two bottles of it now.

575
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,340
That's what I thought.

576
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:51,320
I think Kai is rationing the vodka to us because he knows the minute that he gets it

577
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,100
on him it'll be gone the next day.

578
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,420
Kai is brilliant.

579
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,140
Kai's touch is not felt.

580
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,760
He steers us but he steers you away.

581
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,060
He's the perfect host for it.

582
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,360
He's really into the office.

583
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,140
He really is.

584
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,480
This is his place.

585
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,720
He is the dream host.

586
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,020
He sets us on the right track but steers us away.

587
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,080
He gets us hookers that we don't even have to pay for.

588
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,400
He gets us hookers that we don't even remember fucking.

589
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,460
He gets us hookers that don't necessarily exist.

590
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,660
That's what bothers me.

591
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,760
Meta cyber hookers.

592
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,000
Ethereal hookers.

593
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,020
Meta ethereal hookers.

594
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,880
Oh yay, but we walked the valley of shame last night but we feared no evil because we

595
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,280
were slacker than any other motherfucker in the video series.

596
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,240
Actually, I have to admit I feared a little evil.

597
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,000
Well, we feared a tiny amount of pickpocketing but I don't know if that's the same thing.

598
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,660
It didn't happen though.

599
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,800
The octopus.

600
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:48,800
Why the fuck do we need people to pick our pockets when I can just go drop money on the

601
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,020
floor when I'm fucking everyone.

602
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,260
Hell man.

603
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:50,940
Free.

604
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,400
You get me drunk enough.

605
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,640
You've got the contents of my bank account.

606
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:54,980
I didn't drop money yet.

607
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,260
I think the number is.

608
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,580
Oh really?

609
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,300
It's terrible.

610
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,040
I'm sitting here.

611
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,180
I've got to smoke all this.

612
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:01,960
All this.

613
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,220
Drink all this.

614
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,920
It's just me.

615
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,840
Oh, it was you that drank it all.

616
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:07,980
It was you.

617
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:07,980


618
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:07,980


619
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:07,980


620
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:07,980


621
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:07,980


622
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:07,980


623
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:07,980


624
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,960
I thought Bob, I heard Bob was here.

625
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,440
I thought maybe it was him that had done this.

626
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,100
Hopefully we got some kind of a recording for what that's worth.

627
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,580
It was a recording.

628
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,660
Yes, it's a recording of something.

629
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,040
Here's to Germany Land town.

630
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,120
Yes, Germany Land town.

631
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,060
Germany Land town was cool thanks to the aforementioned Kai.

632
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,400
And after Germany Land town we went to Amsterdam.

633
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:43,180
And preached at the butt kite to the legal pot smokers.

634
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:47,180
The Nederlandertals we call them of Holenhepp land.

635
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,520
Friends, if Bob said it, then you better pick up on it.

636
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:58,020
If Bob says that traffic light is green and it looks red to you, which do you trust man?

637
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,340
Close your eyes and pump the gas.

638
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,100
You do what Bob said no matter what your mind says.

639
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,600
Who do you trust?

640
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,380
Your mind or your heart?

641
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:07,580
Your mind or your heart.

642
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:07,580


643
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,440
You better get that part straight first friend.

644
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,020
But some people fear to trust Bob and I don't blame them.

645
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,660
We've all been burned at one point because we trusted the conspiracy or else we wouldn't

646
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,320
be so screwed up today.

647
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,220
But really, if you can't trust Bob, who can you trust?

648
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:33,420
Anyway, surely there's a, my friends, let me, I'm so pleased to introduce, Jesus couldn't

649
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,280
be with us today.

650
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,120
Why?

651
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,880
Because he got a new job and had to move to Georgia.

652
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,540
But, Columbus, Georgia I'm afraid.

653
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:49,160
But, friends, the father of Jesus, yes, Joseph himself, the most famous cuckold of almost

654
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,340
perhaps of history, Joseph.

655
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:04,180
Hello, thanks for coming out, friends, brethren, uberfems, yeti, bear with me one minute, I

656
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,860
lost my cordless microphone, so.

657
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,280
This is what we're going to do.

658
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,700
I'm not really going to rant tonight because like Reverend Ivan Staggs said, it's no use

659
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,200
preaching to the enlightened.

660
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,120
So, thanks for coming out tonight.

661
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,160
You know, this is the anal frock of the Anans Band.

662
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:34,160
It is true that it is becoming tighter and tighter every day, the conspiracy, the conspiracy

663
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,160


664
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,160


665
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,160


666
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,160


667
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,160


668
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,100
putting shackles on all of us.

669
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,280
We can't even have frock at the frock cup.

670
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,560
More and more it happens, you can't even smoke frock on the streets.

671
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,740
You can't even roll frock on the streets at coffee shops.

672
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:54,280
You can't even smoke frock on the terraces of coffee shops.

673
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,600
Soon enough you can't smoke frock anywhere.

674
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,400
We cannot let this happen.

675
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:01,940
No!

676
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,620
The subgenius must have froth.

677
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,060
We must have froth.

678
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,060
But it is not Bob's pipe that is important. It's what's in the pipe.

679
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:10,520
Woo!

680
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,080
Hey!

681
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:16,240
I can't just sit and sing. Give me all the psychic energy.

682
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,740
Eat flowers and kiss babies.

683
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,300
L.S.B. for you and me.

684
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:36,660
There's one thing, friends, that's more powerful than human belief.

685
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:42,860
You know, when a person really believes something, they can heal illnesses they have.

686
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,080
You know, like faith healing.

687
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,900
Some people have faith in Jesus and that cures them.

688
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,240
I'm the kind of... I used to think, oh gosh, I'm so faithless I could never...

689
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,280
If I had some dreadful dream, I could never...

690
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,200
If I had some dreadful disease, I couldn't undergo faith healing.

691
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,360
And then I realized, no, I have faith.

692
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,700
I was taught to have faith in high doctor bills.

693
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:08,120
If I get a high enough bill from the doctor, my faith is such that it just might save me.

694
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,440
But there's... and that is the power of the human mind.

695
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,820
But there's something far more powerful than your belief or your mind.

696
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,340
And that is your ego!

697
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,180
Your ego is so good at tricking your mind.

698
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,440
It's so much better.

699
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,280
Your mind is so much better at tricking your mind.

700
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,300
Your mind cannot even guess how much trickier that ego is.

701
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,380
In fact, your ego makes your mind think that it's winning just by sweet talking it.

702
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:42,640
And the next thing you know, you're nothing but ego, telling everybody else how to run their own minds and lose their egos.

703
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:49,480
As the great rapper, Poop Bobby Bob, said one time, the pink boy's got a bob complex.

704
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:54,180
And so you see these new age gurus and philosophers,

705
00:38:54,180 --> 00:39:01,760
and so forth, trying to give you ever more complicated rule books about how to run your life.

706
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,800
Well, friends, I'm sorry, but they just didn't give us an instruction book for this.

707
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,620
So we have to ask ourselves, is it all bluff?

708
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,100
Are there no solid answers?

709
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,920
Or are we all just bluffing ourselves, kidding ourselves?

710
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:23,100
Is the wise guru bluffing himself just so that he can inspire others?

711
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,620
The Gurdjieff said that that's the first pitfall.

712
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,360
But was he just saying that because it sounded wise?

713
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:40,340
So it's easy to learn the semblance of enlightenment, you know, the trappings of cool knowledge, and so forth.

714
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:50,960
And it's easy to... all you really need is impenetrably flighty jargon punctuated by pregnant pauses and flattery,

715
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,440
and lying by omissions and suggestions,

716
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,860
providing rule books as if there really was fairness in the world

717
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,540
for lazy thinkers who want to believe that they're actually thinkers.

718
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:10,220
And that brings me to the problem of subgenius coots.

719
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,600
Yes, I know it's hard to believe, but there actually occasionally are coots...

720
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,600
Crazy people in the Church of the Subgenius.

721
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,660
GREETINGS TO THE SNOW

722
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,960
sometimes, sometimes

723
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,700
is so obviously

724
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,180
telling kooks what they

725
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,140
must want to believe that

726
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,080
only a kook would believe it.

727
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,080
And plenty did, my friends.

728
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,920
Plenty did. Unfortunately,

729
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,420
none of them were really rich.

730
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,880
And so there's all of these

731
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,680
gurus and therapists

732
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,220
and experts trying

733
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,260
to tell you how to be more enlightened.

734
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,020
Maybe they're really

735
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,160
impeding your slack because

736
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,860
you have to figure it out

737
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,140
for yourself. Unless you're a dumbass

738
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,860
in which case you have to pay me

739
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,920
or Bob. But

740
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,780
friends, you know, the only

741
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,520
sign of

742
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,020
getting old, really, is

743
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,480
that after a while

744
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,620
you're not sure you're right.

745
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,060
Being more sure that you're right

746
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,720
is a sign of being stupid,

747
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,760
not getting old. But the

748
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,960
subgenius, my friends, is luckier

749
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,900
and better than that. I'll tell you

750
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,760
my friend, Bob Dobbs

751
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,620
healed me! Bob

752
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,520
healed me! He put his

753
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,520
living fist up my

754
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,580
butt and he healed

755
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,620
my ass!

756
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,780
Healed my ass!

757
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,740
That's why I say, friend,

758
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,420
sometimes you find that it's the path

759
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,440
less traveled for a reason.

760
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,640
Believe me, I know, because I'm

761
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,720
an expert on, uh,

762
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,260
whatchamacallit.

763
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,880
So, uh,

764
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,740
you know, the media

765
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,640
is constantly trying to

766
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,600
trick us. You know, it's

767
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,460
so hard to tell what's hidden

768
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,360
behind the headlines in the news

769
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,620
and what those guys are saying, those news

770
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,860
men are saying on TV.

771
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,260
War, the phrase

772
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,220
war in the Middle East

773
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,620
really means

774
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,320
two-for-one sale at Walmart.

775
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:07,980
And,

776
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,360
friends, there's a war on

777
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,760
drugs on Mars!

778
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,840
And you don't

779
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,080
know about it yet!

780
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,460
But as a

781
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,940
father, um, the father

782
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,760
of Jesus, Joseph, was

783
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,880
saying, we must protect our rights to

784
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,060
even fuck ourselves up.

785
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,120
Do-gooders

786
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,020
will be the death of us,

787
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,720
I'm afraid, uh,

788
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,460
trying to, uh,

789
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,580
telling us what's for

790
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,040
our own good.

791
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,900
It's funny how helpful

792
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,960
fascism can become.

793
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,140
Drugs don't

794
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,420
blow minds.

795
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,540
People blow minds!

796
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,340
Praise Bob!

797
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,540
And, uh, we, some of us

798
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,600
enjoy changing the channels inside

799
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,240
of our head every now and then.

800
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,320
We don't want to watch the

801
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,160
common hit show every night,

802
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,440
so to speak. Uh, Princess

803
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,440
Wee and I have managed to

804
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,180
whittle our brains down to one

805
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,040
brain cell, which we share.

806
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,620
I have one half and she has the other

807
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,260
half. It's, uh, we call it

808
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,440
his and her brains.

809
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,000
Uh, and, uh,

810
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,800
she's the one who can

811
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,540
understand

812
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,740
things, and I'm the one who remembers

813
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,900
them. But, uh,

814
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,140
as long as we're together, we're not exactly,

815
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,840
you know, we're still better off

816
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,460
than the subgenius kook.

817
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,820
The kook sees things

818
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,820
that aren't really there.

819
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,860
Not things that aren't there,

820
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,040
but we do that when we smoke too much

821
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,320
frog.

822
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,700
They don't see things that aren't there

823
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,520
so much as connections

824
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,400
that aren't there.

825
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,980
You know, speed freaks and religious

826
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,400
nuts both will see,

827
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,220
uh, connections between things that most of us

828
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,340
don't even notice because we're not

829
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,500
crazy. That's the reason we don't

830
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,080
notice. I hate to be up here

831
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,580
promoting sanity, but, uh,

832
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,240
uh, to tell the truth, I'm tired

833
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,060
of having to deprogram

834
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,740
our own zombies!

835
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:06,960
You know what I mean?

836
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,340
We sold these

837
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,600
kooks the insanity

838
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,420
and now we

839
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,280
must sell them the

840
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,540
cure. And with that,

841
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,800
I, uh, would direct you

842
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,980
to our sales table.

843
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,260
Now that we have made you completely

844
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,360
mad, there is a

845
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,580
the cure is back

846
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,020
there. The more

847
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,440
Bob shit you buy,

848
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,560
the sooner you will

849
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,440
get tired of him and be free

850
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,980
from his mind control.

851
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,380
You must free yourself

852
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,560
from Bob! Or come and free

853
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,480
the less Americans from the evil

854
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,360
dictator Bush!

855
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,300
We do a radio show.

856
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,740
Uh, it's syndicated to a few

857
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,440
stations in the U.S., about

858
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,400
15 college stations.

859
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,480
They're the only ones that are free

860
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,500
to say the foul

861
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,280
and awful things that we say.

862
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,360
Uh, we also find music

863
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,660
that people don't normally hear

864
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,660
or we dig, we, uh,

865
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,860
excavate fossilized music

866
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,720
that people haven't heard in a long,

867
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,340
long time. Great

868
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,060
bulldog, we call it.

869
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,940
The sort of thing that the pink,

870
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,160
the normal thinks,

871
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,540
crazy or trashy,

872
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,280
low class, ah,

873
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,620
that is where we sometimes find

874
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,460
the truth, in the label

875
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,320
of a wine bottle or the

876
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,300
ads in the back of a comic book.

877
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,080
And that cheesy

878
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,400
trash has, is still

879
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,060
on that table, unsold!

880
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,180
And it's cheap!

881
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,440
And yet, friends,

882
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,360
what worth

883
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,520
insanity, or a cure for the insanity

884
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,300
which we just infected you with,

885
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,080
earlier tonight, when

886
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,060
Joseph, the father of Jesus,

887
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,660
was pretending to have technical trouble

888
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,380
and had turned on that

889
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,440
random noise sound,

890
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,880
at that moment,

891
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,040
you were being programmed

892
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,560
with an insane, fanatical attachment

893
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,380
to Bob. You may not think that's

894
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,580
your boy, but

895
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,260
the only cure for it

896
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,280
is to go back there and

897
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,460
free yourself from that which

898
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,340
has enslaved you. You're a

899
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,320
slave to money! So,

900
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,520
you must free yourself from the money!

901
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,260
The chains of money!

902
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,800
Just as I smashed

903
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,180
Bob Black's watch, or

904
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,680
an Ultraloy Black's watch,

905
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,140
then, just so,

906
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,540
you can free yourself by smashing

907
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,740
that money that holds

908
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,720
you as a slave. Smash it!

909
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,140
By giving it to Bob!

910
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,380
You see, Bob doesn't

911
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,800
want you so much to

912
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,840
buy from him,

913
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,940
he wants you to

914
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,540
spend on him.

915
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,520
See what I mean when I say,

916
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,720
you know, it's not queer if it's Bob.

917
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,080
Spend on Bob!

918
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,020
Until you have

919
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,540
nothing left to spend,

920
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,700
until you're all dry.

921
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,300
And we mean spend in

922
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,060
every sense of the word.

923
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,780
So, dribble on Bob,

924
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,380
or spray on Bob.

925
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,920
If you have only a tiny little bit of money,

926
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,560
then the best you can do is

927
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,960
pop out a little

928
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,900
half-hearted load. That's fine!

929
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,600
You know, Dr. Philo Drummond,

930
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,320
of the Co-Sub Foundation,

931
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,320
founder of the church,

932
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,960
and other main tool of Bob,

933
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,580
originally, besides myself,

934
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,740
he said,

935
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,120
who does Bob love the most?

936
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,540
The rich man who

937
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,880
gives Bob $10,000,

938
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,880
even though he could

939
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,760
give him a million,

940
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,820
or the little old lady

941
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,500
who has only

942
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,700
one dollar left to her name,

943
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,360
and yet she gets it to Bob.

944
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,400
Who does Bob love?

945
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,500
The rich man!

946
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,160
Even though he gave a tiny fraction,

947
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,100
even though he's a hypocrite,

948
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,040
a liar, and a cheater,

949
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,600
he gave Bob more!

950
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,520
He spent on Bob!

951
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,080
Fuck the old lady!

952
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,720
Fuck goddamn Mother Teresa,

953
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,000
and all those saints!

954
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,920
Did they do anything for Bob? No!

955
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,300
Mother Teresa will burn in hell!

956
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,380
And late Princess Diana

957
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,860
will burn in hell!

958
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,920
Because they might have tried to do good things

959
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,020
by their silly human notions,

960
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,340
but they did not believe in Bob,

961
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,360
and they adapt you to Bob,

962
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,220
that which is Bob's due!

963
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,220
Render unto Bob

964
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,660
that which is Bob's!

965
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,780
And if it includes punishment,

966
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,240
remember,

967
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,660
I'm just his clerk.

968
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,420
I'm just a PR hack,

969
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,400
I just work here.

970
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,640
So, um...

971
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,420
Leave it to Dave.

972
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,540
And in fact, I'm...

973
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,620
It's time for me to go.

974
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,800
See, I still have a watch.

975
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,560
That's what I preach,

976
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,920
because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

977
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,340
That's what Bob said.

978
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,060
And it's an excuse.

979
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,820
That's part of the great, all-encompassing excuse

980
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,780
that allows us...

981
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,980
Well, look, let me put it this way.

982
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,820
I'm a holy man.

983
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,420
I'm a reverend in the Church of Subgenius.

984
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,460
That means I have magic powers.

985
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,720
So, by the power

986
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,440
invested in me by J.R. Bob Gobs,

987
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,260
you may now

988
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,480
do anything

989
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,640
you want, forever!

990
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:16,800
Woo!

991
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,900
O...

992
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:50,020
Lloyd.

993
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,420
Lloyd...

994
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,600
is...

995
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,820
terrified...

996
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:01,820


997
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,340
you...

998
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:06,340


999
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:06,340


1000
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,220
about

1001
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:07,220


1002
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,160
prophet.

1003
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:15,980
So what do you want from me now?

1004
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,040
The compute chanting there was by Artemia Salina.

1005
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,860
And now let's hear a subgenius devival in progress.

1006
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,920
In this case, led by Pope Black at the Foundry in London.

1007
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:37,380
Ladies and gentlemen, for the last, most sacred ritual

1008
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,780
in our beloved Church of the Subgenius.

1009
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,160
Not many...

1010
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:44,700
Shut up!

1011
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:44,900
Shut up!

1012
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,040
Shut up!

1013
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:47,420
Shut up!

1014
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:48,900
Shut up!

1015
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,240
I've got something to say.

1016
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,380
This is the last ritual of the Church of the Subgenius for this evening.

1017
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,160
It's the most sacred one.

1018
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:03,080
And brothers and sisters, it is why I carry this golf club.

1019
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,820
Yes, yes my friends, we are going to do what?

1020
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,920
What are we going to do?

1021
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,840
What are we going to do?

1022
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,180
Launch the Head!

1023
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,500
Launch the Head , Lensive Head

1024
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,540
Yes my friends!

1025
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,880
Yes my friends!

1026
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:37,980
We are going to launch, not just a head, but my friends, the minute this non-arm hits

1027
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,860
this little plush devil toy.

1028
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,680
It doesn't turn into just a plush devil toy.

1029
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:44,680


1030
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:53,120
It turns into the bleeding head of the future of World Cup golfing and this is what keeps

1031
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,700
the world imploding around you.

1032
00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:02,620
And it's a very, very sacred ritual in the Church of the Subjugates.

1033
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,060
Could I have complete quiet please?

1034
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,320
Silence!

1035
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,500
May I have silence?

1036
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,380
Silence!

1037
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:09,580
May I have silence?

1038
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,500
Shut up!

1039
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,500
Shut up!

1040
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,280
Are you ready?

1041
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,240
Are you ready?

1042
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,020
Are you ready?

1043
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,200
Are you ready?

1044
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,840
Now before I get started there's one thing I forgot.

1045
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,460
Shut up!

1046
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:31,020
There's one thing I forgot and those who are talking won't hear this because, and this

1047
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:34,100
is the most important thing I've said all evening.

1048
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:42,640
The person who catches the head of the future, bleeding head of the future of World Cup golfing

1049
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,100
gets seven.

1050
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:44,260
Seven.

1051
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,320
Seven years good sex!

1052
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,100
Do it here, praise Bob!

1053
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,480
Praise Bob!

1054
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,840
Do it here, praise Bob!

1055
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,060
Praise Bob!

1056
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,180
May I have a drum roll please?

1057
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,800
Drum roll!

1058
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,540
I need a drum roll everybody!

1059
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,300
I need a drum roll!

1060
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,340
Come on!

1061
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,160
Everybody!

1062
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,580
Drum roll!

1063
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:06,860
One.

1064
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:08,560
Two.

1065
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,060
Three.

1066
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:11,840
Four!

1067
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,080
One.

1068
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:14,140
Two.

1069
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:14,140


1070
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:14,140


1071
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:14,260
One.

1072
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:14,260


1073
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:14,260


1074
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:14,260


1075
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:14,260


1076
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:14,260


1077
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:14,260


1078
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:14,260


1079
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:14,260


1080
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,380
We have a winner!

1081
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,440
Ladies and gentlemen, seven years, good sex,

1082
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,980
do I hear a praise, Bob?

1083
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,260
What's your name?

1084
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,400
Joe Anita!

1085
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,740
Joe Anita, praise Joe Anita!

1086
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,260
Seven years, good sex, praise Bob!

1087
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,900
Thank you for coming!

1088
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:35,900
Hallelujah!

1089
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:36,800
Goodnight!

1090
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,840
And now it's time for me to get back to my roots.

1091
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,760
I was feeling sick, losing my mind,

1092
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,040
heard about this stupid from a good friend of mine,

1093
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,100
he was always happy, smiling face,

1094
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,760
he said he had a great time at the play, yeah!

1095
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,400
That piece of love is here to stay,

1096
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,780
and now I can wake up and face the day,

1097
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,620
happy, happy, happy, overdive,

1098
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,360
Jackson, bitch, I'm going blind!

1099
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,380
Gimme, gimme, Jackson, give it!

1100
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,720
Gimme, gimme, Jackson, give it!

1101
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,060
Gimme, gimme, Jackson, give it!

00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,400
I wanna, wanna, Jackson, give it!

1103
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,100
I was feeling sick, losing my mind,

1104
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,320
heard about this stupid from a good friend of mine,

1105
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,520
he was always happy, smiling face,

1106
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,000
he said he had a great time at the play, yeah!

1107
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,240
That piece of love is here to stay,

1108
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,120
pinning, man, that was envie,

1109
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,160
that paper, paper, paper...

1110
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:49,980
Ya, that was what it said,

1111
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:49,980


1112
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,260
No!

00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,320

1117
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:02,400

00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:10,820
Gimme, gimme, Jackson, give it!

00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,660
Gimme, gimme, Jackson, give it!

1120
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,860
on whether chances for recovery are poor.

1121
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,440
For TR News, I'm in densely forested areas

1122
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,380
to prevent rebel guerrillas from seeking New Delhi.

1123
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,880
Doctors say he has fallen two points to 10,001.

1124
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,360
Make that 35.

1125
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,860
This is TR News.

1126
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,880
The U.S. Supreme Court can sniff your drugs.

1127
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,900
Yasser Arafat caught fire on takeoff,

1128
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,460
then dumped at about 12.15 this morning.

1129
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,680
I'm stepping down after studies showed

1130
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,960
that it increased the risk of TR News in Washington.

1131
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:45,440
Beaver, Beaver, Beaver, Beaver, Beaver, Caraboo,

1132
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,820
Caraboo, Beaver, Beaver, Beaver, Cara-Boo,

1135
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,060
Caraboo, Caraboo, Cara-Boo,

00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,300
Herbie may out.

Drink blog.

1142
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:19,420
The Caribou and the Beaver by Imbejur.

1143
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:22,400
That's how you pronounce I-M-B-J-R, by the way.

1144
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,360
Before that, some Lemurian PR news.

1145
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:31,020
And before that, Little Theodore did shock treatment.

1146
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,060
I believe that was recorded live at 7X Day.

1147
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,580
8X Day is coming up this July.

1148
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,060
And now, something weird from Artemia Salida.

1149
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:51,240
I-M-B-J-R.

1150
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:14,660
hi

1151
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:15,700


1152
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:15,700


1153
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:15,700


1154
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,380

00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:16,400

Thank you.

1163
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,860
And that zip code is 44118.

1164
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,300
And now some words from Popes Lillith.

1165
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,380
Job is an alien.

1166
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,380
Job is an alien.

1167
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,520
Job is an alien.

1168
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,420
As so such is this planet.

1169
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,600
Job is an alien.

1170
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,620
Job is an alien.

1171
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,640
Job is an alien.

1172
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,140
As so such is this planet.

1173
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,760
Job is an alien.

1174
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,880
Job is an alien.

1175
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,820
Job is an alien.

1176
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,060
As so such is this planet.

1177
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,000
We shall have paradise.

1178
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,380
Subgenie of the world unites.

1179
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:13,020
Alien sex every night.

1180
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,000
Subgenie of the world.

Subgenie of the world unites.

1183
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:34,260
Stand hand in hand.

1184
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,140
When the trumpet calls.

1185
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,040
I'll make stand.

1186
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:40,060
Global access to fan.

1187
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,000
While we blow the world away.

1188
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:46,540
We shall have paradise.

1189
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,300
Subgenie of the world unites.

1190
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,900

Subgenie of the world.

1192
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,020
Subgenie of the world.
