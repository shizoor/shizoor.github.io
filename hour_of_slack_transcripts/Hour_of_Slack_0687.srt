1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360
Hello?

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:02,580
Hello?

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,440
Hello?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,380
Is anybody out there?

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,860
It's all different now.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,940
It's all different, man.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,940
The room is different.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,540
The sound is different.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,680
The headphones are the same.

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,380
The mixboard is different.

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,220
The mixboard is different.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,780
I don't like different things.

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,800
They make me feel different.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,940
What is this?

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,700
This show is scary.

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,900
I don't like this show.

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,600
What is this show?

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,600
What is this?

19
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,700
What are you?

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,800
What are you?

21
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,740
Well,

22
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:03,260
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,200
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

24
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:19,980
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station...

25
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,000
This station.

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,700
And only in the city of...

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,240
H-H-H-Hemby.

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,620
Oh, yes, dear friends.

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,140
It is a new mixboard.

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,820
And we will somehow try a new...

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,360
A new type arrangement.

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,140
Everything is new and different.

33
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,160
I don't know if I can handle this, folks, but I'm...

34
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,360
What?

35
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,160
Who's that guy?

36
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,700
Oh.

37
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,160
Oh.

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,760
What?

39
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,620
Hello?

40
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,660
Hello?

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,300
Oh, God, I'm getting scared again.

42
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,720
I don't want to crawl.

43
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,040
Out of here.

44
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,360
You.

45
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,120
You.

46
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,120


47
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,360
You.

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


54
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


56
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


57
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,200
I'm sick.

58
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,140
I need sleep.

59
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh.

60
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,300
Look, I can crawl.

61
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,780
Nurse, nurse.

62
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,680
I can crawl again.

63
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,580
How about that?

64
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,620
Don't be worried.

65
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,600
I can't believe I didn't know I could do that.

66
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:06,900
Okay.

67
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,320
Oh, I won't tell the doctor.

68
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,300
I'm crawling.

69
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,960
Oh, my God.

70
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,960
What happened down there?

71
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,500
Now what?

72
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,940
Tell me what to do next.

73
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,600
I'm leaking.

74
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,000
Hurry.

75
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,320
No, it's a no-sumner.

76
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,080
We can ask the computer.

77
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,500
It's hard to crawl with no legs.

78
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,260
Tell me real quick.

79
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,420
I don't want to get sick while he's in the Evacajams.

80
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,100
Here.

81
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,000
Inhale this right now.

82
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,820
Reven Sang.

83
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,700
Oh, yes, ma'am.

84
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,040
Pray, Fifi.

85
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,820
Whatever you say.

86
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,060
I can't do it.

87
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,000
Now hold it in.

88
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,840
Near the end of October.

89
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,220
I'm just going to relax a little bit, old-timer.

90
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,940
Now let it out.

91
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,200
Let it out.

92
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,240
I'm hearing memories.

93
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,960
I'm hearing memories.

94
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,080
I'm from downtown New York.

95
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,100
I'm hearing memories.

96
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,520
I remember in New York.

97
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,040
Yeah.

98
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,200
You was there on Broadway and Times Square.

99
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,380
You danced the jig up against the legs.

100
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:43,740
I had legs.

101
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,420
Well, you'll be entertained by the music of Raymond McKenna and his orchestra.

102
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,300
Ah.

103
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,100
Raymond McKenna.

104
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,520
It was when the war started.

105
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,120
I remember.

106
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,400
I had legs.

107
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,060
Exactly.

108
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,860
Big teats.

109
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,040
Yes.

110
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,640
And bootleg hooch.

111
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,220
And we were partying.

112
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


113
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


114
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,480
We were listening to the radio.

115
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,020
And that was the day the war began.

116
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,080
...of the country to keep an astronomical watch on any further disturbances occurring

117
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,960
on the planet Mars.

118
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,720
It was more of a war between humans and non-humans.

119
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,240
It was a war between galaxies, between entire races.

120
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,740
Fast, cool, and unsympathetic.

121
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,800
I could tell the conspiracy was always watching me.

122
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,580
But they were sending those creatures from another world.

123
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:20,800
They had friends.

124
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,340
They had allies deep in here.

125
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,420
Not just to get me.

126
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,080
The old ones were going to be gone.

127
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,720
No sir man.

128
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,320
But to get all my fellow humans.

129
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,320


130
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,320


131
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,320


132
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,320


133
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,320


134
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,320


135
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,320


136
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,520
The Earth.

137
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,280
And the Earth.

138
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,300
Even the sub-geniuses had to join together with...

139
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,020
Some giants and...

140
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,580
...their rivals and humans...

141
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:34,760
...a tool...

142
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,180
...in order to fight the Martians.

143
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:36,880
A tool.

144
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,400
Due to the unusual nature of this occurrence, we have arranged an interview with a noted

145
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,780
astronomer, Professor Pearson.

146
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:50,060
The following statements which I shall make are true facts that can and will be verified

147
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,280
at the proper time.

148
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,060
The music has come to me from outer space.

149
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,800
Out of space.

150
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,020
I have been instructed by a person from another planet

151
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:08,180
to bring this music to the attention of the people on this Earth.

152
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,600
I have had direct contact with people from other planets

153
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,460
and have spoken with them on many occasions.

154
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,280
I have ridden in their spaceships.

155
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,640
They have taken me to their planets

156
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,260
and brought me back to Earth again several times.

157
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:34,740
I have seen how they live, what they wear, what they eat, and how they look.

158
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,500
They are friendly people.

159
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,280
It seems to me, if we look at the South Jersey shore,

160
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,840
we notice that a large contingency of these flying crafts

161
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,780
have actually come down on a man, a single individual,

162
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,900
named Reverend Ivan Stang.

163
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,600
Some of them are actually very indicative of his brain,

164
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,700
and we have radio contact and phone lines open there,

165
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,760
but the National Guard says that it's not long before Stang is lost.

166
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,720
I refuse to wipe off my forehead under any circumstances.

167
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,580
I don't care whether the Senate subcommittee,

168
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,360
the presidential investigators, Janet Reno, and all the rest of them.

169
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,840
My forehead stays besmirched.

170
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,560
It's my religious right as a subgenius.

171
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:28,340
Yes, it's almost perfectly bluent,

172
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,340


173
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,160
and no matter where that plane is coming from,

174
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,660
I won't think about the rest of America.

175
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,300
A white produzon wanted to investigate that Indian island

176
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:31,300


177
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,120
and is at the core of the Earth

178
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,120


179
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,280
Stacy, tell him you're the butcher,

180
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,500
and of course I will acknowledge the interior.

181
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,440
Oh, here we are,

182
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,320
Mr. Stang.

183
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,900
Mr. Stang,

184
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,120
here I am.

185
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,680
Welcome!

186
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,060
*** stressed out ó

187
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,440
It's giving me a new understanding of power.

188
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,040
I understand by our friends from the next brother planet.

189
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,440
Two of them.

190
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,100
Yes.

191
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,220
Our two friends.

192
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,780
Our brothers planet will come.

193
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,220
Please come.

194
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,940
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I haven't mentioned it all.

195
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,920
It's exciting, but it's becoming more distinct.

196
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,180
Perhaps you've caught it already on your radar.

197
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,620
Where is it?

198
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,720
So much better now.

199
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,440
You haven't much of a chance.

200
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,160
Look at that.

201
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,260
It's not a Martian.

202
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,560
It's you.

203
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,220
It's an American.

204
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,180
It's an American.

205
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,840
It's Bob Dobbs.

206
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,460
It's not a Martian.

207
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,680
Martians are our fathers.

208
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,300
The Martians created us.

209
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,680
We shall go back to their bosom.

210
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,520
We're their children.

211
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,540
Father Mars shall take us in.

212
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,600
I can't believe he's back in here.

213
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,300
The Martians shall take us home.

214
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,980
I realize.

215
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,900
Home, friend.

216
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,500
Soon.

217
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,860
I'm going home.

218
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,760
We're all going home.

219
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,440
I'm going home.

220
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,920
I'm going home.

221
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,820
I'm going home because I sent that $30 to Bob.

222
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,240
I'm going home.

223
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,480
You can go home with me, my friend.

224
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,360
I'm going home.

225
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:19,580
I'm going to Brushwood to meet my father, Bob.

226
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,740
And I will always be grateful to him.

227
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,660
I'll tell you what.

228
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,100
Bob Dobbs came to town to set you free.

229
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,040
I'm going to Dallas to set you free, my friend.

230
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,140
Surely, I come quickly.

231
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,200
Amen.

232
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:42,160
And yes, it is a completely different and new setup for me here in the studio.

233
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,920
And friends, you know, I've got X day.

234
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,560
Oh, my God.

235
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:49,560


236
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:49,560


237
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:49,560


238
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,120
It's just like every X day, friends.

239
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,420
There's only about two, three more weeks left in the world from the time I speak now.

240
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:06,420
And yet I go along through my day acting just as if I had all the time in the world, as

241
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:12,820
if all those bills had to be paid, as if I had to keep making money, as if I had to keep

242
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,480
acting civil to people or in any way even human.

243
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,320
But friends, by the time you hear this, I know most of these stations play these shows

244
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,780
like weeks after I send them.

245
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:32,560
And by the time you hear this, I'm sure you'll, if you're lucky enough to have a radio or

246
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:39,500
anything that even works after XX day, you'll probably be looking out your window at rioting

247
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,980
homeless or formerly rich people now homeless, friends, because X day is coming.

248
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,600
And X day, it really is coming.

249
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,980
It's so hard to believe.

250
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,140
It's too good to believe that maybe that was the problem last time.

251
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,440
Friends, maybe it was just too good for us lowly subgeniuses to even believe that it

252
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,900
could happen.

253
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:09,880
That $30 mere dollars in Bob Dobbs pocket would be enough to allow, to buy us a spaceship

254
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,980
the size of a planet.

255
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,520
Each, each one of us, this, oh, and friends.

256
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:16,960
And to believe.

257
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,100
And to buy us revenge.

258
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,340
For those who were into that.

259
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:28,380
Personally, I'll probably kill a few of you and then, friends, I'm gonna, I'm taking off.

260
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,200
I'm getting out of here.

261
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,900
I am truly, truly going to take advantage of my escape vessel and get off.

262
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,800
On X day.

263
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,900
Mark my words.

264
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,840
I will stand by that.

265
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,960
And I hope that I see you at 7 o'clock in the morning Monday morning.

266
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,600
July 5th, 1999.

267
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,420
I truly hope that I see you in that crowd in front of me at Brushwood.

268
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,600
And if not there, hell, I don't care.

269
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,540
I'll see you on your saucer.

270
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,900
Once you get your saucer, invite me over, won't you?

271
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,820
Just go, hey, Reverend Stang, wherever you're sitting on your escape planet.

272
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,080
And the mom will email me real quick telepathically and I'll hear you.

273
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,940
Well, she'll probably wait until it's over.

274
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,100
It's a convenient moment.

275
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,740
Until after I've got off.

276
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:26,340
And then she'll say, she'll forward your voice on into my head and I'll hear you say,

277
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,900
Hey, Reverend Stang, why don't you come on over to my joint?

278
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
We'll have a party.

279
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,740
I've got the Grand Canyon over here.

280
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,600
A real good replica.

281
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,820
Actually, I call it the Martian Grand Canyon.

282
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,340
I made all the trees.

283
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,080
It's kind of surrealistical like a Salvador Dali painting.

284
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,000
It's cool.

285
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,040
And I got the best frock in the universe.

286
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,440
Heh.

287
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,460
That's what mom told me anyway.

288
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,720
Why don't you come on over?

289
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,380
We'll have us a party, man.

290
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:59,340
And, um, and friends, and if I don't want to, if I happen to be enjoying building my own Grand Canyon,

291
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,840
I can always send a clone or robot and my buddy will never even know the difference.

292
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Friends, and all of this, all of this for 30 measly bucks.

293
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,500
Ugh.

294
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,220
We'll have a party.

295
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,720
I'm sorry.

296
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,020
Okay.

297
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,100
Bye.

298
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,000
See you around.

299
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,820
Bye.

300
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:29,420


301
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:29,420


302
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:29,420


303
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:29,420


304
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:29,420


305
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,460
Oh, I'm going to have to get off the train and get to the gate.

306
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:30,460


307
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:30,460


308
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,780
Uh, it's getting late, I guess.

309
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,080
Yeah.

310
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,760
All right.

311
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:32,760


312
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:32,760


313
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:32,760


314
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:32,760


315
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:32,760


316
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,240
Bye.

317
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:33,580


318
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,100
Bye.

319
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,260
Bye.

320
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,620
Bye.

321
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,680
Bye.

322
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:38,980
Bye.

323
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:38,980


324
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,920
Thank you.

325
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,560
Thank you.

326
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,080
Thank you.

327
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,460
Thank you.

328
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,940
Thank you.

329
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,260
Thank you.

330
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,780
Thank you.

331
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,820
Thank you.

332
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,340
Thank you.

333
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,120
Thank you.

334
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,280
Thank you.

335
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,360
Thank you.

336
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,160
Thank you.

337
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,580
Thank you.

338
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,200
Thank you.

339
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,240
Thank you.

340
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,880
I hope I didn't say 1998.

341
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,140
You know, I've had for 20 years, I said July 5th, 1998.

342
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,340
For some reason, I had to switch over.

343
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:34,180
But you know, these are our friends from outer space that will be coming.

344
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:40,400
You know, it's not like we're just kidding ourselves because it sounds so good.

345
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,020
It's nothing like that.

346
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,600
In fact, friends, it's when you don't give yourself enough credit that you really screw

347
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:46,680
up.

348
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,840
You know, I'm getting back to the music that has come to me from another planet.

349
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:56,020
These two selections are interpretations taken from the actual music that has come to me

350
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,820
from another planet.

351
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,940
Oh, friends, they're just laughing at me.

352
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:29,920
And this is from one of our new acquisitions, but an old friend.

353
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,380
It's a band called the...

354
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,180
Actually, it's not good to talk over.

355
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,460
The Brand Flakes.

356
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,820
That's the Brand Flakes.

357
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,100
Dear friends, we'll talk over Ron Slade instead.

358
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,960
Ah, yes.

359
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,040
The CD, the new CD by the Brand Flakes.

360
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,260
This is a subgenius-related band.

361
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,940
In fact, Reverend...

362
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:54,920
Oh, yeah.

363
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,720
Otis F. Otter did the sound at the Seattle show, which we'll be hearing for the rest

364
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,460
of this hour of slack.

365
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,100
Because I was going, oh, dear, I've got to throw a show together real quick because I'm

366
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,020
going to leave town again for the Portland revival.

367
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,740
And of course, by the time you hear this, I'll be leaving town anyway for X Day, and

368
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,640
I'll probably just do reruns all the way up to X Day anyway.

369
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:23,800
But friends, yeah, there was a wonderful revival in Seattle, which we will be hearing.

370
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:33,580
The Pope David N. Meyer came out of his semi-retirement and did a kick brain rant.

371
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:39,080
And Papa Joe Mama did one of his most thoughtful...

372
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:46,820
He was trying to make up for what he did to Friday on Saturday.

373
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,340
So, what the hell is this?

374
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,160
Not Ron?

375
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,780
What is old Ron doing?

376
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:53,780


377
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:53,780


378
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:53,780


379
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:53,780


380
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,360
What's he thinking here?

381
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,960
I wonder what happens if I turn this tape over.

382
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,560
Whoa.

383
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:08,560
Yeah, that sounds more like it, friends, because the Seattle revival was sponsored by Popes

384
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,840
Lilith and Popes Lilith von Frau Mensch.

385
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:21,320
And I've got this rather wonderful document that Popes Lilith thought that might be appropriate

386
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,760
for us all to consider as X Day approaches.

387
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:23,760


388
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:31,880
You may have heard a variation on this thing that I'm about to read to you, friends, but...

389
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,200
Now, I'm about to give you reasons why the planet should be destroyed.

390
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:50,680
If we could shrink the Earth's population to a village of precisely 100 people, with

391
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,760
all the existing statistics remaining the same...

392
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:53,760


393
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:53,760


394
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,500
It would look like this.

395
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,060
Now, friends, this is, once again, if we rounded the...

396
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:05,820
If we shrank the Earth's population to only 100 people, this is the way it would line

397
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:12,960
up with, you know, the corresponding statistics to the way things are today with almost 6

398
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,780
billion people.

399
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,280
Or is it almost 7?

400
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:16,980
I can't remember.

401
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,760
Anyway...

402
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,960
If there were only 100 people in the world...

403
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,600
One would be...

404
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,440
An evil, rich, white man.

405
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,380
Only one.

406
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,000
And, friends, that's the one I want to be.

407
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,240
I've got the evil and the white part down, but mostly white, anyway.

408
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:42,080
Twelve of that 100 in the village of the world would be plain ordinary Glorbs.

409
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,180
Eighty-three of the 100 would be dumbasses.

410
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,880
As simple as that.

411
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,820
Eighty-three out of 100 people would be dumbasses.

412
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,880
Only 12 would even amount to Glorpism.

413
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,520
Three would be Bobbies.

414
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,520
One would be a latent or rogue subgenius.

415
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,900
And out of that 100...

416
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:13,480
That village of 100 people, there would be one dues-paying, paid-up, ordained subgenius

417
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,560
toenail.

418
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,160
In a village of 100 people...

419
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,800
Representing the world...

420
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,760
Representing the planet Earth...

421
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,120
Ninety-seven would be pee-shy.

422
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,160
Two would be able to pee freely, and one will never pee at all.

423
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,860
Twelve would be really heterosexual.

424
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,780
Twenty-two would probably be bisexual.

425
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,140
Fifty-four would be bi-curious.

426
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,100
And eleven would be homosexual, and one would be transsexual.

427
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,560
And that's Popes Lili, who says on the note here,

428
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,180
Hi, Mom.

429
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:57,540
Out of 100 people, 70 would be nibble-lung, and only 30 would be full-sung.

430
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,040
I happen to be nibble-lung myself, obviously.

431
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,100
Ninety would have a religion.

432
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,840
And nine would pretend that they don't have a religion.

433
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,780
And one would start a religion.

434
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,340
Praise Bob.

435
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,160
Fifty-nine percent of the entire world's wealth...

436
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:25,220
Would be in the hands of only six people, and none of them have a subgenius membership

437
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,860
card.

438
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,220
Eighty people out of 100 would rather stay on Earth on XX Day.

439
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,860
Nineteen would like to visit space, but only one must get off.

440
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,520
Seventy would be unable to read.

441
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:47,420
Fifty of the hundred in the world, half of the world, the village of the world, would

442
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,520
suffer from malnutrition.

443
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,160
And one would be a man.

444
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Only one would have a college education.

445
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,880
Only one would own a computer.

446
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,400
I guess that would be the evil, rich, white man.

447
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,360
That'd be me, man.

448
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,040
I'm gonna be him.

449
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,100
All I've got to do is get rich.

450
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:08,980
Two would own guns out of 100 privately, but ten would possess a gun for their job.

451
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,680
Oh, great.

452
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,940
Seventy-four believe that, quote, good thoughts, unquote, are better than bad thoughts.

453
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,140
And 99 out of the 100 would think the same.

454
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,140


455
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:26,780
I'm sure that this list is boring and stupid, but everyone, all of the 100 except for that

456
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:33,520
toenail that paid its $30, will die on July 5th, 1999.

457
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,160
Praise Bob.

458
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,860
And uh...

459
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,920
And friends, we are going to go to that DeVival.

460
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,680
We're gonna go straight into that DeVival, but first, we're gonna listen to some of this

461
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,120
Bran Flakes music, friends.

462
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,120


463
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,120


464
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,120


465
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,760
So, thank you, Ron Slabe. And now, this.

466
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,740
Now, you can play along with us.

467
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:05,120
All you need is a stick, a pot or a pan, spoons, a bell, a triangle, cymbals,

468
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,480
anything you can get to make some noise with.

469
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,000
2148. Here's 2148.

470
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,340
One.

471
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,180
No more hooves.

472
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,820
Damn.

473
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:20,980
Oh, yeah.

474
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:30,360
I know there's someone waiting somewhere.

475
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,340
I know there's someone waiting somewhere.

476
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,400
I know there's someone waiting somewhere.

477
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,600
Oh, yeah.

478
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,700
Yeah!

479
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,120
You heard it.

480
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,120


481
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,120


482
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,120


483
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,420
them guys don't play music there Christ all they do is wave their arms around and beat like

484
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:33,920
they're crazy and holler and scream around there then these kids go crazy about that

485
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,640
stuff there I said Jesus Christ what do they see in that there

486
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,120
Make me happy

00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,160

Seattle Washington

495
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,620
980

496
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,060
8111

497
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,580
but not all

498
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:40,800
what

499
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:42,940
980

500
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,360
111

501
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,080
980

502
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,440
111

503
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,580
USA

504
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,360
are you ready

505
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,520
well some of you are but not all

506
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,580
now if the rest of you are having trouble finding something

507
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,140
here are some suggestions

508
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,180
try an old tin can

509
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,880
or a cardboard box

510
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,320
or maybe a kazoo

511
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,600
now if you're not sure

512
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,100
if you don't have a real kazoo

513
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,540
you can make one with a cone and a piece of tissue paper over it

514
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,960
try it and see

515
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,240
in the meantime

516
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,500
the X-ists are coming

517
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,780
are you

518
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,560
spread wide for the final ride

519
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,600
as XX day comes looming over your horizon

520
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,340
and down your everything

521
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,080
you

522
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,580
you

523
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,020
you

524
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,300
you

525
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:35,580
you

526
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,600
you

527
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


528
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


529
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


530
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


531
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


532
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


533
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


534
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


535
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


536
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


537
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


538
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


539
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


540
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


541
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


542
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


543
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


544
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


545
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


546
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,600


547
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,980
Gotta Check Out San난

548
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:46,980


549
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,060
and now sample some effects

550
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,500
I have no idea how to build those

551
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,280
M cinnamon

552
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,060
today

553
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,340
we can record music as it is

554
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,040
as as

555
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:11,080
you hear it crisp and clear with every note as bright as the stars in the eyes of the girl you're

556
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,740
dancing with

557
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,540
i am the popus

558
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:25,000
and you are in for a revival tonight

559
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,460
but before we get started much further i think it's time for a ritual that we do at these

560
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:40,660
diviners so if you could just bow your heads for a moment i'd like you to join me for a moment of

561
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,700
sacred traditional

562
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,700
hey brother what's this you brought me to i don't know but i think it has something to do with

563
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:56,960
religion

564
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,840
jr bob dobbs once said to the young dr onan cannaboy who is here i believe tonight he said

565
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:25,120
he actually asked onan do you know onan what all of your enemies have in common

566
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:26,880
you

567
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,440
and uh and friends boy there are some enemies

568
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:40,380
i hate to actually i'm proud to say the church of the subgenius has actually made quite a bit of

569
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:46,760
money off the end of the world this last in 1998 for the first time the church of the subgenius

570
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:56,740
corporation had to pay a sizable tax to the united states government i actually had to write

571
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:02,580
a check for 700 dollars to the united states government

572
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,440
for the church of the subgenius corporation and i'm proud to say the church of the subgenius

573
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,160
corporation is the only one that can pay a cut of that much to the children of the subgenius corporation

574
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,200
the church of the subgenius corporation is the only one that can pay a cut of the subgenius corporation

575
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,780
that's 700 could have been paychecks for jesus christ and me

576
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,440
right

577
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,380
you laugh actually jesus christ has returned to earth and he is the business manager of the church of the subgenius

578
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:32,120
i say that to ensure this belief you're probably you know well yeah right sure but basically i had to give seven hundred dollars to uncle sam instead of jesus

579
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,420
jesus

580
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:33,420


581
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:33,420


582
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:33,420


583
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,080
What kind of, I mean, what is this world coming to?

584
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,680
It's not Felford.

585
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,120
We've been talking about war on God and war on Mars.

586
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:47,520
Let's get back to war on the conspiracy of Peaks and the government they created.

587
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,360
And they built the prison all by themselves, for themselves.

588
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,280
Aren't they clever?

589
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,360
Isn't that wonderful?

590
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,740
War on the normals, friends.

591
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,720
That's where it started.

592
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,440
Let's just say war on all the others.

593
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,000
All the others.

594
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,440
Because they're dumbasses.

595
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,120
Just leave it at that.

596
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,440
Would you like to hear more?

597
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,820
Oh, maybe.

598
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,700
Lord, I love my house.

599
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,220
I love my school and my teachers too.

600
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,780
I love all my friends.

601
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,720
But more than that, Lord, I love...

602
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,220
I love you.

603
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,800
I love you, Lord.

604
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,480
I love you.

605
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,920
You love me.

606
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,300
I know you do too.

607
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,860
I love you, Lord.

608
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,540
I love you.

609
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:57,580
Yes, it's true that I love you.

610
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,720
That was...

611
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,480
Beautiful.

612
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:00,620


613
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,400
I say get out of God's way.

614
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,220
Quit blocking God's bridges.

615
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,720
For God's gonna shoot you if I don't...

616
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,560
I refuse

617
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,560
to hurt you anymore.

618
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:29,860
I'm not gonna hurt you.

619
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,900
I'm gonna hurt you with any of you out there.

620
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,480
Don't even call me.

621
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,360
Get out of my life.

622
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,340
I don't want to even talk to you or hear you.

623
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,320
I don't want to see your ugly face.

624
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,420
Sumblings, I wish God would give me a holy book from a genie and I'd blow your head

625
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:49,560
off.

626
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,080
So friends, let those who doubt scoff and laugh, but the true believers will fasten

627
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,260
our oxygen masks the better to serve, Bob.

628
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,440
Oh, by the way, a little practical matter.

629
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,240
July 5th this year happens to land on a Monday.

630
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,460
Now, I'm sure there's quite a few people that are going,

631
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,540
yeah, I'm going to party.

632
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,180
I'm a good subgenius.

633
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,940
I'm going to party all night and weekend,

634
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,420
and I'll celebrate the coming cataclysmic judgment.

635
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,220
Well, up until Sunday night.

636
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,640
Now, I've got to get up in the morning and go to work.

637
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,320
On next day.

638
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,120
I've got to be ready to go in at 8 a.m. Monday morning at 8 o'clock

639
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:34,320
just in case, just in case the exes fail to arrive at 7 a.m. like last time.

640
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,100
Frank, you backslider!

641
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,860
You every time you say something like that,

642
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,500
you twist that knife and bob-dodge back another turn.

643
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,320
The subgenius cannot be ruptured

644
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,160
if it is working for the conspiracy day job on next day.

645
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,380
It's that simple.

646
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,420
And besides, are you going to, I mean, friends,

647
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,840
are you really going to let your stinking earth job,

648
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:03,220
get in the way of your total escape, your eternal salvation?

649
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,060
Why should you?

650
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,780
Do you really think there's going to be a job for you to go to

651
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,540
after 7 a.m. this July 5th?

652
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,920
So, friends, it's a religious holiday.

653
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,460
You're a subgenius.

654
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,100
Other people get off for Christmas and so forth.

655
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:26,080
You should insist on getting off work on July 5th.

656
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,100
And if you don't, you are pissed.

657
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,820
Take the ball.

658
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,760
You are dead to him.

659
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:38,240
I refuse to talk to you any longer with any of you out there.

660
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,800
Don't even call me.

661
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,700
Get out of my life.

662
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,700
I don't want to even talk to you or hear you.

663
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,660
I don't want to see your ugly face.

664
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,920
Sometimes I wish God would give me a holy book of my teeth

665
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,880
and I'd blow your head off.

666
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,900
I'd get you in one of my thoughts and next sack of teeth,

667
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:08,680
you'd brow where you learned in your old age.

668
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,040
I'd react for it,

669
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:10,220
and I'd look towards heaven for you

670
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,400
and I'd ask for your concerning piece of glass,

671
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:10,400


672
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:10,400


673
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:10,400


674
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,700
.

675
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:12,700


676
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:12,700


677
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:12,700


678
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:12,700


679
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:12,700


680
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:12,700


681
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:12,700


682
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:12,700


683
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:12,700


684
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,020
Jesus had a nice house, a big house.

685
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,360
He handled big money.

686
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,280
Jesus was handling big money.

687
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,700
He even wore designer clothes.

688
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,280
John 19 tells us that Jesus wore designer clothes.

689
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,720
Thank you children, thank you children, thank you children.

690
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,120
I'm here tonight to preach to you the word of God.

691
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,040
The word of the first industrial church, a church of love and money children.

692
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,200
The church of...

693
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,360
What? What?

694
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,760
Thank you children.

695
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,900
Come on boys.

696
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,120
Children that's the way...

697
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,840
Don't stop, let's go.

698
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,740
Children that's the way people expect the Pope of New York to preach.

699
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,100
That's the way people expect the Pope of New York to preach.

700
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,960
That's the way people expect me to come out and preach children.

701
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,040
Because I'm full of Bob tonight children as I always am.

702
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:37,060
But children you know in the past when I've come here to Seattle

703
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,520
and I've shown my enthusiasm for Bob which is genuine.

704
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,480
Well I've noticed an interesting phenomenon children and that is

705
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,960
that Seattle does not mirror my enthusiasm back to me.

706
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,680
Seattle shocks.

707
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,700
This has baffled me children.

708
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,980
This has puzzled me children.

709
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,120
This has become a conundrum for me children.

710
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,800
And I'm going to talk to you about that conundrum for a little while tonight.

711
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,840
Because children in the past...

712
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,520
Let's see I preached at some place up on Capitol Hill.

713
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,920
I preached down in Belltown children that's what it was.

714
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,860
I preached in Belltown at the height of Belltown children.

715
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,000
I looked down in that crowd.

716
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,540
That crowd of Belltown nonconformists.

717
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,820
The herd of independent minds as the phrase goes children.

718
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,320
And I preached to them children I preached to them with enthusiasm.

719
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,360
I preached to them with love.

720
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,460
I preached to them the word of Bob.

721
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,720
And children they stared blankly back at me.

722
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,320
They stared blankly at the Pope of all New York.

723
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,080
Idaho and the great Pacific Northwest.

724
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,300
And this baffled me children.

725
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:48,780
Because children when I come out to preach the word of Bob children.

726
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,660
It's because I have so much Bob in me.

727
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,220
That I have come to share it with you children.

728
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,980
Because in his heart and in his soul and in his mind children.

729
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:05,900
The Pope of all New York is a bell jar of Bob.

730
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,020
A bell jar of Bob.

731
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,340
I'm a bell jar of Bob children.

732
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,540
I'm lightning in a bottle when it comes to Bob.

733
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,480
I'm full of Bob.

734
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,480
I have so much Bob in me.

735
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,560
I got to share it with all of you.

736
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,740
But children what I learned is.

737
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,740
That just as my enthusiasm for Bob requires a mirror.

738
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,520
The problem is with the paradigm of coolness in King County.

739
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,840
Because what I've discovered in my travels children.

740
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,580
Is that here in King County.

741
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,500
The problem is.

742
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,800
That the paradigm of coolness is.

743
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,560
Your coolness is in inverse proportion to the enthusiasm.

744
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,700
That you demonstrate.

745
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,700
Now I've pondered on this issue children.

746
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,040
I've sought solutions children.

747
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,400
First I pursued a meteorological solution.

748
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,600
I said to myself well it's gray and cloudy here.

749
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,520
It rains all the time.

750
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,960
People are repressed.

751
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,040
And then children I pursued a pharmacological solution.

752
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,780
And I said to myself well they're all unscathed.

753
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,780
What can you expect?

754
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,940
They're smack to the eyeballs.

755
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,180
But no children that wasn't it either.

756
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,960
And then I pursued being a man of Bob.

757
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,860
I pursued a religious solution.

758
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,960
And I said to myself well.

759
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,620
200 years of Lutheran rectitude.

760
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,320
That's about what you can expect.

761
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,160
And children none of these solutions satisfied me.

762
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,640
And I came to feel.

763
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,600
That the people of Seattle.

764
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,100
Just didn't want to share children.

765
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,860
They didn't want to share.

766
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,020
They didn't want to feel what incarnates.

767
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,820
The Pope of all New York.

768
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,040
Idaho and the great Pacific Northwest.

769
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,880
They didn't care about my fire children.

770
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,580
They didn't care about my fervor.

771
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,360
They didn't care about my faith children.

772
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,180
Did they care about my fire children?

773
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,780
Say what?

774
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,220
Say what?

775
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,540
Say what?

776
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,840
Say what?

777
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:16,320
Say what?

778
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,900
Did they care about my fervor children?

779
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,840
Did they care?

780
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,540
Did they care?

781
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,020
Did they care about my faith children?

782
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,100
But you tonight children.

783
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,800
Do you care about my fire?

784
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,460
Do you care about my fervor children?

785
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,740
Do you care about my faith?

786
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,380
Then stand up and praise Bob.

787
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,300
Thank you children.

788
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:41,620
Now.

789
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,560
Now.

790
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,880
We can start preaching.

791
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,580
Now children I look around at this great culture of ours.

792
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,820
This great popular culture of ours.

793
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,080
This great insidious culture of ours children.

794
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,780
And you know what I notice since I.

795
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,280
I'll get to that part later.

796
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,720
I do get paid to start trends and spot trends.

797
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,540
But I'm coming to that.

798
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,520
That's the main course of my preaching tonight.

799
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,460
And we're still on the salad children.

800
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,780
We're just on the salad right now.

801
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,860
They're just scraping away the crumbs from the soup course children.

802
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,360
Because the salad is coming.

803
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,860
And the main course is after that.

804
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,300
Alright.

805
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:18,300


806
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,180
And when I look around this culture children.

807
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:26,080
Well what do I see that predominates?

808
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,680
What do I see everywhere I go?

809
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,820
I see retro children.

810
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,300
If there's anything.

811
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,040
Come on.

812
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:39,420
If there's anything that incarnates a conspiracy to me children.

813
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,400
It's this retro nonsense.

814
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,200
Nobody has a new idea.

815
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,160
Nobody wants to push forward.

816
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,880
They just want to catalyze what went before.

817
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,200
And you know children.

818
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,320
You know what separates the Pope of all New York from the Pope of Rome?

819
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,740
Say no because I know you don't.

820
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,180
Say no.

821
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,160
Children the thing is.

822
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,320
I have a power that the Pope of Rome would kill to possess.

823
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,540
I have the power to fail.

824
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:11,960
That's right children.

825
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,160
You never see an infallible Pope in the church of the sub-genius.

826
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,900
And in my consultation.

827
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,560
With the great Ivan Stein tonight.

828
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:22,040
It was decided that we too will go retro.

829
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,540
We too will go old school children.

830
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,420
It's an old school preaching tonight.

831
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,620
Old school.

832
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,240
Now in the old days children.

833
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,400
We would start a preaching with.

834
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,260
Thank you.

835
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,640
With the rules of the church of the sub-genius.

836
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,680
And tonight is no different.

837
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,000
Because what are we doing tonight?

838
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,920
One more time.

839
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,080
One more time.

840
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:50,940
That's right children.

841
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,860
We're going old school.

842
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,080
Now.

843
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,480
I think everybody here knows.

844
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,480
The first rule of the church of the sub-genius.

845
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,220
But it's my job as the Pope.

846
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,720
To take you through it.

847
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,660
And I'm going to do my job.

848
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,040
Go ahead children.

849
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,740
The first rule of the church of the sub-genius is.

850
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,580
The sub-genius must have.

851
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,340
What must he have?

852
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,780
What must he have?

853
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,380
What must he have?

854
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,100
What must he have?

855
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,660
What must he have?

856
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,140
What must he have?

857
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:22,960
What must she have?

858
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:22,960


859
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,120
What must he have?

860
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,780
What must she have?

861
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,800
Thank you children.

862
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,000
The second rule of the church of the sub-genius.

863
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,900
Has been ably delineated.

864
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,520
By the Master I haven't sang.

865
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,220
Who now in a cameo.

866
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,240
Is going to repeat that rule for us.

867
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,120
That I believe pertains to Joseph.

868
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,200
If you don't have a sense of humor my friend.

869
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,080
Don't try to judge us.

870
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,080


871
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,080


872
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,080


873
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,080


874
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,080


875
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,080


876
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,080


877
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,080


878
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,080


879
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,180
It's time to be funny!

880
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,400
Yes children, the most violated rule in the history of mankind!

881
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,640
Now then children, we're going to talk about wool.

882
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,880
Because you know children, if the next rule of the Church of the Subgenius is,

883
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:08,520
the Church of the Subgenius will help you pull the wool over your own eyes.

884
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:12,080
What will it do? Pull the wool over your own eyes!

885
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,780
That's right children, since you were a little baby children,

886
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:21,480
you've been sold your church's wool, your synagogue's wool, your school's wool,

887
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,920
your government's wool. You pull their wool over your eyes.

888
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,480
But we want you to pull your own wool over your eyes.

889
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,540
Jumping in, Ivan Stein?

890
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,760
Relax in the safety of your own delusion!

891
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,640
A hand for the Reverend Ivan Stein!

892
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,740
That's right children, as soon as you relax in the safety of your own delusion,

893
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,600
you're going to start doing what Bob wants you to do, and that's thinking for yourself!

894
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:55,680
Because see, old school children, old school, Bob is a short duration personal savior.

895
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,180
What is he? Personal Savior!

896
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,780
A savior designed for the attention span of today.

897
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:09,240
Now the next rule of the Church of the Subgenius is a rule that helps you

898
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,260
swim like a little fishy through the sea of the conspiracy.

899
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:19,860
And that rule is, if you act like a dumb shit, they'll treat you as an equal.

900
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,160
So that rule is so true, it's not even funny.

901
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:30,560
Now then children, the next rule of the Church of the Subgenius is,

902
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,680
if you can't tell shit from tuna fish, don't order seafood in a French restaurant!

903
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,760
Can I get a merci beaucoup?

904
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,360
Can I get a merci beaucoup?

905
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,420
Thank you children for those merci beaucoups.

906
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,980
I believe you're starting to wake up children, I believe the Seattle paradigm is being chased from this hall

907
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,260
by the Almighty Hand of God!

908
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:01,540
Now children, children, in my travels, in my travels to and fro to various divivals,

909
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,920
when I go uptown, when I go across town, when I go downtown, when I go across this great nation,

910
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,700
well, people say to me, Dave!

911
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:09,720
Dave!

912
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,240
People say to me, Ralph Day!

913
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,460
Ralph Day!

914
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,660
People say to me, Poma! New York City Day!

915
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,460
Poma! New York City Day!

916
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,160
Just what is a subgenius?

917
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,580
What is a subgenius?

918
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:28,380
Well now, if we're going strictly by Hoyle's children, a subgenius is of course someone who has tied to Bob,

919
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,540
that which is Bob, namely, thirty dollars.

920
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,880
But there's a broader explanation, children.

921
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,900
There are ways to recognize a subgenius.

922
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,860
One way we like to say is that a subgenius is likely to be a shy egomaniac.

923
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:52,460
Another thing we say is that a subgenius is someone who can either do one thing extremely well and nothing else at all,

924
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:58,720
or a subgenius is someone who can do a number of things pretty good, but nothing well enough to turn a pot.

925
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:05,200
Alright children, now, I believe that y'all are just about warmed up.

926
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,160
We're going to get to the main course of my sermon tonight.

927
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,180
Now I think y'all know about the conspiracy, children.

928
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:24,820
But I think that what you don't recognize is that you are in the grip of the fallacy that the conspiracy puts on you in its most sophisticated guise.

929
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:33,440
That fallacy is that because you think you know there's a conspiracy, you think you can avoid the effects of the conspiracy.

930
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,720
Which is also like, you could say, I am too cool, I am too perceptive,

931
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:44,340
I am too media savvy, I am too aware for the conspiracy to get me.

932
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:53,880
Well children, in response to such an ignorant and innocent attitude, the Pope of all of Europe would like to pose a sports analogy, children.

933
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,880
This seems like an apt town to propose a sports analogy.

934
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:03,000
A town in which you have mortgaged your future to build a stadium.

935
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,160
Now here's my analogy, children.

936
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,700
You may have noticed that modern football players,

937
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:15,700
between weight lifting and conditioning and innate psychosis and drug use,

938
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:22,180
have become so big and so fast and so powerful that when they run into each other,

939
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:27,320
the human body can no longer deal or tolerate with the impact they sustain.

940
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,780
Now I know you're saying to yourself, Dad!

941
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,640
I know you're saying to yourself, I'm dead!

942
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,500
I know you're saying to yourself, come on New York City!

943
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:47,320
What in the great J.R. Bob Dobbs does that analogy have to do with me and fending off the conspiracy?

944
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:55,780
Well children, you're in luck because I flew 3,000 miles, tourist class, in a window seat, to tell it.

945
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,400
Children, my analogy stands as this.

946
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:06,080
Just as those football players have gotten too big and too fast to sustain the impact they generate,

947
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,140
so the messages of the conspiracy,

948
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:13,400
have gotten too subtle, sophisticated, and pervasive for you to resist.

949
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,960
Now that every commercial has a built-in cool factor that tells you you're cool,

950
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,020
because you see that the commercial's trying to be cool,

951
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,540
how are you going to resist this message, children?

952
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,780
Now you might well, if you're a Perce Picasso sort of subgenius,

953
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,020
you might say to me, Dad!

954
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,080
You might say to me, Rep Dad!

955
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,900
You might say to me, Come on New York City, Dad!

956
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,500
What makes you such an expert in the conspiracy?

957
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,340
Well, I came here to tell you that tonight, children.

958
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,880
Because the real theme of my preaching tonight,

959
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:51,120
the main course, as it were, of my sermon,

960
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,780
is that despite my long history in the Church of the Subgenius,

961
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,820
despite the many kudos the Pope of All New York has received for his preaching,

962
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,600
despite his many demonstrations of his faith and vow,

963
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:10,620
the Pope of All New York flew 3,000 miles to confess something to you tonight!

964
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,880
I don't serve the conspiracy, children.

965
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,340
I am the conspiracy.

966
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:23,040
You see, children, I'm the guy you've got to fear the most.

967
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,200
And I'm going to tell you why.

968
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:28,320
Because, children, way back when I was in college, let me ask you a question.

969
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,440
Who had the best record collection in the dorm?

970
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,360
Well, who was it, children? Was it Carl Weatherly next door?

971
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:35,820
Say no.

972
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,320
Absolutely not.

973
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,560
Was it the Pope of All New York?

974
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,080
That's right, children.

975
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,940
Who knew the best records?

976
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,740
Who knew the records with the most social cachet?

977
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,140
Who knew the records with the greatest soul, children?

978
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,460
Why, it was me, children. It was me.

979
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,800
No rabbit just found it.

980
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,080
The same is true of the cinema.

981
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,300
The same is true of the magazines, children.

982
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:01,540
Because, children, I made earlier in my life a commitment to this pop culture

983
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,400
because I liked it.

984
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,960
And I was dumb enough to try and pursue a career

985
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,180
from what I liked.

986
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:11,420
And, children, the conspiracy has carved my fate into my back.

987
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,840
Because, children, now, in that big demonic city of New York,

988
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:19,280
I sell my knowledge of what's cool.

989
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,220
I sell my knowledge of what's quality.

990
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:29,220
And I sell it, children, by writing and making the very commercials

991
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:32,800
and advertisements that seduce you into believing

992
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,340
that the conspiracy can't affect you.

993
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:41,000
Because I'm the guy that knows enough to put the conspiracy message in

994
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,100
in a way that you can't detect it.

995
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:49,140
Or in a way that flatters you into thinking you can detect it

996
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:55,340
and thus avoid becoming a conspiracy dupe.

997
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,820
Children, that's tricky work, avoiding becoming a conspiracy dupe.

998
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,780
That's very tricky work.

999
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,240
Because that conspiracy is in your DNA.

1000
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,540
It's in your hair.

1001
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:07,360
It's in your skin.

1002
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,980
It's in the air you breathe.

1003
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:16,640
And you have to learn how you respond to the conspiracy in order to find it.

1004
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,420
Now, children, I flew 3,000 miles here tonight

1005
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:25,940
to demonstrate to you the power of Bob within me.

1006
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,520
But I also flew here tonight to repent, children.

1007
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,180
I came here to repent.

1008
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:34,900
I came here to cleanse myself of my connection to the conspiracy.

1009
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,220
I came here to save you, children.

1010
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,200
I came here to tell you what I have learned the hardest way.

1011
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,600
I came here to save you, children.

1012
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,260
I came here to save you, children.

1013
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:49,400
I came here to get down on my knees and apologize to you, children.

1014
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:54,600
I came here to let you know that the Pope of all New York is not a hero.

1015
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,840
He is not a man to be admired.

1016
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,280
He is not a man to be followed.

1017
00:54:59,380 --> 00:54:59,540
No.

1018
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,620
He is unclean.

1019
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,860
He is unclean.

1020
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:07,040
He is filled with the power of the conspiracy, children.

1021
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:13,420
And I have come here tonight to give you the example of my perdition, children.

1022
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:18,080
My loss to you will not go down this path.

1023
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:21,420
I have one thing left to say to you, children.

1024
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:27,680
When you see this broken soul, when you see the shell of a man that once was,

1025
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,520
I want you to remember what I flew 3,000 miles here tonight to tell you, children.

1026
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,000
That is, you are good enough.

1027
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,860
You are clean enough.

1028
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,480
You are right enough.

1029
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:46,800
But if, if, and only if, you get right with Bob tonight, good night.

1030
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,200
.

1031
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,440
Pope David of Lyre.

1032
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:56,820
.

1033
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:56,820


1034
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:57,500
.

1035
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,920
.

1036
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,420
.

1037
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,980
.

1038
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,980
.

1039
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:39,620
11, 10, 9, ignition sequence start, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

1040
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,300
All engines running.

1041
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:42,960
Lift off.

1042
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,620
We have a lift off.

1043
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,520
And Jesus looked up toward heaven and he said, kill the fatted calf.

1044
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:50,980
Let there be feasting.

1045
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:04,980
Oh, let there be feasting, my friends.

1046
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,200
What a frenzy.

1047
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:07,900
Thank you.

1048
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,360
Yes, thank you.

1049
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,920
What a frenzy it has been.

1050
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,220
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1051
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:21,760
Pope David N. Meyer, friends, was the, hold on just a second.

1052
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,260
I've got to get some background music on here.

1053
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,420
Oh, that's much better.

1054
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:33,340
And this is Einstein's Secret Orchestra in the background playing off the CD.

1055
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:48,320
Friends, the great Rev. Dr. Jack gave us, Rev. Dr. Mehoff, he's also known as, gave us, just donated this church a CD-ROM burner,

1056
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:56,420
which means that I can now, well, the most important thing is I can keep safety masters of things on CDs.

1057
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:00,760
It's a little perhaps safer than cassette tapes.

1058
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:01,480
I don't know.

1059
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,060
We'll see.

1060
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:10,780
But it also means that we can, heck, we can just make our own CDs.

1061
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:18,960
I can play, there can be Hour of Slack CDs in limited quantities, shall we say.

1062
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:25,860
And, of course, the Hour of Slack is brought to you by the Church of the Subgenius,

1063
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,780
which it's.

1064
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:32,140
The church in itself is located at the great skyscrapers at Post Office.

1065
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,000
You got that pencil ready to go, friends?

1066
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:42,000
At Post Office Box 140306.

1067
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:43,540
That's right.

1068
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:51,920
140306 in lovely, lovely, oh, it's such a beautiful Dallas, Texas sort of a town.

1069
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:54,820
7521.

1070
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:00,520
now to continue with the tape recording

1071
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,820
we were listening friends to the

1072
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:14,240
DeVival in Seattle produced by Pope S. Lilith

1073
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,080
who was heard at the beginning there

1074
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,640
and I was going to run Pope Meyer

1075
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,840
and the other Huey

1076
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:26,200
Reverend Huey and Papa Joe Mama

1077
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,400
and Pope Meyer's rant was just such a

1078
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,340
classic one piece that I decided to just

1079
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:35,580
