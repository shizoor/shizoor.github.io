1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
And welcome, dear friends, to the Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,200
Praise Bob!

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,860
For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,640
Turn on the machine.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,360
This is Radio Yerevan.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,980
Wake up, puppet boy!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,660
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation to provide programs which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,680
There is absolutely no other possibility.

9
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,620
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,680
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,680
The subgenius Hour of Slack!

12
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,140
Where are we, Bob?

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,500
The code is broken.

14
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,400
Trouble?

15
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,080
Big.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,000
Security?

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,240
I have the lid on tight.

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,900
Well, take it off for me.

19
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,420
The message is...

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,180
Mars needs women.

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,180
Ah, yes, dear friends.

22
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:46,300
We record so much stuff at the X-Day Drills that it lasts us like six months' worth of weekly hours of Slack.

23
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,860
Usually, we broadcast recordings roughly in chronological order, but this one's an exception.

24
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,340
A week after the world failed to end on X-Day,

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,160
it tried to at least reboot.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,840
A week later, in the form of the Starwood Festival,

27
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:11,380
an all-purpose mind-blower started in 1980 by my neighbor Joe and our late friend Jeff Rosenbaum.

28
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,780
They hired me to make fun of them at the 1990 Starwood Festival

29
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,000
and brought me back ever since until I started delivering myself there

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,140
on account of having moved to Ohio to marry Princess Wee.

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,700
And I became part of the organization ACE,

32
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,980
the Association of Women and Women of the United States.

33
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,720
The Association of Consciousness Exploration.

34
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:42,320
Although Potter and Petal Nostril now fill the roles that Princess Wee and I once did,

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,860
the really hard and demanding work,

36
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,560
whereas Wee is a mere co-director now,

37
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,700
I'm as dedicated to the festival as ever,

38
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,880
and I take my annual Starwood sermon very seriously.

39
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,960
It's the yearly rant that I put the most thought and effort into,

40
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:06,020
because the subgeniuses of X-Day Drills are all hecklers and would ruin the recording,

41
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,000
whereas the pagans are polite and often strangely respectful.

42
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,900
So I've been holding back on saying certain things about our current governmental situation for months,

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,200
because I wanted to be able to say them strongly,

44
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,220
and when I'm addressing a whole bunch of real people right to their faces,

45
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,940
it's much harder for me to pink out, as we might say.

46
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:29,940


47
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:29,940


48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,180
Talking to real people right in front of you makes you more honest.

49
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,320
It's the opposite of the internet in that respect.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,620
And I saved up my gut rant for that stage at Starwood,

51
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,560
where I'd have no choice but to say it as I meant it.

52
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,660
Stuttering and all.

53
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,660
Testidilistiz.

54
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,180
Testinacistan.

55
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,660
Testington. Ah, there we go. Baron Testington is here.

56
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,300
Not to be confused with Baron Testiculoid.

57
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,660
Who sounds like this.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,100
I used to sound that way before that operation.

59
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,780
Well, boy, howdy. I guess I'm gonna get us started here.

60
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,520
Recording. Everything going fine.

61
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,340
No trouble.

62
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,840
Except that I can never remember

63
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,640
what I'm supposed to do at these Starwood things.

64
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,820
I always end up having to read my own blurb

65
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,600
to see what the hell I promised everybody I was gonna do.

66
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,300
Oh, no.

67
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,460
This is terrible.

68
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
It says here...

69
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,340
Well, first off, the first word is Bob.

70
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,900
Price Bob!

71
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
I, I, I, I, I, I...

72
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,300
You always feel free to say Price Bob,

73
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,960
although, uh,

74
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,860
lately people have been saying Hail Bob.

75
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,320
And because my hearing aids aren't perfect,

76
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,180
I started hearing it as Jail Bob.

77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,520
But, but really, first, if you think about it,

78
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,860
you first have to nail Bob.

79
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,660
After you finish hailing Bob,

80
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,520
you realize, oh,

81
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,980
maybe I shouldn't trust preachers and salesmen all the time.

82
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,960
Then you've nailed Bob.

83
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,740
Then you can jail Bob, but

84
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,280
if you're a good subgenius, then you bail Bob.

85
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,980
I learned all of that stuff in the comments on the,

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,980
some on the internet earlier today.

87
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,800
Okay, so it says here,

88
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,120
the title is Bob Needs Women.

89
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,760
Nasty women.

90
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,440
To, uh, to quote our president, in fact.

91
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,420
The Bob Needs Women part is a, a play on the,

92
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,400
a movie titled called Mars Needs Women.

93
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,980
But Bob needs specific kinds of women.

94
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,840
The, the nasty kind.

95
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,740
And by that I don't mean sexy, necessarily.

96
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,880
I mean troublesome.

97
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,980
These are challenging times for anyone who's not super rich or brain dead.

98
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,700
And even a few of those folks are starting to get nervous.

99
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,140
On the other hand, if you're both, you can be president.

100
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,400
Reverend Stang has some observations and suggestions about

101
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,560
maintaining one's sense of slack in a world that looks increasingly

102
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:39,320
like a sick cartoon, as the most ridiculous and sketchy of subgenius prophecies are being fulfilled.

103
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,760
As a side sermon, Stang will discuss the science of destructionism

104
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:54,040
and how it proves that all holy books of all religions are equally true.

105
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,020
And,

106
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,140
uh,

107
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,240
I think the, the big question for Bob Needs Women is,

108
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:15,720
what is it that Bob Needs Women is in the history of the church?

109
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,720
And,

110
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,020
uh,

111
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,060
I mean,

112
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,120
I don't know,

113
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,120


114
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,120


115
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,120


116
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,120


117
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,180
I think it's a,

118
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,200
I think it's a,

119
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,220
it's a,

120
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,220


121
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,220


122
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,520
it's a,

123
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,680
I'm not going to say that Bob Needs Women is the most ridiculous,

124
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:21,680


125
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:21,680


126
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:21,680


127
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:21,700
most creepy,

128
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:21,700


129
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:21,720
most disturbing,

130
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:21,880
most disturbing,

131
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,180
most disturbing,

132
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,960
Starwood. Like Starwood, it was incubating

133
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,100
since the 50s. When we first

134
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,560
started getting really, really pissed off.

135
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,040
When mom didn't bring our pacifier in time. This is a for real

136
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,080
documentary. This time it's really going to happen. They've already spent too much money for it not

137
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,960
to. But they, two women are directing it

138
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,020
and they said one thing we want to do is help, you know

139
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,620
let's face it, y'all's events look a bit too

140
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,180
sausage party still. And I

141
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,600
won't deny that, although we're doing better than Devo or Gwar.

142
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,360
It's probably

143
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,960
two out of three are guys. And they said they were going to try

144
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,940
to change that. And they wanted me to come up with some slogans right off

145
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,580
the bat. And Bob needs women, nasty women was it.

146
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,240
It was that simple. Now

147
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,200
some of you I recognize were here at the

148
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,340
Pufferdome. I talked for a little while at the Pufferdome.

149
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,840
And I promised that I would piss people off this time

150
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,880
and not necessarily be funny. Although I do have some

151
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,820
funny stuff in the same subject matter that other people wrote.

152
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,540
But first I have to give you a sad

153
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,820
punchline to a lovely story I told in the Pufferdome.

154
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:47,980
About

155
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:55,920
years ago I inherited my father's dog who was a farm dog and had never dealt with city

156
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,760
life. He's learning, he's adjusting. And especially he had never met anyone who kept

157
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,300
cats as pets. He always, the only cats he ever met were feral cats, varmints. Holy hated

158
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:16,740
cats. And during the week of X day he was forced to live in the bed and breakfast at

159
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,060
the top of the hill. And he could hear us

160
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:25,280
partying down here. Princess Wee had to stay with him then. And I spent most of

161
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,340
Starwood staying with him because he gets so anxious mainly because the cats.

162
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,100
He couldn't believe that people were feeding these things, petting them. Don't you understand their cats?

163
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:43,320
Well over a period of time and with some, a little bit of tough love, he got to where he, he seemed to

164
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,740
not just tolerate the cats but he wanted to make friends with them. The cats hadn't

165
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:56,440
gone that far yet. They're tough old cats. But he himself, this dog's name by the way,

166
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,500
is Dammit with an E. My dad named him. It wasn't a problem way out in the country. It's

167
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:09,460
a little different in the suburbs. Anyway, I was bragging to the people in the Puffer

168
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:16,740
Dome how Starwood was so magical and transformative that this ornery old, and I do mean old dog,

169
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:22,900
had become a kind of a cat lover. And it was such a marvelous little moral of the story

170
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:29,520
and way to end the rant and get out of there so I could go back to bed. Well, here's the

171
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:37,000
sad thing. Dammit was fooling us, or kidding himself perhaps, because just yesterday I

172
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,620
was taking him for a walk in the yard up there, and he came upon one of the cats unexpectedly.

173
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,780
It was in a box on the ground. I didn't see it.

174
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,720
His face was right next to the cat. He instantly grabbed it by the neck and tried to kill it

175
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,560
dead right then and there. Right after all that love talk and moaning and loving, tail

176
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:11,300
wagging, I was very fast and got him apart and whooped his butt. Thank God. My good luck

177
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,680
and the cats. The cat was not injured or I'd be staying at the Super 8 now.

178
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,040
I'd be staying at the Athens with that dog now. So in other words, my description of

179
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:31,520
Starwood transforming this beast into a higher being, fake news. On the other hand though,

180
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,580
now this was something else that I got from the newspaper that very morning and I told

181
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:43,720
everybody about it. It's short. It's a Chattanooga newspaper from Tennessee. It shows a Tennessee

182
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,600
license plate with the word Hail Satan on it.

183
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:54,580
Hail Satan license plates available in Tennessee. After, and this is a story, after Tennessee

184
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,580
legislators passed a bill to allow residents to get license plates that bear the phrase

185
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,100
in God we trust, in the interest of religious diversity, other plates were made available

186
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:12,500
that bear other religious phrases including Shalom, Namaste, Praise Jah, and Hail Satan.

187
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,440
Quote,

188
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,460
It's only fair, said

189
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:25,720
State Senator Brody Printrip, we should celebrate our diversity. Yes, we are deep in the Bible

190
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:32,940
belt, but the freedom of religion is a constitutionally protected right, said Printrip, holding up

191
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:42,880
a license plate with the phrase, there's no prob with Bob. Praise Bob. My son was the

192
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,080
first one to comment that,

193
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,300
Hey,

194
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:52,560
I noticed on the comments everybody believed that story. Well, I did too. I thought it

195
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,880
was real. Today I look closer and the Chattanooga bystander is sort of like the onion. I fell

196
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:07,260
for it and here's why, because I wanted to believe it. I really, it seemed really odd

197
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,740
for Tennessee to be a state that would do that, but I wanted to believe it, you know?

198
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,980
And that's,

199
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,560
somebody thought that I was saying this wrong

200
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,680
but I mean it

201
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,040
fake news is the news you most want to hear

202
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,540
that's how you know it might be fake news

203
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,860
that's not an instruction, it's a definition

204
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,580
fake news is the news you most want to hear

205
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,880
and in many cases it makes money

206
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,060
for the people who produce the fake news in the form of clickbait

207
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,880
you can actually, you know, well I mean

208
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,560
heck the Onion and other groups I can think of

209
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,320
that call themselves churches

210
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,980
sure they will produce a certain amount of interesting

211
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,220
stories to get your attention and that's how they make

212
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,680
their living

213
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,040
but interestingly enough it has turned out through research

214
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,660
that the kind of fake news that

215
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,340
right-wingers, conservatives want to hear is the kind that sells the best

216
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,220
by far and that's why there's a lot more of that out there

217
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,000
now of course a lot of people just assume

218
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,980
that what do you mean fake news, everybody knows the Clintons are murderers

219
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,480
that's the household internet knowledge, that's been household knowledge

220
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,440
on Facebook since 1990 before Facebook was even invented

221
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,560
my mom had every book on the murdering Clintons

222
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,680
I was raised by staunch Republicans but my dad was a lawyer

223
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,920
he didn't believe any of that crap, he could tell hearsay and gossip when he saw it

224
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,420
he didn't like Clintons at all but he knew fake news

225
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,560
however it does sell. Now, those are the kinds of things that are not fake news.

226
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,540
Then there are some other news that was probably real news

227
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,060
because you can't write something this dumb even if you're trying

228
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:27,180
I read the other day, you may have heard of this huge expensive creationist museum in Kentucky

229
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:34,600
taxpayer-funded, oh the state government in Kentucky decided that

230
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,540
oh they know enough about this complicated evolution silly gossip, oh they know enough about this complicated evolution silly gossip

231
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:40,540


232
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,620
let's have some real science, let's spend taxpayers money on an enormous creationist museum shaped like Noah's Ark

233
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:53,760
well even the Christians who wanted to like it found it kind of lame

234
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,980
and it's been losing money like crazy

235
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:01,260
the director of that wonderful project, a guy named Ken Ham

236
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,040
was quoted in the news as saying

237
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,620
the reason we failed was because

238
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,400
atheists were praying for us to fail

239
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,260
I'll say that one more time

240
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,020
to quote Ken Ham

241
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,580
our creationist museum failed only because atheists

242
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,420
were praying for it to fail

243
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,020
now stop and think how outnumbered the average atheist is

244
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,400
even in this crowd

245
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,200
I mean there must be ninety Christians every ten atheists right?

246
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,600
I mean if there's even that many

247
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,500
atheists

248
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,420
what does this imply?

249
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:51,100
that God listens to the prayers of one atheist more than, harder than he listens to ten Christians

250
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,620
in other words

251
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,440
nothing responds to prayer better than Jesus does

252
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,160
what the hell does that mean?

253
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,300
I come from a

254
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,600
a secular humanist background

255
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,480
Actually, I've never had any real bone to pick with any particular religion.

256
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:21,660
I wasn't beaten by nuns or raped by Catholics or any of that that I can remember.

257
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:29,500
I'm a junior scientist, not a real scientist, but I've been a junior scientist my whole life.

258
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,520
Admittedly, I am a clown junior scientist,

259
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:39,240
but I've been following the sciences all in a very, very broad way.

260
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,300
Forever.

261
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,360
With a specialty lately in microfossils, because I have access to a lot of them.

262
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:55,880
Microfossils are defined as fossils that are smaller than the president's hands or the voters' brains.

263
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,600
These are really, really tiny, boring fossils of marine life

264
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,860
that are just like most of the ones that are still around today.

265
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,160
It's just that I have access to a lot of them.

266
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:17,240
When you know what they look like, you want to hold your breath walking around on that ranch in Texas all the time.

267
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,920
Speaking of creation museums,

268
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,480
I inherited my dad's house in Texas.

269
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,340
It's in an interesting little town.

270
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,960
We have a nuclear power plant visible from the dining room window on the horizon,

271
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,140
a safari theme park,

272
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,580
and a dinosaur tree.

273
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,380
There are a lot of dinosaur tracks that the area is famous for,

274
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,460
and a creation museum.

275
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,100
One...

276
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,780
Pardon me?

277
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,520
This creation museum, Dr. Baugh's creation museum,

278
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,280
is so extreme that even the other creationists think he's a coot.

279
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,900
He's got a wonderful track of...

280
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,760
His name's Carl Baugh.

281
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,900
He's not actually a doctor or anything.

282
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,640
He has...

283
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,120
One of the things in his museum is a dinosaur track

284
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,580
with a...

285
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,340
human track in it.

286
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,200
In other words, when the deluge of Noah started,

287
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,060
first the acrocanthosaurus ran across that mud,

288
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,060
then Adam or Eve or some...

289
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,280
one of Noah's neighbors ran across it.

290
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,500
And so you can clearly see this barefoot human track inside a dinosaur track.

291
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,480
He also has one with a sandaled human footprint.

292
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,300
They do look strangely sculpted and smooth,

293
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,120
much less rough and...

294
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,700
and messed up than your average true lower Cretaceous

295
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,940
or even 6,000 year old track.

296
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,600
His whole theory is that the...

297
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,380
the...

298
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,600
the flood came down so hard that in two hours

299
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,720
it turned all the mud and tracks and bones and shells on the whole planet

300
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,000
into solid rock.

301
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,940
That's how heavy it was.

302
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,440
Now, that was...

303
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,980
You might call that fake news.

304
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,080
Here's something I read just yesterday that...

305
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,720
I want to be fake news,

306
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,380
but it was one of those big polling...

307
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,660
outfits.

308
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,180
Kinna Pak, I think.

309
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,920
They asked...

310
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,200
people what they thought of higher education and college.

311
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,420
And for the first time,

312
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,420
54% of Republicans said,

313
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,520
college is bad.

314
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,500
You should stop at high school.

315
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,140
54%.

316
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,980
Okay, higher education is bad.

317
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,960
I guess that's because they've been telling each other for 40 years that

318
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,000
if you go to college, every class tells you about Karl Marx

319
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,120
and the...

320
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,480
the silly theory of evolution and so forth.

321
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,080
I actually only had two years of college and I don't remember

322
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,920
any math professor mentioning Marx.

323
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,840
Or communism.

324
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,320
Or a music teacher mentioning...

325
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,840
The film history professor mentioned Groucho Marx

326
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,620
and other Marxists.

327
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,960
That was all that I got out of it.

328
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:17,800
But...

329
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,600
In other words, it has come to the point

330
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,740
where...

331
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,420
a little over a quarter of the American population

332
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,320
thinks that knowledge is bad.

333
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,920
Of course, some people think there's no such thing as knowledge.

334
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,840
It's all opinion.

335
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,760
And it's all just feelings.

336
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,220
I'm not going to try to argue with that

337
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,280
because I don't argue religion with people.

338
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,620
It just doesn't make any sense.

339
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,640
Praise Bob.

340
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,080
So...

341
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,360
Isn't that kind of...

342
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,620
awful?

343
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,380
That people would...

344
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,660
consciously say increased knowledge is a bad thing?

345
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,220
Isn't that sort of deplorable?

346
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,980
So wasn't Hillary kind of wrong to say

347
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,660
half the Trump voters?

348
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,860
That the Trump supporters were deplorables?

349
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,520
It was 54%.

350
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,400
She did later regret saying half.

351
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,460
Yeah, slightly over half.

352
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,480
What about you non-deplorable Trump supporters?

353
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,520
There are intelligent Republicans.

354
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,120
I've known them.

355
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,240
Poor William F. Buckley.

356
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,900
Good God, he must be rolling over and over

357
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,200
in his grave at this point.

358
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,280
I didn't agree with him,

359
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,040
but he knew what a shift key was for.

360
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,120
You know?

361
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:40,280
How far will you secret, intelligent Republicans

362
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,960
let this go just to piss off us libtards?

363
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,000
I've heard the strangest arguments.

364
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,000
Well, a vote for...

365
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,060
This was before the election.

366
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,980
And this is from some of my best friends.

367
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,180
A vote for Trump is a vote against boredom.

368
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,540
Oh, he's an agent of chaos.

369
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,320
Okay, number one.

370
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,820
No, he's an agent of totalitarian authoritarian fascism.

371
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,800
That's the exact opposite of chaos, you dumbass!

372
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,300
And boredom is something to be greatly, greatly welcomed

373
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,140
in international politics.

374
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,380
You know, the argument was,

375
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,840
well, if we vote for a Democrat,

376
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,220
let's not even get into those differences.

377
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,580
You're just voting for business as usual.

378
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,460
Well, as a half-college-educated,

379
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,480
country, aging white man,

380
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,820
I kind of was okay with the way things were going.

381
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,520
It seemed like we were making tiny, tiny incremental steps forward,

382
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,200
which is all I ever hoped for,

383
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,820
in practical terms,

384
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,180
after I grew up a little bit.

385
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,980
Well, the president says that

386
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,760
PC speech,

387
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,580
what we used to call common manners,

388
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,520
it was a whole problem.

389
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,820
Okay, so I'm going to quit being PC,

390
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,200
and we'll see who the crybaby special snowflakes are.

391
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,880
Because I'm going to use the S word.

392
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,560
And for a subgenius to have to use the S word,

393
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,820
that's bad, bad news.

394
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,140
Stupid is the S word.

395
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,040
For a subgenius to have to call somebody else stupid.

396
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,780
Oh, oh.

397
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,920
And ignorance is only a partial excuse.

398
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,100
I understand maybe being in a situation

399
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,700
where you've never been able to travel much,

400
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,180
and you never did learn to read much,

401
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,340
and besides, Sesame Street was kind of hard to follow.

402
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:05,620
But these people are consciously voting

403
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,220
to increase ignorance,

404
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,420
like creationism,

405
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,200
and to make it,

406
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,180
I hate to say it,

407
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,880
but I'm starting to feel like

408
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,060
they kind of want to outlaw science.

409
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,000
In the Church of the Subgenius,

410
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,840
we sell, right over there at that table,

411
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,360
among other things,

412
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,320
a doctorate in the forbearance of science.

413
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:29,800
And they're not even forbidden sciences.

414
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,580
Well, if you're any kind of science at all,

415
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,020
scientist at all,

416
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,020
even an amateur,

417
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,060
you're a lawbreaker

418
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,780
in this administration's environment.

419
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,620
And they are just ignorant.

420
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,780
It really is stupid

421
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,120
to vote for bigger breaks

422
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,920
for the insanely rich

423
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,600
and to screw yourself.

424
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,660
No skin off my teeth,

425
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,180
I'm one of the elites.

426
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,500
Relatively.

427
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,460
It's not that I have a lot of money in my pocket,

428
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,000
but I've got a couple of cars,

429
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,000
a little bit of an education.

430
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,580
I'm not the one who's going to suffer.

431
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,200
So, yeah.

432
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,040
Yeah, I'll say it.

433
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,820
The stupid people won.

434
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,360
Boy, that hurt my buddy's feelings.

435
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,720
I said that at dinner the other day.

436
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,580
He was so shocked to hear me say that.

437
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,960
I'll say it again.

438
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,320
The stupid, buck-toothed, inbred,

439
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,740
cow-fucking, jock, redneck, dumbasses.

440
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,040
One, does that hurt somebody's feelings?

441
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,400
Was that a mean thing for me to say?

442
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,800
Are the libtards full of hate?

443
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,680
We won't let Ann Coulter get a word in edgewise?

444
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,640
Oh, the poor thing.

445
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,200
Was I not PC when I said that?

446
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,560
It was, hey, come on.

447
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,680
It's just locker room banter, that's all.

448
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,220
I'm a media star.

449
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,240
I can do anything.

450
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,120
You should just walk up to the media

451
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
and grab them by the country.

452
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,100
Ha, ha, ha.

453
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,120
Locker room banter.

454
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,220
And the sad thing about stupid people

455
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,180
is they're afraid.

456
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
They are so afraid.

457
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,820
They're afraid.

458
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,920
There's Sharia law everywhere.

459
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,140
Just look around.

460
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,740
Oh, wait.

461
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,580
Almost everyone I see looks like an ordinary,

462
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,760
normal, Caucasian American.

463
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,900
Isn't that funny?

464
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,340
I mean, really, I'm not seeing a whole lot of Sharia law

465
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,620
being implemented in Glen Rose, Texas,

466
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,240
or Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

467
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,920
I currently live in both of those places.

468
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,520
Obama took everybody's guns away.

469
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,380
The Clintons were executed for murder.

470
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,600
There are child sex camps on the moon,

471
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,120
even though the moon landing was on the moon.

472
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,520
I'm not a hoax.

473
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,940
I have heard all of these things over and over and over

474
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:05,400
and over again since I started reading,

475
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,460
since I started the terrible bad habit of reading

476
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,520
the letters to the editor in the Dallas Morning News

477
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,240
100 years ago.

478
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,740
But my dad, in the middle of an argument with me

479
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,740
that he was not exactly winning,

480
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,500
because I wasn't exactly arguing,

481
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,860
he uttered something from the bottom of his heart

482
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,240
that was one of the truest things I ever heard.

483
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,240
He just blurted out,

484
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,560
I believe what I need to believe.

485
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,100
That's the human condition.

486
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,520
Who among us can really admit

487
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,960
that it's any different than that?

488
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,600
We all do that.

489
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,860
We all believe in what we need to believe.

490
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,720
It's just that some people are just like,

491
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,660
they're so screwed up,

492
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,860
they need to believe that everybody else is too.

493
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,420
And I'm not just talking about

494
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,440
poor dumbass ignorant right-wingers.

495
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,880
I'm talking about dumbass ignorant subgeniuses.

496
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,840
Again, think how dumb you have to be

497
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,820
to be kicked out of church with a subgenius for being dumb.

498
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,740
And then there was my dildo bomb last year.

499
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,860
I had this camera mount.

500
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,500
It was a very weird looking thing.

501
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,420
It didn't actually work as a camera mount.

502
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,640
That was fake news too.

503
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,600
It had rounded ends.

504
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,640
It fell out of the golf cart.

505
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,300
And as I was looking for it,

506
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,020
I started getting reports from security

507
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,280
over the walkie-talkies.

508
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,460
I tried to track it down.

509
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,940
A guy tended to see it as a roadside bomb.

510
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,820
Women tended to see it as a dildo

511
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,860
that had just been used and was gross

512
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,040
and they weren't going to touch it.

513
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,660
So yeah, you believe what you need to believe.

514
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,780
And if I wanted to get rich real quick,

515
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,820
all I would have to do is repeat

516
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,220
the subgenius bullshit without smiling.

517
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,320
If I could keep a straight face

518
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,620
when I went through all of Bob's wonderful sayings

519
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,740
that too much is always better than not enough,

520
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,700
pull the wool over your own eyes,

521
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,080
there's conspiracy of normal people

522
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,340
taking away the slack of all the abnormals,

523
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,860
that you're better than others

524
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,400
just because you're different.

525
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,480
Isn't that just what you most want?

526
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,380
Doesn't that sound like it might be fake news?

527
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:24,940
Maybe.

528
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,480
There are people who honestly want to believe

529
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,600
that they are a different species than the humans

530
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,940
and therefore they're better.

531
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,740
The really stupid ones actually think

532
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,900
they're smarter than everybody else.

533
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,060
How do you even define intelligence?

534
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,840
If you've got half a brain,

535
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,160
you know that's impossible.

536
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,400
Book smart and you can't change attire?

537
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,200
Well, Mensa might be the place for you.

538
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,680
If you can do both,

539
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,740
Church of the Subgenius might work out.

540
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,400
If you can just change attire,

541
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,580
that's all we ask.

542
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,360
Phooey, that's what I say.

543
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,580
Mark my words, phooey.

544
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,740
I know that's strong language,

545
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,620
I don't want to break anybody's ears.

546
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,800
Oh, and then there's the mainstream media,

547
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,600
that's the bad guy now because

548
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,080
it might say news you didn't want to hear.

549
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,840
Oh my God, it must be a lie

550
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,700
if it isn't exactly what you want to hear.

551
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,700
Here's the thing, I actually have worked

552
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,600
in and out of the mainstream media

553
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,120
and of course the underground media.

554
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,520
I've spent most of my time doing college radio

555
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,020
and fun stuff where I didn't have advertisers,

556
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,940
didn't have a boss,

557
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,680
could basically do anything I wanted to

558
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,780
except say the one true rule of the Church of the Subgenius,

559
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,120
plainly on the radio,

560
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,780
which is if they can't take a joke.

561
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,940
There, I just saved myself some work.

562
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,380
Anyway, sure, there's bias there.

563
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,100
I've actually worked as a journalist a little bit,

564
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,020
although I wasn't ever trained that way.

565
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,020
And I've worked as a typesetter and an office boy

566
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,920
and a cameraman around regular news stations

567
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,300
and big city magazines and all that kind of stuff.

568
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,100
And they're not sitting around trying to make up lies.

569
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,720
They're trying to compete with their competition

570
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,040
by getting better proof sooner.

571
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,760
Of course there's bias, mostly driven by advertising.

572
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,920
And of course there's, you know,

573
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,440
you've got your Breitbart on the one hand

574
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,000
or your Raw Story perhaps on the other hand.

575
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,520
I have the bad habit of reading both, my friends.

576
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,920
I don't watch TV news.

577
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:55,740
I've never actually seen The Daily Show.

578
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,160
I've never seen a Daily Show.

579
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,980
I've seen a little clip.

580
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,940
I saw a clip of Rachel Maddow the time she mentioned Bob Dobbs.

581
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,540
I saw Stephen Colbert the time he looked like Bob Dobbs.

582
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,100
But basically I don't use cable TV

583
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,800
and I prefer to read in the news

584
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,920
because then I can get it at my own speed.

585
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,720
There's more sentences there, more information.

586
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,060
I can go through it faster than any news guy can talk.

587
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,340
And I've spent more time in the right-wing bubble

588
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,540
than most right-wing bubble-heads have.

589
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,620
I know about echo chambers.

590
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,660
I know about both sides of the echo chambers.

591
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,520
You believe what you want to believe.

592
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,080
But there is such a thing as truth,

593
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,600
but it's not simple.

594
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,160
And people want simple.

595
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,460
They really want simple.

596
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,700
And when you're simple, it doesn't matter.

597
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,200
When you're down, it's not truth anymore.

598
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,120
Truth is complicated.

599
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,860
It's like slack versus false slack.

600
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,860
Sure, you can say,

601
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,920
well, false slack, well, I know I'm not getting real slack,

602
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,000
but I got lots of false slack,

603
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,120
and false slack's better than no slack at all.

604
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:11,000
No! False slack is no slack at all!

605
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,560
And when you say,

606
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,360
well, these are just alternate facts.

607
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,680
No! Alternate facts are no slack at all!

608
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,960
No facts at all!

609
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:25,960
There are such things as correct and incorrect.

610
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,600
I didn't say right and wrong.

611
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:33,660
Those are human conceits that will change from person to person.

612
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,200
But some things can be measured.

613
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,240
But my friend across the dinner table from me,

614
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,860
he couldn't get over me saying,

615
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,360
the stupid ones won this time, just face it.

616
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,360
They were tired of the black president and woman bosses.

617
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,340
That's what it boiled down to.

618
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,940
Well, later that night,

619
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,700
because we were in the same motel room,

620
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,780
my friend started in on the same lines

621
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,060
I've been hearing for 20 years.

622
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,540
But in the 70s, this Pauli A. guy,

623
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,620
he wrote this book that said global cooling

624
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,380
was going to destroy the world in 10 years.

625
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,260
Science is wrong! Science is always wrong!

626
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,120
They're always having to correct themselves.

627
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,720
Yeah! That's the general idea about science!

628
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,940
That's why it's not a religion!

629
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,440
They're constantly admitting they're wrong.

630
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,280
Of course, it's slow,

631
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,680
because scientists live a long time,

632
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,040
and they cling to their ideas,

633
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,300
and they have egos just like everybody else.

634
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,380
But yeah, that is the general idea.

635
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,040
They find out they're wrong, and then they admit it!

636
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,120
Good God!

637
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,100
Oops.

638
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,580
Anyway, oh God, I saw,

639
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,320
trying to watch a video today,

640
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,300
it was coming in too slow because of the Wi-Fi.

641
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:51,180
It was a Christian creation science video.

642
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,260
And I couldn't watch it, but I read the description.

643
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,180
It said,

644
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:03,320
dinosaurs aren't real because fossils are just rocks.

645
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,580
They're not really bones.

646
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,320
I didn't care about that part.

647
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,080
She couldn't even spell dinosaurs!

648
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,340
It was spelled like a sore on your arm!

649
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,180
Thunder!

650
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,280
Thunder!

651
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,300
Thunder soars!

652
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:16,820
God!

653
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,940
Okay, here's another funny thing.

654
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,540
Racism!

655
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,780
All of a sudden,

656
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,080
whoa, it's just cool to be a racist again!

657
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,860
At least on the internet,

658
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,100
where you're still anonymous,

659
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,160
and a whole lot of big old brave white boys

660
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,480
get together on the internet with fake names to be racist.

661
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,380
Racism, of course, is a loser's excuse for being a loser.

662
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,280
I personally think loser is a name.

663
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,060
It's a nasty word.

664
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,460
We're all losers.

665
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,940
We're all gonna die, every single one of us.

666
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,600
Some of us know how to make our way through this short life

667
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,520
and be graceful losers.

668
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,620
Racists are just the very bad losers.

669
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,360
They've gotta have something to blame it on.

670
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,680
Oh, but Stang,

671
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,700
you're an elite in an ivory tower.

672
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:22,820
Yeah, and I'm also a gun-owning small business owner

673
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:26,880
who lives on a goat ranch in rural Texas.

674
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:33,060
I have, I'm an elite, all right, yeah.

675
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,000
I read a couple of nonfiction books a month at least,

676
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,140
preferably every week.

677
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,000
I've been to China,

678
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,240
and Africa, working, not just as a tourist,

679
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,720
all over Europe, and really all over the United States.

680
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,440
I lived for 25 years in a low-income,

681
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,920
mostly Mexican neighborhood in Dallas,

682
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,220
and in the last 20 years I've lived in a mostly black neighborhood

683
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,860
that is middle class,

684
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,580
and is in fact the, probably the safest,

685
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,820
most welcoming neighborhood I've ever lived in.

686
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,140
Not everybody's black.

687
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,540
There's also a lot of artists,

688
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,500
Hasidic Jews,

689
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,320
queers of every stripe,

690
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,380
Russians,

691
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,520
just, for some reason,

692
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,440
unlike the way they describe it on the internet,

693
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,720
everybody gets along fine.

694
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,520
The people in small town Texas

695
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,520
read about the big city crime,

696
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,540
and they think, oh, big people in big city are also unfriendly,

697
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,260
and oh, the Muslims are gonna take over,

698
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,520
and oh, it's just, we've got to do this,

699
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:40,680
we better,

700
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,660
and meanwhile, the people in the big city are just going,

701
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,760
including me,

702
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,820
for a long time,

703
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,340
are going, oh my God, the Texas state government,

704
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,020
Jesus, I could never live there.

705
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,180
They're insane.

706
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,060
And they just passed this open carry law,

707
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,200
so they're all gunslingers now.

708
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,220
Well, all of those are stereotypes.

709
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,380
They did pass open carry law in Texas,

710
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,380
and nothing happened,

711
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,660
because everybody was already packing,

712
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,200
they always had been,

713
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,320
they just didn't have to brag about it.

714
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,680
The only ones that had to brag about it

715
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,820
are the scared dumb shits.

716
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,940
My brother and sister and I,

717
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,740
after the open carry thing was passed,

718
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,860
a month later, we discussed it,

719
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,760
and among the three of us,

720
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,000
we had seen one person

721
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,120
toting her six gun out on her hip,

722
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,820
and it was an old lady.

723
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,740
Most of the stores had signs up that said,

724
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,420
please don't carry your open carry weapon in here,

725
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,820
it makes people nervous.

726
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,800
And no one did,

727
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,840
because like I say,

728
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,840
in a rural area,

729
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,560
yeah, most people are packing.

730
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,360
I need to get a pistol myself,

731
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,600
because of rattlesnakes.

732
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,540
But yeah, it works both ways.

733
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,160
Most of those people in small towns,

734
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,400
they're not ignorant,

735
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,520
they're not all ignorant,

736
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,860
and they really are really friendly.

737
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,960
They might be a little standoffish

738
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,120
if you had a hope and change button on,

739
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,440
but we've got to be good friends with our neighbors.

740
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,220
And the reason they don't like Trump

741
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,080
is because they like Ted Cruz better.

742
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,720
So, you know, go figure.

743
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,320
Anyway, my point is the internet backfired.

744
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,940
It spreads simple lies so much faster

745
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,780
than complex truths.

746
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,220
I used to think TV was worse,

747
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,500
but it's not really,

748
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,480
because TV is still somewhat controlled

749
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,200
on the internet.

750
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,940
No matter what idiotic, hateful thing you want to believe,

751
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,860
you can find a million other people instantly

752
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,200
with plenty of proof of it.

753
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,360
So, yeah.

754
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,040
We're going to need a bigger lie.

755
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,120
A bigger big lie, I guess,

756
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,740
if we're going to fight fire with fire.

757
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,520
I've never seen anything this dumb,

758
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,260
but I've seen so many extremely dumb things happen,

759
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,420
I'm not a bit surprised

760
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,600
that things could get dumber.

761
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,540
Think of those poor Jews

762
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,260
in late 1930s Germany going,

763
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,440
oh, that guy's a clown.

764
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,500
He's not, nobody takes that crap seriously.

765
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,440
What's going to happen?

766
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,540
And that was one of the most civilized,

767
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,380
knowledgeable countries on the planet Earth.

768
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,240
Possibly more so than this one.

769
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,420
It can happen here.

770
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,060
And I'm sorry I'm not being funny,

771
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:49,300
but we can't go quietly into that dark night of tax returns.

772
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,400
We've got to rebel, rouse, and shout like hell

773
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,740
before we get Stockholm Syndrome.

774
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,640
You know, where you're taken hostage

775
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,140
and you can't handle the fear and the humiliation.

776
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,980
So you automatically start to love your captors.

777
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,080
Oh, there were so many clues.

778
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,000
They were right in front of us.

779
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,900
For instance, Kellyanne Conway,

780
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,000
the first woman to run a successful presidential campaign.

781
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,260
But look at her name.

782
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,700
Conway.

783
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,640
The conspiracy hiding in plain sight.

784
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,940
And then there was Hillary,

785
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,960
one of the lizard aliens,

786
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,080
bragging openly about how she was going to expose

787
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,580
the gray alien UFO conspiracy.

788
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,700
They had to replace her with one of their own puppets.

789
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:41,700
It's all part of the Grays versus the Lizards secret alien overlord mob war.

790
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,460
And it's all in subgenius prophecy.

791
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,280
You can read about this crap in a 1983 book

792
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,120
with the word humor on the back cover.

793
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,880
Telling the librarian where to put it.

794
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,040
And we've been trying to look at the bright side.

795
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,700
I told my friend Reverend Pease,

796
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,720
oh, we'll keep doing the hour of slack radio show,

797
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,760
even from the concentration camps.

798
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,060
He said, oh, we call those patriot camps.

799
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,200
Reverend Stang.

800
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,800
They're not going to be that bad.

801
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,040
We'll get snacks.

802
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:16,540
But more likely they'll be called Trump Towers, I think.

803
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,420
Prisons and public housing will be merged

804
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,720
and just all called Trump Towers.

805
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,000
And people who score low in citizen points

806
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,840
by not turning in enough of their fellow citizens

807
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,980
for treason or pot smoking

808
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,420
will have to pay much higher rent

809
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,020
than those with good American scores,

810
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,040
especially the Trump-U.S.

811
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,320
youth who report on college radio stations

812
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,340
that break the new patriotism rules.

813
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,600
You know, if you criticize the government,

814
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,440
that's exactly the same as terrorism

815
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,280
and it's going to have the same penalties,

816
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,700
hanging or else having to work at Trump Stop

817
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,740
for the rest of your life.

818
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,460
Everybody will be...

819
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,320
By the way, the policy I just described

820
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,460
is happening in China right now.

821
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,940
Everybody will want to be a good American

822
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,380
just like those good Germans we all heard about.

823
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,640
Again, I'm not worried.

824
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,500
I'm one of the elites...

825
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:09,840
Well...

826
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,780
I am worried.

827
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,520
We had a hope.

828
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,600
Right after the election,

829
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,040
like a lot of people,

830
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,840
I felt like I'd been...

831
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,040
I knew it could happen

832
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,880
because I had been living in the bubble

833
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,980
and I knew that people who had never voted

834
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:27,740
in their whole lives

835
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,440
were going to vote for the first time.

836
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,000
And a lot of people who probably would have voted

837
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
went, no, I don't like what she did to Bernie,

838
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,940
so I'm just...

839
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:37,640
Well...

840
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,960
The hope was...

841
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,400
Maybe...

842
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,400
Maybe Trump's really a closet surrealist

843
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,360
like that comedian, Andy Kaufman.

844
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,940
You know, he said years ago

845
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,460
that if he was going to run for president

846
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,540
he'd do it as a Republican

847
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,100
because as he put it,

848
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,700
they're so easy to fool.

849
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,260
And so we got to thinking,

850
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,060
maybe his whole plan was to convince the deplorables

851
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,420
that he was really just one of them,

852
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,780
a rich real estate developer,

853
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,700
and then once he got in,

854
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,040
totally blow their minds.

855
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,580
With really cool surrealist laws like

856
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:15,220
all dogs must wear top hats and little bow ties.

857
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:21,100
Or car tires shall henceforth be made of titanium steel

858
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,200
but the rest of the car shall be made of rubber.

859
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:29,980
Daylight savings time shall be held on alternating days.

860
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,100
Free Adderall for redheads.

861
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,020
Christmas every month.

862
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,020
Only Christians will have access to pornography

863
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,960
or death metal.

864
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,440
Every tenth jack in the box

865
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,100
will be armed with explosives.

866
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,780
Vaccinations will be available by lottery

867
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,760
but will be required for those chosen randomly.

868
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,400
If global warming continues,

869
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,400
we will build a wall around the earth

870
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,360
and make God pay for it.

871
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,520
All subgeniuses must wear collars with bells on them.

872
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,660
No farting except by heads of state.

873
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,040
All diapers shall be small confederate battle flags

874
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,020
but with Pokemon characters added.

875
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,400
And North and South Korea will be deported

876
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,220
to opposite sides of the moon

877
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,980
with the North Koreans facing away.

878
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,920
So, uh,

879
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,660
but that didn't, that would have been kind of cool.

880
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:42,560
Then I could agree, yeah, he's an agent of chaos.

881
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:48,300
But that is turning out to be just the opposite.

882
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,960
And I only have ten more minutes

883
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,420
and I have to get out of here

884
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,100
because the incoming bans are complicated.

885
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,000
Like the truth.

886
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,860
But I do have a couple of statements

887
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:09,240
that some subgeniuses who are feeling a little funnier

888
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,880
than I was about all this said

889
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,280
that I collected off the internet.

890
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,860
The very young guy, Dr. Shogoth, said,

891
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,480
uh,

892
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,240
friends, loved ones, and country folks,

893
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,140
you can't hashtag your way out of this.

894
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,360
Donald Trump is your president.

895
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,580
That's democracy.

896
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,380
You can't protest an election away.

897
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,140
Put down your hashtags.

898
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,240
Shit is gonna get weird.

899
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,340
We've been through weird.

900
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,500
We've been training all our lives, dear mutants,

901
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,380
to resist and uphold our integrity

902
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:45,700
against a society that increasingly insists on conformity.

903
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:49,540
We are the faithful who have trained for this exact moment.

904
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,500
This is not the time to panic and give in to despair.

905
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,860
This is what all of our conversations led to.

906
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,980
Like the spring of love and hate and weirdness

907
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,300
and wits were made for.

908
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,000
We can come out of this shit better than when we went into it.

909
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,980
This situation was made by chaos,

910
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,240
and we know chaos.

911
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,460
This is a medium we can work in.

912
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,680
And our enemies were fools for handing this to us.

913
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,360
Stay strong, chippies.

914
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,180
When the going gets weird,

915
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,660
the weird turn pro.

916
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,180
Or kill me.

917
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,380
Another friend of mine,

918
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,840
G. Gordon Gordon,

919
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:29,260
who moved to Portugal after the election,

920
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,700
said, I know a lot of my Yeti kin are totally bummed.

921
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,980
But look at it this way.

922
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,580
The ones who have the most invested in the system

923
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,580
will suffer the most when shite heel wrecks it.

924
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,680
They'll be the pinks.

925
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,220
So lean back, light up, and enjoy the circus.

926
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,580
After all, we still have slack.

927
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,820
We and we alone will prevail.

928
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,680
And we've never believed in all that government bullshite anyway.

929
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,120
And there are more places for you to buy frop or grow it legally.

930
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,680
I hope.

931
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:02,480
And when the Trumpkins find out they've been conned

932
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,740
because shite heel can't possibly give them all the things they want,

933
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,260
the fun will be even bigger.

934
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,760
And this Norwegian said,

935
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,860
our betters up at the castle,

936
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,180
who have spent the past 60 years wishing they could order summary execution

937
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,300
of anyone who even looks funny

938
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,840
at the unholy first-use nuclear alliance,

939
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,740
are severely embarrassed.

940
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,920
And freaking the fuck out.

941
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,600
I do not like the phrases,

942
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,100
freaking the fuck out,

943
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,600
and first-use nuclear alliance,

944
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,080
to apply to anywhere on the same planet as me.

945
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,460
Thank you very much.

946
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:53,220
And this last one by the good Reverend Roger.

947
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,800
I read a rant by him last Starwood.

948
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,640
And this one's funny too.

949
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,680
I have no ass and I must shit,

950
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,140
is the name of it.

951
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,340
By the good Reverend Roger.

952
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,660
For the first time in my long and wretched life,

953
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:13,760
I'm stumped.

954
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,300
I'm watching the rolling dumpster fire

955
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,800
that is the Trump administration,

956
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,840
and I can't rant about it,

957
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,620
because I don't know where to start.

958
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,860
There are so many things to bray laughter at

959
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,860
that I keep starting to spout,

960
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,100
but then something else comes along and I get derailed.

961
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,460
Now, I normally do not rant,

962
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,920
I do not soil myself with human politics,

963
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,180
but it's impossible to avoid this time around.

964
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,120
The moment you turn on the TV or the internet,

965
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,380
an avalanche of raw sewage pours out

966
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,540
and ruins the carpet.

967
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,080
It's like a production line making assholes,

968
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,720
one right after another,

969
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,440
and there's no getting away from it.

970
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,340
So I've stopped trying,

971
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:57,020
and so I'm going to do my part

972
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,000
to push this bad puppy right off the cliff.

973
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,440
This is not a time to get mad.

974
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,440
I'm going to keep a straight face,

975
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,480
and life is going to be very, very hard

976
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,020
on those who are not serious about having a good time.

977
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,440
And I plan on having a very good time indeed.

978
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,600
Who can blame me?

979
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,420
Actual no-bullshit Nazis

980
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,360
are coming out of the woodwork

981
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,180
thinking their day has come.

982
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,800
The hills are alive with the sound of hayseeds

983
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,840
and Klan members screeching

984
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,100
and touching themselves in triumph.

985
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,860
But the funny thing is,

986
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,380
even though their guy won,

987
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,000
nothing is working out for him.

988
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,120
The Senate is a tangled mess,

989
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:43,240
the courts are publicly urinating on executive orders,

990
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,280
and the people who voted for Trump

991
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,480
are devouring themselves,

992
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,340
spitting out bits of their own skin

993
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,820
as they proclaim that America is going to be great again.

994
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,040
It is.

995
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,460
You just watch.

996
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,340
Never mind that people in Kentucky

997
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,600
don't look happy at their victory,

998
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,000
or, well,

999
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:01,720
West Virginia,

1000
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,440
or the suddenly impoverished cattle kings

1001
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,020
in Texas and New Mexico.

1002
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,380
Never mind that some po-buckers

1003
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:12,500
are starting to mumble about their health care

1004
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,500
as if they suddenly realize

1005
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,220
that all the things Trump said

1006
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,200
apply to them too,

1007
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,660
and this is real.

1008
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:26,640
Not just showing those liberals a thing or two.

1009
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,400
Richard Spencer got a flying elbow to the jaw

1010
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,400
and the alt-right started asking

1011
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,960
where the liberal tolerance went.

1012
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,820
But we were all too busy laughing to listen.

1013
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,860
A long time ago,

1014
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,900
a few crusty old subgeniuses talked about,

1015
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:44,540
quote,

1016
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,420
the coming weird times.

1017
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,160
Well, those times are here now,

1018
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,160
and they're going to get a lot weirder.

1019
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,520
I'm okay with that.

1020
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:54,620
I'm on the crazy train with the primates

1021
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,060
making choo-choo noises

1022
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,240
while the boiler overheats,

1023
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,660
and I wouldn't trade it

1024
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,320
for anything.

1025
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,360
Well, almost anything.

1026
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,440
I'd kind of like my aging parents

1027
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,600
to have health insurance

1028
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,020
and all that good stuff,

1029
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,860
but since that isn't going to happen,

1030
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,700
why not roll the stake down the stairs

1031
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,060
just to hear it crash?

1032
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,940
I've become an unrepentant wrecker,

1033
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,620
and I make no apologies for it.

1034
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,940
This is, after all,

1035
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:24,540
what 61 million people demanded,

1036
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:29,260
they being the idiotic hominids that they are,

1037
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,140
wanted an administration

1038
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:35,180
that would pay attention to them.

1039
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,820
Be careful what you wish for,

1040
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,880
stupid humans.

1041
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,640
This is exactly why you can't have nice things.

1042
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,940
But you and I, we're yeti.

1043
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,160
We're subgeniuses,

1044
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,480
and we will not be governed.

1045
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,960
We wobble.

1046
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,600
We oscillate.

1047
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,200
When you crush us in the fist of the stake,

1048
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,860
we just sort of ooze out between its fingers

1049
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,740
and dance off down the street,

1050
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,880
laughing and happy-slapping passing poe-buckers.

1051
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,060
They may have two million people under arms

1052
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:10,620
and twice that many police,

1053
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,620
but we have bomb!

1054
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,540
They may have the banks.

1055
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,340
We have slack.

1056
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,780
They may have 12 aircraft carriers,

1057
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,800
but we have Dr. Legume and G. Gordon Gordon,

1058
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,500
even if they had to leave the country

1059
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,660
for reasons best left unspoken.

1060
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,380
Orton and Nenslow once said that

1061
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,740
if you, quote,

1062
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,120
freak the mundanes, unquote,

1063
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,780
they'll find ways to make sure you'll wish you were never born.

1064
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,720
But they're doing that anyway,

1065
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,900
so why not take them with us?

1066
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,560
Why not skip merrily along into the apocalypse

1067
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,760
with your pants full of shit

1068
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,120
and a stupid grin on your face?

1069
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,420
Anyway, that's why I can't rant anymore

1070
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,320
or kill me,

1071
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,940
says the good Reverend Roger.

1072
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,380
Notice that's two rants by subgeniuses

1073
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,420
that ended with the line,

1074
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,680
or kill me.

1075
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,820
And I'm going to end this

1076
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:16,400
having not told you anything at all

1077
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,160
about the Church of the Subgenius.

1078
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,360
You don't want to know.

1079
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,020
Oh, you don't want to know.

1080
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:25,140
The last thing you want to do is spend that 35 bucks

1081
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,040
and become a minister

1082
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,840
and be able to go to the secret websites.

1083
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,840
Oh, you don't want to do that.

1084
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:38,700
I do have a couple of new quotes.

1085
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,660
And they're actually not Bob quotes,

1086
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,540
they're all me quotes.

1087
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,600
Here's the first one.

1088
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,360
If I don't already know about it,

1089
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,320
then it isn't cool enough for me to know about.

1090
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,380
Boy, that one pisses people off.

1091
00:55:59,040 --> 00:55:59,880
Aging.

1092
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,260
It's just like turning into the Wolfman,

1093
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,880
only it's the mummy you're transforming into

1094
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,500
every full noon.

1095
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,280
And then the last one is,

1096
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:18,020
inside this confident-seeming skinny old hippie

1097
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:21,940
is an incredibly insecure fat nerd

1098
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,820
screaming to get out.

1099
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:27,660
That probably describes a whole lot of my friends, too.

1100
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,240
And with that, friends, I must say,

1101
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,180
thank you for coming to another Starwood.

1102
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:38,280
We'll be here again next year

1103
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,800
unless the new subgenius prophecy works out

1104
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:46,760
and the world ends on 5-7 instead of 7-5.

1105
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,520
Apparently the 1998 was a phone number.

1106
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,020
We'll figure it out.

1107
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:54,620
But we'll still be waiting for the saucers at Wisteria.

1108
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,300
And, um, and...

1109
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,360
Price Bob...

1110
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,000
Well, we can't do the Q&A.

1111
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,380
There's usually a Q&A,

1112
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,040
and usually I go through this thing

1113
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,240
and read funny workshop titles,

1114
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,900
but they weren't all that funny

1115
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,160
except this one that was early on,

1116
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,140
honoring the sacred Yoni.

1117
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,480
Oh, just walk up and grab him!

1118
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:22,720
Yeah.

1119
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,660
So, uh, thank you, friends,

1120
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,460
and our sales table is over there.

1121
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:30,960
There will be a Q&A at the sales table,

1122
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,000
but every answer will end with the phrase,

1123
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,880
only one dollar.

1124
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,100
Thank you and praise Bob.

1125
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1126
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,400
Good.

1127
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,920
Hey, hey, hey, applaud again.

1128
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,960
I want to get a shot of that.

1129
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,400
Yeah, praise Bob!

1130
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:52,860
Yeah!

1131
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,100
Oh, ho, ho!

1132
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,100
This is the way they were the whole time!

1133
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:00,320
Cut.

1134
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,340
Okay, that's enough, enough.

1135
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,380
That's a wrap.

1136
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,600
57 minutes, just right.

1137
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:14,400
You've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1138
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,060

1139

1142
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,360
Praise Bob!

1143
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,200
It's an unfashionable belief in the atheist community,

1144
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,800
but truth just needs to be stated.

1145
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,460
It doesn't have to be hyped.

1146
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,460
I know.

1147
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,660
I do a lot of hyping of atheism.

1148
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,040
But remember what Bob Dobbs said,

1149
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:56,400
I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to.

1150
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,460
There is no God, and that's a simple truth.

1151
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:04,840
If every trace of any single religion were wiped out and nothing were passed on,

1152
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,760
it would never be created exactly that way again.

1153
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,180
There might be some other nonsense in its place,

1154
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,720
but not that exact nonsense.

1155
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,280
If all of science were wiped out,

1156
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,400
it would still be true,

1157
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,180
and someone would find a way to figure it all out again.
