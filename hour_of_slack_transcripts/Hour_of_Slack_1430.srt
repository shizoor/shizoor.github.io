1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Let's go to the gigolo club over in Yancey.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,180
They got a...

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,260
Some genius powerhouse watching.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,140
I say this calls for action, and now, nip it in the bud.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,140
Ah, shut up.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,780
Yes.

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,300
We often have pop guards and spit guards, but now we're doing radio in the raw.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,540
Yes.

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,040
Sitting here.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,380
Shivering.

11
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,240
I can see that you are shivering.

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,380
Do you want something?

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,740
They want some garment to put on.

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,120
You want a little chili?

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,980
I've got a can of chili, and I really seriously do.

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,100
I always have a can of chili at the ready when we're here at Wisteria Campground.

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,000
Not that we have to have the can of chili, because we're sitting in the cafe, and we

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,480
could go over there and buy lunch.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,940
And I should have done that a little while ago.

20
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,340
Oh, where's my script?

21
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,600
Ah.

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,300
Once again, the visible show.

23
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:08,600
We have an audience of five people, the only ones who forgot that this will all be...

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,280
They'll be able to download and hear all this stuff later.

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,480
To download when one is down in hell.

26
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,220
Yeah.

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,900
Well, we won't have to worry about that anymore, will we, Dr. Howell?

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,100
Yeah, we recommend those Niels Stevenson books, the Quicksilver trilogy.

29
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,360
Well, I found a section in this that I was going to...

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,540
I was going to read, but I don't want to do that when I've got fellow spouters here.

31
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,220
See, that's for when no one is here but me.

32
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:38,740
Well, that's very handsome.

33
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:45,120
Just reading to myself out loud, making a lonely, lonely one-man, one-listener show.

34
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,500
It's Niels Stevenson's Quicksilver, the first of his Baroque cycle trilogy.

35
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,580
Baroque cycle.

36
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,680
It's three fat books, of which that is one.

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,640
And they're all about Isaac Newton.

38
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,900
And many interesting people.

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,060
Yeah, it's like the awkward invention of science in general.

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,340
But they're amazing characters, like Jack the Robber King.

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
It's quite a fat book.

42
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,120
Yes, it is a great book.

43
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,440
They're wonderful characters, wonderful adventures in it.

44
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,560
All one could ask for a book.

45
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,260
From a book.

46
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,800
Nuh-uh.

47
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,580
He doesn't have pictures.

48
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,700
Well, one must provide the pictures.

49
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,940
Therein the patient must minister.

50
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:28,680
To himself.

51
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,640
Word pictures.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,140
Actually, I did find one illustration in it, which appears to be a copy of a drawing of

53
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,700
a flea by Robert Hooke.

54
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,940
Ah, yes.

55
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,360
The microscope was just coming into its own.

56
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,080
Yes.

57
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,840
Anthony van Leeuwenhoek.

58
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,200
My hero.

59
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,820
Grinder of lenses.

60
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:58,360
So we've just been down at the baptism and we have made those who are beginning to read

61
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,360


62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,140
beginning to show an effusion of pinkness reduced to pure subgenius essence.

63
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,860
That was my first baptism.

64
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,700
Yes, and you did nobly, too.

65
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,980
Yes, you did very well.

66
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,500
She really did.

67
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,600
Well, you know, she didn't drown.

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,040
We get these people that just, you put them down in the water,

69
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,000
and they don't have the sense to come back out,

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,660
because they're true subgeniuses.

71
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,640
Yes, and they continually dangle their pink toes

72
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,360
over the impatient beak of old sequoia until it's too late to retrieve them.

73
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,740
I was planning on plugging my nose anyway,

74
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,440
so I was glad that you were recommending it,

75
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,420
because then I didn't have to be embarrassed about it.

76
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,540
No, we recommend that everyone keep from snorting the brain-eating amoebas

77
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,800
for a more healthful X-Day.

78
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,580
There would not be much to eat.

79
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,780
But you saw other creatures in the pond besides subgenius ones.

80
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,600
What did you see?

81
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,520
Oh, yes, indeed.

82
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,980
Very large stick bugs and...

83
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,980
Stick insects.

84
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,460
Various stages of the frog metamorphosis.

85
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,720
How about the amphibia?

86
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,080
I didn't see any...

87
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,200
She just mentioned them.

88
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,000
I didn't see any newts this time, though.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,980
Yeah, I meant the newts.

90
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,100
I meant newts, axolotls, and salamanders.

91
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,980
I didn't see any.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,900
Last time I saw the little ones with the spotted orange backs.

93
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,320
Did you read?

94
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,920
Did you read my essay about the giant stick insects of Ball's Pyramid Island?

95
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,620
The tree lobsters, yes.

96
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,180
The tree lobsters, as they are called?

97
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,260
Yeah, that was like a great lost world.

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,640
Kind of a lost continent of monsters.

99
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,000
Did you see the picture of the island?

100
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,900
I should send you a picture of the island.

101
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,020
Some youths, when shown it, sniff and say,

102
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,540
Photoshop.

103
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,280
No, this incredible island actually does exist.

104
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,600
Yes, friends.

105
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,020
Did you see it?

106
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,160
It's hard to believe, but sometimes nature beats Photoshop.

107
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,100
Oh, it's very cool.

108
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,520
Yep.

109
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,060
What's interesting about this island is,

110
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,360
imagine a thousand feet of rock coming to a point,

111
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,680
coming up out of the ocean.

112
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,300
A thousand feet of rock, which are thin in cross-section,

113
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,140
so it's like a giant arrowhead.

114
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,880
And it arises out of the Tasman Sea off the Australian coast,

115
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,540
although the area is administered by New Zealand.

116
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,740
It does definitely look like something from a fantasy novel.

117
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,320
I could see how people would be...

118
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,120
Oh, it looks like something.

119
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,960
...wouldn't believe it.

120
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,100
Willis O'Brien or somebody came...

121
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,320
It's got monsters on it, too.

122
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,720
It does.

123
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,660
That's the wonderful thing about it.

124
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,080
And now science is making sure that those monsters will survive.

125
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,820
I'm surprised the rats were able to take them out,

126
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,300
because they're so large.

127
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,020
They're large, but they're helpless and trundling,

128
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,240
big, peaceful insects that may be vegetarian for all their giantism,

129
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,700
but they were no match for the black rats, which came ashore,

130
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,440
on their former home, what was it, Lord Howe's Island,

131
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,160
when a British freighter crashed there,

132
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,720
and the rats killed the native population of giant stick insects,

133
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,520
or tree lobsters, as the natives called them.

134
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,320
Rats are almost as bad as humans in that respect.

135
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,980
Recent scientific inquiry has determined that when you tickle rats, they laugh.

136
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:21,680
What?

137
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,180
Yes, they laugh when you tickle them.

138
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,780
What?

139
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,900
That means they have souls.

140
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:26,840
Yes.

141
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,500
That means I'm guilty of murder.

142
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,360
Yes.

143
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,900
With a shovel.

144
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,480
I mean, other kinds of murder, besides the other ones.

145
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:33,800
Yeah.

146
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,540
My dad and I also had to kill rats at times.

147
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,500
But there you go.

148
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:44,640
And I had a girlfriend who used to put the rats in her terrarium for her pet snakes.

149
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,820
I thought that was going to go somewhere else for a second.

150
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,900
No, no, no, no.

151
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,500
Well, she may have.

152
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:49,820
Those are gerbils.

153
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,920
You're thinking of gerbils.

154
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,560
There was one case that someone put an eel up there,

155
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,680
and the eel ate his colon.

156
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,780
Not an electric eel, I hope.

157
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,500
Oh, it's true.

158
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,180
I swear.

159
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,780
People put all kinds of things up there.

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,620
Well, that changes the whole nature of my day.

161
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,840
Afterwards, he had a descending semicolon.

162
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,260
Dr. Legume.

163
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,420
Good morrow.

164
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,520
Now Legume is among us.

165
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,580
Things are going to get lively.

166
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,760
Rats also have signs of empathy.

167
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:31,900
They've done tests where the rat can choose whether to feed just itself

168
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,640
or to also provide food for another rat.

169
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,460
And given the choice, it will always provide food for the other rat as well.

170
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,680
Yes, they have the basis of a communal organization.

171
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,500
So now all the testing that we've done is...

172
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:44,500


173
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,160
Rats are leftists.

174
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,360
That's what Mr. Sistar would say.

175
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,760
But even the giant stick insects of Ball's Pyramid,

176
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,900
tried to protect each other when scientists showed up

177
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,780
and started scooping up specimens.

178
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,640
The males would throw their legs over the females

179
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,160
and put their bodies over them to try to protect them.

180
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,740
Of course, it didn't work since you can't stop science.

181
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,000
Well, so the question that raises is,

182
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,440
when the ATF shows up here in an hour,

183
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,920
will we help each other hide stashes and so forth

184
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,660
and put on disguises?

185
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,980
Or will we just flee?

186
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,760
Will it be every subgenius for itself?

187
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,280
A disturbed subgenius anthill

188
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,840
with subgeniuses running in every direction.

189
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,300
All of them going, who's the queen?

190
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:37,900
Who's the queen?

191
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,320
Carrying that Bob dummy around.

192
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,080
Yes.

193
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,040
Trying to protect it.

194
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,300
Well, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

195
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,960
You know, one good thing about the church is

196
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,980
it tells you how to think on your feet by George.

197
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,180
It does?

198
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,900
Boy, I must have missed that lesson.

199
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,540
Yeah, I'm not...

200
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:54,720
Yes.

201
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,940
I'm not getting that lesson so well.

202
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,780
It teaches you to be able to...

203
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,760
I do okay on my butt.

204
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,220
...roll with the punches and get your sea legs

205
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,920
in a violently pitching, tossing world.

206
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,180
That's the idea.

207
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,660
This music in the background by Chaz Smith

208
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,220
and Einstein's secret orchestra...

209
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,300
Now even I can hear the music.

210
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,760
And as I look out on this assembly,

211
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,580
I see some out there who were at the baptism

212
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,020
and were purified and are now newly washed unto Bob.

213
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,480
And thankfully have their clothing back on.

214
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,680
You can...

215
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,020
In some cases...

216
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,800
There was a couple of ripped fellows down there.

217
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,240
Sure, not all subgeniuses are huge,

218
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,680
shambling mounds of protoplasm.

219
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,280
No.

220
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,080
Only most of them.

221
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,200
And there were, of course, several skeletal young fellows.

222
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,060
They yet have to fill out and enjoy life.

223
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,340
I've certainly managed to do that.

224
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,920
Yes, it's true.

225
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,300
There is such a thing as slack.

226
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,420
For a long time, I wasn't really sure.

227
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,380
And I was kind of defensive.

228
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,040
Of course there's slack.

229
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,080
I don't have it.

230
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,580
But I know that it's there.

231
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,140
It must exist.

232
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,060
But I can definitely vouch that if you're lucky

233
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,880
and keep your mind focused on the FIB,

234
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,840
then you will eventually get slack.

235
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,160
Even if you only get one minute of it

236
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,600
at the end of your 70-year life of torture,

237
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,220
that one minute justifies...

238
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,440
Yes.

239
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,740
...the rest of it completely.

240
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,560
Well, you see, if you put on a subgenius event,

241
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,400
the show host syndrome that you have

242
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,960
expands to gobble up every ounce of free slack

243
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,940
that you may have.

244
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,400
Well, then, because of that,

245
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,160
I was always sure to have a nervous breakdown

246
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,960
on Saturday night at X Day.

247
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,240
But now the torment and...

248
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, the responsibilities are divided

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,160
between several slacker subgeniuses.

250
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,000
So there's like five or six of us

251
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,500
not getting anything done,

252
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,660
which spreads the stress a lot better.

253
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,560
Should I get us some coffee, Stan?

254
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:00,940
I have fun.

255
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,540
I would love to have some coffee.

256
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,960
Yeah, I need coffee.

257
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,280
In fact, I'll even...

258
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,100
Here, get this.

259
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,700
I'll even spring for it, man.

260
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,080
Wow.

261
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,140
I was gonna.

262
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,660
Yeah.

263
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,580
There you go.

264
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,880
All right, free coffee.

265
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,840
That's on Bob.

266
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,620
See, at this Tarzan's radio station,

267
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,680
unlike WCSB, KPFA, WRK, any of those noble places,

268
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:23,700
has...

269
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,360
Food.

270
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,180
We can eat and drink.

271
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:27,880
Huh?

272
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,020
Just cream.

273
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,260
Or milk.

274
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,040
Milk.

275
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,020
And the reason I put milk in my coffee

276
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,540
is because back when I was a superstitious young person

277
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,060
learning about New Age and UFOs and paranormal gobbledygook,

278
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,980
I read Edgar Cayce said that you should always put milk

279
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,400
in your coffee to save your stomach light.

280
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,920
I figured, well,

281
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,980
if Edgar Cayce said that,

282
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,700
I better pick up on it.

283
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,780
Because he, you know,

284
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,980
he was doing miracle diagnoses.

285
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,340
And I knew people who knew people who knew doctors

286
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,340
that had sworn by him.

287
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,800
So it must have been true.

288
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:08,820
However,

289
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,320
Something will always get you, though.

290
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,080
You can't protect yourself.

291
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,160
I was reading through one of those Edgar Cayce stories

292
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,700
or books and thinking,

293
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,820
wow, this is all...

294
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,080
I was very young and stupid.

295
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,620
Impressionable.

296
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,180
Yeah.

297
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,480
Yeah.

298
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,440
And, uh,

299
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,600
I was reading about the

300
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,300
And suddenly he was talking about Atlantis

301
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:32,100
and how the Atlanteans had this advanced crystal-based nuclear energy

302
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,260
and that they were able to mutate animals into people and vice versa.

303
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,500
And as the more it went on and on,

304
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,600
I realized that George Powell movie,

305
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,720
Atlantis, The Lost Continent,

306
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,400
was written from an Edgar Cayce...

307
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,420
Thank you.

308
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,420
...channeling.

309
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,160
It was all Edgar Cayce,

310
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,320
New Age,

311
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,040
uh,

312
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,200
trance-spouting nonsense.

313
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,960
But it made for a great movie.

314
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,220
Atlantis, The Lost Continent had...

315
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,400
And they had to have, uh,

316
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,180
an obstacle course with lava all around.

317
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,340
And they could actually stand right over the lava

318
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,560
and not be fried instantly.

319
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,040
Yeah.

320
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,500
It was my first exposure.

321
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,080
I was the first exposure to that miracle aspect of lava in movies.

322
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,860
What is that one movie, the,

323
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,680
the volcano erupt, erupting with Pierce Brosnan?

324
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,820
Oh yeah, I never, I haven't seen that.

325
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,520
In the 90s.

326
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:24,980
Dante's Inferno.

327
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,440
Dante's Inferno, thank you.

328
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:26,720
Yeah.

329
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:26,960
Yes.

330
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,780
They, uh, drive over, uh, freshly cooling lava in a SUV.

331
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,220
And the tires are melting and they still make it over it just in time.

332
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,660
That movie is so great.

333
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,920
Well, yeah, I, I, uh, I'm gonna have to see that someday.

334
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,860
In fast forward, most likely.

335
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,640
Yes, there, there are some parts though,

336
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,640
they also have to cross a lake that's boiling with sulfuric acid.

337
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,720
And someone has to sacrifice themselves.

338
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,660
That's Lake Pookaballaponga.

339
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,320
They sacrifice themselves nobly to push the boat across the lake as it's disintegrating.

340
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,680
Wow.

341
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,940
Talk about cooperative endeavor.

342
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,760
Well, in every movie that we've seen like that,

343
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,040
we can bring to life on X Day.

344
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,120
That's right.

345
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:16,000
You can just, uh, rope off any point you want on Earth and raise up a volcano.

346
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,940
Or King Kong's Island.

347
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,100
Say you're, say you got a, you just, you hate your hometown or something like that.

348
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,920
Any monster movie or disaster movie you've seen,

349
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,520
you can inflict them all at once on your hometown.

350
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,500
Just to get that one kid that picked on you that one time.

351
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,460
And boy, is he gonna get it.

352
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,020
And if he's dead, well, well actually in theory, you can get it.

353
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,020


354
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,720
You can bring him back to life and torture him.

355
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:42,760
Yes.

356
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,080
You remember the case of Charles Dexter Ward, you know, uh,

357
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:52,840
Joseph Kirwan brought back dead sorcerers and tortured them to get the information from them.

358
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,240
And of course what he could do, we will be able to do.

359
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,120
Not through his technique of palingenesis, however.

360
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:07,420
I would rather focus less on the torture of the pinks and more on just acquiring all the things that I want.

361
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:07,960
Absolutely.

362
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,300
I will have an entire,

363
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,780
Pokemon world.

364
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,480
I'll have the whole thing.

365
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:12,880
Really?

366
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,780
I'd be satisfied if that was all I had on my pleasure saucer.

367
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,440
Live, actual Pokemon characters.

368
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:17,600
Yes, Pokemon.

369
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,740
That's all I want.

370
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,460
That's my, that would be my number one, top of the list.

371
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,320
If I could only have one thing, it would be that.

372
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,180
And you can have all of those things.

373
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:31,820
Uh, my, of course, needless to say, I'll be hunting monsters like tomorrow afternoon.

374
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,440
So you know, it's, it's similar.

375
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:33,860
Yeah.

376
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,540
Mine's a little more friendly and cooperative and,

377
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,620
Where's Mr. Sister to make fun of all of this stuff?

378
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,600
Socialism.

379
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,420
Yeah, really.

380
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,040
He'll be along.

381
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,400
Um, well, you know, he, that guy acts like a socialist in real life.

382
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,020
I know, he's very pleasant.

383
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,700
Yes, he's generous and, you know, real, real giving.

384
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:03,580
Well, it's funny that no conservative ever died saying, you know, I wish I'd stolen from the poor a little bit more.

385
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,260
I wish I'd been more ruthless.

386
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,080
Are you sure?

387
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,560
No.

388
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:16,680
I mean, it's on their deathbeds that they come out as, as with, as potential, uh, liberals and easygoing, generosity motivated people.

389
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,880
Oh, well, and I'm on my deathbed.

390
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,820
I'm sure I'll renounce Bob and, and, uh, and,

391
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,040
And become a Catholic.

392
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,760
Become a Catholic, just in case.

393
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:32,000
Yes, put the communion wafer on, like Charles the second or even Henry the eighth, the secret Catholic in articulo mortis.

394
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,880
Don't let anyone find that out.

395
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,060
I know that there are so many people on the internet that would love to find out.

396
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,260
But here we're among friends.

397
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,140
That you renounced Bob at the last second.

398
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,760
Oh, well.

399
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,560
Snippets of information.

400
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,480
But Bob wouldn't care.

401
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:42,800
That's the important thing.

402
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,460
You have to be spiteful to them though.

403
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:44,980
It's important.

404
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,680
Bob would not care in the slightest if, if anybody renounced him.

405
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:55,640
I don't think he ever remembers most of the time that anybody is nouncing him in the first place.

406
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,620
You know?

407
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,720
Um, okay.

408
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,860
However, when we renounce the conspiracy and all its works, we make real.

409
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,100
Room for Bob and all his works.

410
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:14,780
And, and when you destroy brain cells, uh, partying too hard at X-Day, you make room for new memories.

411
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,840
Of things that may not have actually even happened at all.

412
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,900
But they will comfortably nestle in your anterior frontal gyrus.

413
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,380
All right, what was it Onan said, um, about Bob?

414
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,060
Didn't you have a special rap by Onan to read?

415
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,780
Yes, I, I did.

416
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,020
I did.

417
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,240
I did.

418
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,660
And I, I, I was planning to do it on the stage.

419
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,560
On the big stage.

420
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,220
Oh, very well.

421
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,120
Very well then.

422
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,320
Um, it was written for me to preach.

423
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,520
It said, it actually says things like, I got this email.

424
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,460
It said, dear I've been stank.

425
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,720
I'm reading this.

426
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,920
You know, it's kind of a strange, I haven't had any, a speech written for me like that.

427
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:01,640
But I, Onan just, you know, I think what, what it was, was he kind of what was half of what

428
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,760
stank says on stage is written by me.

429
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,520
me anyway. I might as well just go ahead and

430
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,320
write him one and show him how to do it right.

431
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,640
Friends, while I

432
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,540
was putting on my socks this morning,

433
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,660
an unusual thought about God

434
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,680
came to me, which I was hoping

435
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,800
to share with you.

436
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,520
Why, they practice to write

437
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,120
themselves, don't they? Yeah.

438
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,640
Yeah. But this show isn't

439
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,580
writing itself, is it? Maybe

440
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,120
I should pull that. Well, it's

441
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,700
coming into being.

442
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,640
Now the Stang folder has been

443
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,340
withdrawn. Folder of rants. Oh, no.

444
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,200
This is all for the Pittsburgh revival.

445
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,760
Happy birthday, Tommy Amoeba.

446
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,260
Hey, how are you doing, Pittsburgh?

447
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,380
Oh, here. I'll tell you what I can

448
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,440
read.

449
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,220
I'm going to be speaking

450
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,240
at the Starwood Festival on my

451
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,220
escape vessel next week. Yes, I

452
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,000
know. They wanted me to

453
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,180
give them a description of what my

454
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,220
workshop, as

455
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,200
they call it, will be. Workshop?

456
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,340
I'll read what I came up with.

457
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:01,940
That's sacrilegious.

458
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:03,700
Workshop.

459
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,240
A crowd of loners.

460
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,240
Paradox or marketing

461
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,320
niche? Reverend

462
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,240
Stang will perform miracles and

463
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,220
wonders before your very eyes.

464
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,240
Witness this daring, evil,

465
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,120
angelical emissionary

466
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,340
as he demonstrates fake

467
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,260
handling, acubating, and

468
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,780
astounding acts of

469
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,400
pyroflagellation. Witness, you

470
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,300
say? At the very least,

471
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,340
you'll learn what not to do.

472
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,000
There will be no

473
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,020
laughing allowed.

474
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,000
During this unusual

475
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,940
and possibly dangerous

476
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,080
presentation. Because of the

477
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,940
potential for brain sneeze,

478
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,120
those faint of mind or

479
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,140
weak of butt are urged not

480
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,100
to attend. No belief system

481
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,080
is safe from the church of the

482
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,800
subgenius and the slack

483
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,000
infestation known as

484
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,140
J.R. Bob Dobbs, who is

485
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,060
unfortunately too busy to

486
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,620
attend this devival.

487
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,500
So,

488
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,240
a crowd,

489
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,140
a crowd of loners.

490
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,900
That was the theme.

491
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,740
A crowd of lonely philosophers.

492
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,280
I found myself in front of

493
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,140
several different brands of

494
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,700
crowds of loners lately.

495
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,180
As you noticed at the Cacophony

496
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,100
Society, I got confused as to which

497
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,880
crowd I was talking to. Yes,

498
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,180
ladies and gentlemen, earlier this year

499
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,120
Reverend Ivan Stang was brought

500
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,720
to San Francisco by

501
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,800
Chicken John to participate

502
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,600
in a Cacophony Society

503
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,100
stage show.

504
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,240
Where he whipped the audience

505
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,520
into a frenzy

506
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,500
on a gigantic stage

507
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,440
at the Castro Theater.

508
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,860
I did? I thought I must

509
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,060
have just introduced these acts real fast

510
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,280
and got off as quick as I could. Oh, everybody loved it.

511
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,120
But what was one

512
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,080
amusing

513
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,060
part where both Stang and I had

514
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,820
to get off stage and there was

515
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,940
only a very little area

516
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,960
for the chorus girls to get on

517
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,820
and we couldn't get off stage

518
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,780
because they were standing there

519
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,440
and there was no way to

520
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,740
squeeze past them even if one

521
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,880
had wanted to make the attempt.

522
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,500
So we just sort of stood there waiting for them

523
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,780
to come out until an infuriated

524
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,720
Chicken John leaped onto the stage

525
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,700
and led both me and

526
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,700
Stang off the stage. Trapped

527
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,660
by chorus girls. I can think of worse

528
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,680
things. Showbiz can be really

529
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,720
tough. Backstage at that

530
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,500
show was just awful. All these

531
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,760
did you see that picture, Philo's shot

532
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,260
of me and the girls?

533
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,460
That picture that's on the internet?

534
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,580
That may be the one I shot.

535
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,480
The one I shot of you and

536
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,580
Philo and the girls. No, this one

537
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,440
is just me and them. Oh, okay.

538
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,600
See, you were smart.

539
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,640
I had to tell Philo to get in

540
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,740
there. He's standing there in front

541
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,020
of all these belly dancers

542
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,500
and I'm pointing

543
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,560
the camera at him

544
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,640
and Hal saw what was going

545
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,280
on and you can see Hal jumping

546
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,400
right into the frame. I said,

547
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,120
Philo, you're fucking up.

548
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,220
Photo bombing. And he looked around

549
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,200
and realized, oh, I'm in front of

550
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
all these beautiful gals.

551
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,380
So, needless to say,

552
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,800
the true overman

553
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,100
or doctor

554
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,040
like Dr. Hal instantly

555
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,220
poses. If you see somebody pointing

556
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,260
the camera at you with a bunch of girls around

557
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,260
you instantly try to look like

558
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,640
you're supposed to be there.

559
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,000
And that they somehow are your

560
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,360
good buddies. First of all, they assume

561
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,260
you're supposed to be there because you're there.

562
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,160
Secondly, they're all dressed

563
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,200
up and want somebody to take their

564
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,920
picture. They're waiting to pose.

565
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,300
What's this namby-pamby

566
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,800
hanging back, you know,

567
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,000
to just get in and start snapping

568
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,320
pictures? That's what's

569
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,300
supposed to be happening.

570
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,180
I don't know why there's always this hanging

571
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,520
back.

572
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,060
Well, because you can get

573
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,880
sued or whatever.

574
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,420
It's a bad form

575
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,340
to take pictures of people

576
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,080
because they all know it could end up on the internet.

577
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,320
I was really surprised how many

578
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,920
people took their clothes off.

579
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,140
For the baptism today, because

580
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,760
for several years

581
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,560
they were hanging back.

582
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,380
For the first few years

583
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,640
we were so open about it.

584
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,020
We had a million naked pictures on

585
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,940
subgenius.com. Then

586
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,960
everybody's grandparents got

587
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,040
web TV.

588
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,980
And I started getting those letters.

589
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,280
You know, please remove those pictures

590
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,300
of me from that. Take those terrible pictures

591
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,000
off right now. And if they asked politely

592
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,140
I did it promptly. And if they were

593
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,740
rude about it, I dragged

594
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,240
my feet. As long as they're not on

595
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,120
Facebook, which not that Facebook

596
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,160
would ever allow such things.

597
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,120
Facebook is puritanical and the guy who

598
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,140
runs it loves Chris Christie

599
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,860
and the Republican Party and

600
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,120
so forth. No, that's not

601
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,440
a sin. That's just somebody else's religion.

602
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,980
We're not going to put down... He's just a

603
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,840
teenage ignoramus or a

604
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,420
youthful

605
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,280
Zuckerman? Zuckerman, yeah.

606
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,160
You know,

607
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,020
Princess Wee and I tried to watch that movie

608
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,000
Social Network three

609
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,600
times and gave up

610
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,060
because we're old.

611
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,960
And we could not

612
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,080
understand a word of

613
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,020
dialogue in that thing because it's very

614
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,000
realistic. They're in coffee

615
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,120
shops and clubs.

616
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,440
A lot of mumbling nerds.

617
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,360
Yeah, mumblecore.

618
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,620
And my son, who is a

619
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,460
actual Hollywood director,

620
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,900
explained to me that they deliberately

621
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,780
made it that way

622
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,000
unintelligible to

623
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,980
slightly deaf old folks

624
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,940
who don't understand.

625
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,260
They don't understand the latest mumble.

626
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,260
That's Hollywood.

627
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,760
So I'm still waiting for a...

628
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,640
The problem is, the bootleg copies

629
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,780
don't have subtitles. Okay, I'll just say it.

630
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,700
I would have to

631
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,640
spend money to know what they're saying

632
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,220
in that movie by reading the subtitles.

633
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,760
You know, I watch movies with my Chinese

634
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,500
friends who always like to

635
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,640
have the subtitles on because it helps them

636
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,540
get it. And now I'm used

637
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,740
to it. It's, you know, I'm used

638
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,700
to checking the subtitle if I don't hear

639
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,840
something quite. And I actually prefer

640
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,560
even English language

641
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,720
movies to have the subtitle options

642
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,880
on. I always get distracted

643
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,720
by the subtitles, though, and I don't see

644
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,740
anything else that's happening on screen. I just

645
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,600
focus on the letters. Well, there is that,

646
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,620
but sometimes it does

647
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,560
help you. I'm close to learning

648
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,600
Dutch because of that same problem.

649
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,780
I get a lot of bootlegs with

650
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,880
Dutch subtitles, and I can't help

651
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,420
but try to...

652
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,800
Even though I'm worried about who's going to

653
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,720
get killed by the monster or whether the monster

654
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,800
is going to get killed, I'm still trying to

655
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,500
translate back and forth so that

656
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,740
eventually I'll suddenly wake up one

657
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,240
day speaking fluent Dutch.

658
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,260
But mispronouncing it.

659
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,520
I'd be mispronouncing it because it

660
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,280
doesn't sound like it looks.

661
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,200
There are many movies that you

662
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,540
do have to watch subtitled, though.

663
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,260
Like all the great Korean

664
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,680
horror and monster movies they've got now.

665
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,220
Yeah, sure. Like The Host.

666
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,240
And now there's a sequel.

667
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,880
Isn't there a host, too?

668
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,620
No? Have you seen it?

669
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,640
Well, there's another movie called The Host

670
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,660
that's not related.

671
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,760
I really want to see it.

672
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,660
Is it the same director, at least?

673
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,120
Okay, that's a little more comforting.

674
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,320
Oh, I saw a preview. It looked amazing.

675
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,180
It looked really good.

676
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,760
Okay, I'll trust that.

677
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,200
I can't wait to see it.

678
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,960
That's one of the nicest, neatest monsters

679
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,420
that's come out recently.

680
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,300
The creature in The Host.

681
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,720
It's one of my favorite movies.

682
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,120
I've watched it dozens of times.

683
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,760
So do you think that the reason

684
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,400
he kept the little girl until she died

685
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,340
was just for a pet for him

686
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,280
because he was lonely?

687
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,280
Well, no.

688
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,540
I think he thought that everyone

689
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,220
that he was barfing up into the sewer

690
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,340
was dead and he came back to eat them later.

691
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,000
But she survived.

692
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,640
But she, when she would try to go out,

693
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,320
a tentacle would go around her

694
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,700
and then the other tentacle would say,

695
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,080
no, you're going to stay here.

696
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,740
Saving it for a snack later.

697
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,620
But she was eventually smothered by him

698
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,000
because he loved her too well.

699
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,620
But still, that was touching, I thought.

700
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,940
Hey, how about Troll Hunter?

701
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,560
Troll Hunter, amazing.

702
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:00,840
Amazing.

703
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,760
You must not miss that one.

704
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,640
It's done like a documentary.

705
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,120
Isn't it in Mexico?

706
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,860
No, it's in the Scandinavian northern country.

707
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,400
It's a Norwegian movie.

708
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,140
Norwegian.

709
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,260
It's very Norwegian.

710
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:20,000
There's something quite different about it.

711
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,580
What it is is

712
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,680
the fact that it's Norwegian.

713
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,000
These dumbass Norwegian kids

714
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,740
are trying to make some kind of movie

715
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,120
with their video cameras

716
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,080
and they just happen to follow this strange guy

717
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,000
and they think, hey, maybe we can make a movie about him.

718
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,840
Well, it turns out that he is a government-hired troll hunter

719
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,000
because the authorities don't want the world to know

720
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,100
that there are actually huge flesh-eating trolls

721
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,260
out there in the woods

722
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,000
and whenever they do something,

723
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,280
they kill a bear and drag it in and say,

724
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,500
we shot the bear that committed this crime.

725
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,620
But there are also trolls as large as houses out there

726
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,640
and electrical towers that you see

727
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,480
are not to carry.

728
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,660
They're not to carry current from towns to towns,

729
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,220
but simply to keep these monsters in.

730
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,340
Then nobody questions where these towers go

731
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,840
or where the current goes.

732
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,260
A lot of interesting things.

733
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,020
You see the giant two-headed trolls,

734
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,300
all the different trolls.

735
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,520
Yes, and they're, you know...

736
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,640
The nice thing about it is it's done

737
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,840
very, very straight and documentary style.

738
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,720
Oh, but there's some supernatural elements.

739
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,960
The trolls can smell,

740
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,000
they can smell the blood of a Christian man.

741
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,300
The old guy asked the documentary filmmakers,

742
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,380
are any of you Christians?

743
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,020
And they all go, oh, no, of course not.

744
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,940
That's silly.

745
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,180
But one of them's lying

746
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,800
and he ends up in the troll's cave

747
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,740
and everybody's going, how come?

748
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,520
They know we're here.

749
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,480
How do they know we're here?

750
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,240
He doesn't make it.

751
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,520
So is that...

752
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,020
Well, I've always heard the,

753
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,960
I smell the blood of an Englishman.

754
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,280
Was that translated differently?

755
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,760
Well, that's not trolls, but giants.

756
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,540
Oh, giants.

757
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:01,880
Right.

758
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,840
And they left that out of Jack the Giant Slayer.

759
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,280
That's because Jack the Giant Slayer

760
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,780
seems not to occur in actual England,

761
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,920
but in some sort of parallel England known as Albion.

762
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,720
And they couldn't rhyme that.

763
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,500
I get so used to the monsters from Dungeons and Dragons

764
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,280
that I forget all the other mythologies

765
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,480
that go behind everything.

766
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,660
You poor child.

767
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,100
No, it's great.

768
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,640
No, you're doing right

769
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,260
because those monsters are canonically correct.

770
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,900
And you're learning about them in an effortless way.

771
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,780
Is that game well researched as far as the mythology and stuff?

772
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,080
It is.

773
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,560
Dungeons and Dragons is.

774
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,840
Well, did you know Gary Gygax,

775
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,640
the creator of Dungeons and Dragons?

776
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,880
No, I've only heard Papa Joe Mama's interview with him.

777
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,800
Oh, well, of course.

778
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,760
Where is that?

779
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,620
I want to hear that.

780
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,120
Papa Joe Mama interviewed Gary Gygax

781
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,140
and a few other, Dr. Kevorkian.

782
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,980
He was one of the, before Kevorkian got famous.

783
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,160
He even got buddy-buddy with Jack T. Chick himself.

784
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,640
Yes.

785
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,580
And Chick put him in a Chick track

786
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,020
called The Judge.

787
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,920
Kurt is in there.

788
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,140
It's in my briefcase.

789
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,460
Yeah.

790
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,940
I still have it from last year.

791
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,860
What an honor, I guess,

792
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,700
to be in a Jack Chick track.

793
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,920
I know two people who've been in Jack Chick tracks.

794
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,640
I know some.

795
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,140
The Druids?

796
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,960
Some of the sisters of perpetual violence in San Francisco.

797
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,140
The late Isaac Bonowitz.

798
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,020
Right into their anti-gay tracks that they did.

799
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,900
He just has his legion of minions.

800
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,820
Yeah.

801
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,800
Oh, God, man.

802
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,480
So, if only.

803
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,100
But anyway, I'm really jealous now of Isaac the Druid

804
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,440
who got in as a demonic guy.

805
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:38,960
And who is it?

806
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,760
Gavin Frost.

807
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,980
Yeah, the witch.

808
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,100
Guy who writes about witch stuff.

809
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,180
Well, of course, Chick puts his whole...

810
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,820
They're both subgenius fans, by the way.

811
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,460
...coterie of weird Christian kooks

812
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,420
who hang around with him.

813
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,960
He makes them characters in the comics.

814
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:53,680
Well...

815
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,420
You have to try to make a point to provoke him more.

816
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,340
Maybe we'll make it in.

817
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:57,880
Like Pastor Malcolm, the father of the devil.

818
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:57,880


819
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:57,880


820
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,280
The long-suffering anti-gay black evangelist

821
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,760
often appears in those things.

822
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,460
Or, of course, you know, Alberto.

823
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,020
The only Chick track I've ever seen is the...

824
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,920
Speaking of Dungeons & Dragons,

825
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,120
was the one where the girl gets indoctrinated

826
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,780
into the evil witchcraft cult.

827
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,060
Is it the one where the demons throw the witches out the window?

828
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,640
No, I don't think...

829
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,560
It's like some woman that's part of some, like, you know, a coven.

830
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,780
It's called Dark Dungeons, right?

831
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,120
That's the title?

832
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,400
Maybe. I don't know.

833
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,700
Like, one of the kids kills themselves over their character

834
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,980
because their character dies.

835
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,960
Yes, and her character died, and so she kills herself.

836
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,280
And then the leader of the coven says,

837
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,360
Forget about that loser.

838
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,860
It's time for you to get closer.

839
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,300
As subgeniuses, we need to catch up with the pagans

840
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,820
in being depicted as some kind of terrible monsters

841
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,620
in low-brow Christian comic books and television shows.

842
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,320
And that's why it's up to you, all those subgeniuses who are listening,

843
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,900
to commit every act of debauchery that might possibly offend Jack T. Chick

844
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,440
and people like him,

845
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,200
so we can get a bigger, wider profile on their radar.

846
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,300
He must be fairly old and venerable at this point, right?

847
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,720
Oh, he's in his 90s.

848
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,560
He's old and venerable, and he's had several heart attacks,

849
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,000
but the Lord is keeping him going.

850
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,600
He promised Papa Joe Mama that he would get around to doing an anti-subgenius

851
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,680
tract when he finishes his current project,

852
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,580
which unfortunately is oil paintings illustrating the entire Old and New Testament.

853
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,360
Which they're going to make a movie out of.

854
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,460
And at age, since he's 90, I think a lot of it is already out on YouTube.

855
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,480
Yes, that's the movie made by the good artist in the Jack Chick organization.

856
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,300
Kurt knows his name.

857
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,380
Right.

858
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,600
But, you know, he also said he'd prey on it,

859
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,920
on the subgenius tract, which is his polite way of saying,

860
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,980
are you kidding?

861
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,040
Right, yeah, this is too small time.

862
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,600
We're trying to beat the Papists.

863
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,440
You know, to him, the real devils are the Catholics.

864
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,680
According to Chick, yes, and according to Alberto Rivera.

865
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,880
And his wife, his widow, is in the Jack T. Chick movie that Kurt made

866
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,240
talking about the poop.

867
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,480
The poop tried to have Alberto shot on the railroad tracks near here.

868
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,940
It was the poop.

869
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,580
We were talking about that at breakfast this morning.

870
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:35,120
People focus on the nearest, the enemy they know best.

871
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,360
The Baptists hate the Methodists more than anybody.

872
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,240
Oh, their rivalry is so sweet to savor.

873
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,080
Right, and the subgeniuses put down the Discordians or whatnot.

874
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,560
Exactly, you attack the people nearest to you instead of your ideological enemy

875
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,320
on the other side of the ideological color wheel.

876
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,380
You attack the ones who are the closest to you.

877
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,880
Right, we should be spending more time bad-mouthing the televangelists, say,

878
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,720
or the Muslimic fanatics.

879
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
We have to be careful with that.

880
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,860
But instead, who are we bad-mouthing?

881
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,500
Poor old Reverend Got-Too-Drunk.

882
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,600
But, you know, the poor old Discordians who don't have their own P.O. box.

883
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,160
It's a human tendency.

884
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,020
Yeah, sad.

885
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,300
And while we still are inhuman beings,

886
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,700
I'm afraid we will be susceptible to it.

887
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,820
Well, that's why I'm an evangelical.

888
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,020
I'm of a more forgiving nature.

889
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:40,480
And I, tomorrow morning, when I'm given control of the lives and deaths of billions of people...

890
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,340
I hope you'll remember those who served tirelessly in your service.

891
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,460
Yeah, I'm not gonna just wholesale wipe out strangers.

892
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,340
I've got no interest in that.

893
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,760
I'm gonna go get the things I like first.

894
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,920
They're still raw material.

895
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,140
They're material.

896
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:55,940
It can be molded.

897
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:00,400
We'll have all of eternity to go over old grudges and so forth.

898
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,000
God help me if they're subgeniuses I gotta grudge against,

899
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,880
because they might have a bigger battle planet than me.

900
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,620
They, too, may need to be set straight with the teeth of the Harrow of Shaddai.

901
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,020
I mean, it would be a shame, wouldn't it,

902
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,600
if on next day, instead of focusing on the positive,

903
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,780
we all started getting jealous of each other,

904
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,900
until there was just one subgenius death planet left standing.

905
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,240
Which would probably be Dr. Legumes, because he's the smartest one.

906
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,520
Or...

907
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,040
And the meanest.

908
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,180
The ecclesiastical court's established...

909
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,640
The reason you can now tell he's the smartest one is because he's over there taking it easy,

910
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,440
and we're up here flapping our limbs.

911
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,340
He's taking a pleasant stroll out there in nature's wonderland,

912
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,800
while we sit here in the dark, yammering for Bob.

913
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,720
It'll be important to not let jealousy take over.

914
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,480
Yes, that's right.

915
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,880
Or then you have people saying, well, they're pretty good.

916
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,100
They're planets bigger than mine.

917
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,180
Their ship is larger than mine.

918
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:58,760
Mm-hmm.

919
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,460
Of course, these ships can expand and contract.

920
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,460
Stang got the Grand Canyon.

921
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,740
I was gonna get that.

922
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,480
Yes, but if you have limited imagination,

923
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,160
or some sort of inferiority complex,

924
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,180
then your ship will be the pukeyest of all.

925
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,140
Well, and the worst are the people who just can't make that imaginative leap.

926
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,020
And their ship looks like their dingy apartment,

927
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,720
and the classes they have to go to,

928
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,160
and their crappy job at the speedway,

929
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,520
and they don't even know they're on the escape.

930
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,320
Wait a minute.

931
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,480
How many years has it been since 98?

932
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,140
Could I be that?

933
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,640
Could I be one of those?

934
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,620
I've just created the two of you as androids

935
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:43,420
to sit up here and go through the same tired routine

936
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,000
for 17 years waiting for the sausage.

937
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,560
I'm a new figment, though.

938
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,060
Well, sure, that wouldn't be realistic

939
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,760
if it was like Groundhog Day.

940
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,000
We have to throw some...

941
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,820
What if we had to do this day over and over?

942
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,960
Dr. Legu, do you want to...

943
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,480
That wouldn't be so bad.

944
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,180
There would be much worse days.

945
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,200
Do you want to take my place?

946
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,020
I don't mind.

947
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,720
We'd have to either share here.

948
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,820
You can just sit...

949
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,660
Why don't you sit there?

950
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,500
And I can yell.

951
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,220
See, I can yell.

952
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,020
Legu is rather soft-spoken.

953
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,980
Because I'm so gentle.

954
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,060
But he knows to put his lips near the microphone,

955
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,540
unlike some who have been up here.

956
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,740
That's the important thing.

957
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,720
They've got to hear you.

958
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,660
They've got to hear you.

959
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,120
You have to lean in.

960
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,440
Right.

961
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,140
I'd be like Philo in all other ways,

962
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,040
but not in that way.

963
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,800
No, not all other ways, please.

964
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,480
Well, in most other ways, then.

965
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,040
What were you going to say?

966
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,180
Oh, I was saying,

967
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,060
perhaps you haven't been doing the same.

968
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,340
Shit for 17 years.

969
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
Perhaps you're just the death flash

970
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,580
in the mind of some 17-year-old boy somewhere

971
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:04,160
who just died of autoerotic asphyxiation.

972
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,200
Well, let's hope it was a pleasant second death.

973
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,920
Well, anybody's got that problem.

974
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,000
Which matrix are we in?

975
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:13,920
Yeah.

976
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,840
Which tub of goo and wires are we plugged into?

977
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,880
I want to be in a...

978
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,200
Who cares, copper top?

979
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,960
I want to be in a comfortable one.

980
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,020
So I can roll over without getting my wires crossed.

981
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,820
I want to be in the broken glass matrix.

982
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,060
That would be a great matrix to be in.

983
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,000
Where the world is all broken glass.

984
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,760
That would hurt.

985
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,040
The shattering shards.

986
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,740
Yeah, yeah.

987
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,360
It would hurt, you know.

988
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,300
It'd keep you wakeful.

989
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,780
In fact, it would probably be the main point of the place

990
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,920
would be just because your very existence

991
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,640
would just suck so totally.

992
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,320
Well, you know, there are many who feel...

993
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,340
That would be a great matrix.

994
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:53,920
Yeah.

995
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,140
Yeah.

996
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,140


997
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,140


998
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,140


999
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,140


1000
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,140


1001
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,140


1002
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,140


1003
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,140


1004
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,140


1005
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,140


1006
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,140


1007
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,140


1008
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,140


1009
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,140


1010
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,720
And wish to be punished in some way.

1011
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,400
For somebody else, not for me.

1012
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Some people's idea of heaven is hell.

1013
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,440
Some people just dislike themselves so much

1014
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,000
that they want to be tormented.

1015
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,240
And we can oblige them too for X day.

1016
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,460
It depends on what version of hell it is.

1017
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,440
Some of them look very interesting.

1018
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,960
Yeah, it could all be medieval

1019
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,720
with the tombs of the heresiarchs and everything.

1020
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,180
All that stuff.

1021
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,940
I kind of envision subgenius heaven as being a place

1022
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,140
with lots of...

1023
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,420
of broken glass.

1024
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,320
Well, you keep going on about this broken glass thing.

1025
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,420
Didn't you have a sermon that went on for hours and hours

1026
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,140
about the planet of broken glass?

1027
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,380
That is true.

1028
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,360
Years ago, which I've completely forgotten every detail about

1029
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,360
except that phrase.

1030
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,320
Well, both heaven, subgenius heaven and hell

1031
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,380
and the escape vessels and all that could be broken glass

1032
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,660
if you really wanted it to be.

1033
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,040
Well, sure.

1034
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,120
Well, go for it.

1035
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,960
We're railroads.

1036
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,520
Go for it, Katahdin.

1037
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,240
Yeah.

1038
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,980
Well, I guess I could just tell about the planet of broken glass

1039
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,740
and you could just fill in the noun of your choice

1040
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,320
or your necro-destination or whatever.

1041
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,720
But the planet of broken glass

1042
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,360
was made entirely of broken glass.

1043
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,180
Yes.

1044
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,360
And everyone on the planet weighed 500 pounds.

1045
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,960
Oh my God, it's a big one.

1046
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,420
And they would walk around all day on broken glass.

1047
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,340
And every day at four o'clock for an hour,

1048
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,720
it would rain alcohol.

1049
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,960
Oh, the Goldilocks zone, they call that.

1050
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:33,700
Yes.

1051
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,380
Oh yeah, that's the happy place.

1052
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,340
And not only would they have to cut themselves

1053
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,220
coming into contact with everything,

1054
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,760
but the people of the planet of broken glass can never die.

1055
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,240
Even if they cut off a section of their foot,

1056
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,100
and dropped it on the ground,

1057
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,360
they would feel that pain.

1058
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,220
And that foot would just lay there in the broken glass

1059
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,320
in pain forever.

1060
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,400
Throbbing.

1061
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,720
And even as the course of time wears you down

1062
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,500
to just one little sliver of meat left,

1063
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,880
all those previous slivers of meat

1064
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,760
on all those little jagged pieces of glass

1065
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,940
are gonna be there suffering for you.

1066
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:15,520
Quivering.

1067
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,760
And at four o'clock when it rains,

1068
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,660
it's just unspeakable.

1069
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,300
Oh, and there's nothing to eat on the planet of broken glass,

1070
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:23,940
except for the gold.

1071
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,580
Except each other.

1072
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,020
And broken glass.

1073
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,280
And broken glass.

1074
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,440
You know, a lot of my carnival friends do eat broken glass,

1075
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,660
and apparently you can eat broken glass.

1076
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,860
The glass from like the light tubes.

1077
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,700
Yeah, you can, they eat light bulbs and stuff.

1078
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,340
Does the planet of broken glass have any bananas on it at all?

1079
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,640
There...

1080
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,560
Because that's what you eat before you eat the glass,

1081
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,780
and after you eat the glass.

1082
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,660
Maybe if they're bananas made out of glass, they got broken.

1083
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,780
There are bananas, but they are made out of broken glass.

1084
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,640
And they got broken too, so...

1085
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,740
Or St. Andrew the Impaled isn't here,

1086
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,280
or he could demonstrate that.

1087
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,480
That's why I know so much about eating broken glass.

1088
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,660
I've seen it so many times.

1089
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,960
I'm, you know, I'm always afraid that

1090
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,460
when somebody's doing something like that,

1091
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,640
something will go wrong,

1092
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,620
and then I, an audience member,

1093
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,620
will be somehow implicated,

1094
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,920
simply because I was there,

1095
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,520
because some sword swallower or glass chewer or

1096
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:21,720
uh,

1097
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,300
nail pounded into the header,

1098
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,440
uh, makes a mistake.

1099
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,880
And then, for some reason, it becomes my fault,

1100
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,660
because I was an enabler.

1101
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,660
I abetted it.

1102
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,240
I stood in the audience and watched it happen.

1103
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,660
I don't think I'm gonna be able to watch that.

1104
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,400
I couldn't watch it last year.

1105
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,340
I don't think I can...

1106
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,000
Andrew the Impaled.

1107
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,120
...screwdriver directly into his fucking face!

1108
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,920
And we're also familiar with David Apocalypse,

1109
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,540
the human blockhead, who also pounds nails,

1110
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,560
into his head.

1111
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:57,200
In fact, we've all seen these acts many times,

1112
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,360
and have become somewhat inured.

1113
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,100
Oh, here's a Jack T. Trick track

1114
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,740
that was brought up by Reverend Asterix.

1115
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,180
The Little Princess.

1116
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,520
It's one about Baby Bear herself.

1117
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,060
Daddy said I should have been a...

1118
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,060
abortion.

1119
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:14,580
Ehhh...

1120
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,580
Oh, it's a sad, sick child.

1121
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,720
It's one of those, uh,

1122
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,260
those twisted, uh,

1123
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,060
sentimental Chick tracks,

1124
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,660
which aren't as good as the jolly, sadistic ones

1125
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,580
that he puts out.

1126
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:28,920
These are...

1127
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,240
It's sad about a little, big-eyed child

1128
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,000
dying and waving away and accepting Jesus

1129
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,840
and all the rest of that bilge.

1130
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,600
His best comics have snickering demons

1131
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,700
hiding in the corners that, uh,

1132
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,680
uh, comment on the action.

1133
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,960
Hey, look! Ice cream!

1134
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,320
What? What? What is this happening?

1135
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,160
Heathen's homemade ice cream!

1136
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,380
Thank you, Heathen!

1137
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,140
Yeah, we were talking, uh...

1138
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:56,520
These days, it's not really a proper subgenius event

1139
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,500
or wedding unless you hire Reverend Heathen

1140
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,300
to do the barbecue.

1141
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:01,120
I think it's vanilla.

1142
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,840
It's very good. I think it's vanilla.

1143
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,600
Vaniglia.

1144
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,660
It's quite good.

1145
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,340
Mmm.

1146
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,380
This isn't as heartwarming as the, uh,

1147
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,540
the movie, The Little Princess.

1148
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,660
No, no relation to The Little Princess.

1149
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,820
Which, that's...

1150
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,620
I'm a sentimental sucker for that movie.

1151
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,240
Boy, that ice cream is high in butter.

1152
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,800
It's only 3.9.

1153
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,380
It's got everything they...

1154
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,000
Look at him. You're pulling a sushi.

1155
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,480
That keeps it from being...

1156
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,000
You're talking to me, a guy in headphones...

1157
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,560
Do you guys want a drink?

1158
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,240
...who can't hear you unless you talk into that thing.

1159
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,560
Just put your lips near the microphone

1160
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,360
and your voice will be virile and unstoppable.

1161
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,480
Yep.

1162
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,360
Is that how this works?

1163
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,520
Yeah, that is actually how it works.

1164
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:42,780
Exactly.

1165
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,440
But I don't sound the same when I get close.

1166
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,920
Whenever I get close, my voice changes to this again.

1167
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:47,580
Like that?

1168
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,540
Yeah.

1169
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,980
Oh, did you learn that from Pope S. Lilla?

1170
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,280
Lil uses a mic like...

1171
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,060
You know, when Lil is screaming, Lil would...

1172
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,660
Yeah, I'll go right into the mic!

1173
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,180
Look, we've all got Heathens' homemade ice cream.

1174
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,400
Lil would whisper.

1175
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,320
Lil would do that.

1176
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,700
The Little Princess, she needs to talk to the Smiths right now.

1177
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,580
The Smiths, yes.

1178
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,440
I know a bunch of Smiths.

1179
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,560
They'll set her right.

1180
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,700
There's two of them here, I know that.

1181
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,720
True smi, not the false smi of the conspiracy.

1182
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,040
My God, that's good.

1183
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:27,840
Isn't that good?

1184
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:28,200
Mmm?

1185
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:28,620
Mmm?

1186
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,240
Good?

1187
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,500
It's very good ice cream.

1188
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:35,140
Okay, so now, you know, we swore we wouldn't talk about YouTube videos that the audience

1189
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:38,820
isn't seeing, but now we're reading comic books and eating ice cream.

1190
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,120
Sorry.

1191
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:47,440
And come July 5th, 1998, we'll be describing much more hedonistic things.

1192
00:45:48,300 --> 00:46:02,180
Oh, I don't think you are台 7d, you know?

1193
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:02,900
Okay, I know, OK, I don't care if I don't,

1194
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,220
I don't put my head up, T novo wszystko!

1195
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,840
Hey man, and Auto Channel, leave us a comment.

1196
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,480
Hey Greg, it's pretty exciting and a cheeseburger with pepper.

1197
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:08,480


1198
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,920
I'm just gonna throw it out to my worth from the action souk.

1199
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:14,920
You know, I think that restaurant was gonna lose employees at the Shoveling Centre when

1200
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:14,920


1201
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,880
And then they're gonna beArthur gang in there,ationincbreaker!

1202
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,540
I know, yeah.

1203
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:17,540


1204
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,960
So B is the hour of slack.

1205
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,380
It'll be the same one.

1206
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,840
They're not one of the better ones either.

1207
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,080
While they sleep.

1208
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,080
That's...

1209
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,120
Wait a minute.

1210
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,920
You're describing my life at this point.

1211
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,800
Well, you are a precursor.

1212
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,180
You prefigure the post-X day.

1213
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,080
Yes, I'm forced to listen to hours of slack over and over again.

1214
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,140
Spoiler alert.

1215
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:49,040
They all seem the same to you after 1,425 episodes.

1216
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,260
Spoiler alert on this comic.

1217
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,400
She gets saved and goes to heaven.

1218
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,600
And look, she runs to the arms of Jesus and his scary, faceless father.

1219
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,560
I hate in these how God is always trying to one-up everybody.

1220
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,600
Mr. Spencer, I'm sure the thought of your daughter dying breaks your heart, right?

1221
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,660
Of course.

1222
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:13,780
Well, God was even more heartbroken when he sent his son from heaven

1223
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,120
to die.

1224
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:14,920
To die on earth.

1225
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,700
Bullshit.

1226
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,140
Why do you have to one-up everything?

1227
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,140
Yeah.

1228
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,460
He knew what was going on.

1229
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:25,560
That was about as real as that time I was dunked in the pond on...

1230
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,080
Oh, wait.

1231
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:26,780
That was real.

1232
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,440
That was real.

1233
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,740
Yes, the passion of Ivan's day.

1234
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,220
Well, I paid for the tar and feathers myself.

1235
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:35,760
The martyrdom, the crucifixion, the transfixation of Ivan

1236
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,820
and the other subgenius martyrs.

1237
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,480
When you consider what suffering has happened

1238
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,740
just so the pinks can fatuously,

1239
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:47,700
slumber along in their delusion for a little bit longer.

1240
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,580
This ain't a church of martyrs, friends.

1241
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,980
I hope you realize that.

1242
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,600
It's a church of farters.

1243
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,840
Others become the martyrs.

1244
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,680
It's farterdom we're addressing here, not martyrdom.

1245
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,360
Yes.

1246
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,700
A mummer's fart.

1247
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,960
Nacreous gas.

1248
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,280
Speaking of which, heathens just drove by again with a giant van of...

1249
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,000
Yes, he brought the ice cream that we are enjoying.

1250
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,940
This ice cream is so good.

1251
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:15,960
And he's whooping up...

1252
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,700
Reverend Heathen's cooking up Dave right now.

1253
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,160
That big old goose man.

1254
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,740
Dave is who we're going to eat tonight.

1255
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,560
Tonight we will feast on his flesh.

1256
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,180
Not the lonesome cowboy, right?

1257
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,100
Oh, no, no. There's no meat on him.

1258
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,340
There's hardly any.

1259
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,720
He's a bony fellow.

1260
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,540
No, this Dave is plump and ready to go.

1261
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,000
Ready for the incisive incisors.

1262
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:43,980
Oh, yeah.

1263
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,820
He's a ravenous subgenius.

1264
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,140
Princess, we threw a leg of lamb in there.

1265
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,660
Oh, wow. So we've got a leg of lamb, too.

1266
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:54,460
And not only do we have a leg of lamb, we have mint jelly.

1267
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,240
Oh.

1268
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,620
That's right. We have the lamb and we have mint jelly.

1269
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,160
So no subgenius can bitch or complain.

1270
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,260
What else could you want?

1271
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,880
Well, I hope Dave the pig didn't suffer too much because...

1272
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,720
Because that spoils the flavor.

1273
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,580
Well, it seems like in this church...

1274
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,980
We're a little hard on Daves, it seems.

1275
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,000
There's a lot of Daves up for the burn-em-up.

1276
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,760
These are the Daves of our lives.

1277
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:25,360
Well, actually, I can tell you some horrible facts.

1278
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,440
Well, let's hear them.

1279
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,440
There have been a lot of famous subgenius Daves

1280
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:35,460
who almost all ended up falling by the wayside one way or another.

1281
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:39,500
But not the lonesome cowboy because being lonesome,

1282
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,580
there was no way he could be ostracized.

1283
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,560
And he has a body connected.

1284
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,980
And because he was lying on the ground, there was no way he could fall.

1285
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,480
Right. He was as far down as you can get.

1286
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,720
But he still got his coat on.

1287
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,100
I wish Dave could be here.

1288
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,260
Me too. I would like to see him.

1289
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:00,620
It's just his huge, slobbering dog will not allow him to cross his threshold.

1290
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:01,100


1291
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:10,260
Friends, if you have a buddy whose life would be improved by the death of their pet, call me.

1292
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:17,200
I've been collecting poisons to help my friends secretly for a long time now,

1293
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,140
and I have quite a long list of animals that need to die

1294
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:25,320
to free up the lives of their human or subgenius slaves.

1295
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,220
Yes, the animal body must be put out of the way.

1296
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,300
The damnable beast flesh keeps coming back.

1297
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,380
The beast flesh needs to be cut back.

1298
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,260
They know which end holds the leash.

1299
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:40,020
I thought you were just going to ask if there was anybody that knew a good dog sitter in Ashtabula.

1300
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,480
I could sit on him.

1301
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,280
We need a more permanent solution.

1302
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,140
I don't know a good dog killer.

1303
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,380
Well, who knows.

1304
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:54,440
This dog is simply the straw that breaks the camel's back in Dave's case.

1305
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:01,120
One thing too many for him to achieve escape velocity and get out here to Wisteria.

1306
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:06,740
Well, you know, Northern Ohio is a depressed part of the Rust Belt,

1307
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,100
and I think there's only four working cars left.

1308
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,780
Among subgeniuses there, and they're all here.

1309
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,740
So, that's the way it goes.

1310
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,160
The rest of the cars are drawn by horses.

1311
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,660
Dave's car will be fixed on...

1312
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,100
Oh wait, Dave never spent his 30 bucks.

1313
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,740
He never officially joined the church.

1314
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,820
He's going to be left behind. Nothing I can do about it now.

1315
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,460
Too bad.

1316
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:31,960
Yes.

1317
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,140
Someone will have to buy a membership right now.

1318
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,480
Write it out for Dave.

1319
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,000
Well, that's...

1320
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,560
It doesn't count.

1321
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,180
Unless you spend the money yourself.

1322
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,380
...a membership for Dave.

1323
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:47,420
No, it only counts if he spends the money himself.

1324
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,440
Yeah, he has to do it.

1325
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,480
I gave him 30 bucks, but he spent it on cigarettes.

1326
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:55,800
What about all the politicians that Chainsmurker has bought memberships for?

1327
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,900
Their money... His money is good.

1328
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,960
His money... Chainsmurker will be rewarded a thousand times over.

1329
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:04,740
Well, there you go.

1330
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,840
He bought... He bought members... He's an Australian,

1331
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:12,900
but he loves following American politics because it's, you know, like a comedy.

1332
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,360
Because it's so entertaining.

1333
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,080
He bought memberships for George W. Bush,

1334
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,940
and during the elections he bought them for Sarah Palin, McCain, and Obama.

1335
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,440
Do those count?

1336
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,720
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1337
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:26,680
Are we going to have...

1338
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,180
I mean, no, not really.

1339
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,460
Is Sarah Palin going to get an escape saucer?

1340
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,460
You can't sponsor a membership in the Church of the Subgenius, you're saying.

1341
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,820
No, I'm sure most of these people bought memberships under assumed circumstances.

1342
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:38,280
They're not going to be called names.

1343
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:43,600
There's no way that Sarah Palin wouldn't join the Church of the Subgenius.

1344
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,640
You'd think so.

1345
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:49,460
And Obama probably joined up in his pot smoking days as a youth.

1346
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,880
He's younger than I am.

1347
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:57,520
I had a poster, or a flyer that we did for one of my shows that I did in Columbus with my band,

1348
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:00,440
and it's just... It was an inauguration show.

1349
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,560
We do an inauguration show every time.

1350
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,100
Wow.

1351
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,620
An inaugurama?

1352
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,480
Or at least the two times that it's happened while we've been a band.

1353
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:14,320
And it's just a poster with a picture of Obama in a silly Panama hat smoking weed.

1354
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,720
There you go.

1355
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,000
Oh, right. I've seen that pic. Yeah.

1356
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,060
It's really great.

1357
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:19,480
Yeah, that's pretty famous.

1358
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:23,320
Yeah, it was Mr. Sister's Facebook picture for a while.

1359
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:23,920
It was for the auction.

1360
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,480
Oh, it was for the auction.

1361
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,460
It's a bottle of weed.

1362
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,420
Now, I've learned a long time ago, don't just...

1363
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:35,580
If Dr. Dark walks up and hands you a bottle, don't drink it.

1364
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:36,920
Awesome.

1365
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,220
The last time he did that, it was bacon flavoring.

1366
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,620
He didn't tell me to drink it.

1367
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:49,560
It's a very exotic soda pop, which we're going to auction later on.

1368
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:53,900
It's the real appetizer, or so it purports.

1369
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:58,360
I've never heard of that one, and I'm somewhat of a fancier of soda products.

1370
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,780
Dr. LeGaymer, we really missed you down at the baptism today.

1371
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,340
You kind of started that whole thing.

1372
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,040
You were one of the main baptizers.

1373
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,840
Well, you were the main baptizer for a long time.

1374
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,980
Yeah, I didn't catch anyone today.

1375
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,540
Yes, that's true.

1376
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:16,980
I unfortunately finally had the sleep that I needed to get.

1377
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,740
Don't fall into me by force.

1378
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,000
Oh, okay.

1379
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,580
I understand.

1380
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,500
I'm going to bed early tonight, friends, because I...

1381
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,240
It contains no fruit juice.

1382
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:33,540
As much as I'm in suspense about 7 a.m. tomorrow, I'm still going to get a good night's sleep

1383
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,680
and wake up...

1384
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,380
That's not nutrition, then.

1385
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,240
Freshly.

1386
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,340
Fresh and bushy-eyed and...

1387
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,920
No, it just says that it was in a facility that processes peanuts.

1388
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,940
And I'll be dead.

1389
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,760
And you'll be what?

1390
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:45,740
And I'll be dead.

1391
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,460
Oh, yeah, you're going to die by X time.

1392
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,660
Apparently it's made of nothing.

1393
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,600
You've been saying that for some time.

1394
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:50,720
Don't rush me.

1395
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,180
There's still a few hours.

1396
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,000
Right.

1397
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,800
I have time.

1398
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,500
Synthetic color, sugar, citric acid.

1399
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,740
I have no idea what this will possibly taste like.

1400
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:04,220
Oh, those are the lyrics to the next song on stage later tonight.

1401
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,140
Jira Masala.

1402
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,600
Jira Masala, the next hit.

1403
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:15,520
Philo, a couple of years ago, Philo and Reverend Angry Larry used ingredients on bottles on

1404
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,280
the stage as Swedish death metal lyrics.

1405
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:26,520
So they were playing this death metal thrash music and screaming out, you know, artificial

1406
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:32,580
sugar water, made in USA, trademark, trademark.

1407
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,420
More like that.

1408
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:35,300
I can't do it.

1409
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,040
I'm not a musician.

1410
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,800
I'm a talented singer like Philo.

1411
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,320
It works every time.

1412
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,780
Well, how long have we been?

1413
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,780
This has been 55 minutes.

1414
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,200
55 minutes of protracted nonsense.

1415
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,160
55 minutes of slack.

1416
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,000
Oh, of slack.

1417
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:54,580
Yes, that's what I mean.

1418
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,600
Which would mean a whole hour.

1419
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,420
Slack.

1420
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,460
That gives you enough time to put in the credits and...

1421
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,000
55 minutes of slack.

1422
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,400
Imagine over the course of time how much of your life you can recover.

1423
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:04,400


1424
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:04,400


1425
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:04,400


1426
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:04,400


1427
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:04,400


1428
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:04,400


1429
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:04,860
I can't even claim.

1430
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:05,780
Oh, yeah.

1431
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:05,800
Wow.

1432
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,140
I just have that 55 minutes.

1433
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,360
An extra five minutes every week.

1434
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,420
Well, how many hours of slack have you done?

1435
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,460
I just gain back all the time I've wasted.

1436
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,640
1,425.

1437
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:20,080
Now, five minutes times that, that's a pretty good chunk of time.

1438
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,140
You could get a lot done.

1439
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:25,640
You could have a hell of a party in Bangkok in that amount of time.

1440
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,220
Yeah, I guess so.

1441
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:33,120
You could totally be missing out on that Bangkok party simply by not making it the 55 minutes

1442
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:33,600
of slack.

1443
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:39,120
Is that what Silvio Berlusconi referred to as a bunga bunga party?

1444
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,300
I don't know.

1445
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:46,500
All I know is that 55 minutes of slack would use up a lot more neon when I finally make

1446
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,660
the big neon hour of slack song.

1447
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,680
You should get John Law on the case.

1448
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:51,420
He'll build you one.

1449
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,120
What if we cut it down to the split second of slack?

1450
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,180
The micro nanosecond of slack.

1451
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,800
Let's go back to doing the minute of slack.

1452
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:02,820
The...

1453
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,300
You know, those were harder to do.

1454
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:15,980
Do you know how many seconds you could save in your life by eliminating the other 99 one-hundredths

1455
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:16,600
of a minute?

1456
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,580
You know, recently...

1457
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:19,880
In less than 12...

1458
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,660
In less than 24 hours, time won't matter.

1459
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,560
There won't even be hours anymore.

1460
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,340
Scientists recently figured out the shortest possible interval that could exist.

1461
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:33,100
The speed that a photon moves might be...

1462
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:39,960
Microscopically within an atom at the speed of light to get from one spot to another.

1463
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:45,960
Scientific American defined this as the smallest possible quantum moment.

1464
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,940
The smallest possible increment of time of slack.

1465
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:51,980
We add.

1466
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,820
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

1467
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,840
Well, that's the way it is for some people, you know.

1468
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,980
You can't just expect it to...

1469
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:01,720
Like the unborn.

1470
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,680
Like the unborn.

1471
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,420
They don't get any slack, do they?

1472
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,080
The unborn.

1473
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,000
They don't have any slack.

1474
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:06,200
Well, what about that...

1475
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,580
Who thinks about slack for the unborn?

1476
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:13,500
That Republican legislator claims fetuses masturbate in the womb if you're following the news cycle.

1477
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,440
Oh...

1478
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:15,980
They're getting slack.

1479
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:16,980
The little malfeasance...

1480
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:17,700
Busted!

1481
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,120
Yeah, what channel's even watching?

1482
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,180
Sitting before they're born.

1483
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:20,760
Busted.

1484
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:26,360
Who trusts some kind of pedophilic politician who likes to watch babies masturbate in the

1485
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:26,660
womb?

1486
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,960
Well, he's trying to show you shouldn't have b-abortions because the little kid's

1487
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,680
are in there enjoying themselves already.

1488
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,680
Even at an early age, they're doing it with themselves.

1489
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:38,700
He's just making sure he can get streaming video.

1490
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,100
Possibly.

1491
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,560
You know, that would actually explain a lot, but I don't want to go into that.

1492
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:46,880
Well, we won't talk about it now.

1493
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,560
We'll table it as the subject of a future colloquy.

1494
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,760
You sure have a pretty mouth, Dr. Howe.

1495
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,440
Thank you, Reverend Stagg.

1496
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,940
You talk with that mouth that James makes those pretty words.

1497
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:57,440
Yes, it's all true.

1498
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,940
We're going to ascend to our native soil.

1499
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,560
Starry stars.

1500
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,940
A brighter and better world than this one.

1501
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,840
Gleaming in glory.

1502
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:11,080
After a night of dubstep and partying.

1503
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,360
After a night of filth and imbecility.

1504
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:20,640
