1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,200
You don't hear no sounds as you hear but dig this.

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,760
You don't hear no sounds as you hear but dig this.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:24,160
And I think a lot of things we do today, I mean, how much time do we spend working, doing jobs, to earn the money, to buy things we don't really want?

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:32,380
I mean, sometimes I ask people to go home, to look through their closet, to count up all the things they don't actually use and don't really need and shouldn't really have bought,

5
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,000
and then work out how many hours they spent slaving away to buy this stuff.

6
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:37,440
All right.

7
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:46,880
And on top of that, we're seeing the tax burden increase on people in America to a level virtually undreamed of,

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,080
a level, as a matter of fact, that is higher than what was paid by the serfs in medieval Europe.

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:53,920
What?

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,340
See, what really gets you ahead in today's world?

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,840
Are you going to get ahead by brains?

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,720
No.

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,400
It's probably going to be a handicap.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,700
I mean, do you get good dates because of brains?

15
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,480
What was the last time you fell in love with somebody because they were smart?

16
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,660
You know, it's slack and luck.

17
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,160
As Bob said, I'd rather be lucky than good any day.

18
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,720
In just the 200 years since the Industrial Revolution,

19
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,960
we now consume 350,000...

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,240
That's a lot.

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,500
...times the resources of a person 200 years ago.

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:27,960
Like each one of us.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,580
Each one of us.

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,260
And there's a stack more of us than there were...

25
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,300
And this is the point.

26
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,620
There were 10 times more of us, which means we're each consuming...

27
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,920
Sorry, as a society, we're consuming 3,500 times what society did 200 years ago,

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,720
which is even more staggering when you translate that in time.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,340
It means in one year...

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:46,900
Let's go for it.

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,220
...we now consume what society consumed from the period,

32
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,700
from the rise of Greek culture to the Industrial Revolution,

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,280
through that whole period of history,

34
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,240
whatever we consumed through that whole period of history,

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,180
from Greek culture to the Industrial Revolution,

36
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,500
we now consume each year.

37
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,760
It's a beautiful thing, man.

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,160
Yeah.

39
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:07,600


40
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,980
Yeah.

41
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,180
Yeah.

42
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,820
Yeah.

43
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,060
Yeah.

44
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,100


45
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,500
Yeah.

46
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,140
Yeah.

47
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,140


48
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,140


49
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,140


50
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,140


51
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,140


52
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,140


53
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,140


54
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,140


55
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,140


56
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,140


57
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,140


58
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,360
en

59
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,420
Yeah...

60
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:44,520
Yeah.

61
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:14,500
Welcome, dear friends.

62
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,560
To the subgenius hour of Slack.

63
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,380
You know,

64
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,680
In a world where so many people were heartbroken by the removal of black talon 9mm shells from the market,

65
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,060
it takes a truly sophisticated palette to properly appreciate the kind of finely honed madness

66
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,240
that refreshes the soul and keeps those baseball bats in their holsters where they belong.

67
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,360
Usually, anyway.

68
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,120
That's why the world is crying for an outlet, a safety valve you might say,

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,440
such as the almighty subgenius hour of slack!

70
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,520
This amusing weekly hour-long antidote to the toxic effects of the everyday

71
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,920
is the best investment of your radio dollar in your bid to refrain from bludgeoning to death

72
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,120
those whom we all know full well deserve it.

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,200
If not for such so-called madness, many would go truly insane and create the most awful turmoil.

74
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,180
Why, a gentleman can scarcely enjoy his times in peace,

75
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,540
what with all the gunfire, screaming, and rap music polluting the vicinity.

76
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,980
That's why those determined to rise above the muck and mire of the banal

77
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,080
are all but crushing their house bets every Sunday night at 9pm

78
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,700
as they dash madly to the parlor in their bid to switch on K&ON,

79
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,500
89.3 FM, and TAPS,

80
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,920
wacky but resolute Dallas, Texas,

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,160
for each and every enriching episode of

82
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,500
THE SUBGENIUS HOUR OF SLACK!

83
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,100
Hosted by a real man's man, the ascended Reverend Ivan Stang,

84
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,480
this rousing yet tasteful offering not only shows one how to resist the onslaught of the vulgar lower classes,

85
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,680
but provides the plans for phasers,

86
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,680
with which mescriants can be killed outright

87
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,320
while leaving no messy and annoying corpus delecti

88
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,180
that might attract the gendarmes or stain the Bentley,

89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,920
disrupting one's agenda for the day.

90
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,260
A bargain indeed, considering the amount of free breeding going on today.

91
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,900
So, which will it be?

92
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,600
Seemingly endless suffering and strained, gracious silence,

93
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,900
or tastefully focused mayhem that restores the balance you've come to know and love?

94
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,660
The answer?

95
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,580
Simply make THE SUBGENIUS HOUR OF SLACK

96
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,380
part of every Sunday night's regimen

97
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,720
and let Bob unravel that knitted sleeve of care

98
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,920
with a kid glove and a stark fist!

99
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,280
The choice is yours!

100
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

101
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,580
Yes, my fellow Yeti.

102
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,940
Have you ever seen the inside of a poultry processing plant?

103
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,420
What the common chicken goes through from birth to death,

104
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,260
even the most barbaric of nations would consider beyond cruelty.

105
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,980
If humans were where the chickens are...

106
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:22,000
The chicken is born into the mechanical arms of a vast stainless steel machine.

107
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:28,980
They are separated and their wings are burned off to prevent flight or any possibility of escape.

108
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:35,940
The males, being all but useless to the machine, are immediately destroyed.

109
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,460
The newborn slaves are given huge booster injuries,

110
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,360
injections to ward off any disease,

111
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,480
and growth hormones to make the slaves grow bigger and faster.

112
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,020
From then, the slaves become the intricate cogs of the vast machine.

113
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,020
They are cramped into tiny metal boxes

114
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:05,120
and forced to lay their eggs for the rest of their lives to feed their barbaric human masters.

115
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,140
Only the few lucky males that aren't destroyed are kept,

116
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,180
and the only ones that are left are the ones that have to provide their semen

117
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:21,240
to artificially inseminate the females in order to keep the machine running forever and ever and ever.

118
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:27,200
And after the females have finished their usefulness and can no longer produce eggs,

119
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,300
after each having pumped out about a thousand or so in their lifetime,

120
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,960
they become the Kenny Rogers Roasters and the Kentucky Fried Chickens and the Tyson Roasters

121
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,800
on your supermarket shelves.

122
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:46,900
Now, imagine the Earth as one vast poultry processing plant.

123
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,560
Every human cramped into a tiny metal box,

124
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,180
being given super drugs to keep them from ever getting sick,

125
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:02,620
and forced to pump out infants for the consumption of some hideous alien race of gods.

126
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,680
Read Aldous Huxley!

127
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,880
A brave new world is already here!

128
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,300
The human lifespan already is at an all-time high.

129
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,700
Humans now live twice as long as they did 200 years ago.

130
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,520
It's not a coincidence!

131
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,840
And medicine serves only one function.

132
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:28,280
To prolong our lives for service in the vast stainless steel machine.

133
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,980
And Dr. Howell, the good Dr. Howell, tries to reassure both Yeti and Pink alike

134
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,940
by comparing the takeover to the Earth-based machine.

135
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,380
The Earth is being turned into one big Stucky's.

136
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,220
No, no, my brothers and sisters, it's going to be much worse!

137
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,540
Stucky's at least offers souvenirs,

138
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,800
which is something that the Yakutisma could care less about.

139
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,800
Stucky's sells gas, which the Yakutisma are going to take anyway, so who cares?

140
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,280
If you want a picture of what Earth will resemble,

141
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,960
imagine a chain of Kentucky Fried Humans.

142
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,060
You can buy a million restaurants, each inhabiting a whole continent,

143
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,560
all of which are five miles high,

144
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,560
then where you can sit in mile-high chairs

145
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,660
and order a 50,000 gallon bucket of original recipe humans.

146
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,160
That is what is in store for humanity, my friends.

147
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:37,460
Let us pray that our guru, our savior, our saint, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

148
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,580
can get we, the Yeti, get us off this planet

149
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,440
before we encounter the same fate as the Pinks.

150
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,060
And dear friends, that was a wonderful little rant there,

151
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,260
written not by myself, but by the good Saint Lachnar

152
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,120
of the Holy Order of the Cheeseburger.

153
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,700
Yes.

154
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,420
A member of the Church of the Subgenius,

155
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,900
who sent us that rant on electrons by internet.

156
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,040
Last week, we actually sapped the internet quite a bit,

157
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:28,580
in that some of the regular denizens of the subgenius part of the internet,

158
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,580
which is called alt.slack,

159
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,680
for those of you who haven't caught on yet,

160
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,280
there's a lot happening there,

161
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:44,960
and not only do we get many words and ideas from alt.slack

162
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,120
and its good denizens,

163
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,800
but we also have lately started to get tapes.

164
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,100
Yes, the alt.slackers are, they're whipping it out,

165
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,100
they're starting to whip it out,

166
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,300
and we'll whip out some more of that tonight

167
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,280
for your entertainment and edification.

168
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:10,580
In the meantime, well, we don't know exactly what we're going to do,

169
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,800
because there's so much music here.

170
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,180
Lately, there's been more music than words,

171
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,460
and I bet you as radio listeners wouldn't mind hearing a little bit more of that

172
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,740
on the subgenius hour of slack.

173
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,300
So let's see what this little tape here sounds like.

174
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,060
By the way, in the background, you're hearing the soundtrack of the...

175
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,360
Ed Wood's movie, the fine Tim Burton film.

176
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,180
That's the end of that, and the beginning of this.

177
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,480
Back in history, before time began,

178
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,900
all the real cool cats had a solid plan.

179
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,320
When they dug a nervous jig,

180
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,820
they all to a man went,

181
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,060
Aaaaaaaaah!

182
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,740
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

183
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,220
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

184
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,740
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

185
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,120
You wanna be cool, man? Go ape!

186
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,620
Young mighty Joe, swinging through the trees,

187
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,120
Was the king of everything that roosted in the leaves,

188
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,660
But when he saw a girl ape hanging in the breeze,

189
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,040
He went, Aaaaaaaaah!

190
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,880
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

191
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,380
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

192
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,840
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

193
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,160
You like to be a hip boy? Go ape!

194
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,620
Big dinosaur was a long, tall lizard,

195
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,140
He drifted through the jungle like a slow blizzard,

196
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,540
But when he got a double ticket lady lizard,

197
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,000
He did Aaaaaaaaah!

198
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,780
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

199
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,280
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

200
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,700
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

201
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,120
You wanna be sharp, cat? Go ape!

202
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,020
A pterodactyl was a flying fool, just a...

203
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,080
I thought I'd break in and tell you what a pterodactyl was.

204
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,860
Well, it was sort of a stork-looking bat,

205
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,200
With sharp teeth that cruised around looking for...

206
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,600
Say, we haven't changed a bit, have we, cats?

207
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,000
A pterodactyl was a flying fool,

208
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,460
Just a breeze-flapping daddy of the old school,

209
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,220
But a mama-dactyl could sure make him drool.

210
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,920
Aaaaaaaaah!

211
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,140
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

212
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,560
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

213
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,960
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

214
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,400
Don't be a square, Joe, go ape!

215
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,840
Now, old Papa Tiger was a boss of the Nile,

216
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,100
Just a sport model cat with a solid style,

217
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,620
He was old King Cool till the girl tiger smiled.

218
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:26,960
Aaaaaaaaah!

219
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:27,980
Aaaaaaaaah!

220
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,760
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

221
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,220
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

222
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,620
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

223
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm Bee's Orch Daddy, oh, go ape!

224
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,300
Adam was the first boy in the land,

225
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,680
The big melleroon-y daddy with an iron hand,

226
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,200
But when little Eva said,

227
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,080
Hi, man!

228
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,720
Aaaaaaaaah!

229
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,360
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

230
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,800
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

231
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,220
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah,

232
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,860
Don't be a cube-roob,

233
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,640
Go ape!

234
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,400
So remember to ape,

235
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,380
Call today!

236
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,060
Yeah!

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,760
Aaaaaaaaah!

238
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,780
Aaaaaaaaah!

239
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,620
The interesting thing about that song is that

240
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,080
our good friend Orton Nenslow

241
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,600
is pretty sure that that is actually a...

242
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,720
That song was one of the very few that was written

243
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:33,420
by J.R. Bob Dobbs during the time that he was doing the Bob Dobbs and the Doobops.

244
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,440
Oh, I'm sorry, Bob Dobbs and the Doo-Wops.

245
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,060
Gotta keep the history straight here.

246
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,840
The Doo-Wops never really did all that well,

247
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:51,320
but apparently this one song was recorded by another group,

248
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,680
and what was their name?

249
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,840
Well, it doesn't say on this tape that...

250
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,420
Paul Mavridis sent us.

251
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,000
Lovely little tape called Holiday in Paris,

252
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,380
but by gobs, it's a beautiful thing.

253
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,800
You know, when you get down into the pure music of the subgenius,

254
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,380
and I mean, this is truly underbrain music,

255
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,060
there's quite a range, you know?

256
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,640
It goes from Bach to Hendrix to the guys that did Ape Call,

257
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,380
and to Captain Beefheart, heard here in the background.

258
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:33,580
I've got a huge stack of musical tapes to play for everyone tonight.

259
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,700
Oh, I'm sure this is music for everybody.

260
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,100
Oh, yeah, everybody's gonna love this stuff.

261
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:45,940
But, well, heck, let's just shut up, shall we?

262
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,420
No one's going to be able to watch if it's exciting and interesting,

263
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:13,420


264
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:13,420


265
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:13,420


266
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:13,420


267
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,160
And, uh...

268
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,440
And how good it's fucking大

269
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,720
Guess we gotta take a look!

270
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,340
It's a good melody.

271
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:24,340


272
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:24,360
we're going to share this wonderful,

273
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:24,380
always head-pushing way.

274
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,560
Castle in Paris caught up with me a few nights ago,

275
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,140
and as you see, it's only a year out,

276
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,140

Yes, dear friends, and that was Captain Beefheart

288
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,540
from a bootleg called Alternative Beefheart,

289
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,540
an instrumental tune called Flower Pot.

290
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,620
Most of that is outtakes from a studio session

291
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,580
in the process of putting one of his early albums together.

292
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,860
And in the background here we have The Ventures.

293

What is this?

294
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,900
Yeah, The Ventures in Space

295
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,420

¶¶

318
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,520
Right.

319
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,400
I think what I say is we often don't live in the now,

320
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,620
often our thoughts are in the future about what if what if this and we fill our minds with concern

321
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:02,560
which doesn't actually make us any happier and we miss out on actually enjoying the present and i

322
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,260
think part of the art of life is being able to just let go of a lot of our worries and actually

323
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:12,180
be in the present and enjoy what's happening right now and if we do that i think we become

324
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:27,520
much much more alive to understand the master's words let the spirit of eck flow through

325
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:41,780
it must be free to flow through you to share its wisdom from the heavens

326
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:52,120
above the fruits of the spirit the gifts of god

327
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:02,660
most souls are seeking peace health love joy and prosperity

328
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:11,500
the timid never find true love and happiness

329
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:31,080
and you know if if you'd look in a blind spot and see that is all you really need

330
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:42,160
you deeply in your mind if you're having worry planner if you're feeling anxious

331
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,160


332
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,160


333
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,820
In the sea of spirit

334
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,640
To be lifted

335
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,940
Above your daily problems

336
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,800
Then you are in this world

337
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,960
But not of it

338
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,680
Yes, yes, dear friends.

339
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,620
Well, I had to cut into that...

340
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,740
I had to cut out of that Ekencar song there

341
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,640
because it was getting really, really bad and boring

342
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,300
and that's what you can expect

343
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:22,560
from non-subgenius rival mind-control cults.

344
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,760
That little cut there was by The Lighter Sound,

345
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,960
a group of Ekencar geeks.

346
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,740
Hold it.

347
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,800
Oh, man.

348
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,160
You know, I just hate to put down somebody else's religion,

349
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,360
but, boy, if you ever get bored with the Sunday funnies,

350
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,260
you know, check out the religion section in your paper.

351
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,000
Ekencar is big enough that they may be listed in there

352
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,340
and go to an Ekencar meeting.

353
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,660
It's...

354
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,360
It's why it's funnier than the church of the subgenius,

355
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,480
you might say.

356
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,880
Yeah, I had originally put that whole song on this show

357
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,860
and I'm coming back to cut in over it

358
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,340
because, well, we like subgenius music better than Ekencar music

359
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,300
and besides, we haven't talked enough lately

360
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,500
about satanic backmasking,

361
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,360
of which I have an excellent example here

362
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,760
in a piece of subgenius music,

363
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,020
the well-known tune,

364
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,180
You Rang,

365
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,800
by so-called out-of-band experience

366
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,400
or kings of feedback.

367
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,280
They can't seem to make up their mind what they're called.

368
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,460
This person, Bill Miller,

369
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,120
created this horrible song,

370
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,060
which we hear in the background.

371
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,340
It's loaded with backmasking, friends,

372
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,780
and after you hear this little section I'm going to play,

373
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,540
then,

374
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,160
I will play it for you backwards

375
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,880
by the miracle of computer technomation.

376
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,960
So, stand by for this one segment coming up here.

377
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,820
You saw me from beyond

378
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,500
You'd better be ready

379
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,960
To speak your peace

380
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,220
You caught me from beyond

381
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,980
You disturbed my rest of sleep

382
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,460
With your childish games

383
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,500
You don't know what you're playing with

384
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,440
This is not a game

385
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,320
Put a little voice in you

386
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,660
This is your life

387
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,600
You know that you're not alone

388
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:39,600


389
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:39,600


390
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:39,600


391
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:39,600


392
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:48,240
You know you're next to the world

393
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,200
You'll see a future

394
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,680
You're all you ever change

395
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,320
Your dreams won't match

396
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,460
You chose your fate

397
00:25:59,460 --> 00:25:59,460


398
00:25:59,460 --> 00:25:59,460


399
00:25:59,460 --> 00:25:59,460


400
00:25:59,460 --> 00:25:59,460


401
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,840
And now all of the world

402
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,160
Hahaha..

403
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,600
I can't tell you

404
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:03,920
You're stronger

405
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:03,920


406
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:03,920


407
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,660
And even stronger

408
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,380
It's beautiful

409
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:06,600
Really beautiful

410
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:06,700
I wish we had that

411
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,180
okay now friends this incredibly we're going to listen to this satanic type song

412
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,440
backwards now that's that little sequence that we just ran listen to this

413
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:36,880
oh

414
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,500
pretty horrifying huh friends uh

415
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,120
well you can have your mind programmed with more anti-satanic material

416
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:18,020
by getting hold of the out of band uh cd from extraterrestrial records

417
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,540
i'm about to give that number friends

418
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:26,280
the easiest thing to do is to call uh 1617 lick o b e

419
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,860
that's 1617 lick o b e

420
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,980
we smell sausage

421
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,540
oh and you can also uh write to

422
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:47,940
uh them at box 221 boston massachusetts once again that's box 221 boston massachusetts 02123

423
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:57,980
what significance could lay in that zip code number 02123 hmm just a little too perfect isn't it

424
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,820
sorry

425
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,320
and eliminate four

426
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,200
oh shit

427
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,620
.

428
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,020
wow

429
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,440
i just heard my own voice in their back mask i believe that was me saying slack off

430
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:33,620
this is bill t miller from obe at kings of feedback

431
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,680
and you're listening to the hour of the rarely heard Idiots and Per explanation, why fellp능 dumb is all we're going to do today 14 konspiracy & idiotic behaviour and bullying can be seen in the doubtless audio동 preventing this video from going anyway

432
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:46,140
of slack and friends that reminds me I apparently forgot to do some credits

433
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,720
here in the early part of the show that promo for the hour of slack up at the

434
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,560
very beginning was of course the held Pope Huey currently out of Little Rock

435
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:01,040
Arkansas I believe and the little cuts of the British guy little clips of the

436
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:06,360
British guy telling us what we're doing wrong is from a media barrage tape that

437
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:13,460
will be scavenging a lot from good Reverend Nick Nolan up in Canada let's

438
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:19,120
see oh we must thank Palmer Vredes Nenslow and Joe Riley for some of the

439
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,060
background music we've been playing and let's just see well what there is here

440
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:29,180
coming up I believe this is a yet one of the most bizarre cover versions of a

441
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:34,280
Jimi Hendrix tune I've ever heard Purple Haze as done by the shaman

442
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,660
in Australia

443
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,580
Things are funny, they don't seem the same

444
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,020
I'm acting funny, I don't know why

445
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,180
Excuse me and I'll kiss the sky

446
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,520
I hope he's all around

447
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,780
Don't know whether I'm coming up or down

448
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,660
I'm a hobby, I'm a lady

449
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,400
Kiss, puss, bail on me

450
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,240
Oh my God, my turtle died

451
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,300
Ladies, get your knockers up to three

452
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,040
Up to three

453
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,760
Put a rug, get shoulders back

454
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,640
And get your knockers up, up, up, up

455
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,460
Come on there honey, throw those shoulders back

456
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,600
Get up, big smile

457
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,360
Come on, shoulders back, come on honey

458
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,780
There, doesn't that make your navel tingle when you do that?

459
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Ladies, I have said that man was born

460
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,060
To thrust upon us with the biggest and the best that they have

461
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,700
I feel that it is our turn now to rise and unite

462
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,660
And thrust back at them with the biggest and the best that we have

463
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,000
In order to do that, I want every lady sitting here in this audience tonight

464
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,620
To march forward

465
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,140
Proudly to the Anaheim Bowl with the knockers held high

466
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,120
Flapping in the breeze

467
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,200
Proving that we have something to give in this crazy world today

468
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,220
Ladies, are you ready to commence the march of the knockers?

469
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,120
Everybody march

470
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,240
Back to the show, let's round about

471
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,040
Throw your knockers upward, out

472
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,400
Hut, two, three

473
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,080
We're in a hut, two, three

474
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,820
We're in a hut, two, three

475
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,460
We're in a hut, two, three

476
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:01,620
We're in a hut, two, three

477
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:01,620


478
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,140
We're in a hut, two, three

479
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,560
We're in a hut, two, three

480
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,980
Ladies, you're not marching

481
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:13,120
You don't have to have large knockers to do this march

482
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,280
Just do as the men do

483
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,460
Think big, right?

484
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,220
Back to the show, let's round about

485
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,180
Throw your knockers upward, out

486
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,500
Hut, two, three

487
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,160
We're in a hut, two, three

488
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,840
We're in a hut, two, three

489
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,620
We're in a hut, two, three

490
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,500
Hut

491
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,640
Well, when you girls go back into the office

492
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,060
I want you to do me a little favor

493
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,680
I want you to stand in front of the boss's office for just one moment

494
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,860
Mentally take yourself in hand

495
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,140
Throw your shoulders back

496
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,900
Get your knockers up

497
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,080
Put a big smile on your face

498
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,380
The boss will take one look at you and he'll say

499
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,600
Hot damn, Beatrice got her knockers up

500
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,460
Knockers up, everybody!

501
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,800
Knockers up, everybody!

502
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,120
Knockers up, everybody!

503
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,360
Thank you.

504
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,500
Thank you.

505
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,240
Thank you.

506
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,860
Thank you.

507
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,340
Thank you.

508
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,640
Thank you.

509
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,020
Thank you.

510
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,440
Thank you.

511
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,380
Thank you.

512
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,560
Thank you.

513
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,960
Thank you.

514
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,040
Thank you.

515
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:37,680
Thank you.

516
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,600
Thank you.

517
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,900
Thank you.

518
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:41,660
Thank you.

519
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,440
Thank you.

520
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:43,700
Thank you.

521
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:43,700


522
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:43,700


523
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:43,700


524
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:43,700


525
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:43,700


526
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:43,700


527
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:43,700


528
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:43,700


529
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,040
Bob is the man cleaning our plate.

530
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,760
Bob is the man saying, it's not too late.

531
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,020
Bob prescribes the word of Jehovah One.

532
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,200
How many Jehovah's are there, Uncle Will?

533
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,420
23, Jimmy.

534
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,400
A whole 20.

535
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,640
23 Jehovah's.

536
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,800
But it's only Jehovah 1 we really need to worry about

537
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,880
because he's a crazy space alien bent on destruction.

538
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,800
But anyway, back to the story.

539
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,360
Mom prescribes a word of trouble.

540
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,620
And we'll be totally transformed when the message is done.

541
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,380
Oh, glory be to him.

542
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,720
The one that brought us sails.

543
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,360
Taking in the dollar.

544
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,140
In a storm's windy gale.

545
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,040
Uh, what's a gale?

546
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,320
I mean, there's a gale.

547
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:34,320
A gale would be, uh, no, it's, it's a,

548
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,000
it's an elaborate way of saying a lot of wind.

549
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,540
Play some slides.

550
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:49,940
Um, it, I, uh, it's, well, okay, this is poetry.

551
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,840
It's a story, right?

552
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,540
So you've got to, you've got to have things that rhyme.

553
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,380
Well, they don't have to rhyme if it's poetry.

554
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,700
I mean, concrete poetry obviously doesn't have to rhyme.

555
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,500
Concrete.

556
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,980
Anyway, this is the way the story was written.

557
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,240
It's supposed to be this way.

558
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,480
Just take it, okay?

559
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:05,800
Okay.

560
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,060
So, Bob is the man sucking on his pipe.

561
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,360
Hey, you've got a pine bogle.

562
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,400
Well, is it the same kind of pipe?

563
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,640
No, Jimmy.

564
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,180
I mean, it's a pipe.

565
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,700
You put stuff in one and light it on fire and breathe it in.

566
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,880
But Bob's pipe is something special.

567
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,940
Anyway, let's get back to the story.

568
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,300
Bob is the man sucking on his pipe.

569
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,180
Bob is the man turning day into night.

570
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,020
Bob is your friend.

571
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,480
And Connie is too.

572
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,320
Oh, no.

573
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,420
The name you know is Connie.

574
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,480
Ha ha, Connie.

575
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,500
Connie, Connie.

576
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,760
Uh, Connie is Bob's wife.

577
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,960
Um, she's Connie.

578
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,080
Something you'll learn along with getting drunk.

579
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,600
Trust me, okay?

580
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,220
Oh, okay.

581
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,300
Okay.

582
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,460
Um, anyway, Bob is your friend.

583
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,100
Connie is too.

584
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,780
And all they ask is a little dollar straight from you.

585
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,740
A dollar?

586
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,280
Wow!

587
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,720
Is that all they want?

588
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,240
Well, they want more than a dollar if they can get it.

589
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,940
But sure, a dollar would be swell.

590
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,480
A dollar is all it costs for the Church of the Subgenius' salvation.

591
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,360
Only a dollar.

592
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,720
That's a bargain.

593
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,600
You know it, Jimmy.

594
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,200
It's a hell of a bargain.

595
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:29,960
Wow.

596
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,260
Praise and glory be to Bob.

597
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,420
Oh, yes, dear friends.

598
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,060
We can calm down now.

599
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,260
I think it's all right.

600
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,460
And, um, let me explain to you that that last lovely pee,

601
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,660
that oh-so-explanatory piece there,

602
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:06,980
was done by Olo T. Schicklgruver and the Happy Philanthropist Orchestra.

603
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:12,220
From their album, Music for Women Who Are Hard to Knock Over.

604
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,840
This is a product of neglect release.

605
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:22,840
That is, you can write for information and the Olo T. Schicklgruver fan club,

606
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:27,440
care of the product of neglect recording company.

607
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,320
Got that pencil ready?

608
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,880
At 2936 Waterloo Street.

609
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:43,940
That's 2936 Waterloo Street in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

610
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,880
A V6R3i5.

611
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,140
Those silly, silly zip codes there in Canada.

612
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:55,260
Da.

613
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,580
A V6R3i5.

614
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:08,640
Uh, yes, and, and, uh, oh, here's some more of those 50 fun things to do in an elevator.

615
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,840
Number 11.

616
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:16,040
When arriving at your floor, grunt and strain to yank the doors open.

617
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,200
Then act embarrassed when they open by themselves.

618
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,080
Number 13.

619
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,420
Greet everyone getting on the elevator

620
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:28,360
with a warm handshake and ask them to call you Admiral.

621
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,100
Number 14.

622
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,620
One word.

623
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,380
Flatulence.

624
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,960
Number 15.

625
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:42,560
On the highest floor, hold the door open and demand that it stay open

626
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,280
until you hear the penny you drop down the shaft go clink at the bottom.

627
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:49,940
Number 16.

628
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,260
Do Tai Chi exercises.

629
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,880
Well, alright, let's make a mark.

630
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,780
Oh, excuse me there, I didn't mean to hit you in the ear.

631
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,140
We'll make a mark here where we go on to the next subject, which is, friends, there are

632
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,940
some subgenius de-vivals coming up, and I'm going to go through these real fast because

633
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,600
you don't all live in any of these towns.

634
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:17,140
But, uh, get your pencils ready because on May 13th, Saturday, we'll be doing a bookstore

635
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,740
signing and de-vival.

636
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,500
Yes, we'll be preaching the word of Bob and signing books and selling stuff.

637
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,400
Uh, yeah.

638
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:31,260
Uh, in Austin, Texas, May 13th at a bookstore called Adventures in Crime and Space.

639
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,300
They're on 6th Street.

640
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,860
So, uh, you know, just look in your paper, man.

641
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,100
It's Adventures in Crime and Space Books.

642
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,020
It's a double bill, actually, at 2 in the afternoon.

643
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:47,440
Uh, Sister Nancy Regalia will be there to, uh, well, she's in her secret life.

644
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:53,440
Nancy is a horror writer, and she wrote these vampire stories about Sonia Blue.

645
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,840
And, uh, she's going to be talking about that.

646
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:01,800
But then at, uh, 4 o'clock to 6 o'clock, yes, the man chosen by J.R. Bob Dobbs himself

647
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,920
to be the official translator of all Dobbs droppings will be in that store signing and ranting.

648
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,360
That's me.

649
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,340
Um, that's what they say.

650
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:14,520
And, uh, friends, remember, the first hit is always free.

651
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:22,100
Um, and we should also be, be, uh, visiting on that weekend with the legendary G. Gordon Gordon

652
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,420
as well as Colonel Sthal.

653
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,840
And, uh, I can't tell you where that is at.

654
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,840
That's, uh, what we're actually going to be doing there.

655
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,500
So, uh, we'll be doing it.

656
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,320
Uh, we're going to be visiting the

657
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:43,000
um, uh, I can't tell you anything more about that.

658
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,380
Because we don't know for sure if that's going to happen.

659
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,800
But, uh, you can talk to Nenslow.

660
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,100
Just ask Nenslow about that.

661
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,100
That's in Portland, Oregon.

662
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,100
No one there hears this show.

663
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,240
So it's a moot point.

664
00:45:52,240 --> 00:46:00,080
However, there's a lot of folks in Atlanta listening via WREK in Atlanta.

665
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:09,920
Yes, July 14th and 15th, DragonCon, the giant science fiction fantasy convention where the subgenius devivals are about the only nonfiction events.

666
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,580
And last year's was a great one.

667
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:19,520
This year we'll probably have Dr. Legume and Father Joe Mama and definitely Reverend Susie the Floozy and yours truly.

668
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,900
And that's in Atlanta.

669
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,840
I think it's at the Hilton.

670
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:31,160
And last but not least, July 21st through 23rd, the Chicago Underground Film Festival.

671
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:39,860
Now, you sub-demies listening at WZRD in Chicago, you can go to this Underground Film Festival.

672
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:47,200
I'll be showing all kinds of horrible stuff that I did in years past with the help of Dobbs' money.

673
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,620
And Kenneth Anger, that scary, scary.

674
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,540
Satanist type of filmmaker will be showing his movies, such as Lucifer Rising.

675
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,180
And yeah, that's July 21st.

676
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:06,320
Well, just watch your newspapers for that Chicago Underground Film Festival.

677
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:10,040
It seems like it's going to be a hell of a party.

678
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,660
And what else do we have coming up here next?

679
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,260
Things to do on an elevator, number 17.

680
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:21,880
Stare.

681
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,920
Grinning at another passenger for a while and then announce,

682
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,200
I've got new socks on.

683
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,500
And number 19, Praise Bob.

684
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,200
Okay.

685
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:48,500
Dear friends, I have here a reading I would like to do for you from a self-help publication here by none other than Nenslow.

686
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,840
Yes, once again, more Nensletic ranting.

687
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,120
Not.

688
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:58,120
Spoken by the great Nenslow himself, but unfortunately by me.

689
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,560
But let's check some more appropriate background music, shall we?

690
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,680
Personal Freedom Now.

691
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,460
An essay by Nenslow.

692
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,140
Nenslow.

693
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:26,600
Any tips, dear friends, for freeing yourself from the constraints of friendship?

694
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,860
The following techniques have been tried and tested by experts, but they are not guaranteed.

695
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:41,300
A guarantee promises compensation if something doesn't work, and these alienating behavior patterns absolutely will work every single time.

696
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:48,620
If, after applying them, you have not become the most despised person you know, you aren't trying hard enough.

697
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,940
Use these simple guidelines as a basis for your own.

698
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:59,340
Only investigate it as 69% Then find out if you will proceed to the goal.

699
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,740
Never do anything you've ever thought of.

700
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:01,820
My friends.

701
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,800
Get drunk.

702
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:05,800


703
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:06,900
Be friends.

704
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:06,900


705
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:06,900


706
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:06,900


707
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,600
Everybody's wise.

708
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,720
I don't know a lot of, so I'll try this.

709
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:12,980
I am quite excited to find some help.

00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:19,240


717
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,980
Like Java, I believe you think that.

718
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:27,440
to them, drunks not only look bad and smell bad, they think bad. The only people who enjoy

719
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,660
being around drunks are other drunks. Modern science has not yet determined whether daily

720
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:37,820
drinking actually destroys the personality or if people with lousy personalities naturally

721
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:43,740
become drunks. What's certain is that drunks have no real sense of being a part of the

722
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:49,540
world, and this puts them in a constant defensive posture which can cause great pain and frustration

723
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:58,240
for any non-drunk who befriends them. Here then are the best and most successful approaches

724
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,500
for ridding oneself of friends, family, and co-workers.

725
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:13,200
1. Be a know-it-all. There are many exciting ways to apply know-it-allism and make yourself

726
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:18,920
very unpleasant to be around. Try researching one obscure byway of knowledge and bring it

727
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:19,520
into everything.

728
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:23,500
2. Be a good friend. When your friends admit they don't know much about it, they provide

729
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:29,180
you with a perfect opportunity to enforce your position of superiority by mocking their

730
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:29,780
ignorance.

731
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:36,680
If you are among the lucky few with wide knowledge and good recall, take every opportunity to

732
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:42,660
educate everyone you know by delivering long monologues on any topic they think they know

733
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:47,280
something about. This works best when they want to tell you about an intriguing fact

734
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,520
they've learned or an interesting book they've just read.

735
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:49,520


736
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,900
3. Be a know-it-all. Not only do you get to be an authority, but you deprive them of

737
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:58,380
the pleasure of sharing something they like, perhaps even making them wish they'd never

738
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,440
heard of it at all.

739
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:05,080
4. Be a know-it-all. The best way to be a know-it-all, though, is to treat everything

740
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:10,240
you've ever heard of except your personal field of favorite topics as old-hat, lame,

741
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:16,120
and juvenile, lacking any redeeming quality for genuinely knowledgeable people like yourself.

742
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,500
5. Be a know-it-all. Anything you don't already know all about can be a good thing to do,

743
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:19,500


744
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:19,500


745
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:25,920
and you can be treated as if it doesn't matter. This leaves your soon-to-be ex-friends

746
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:31,420
without a leg to stand on unless they abandon every field of knowledge not officially approved

747
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,220
by you.

748
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:42,080
2. Have a negative attitude. This one's easy. Just complain about everything all the time.

749
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:49,040
Make sure everyone knows how much you think life sucks. Since perfection is unobtainable

750
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:55,100
in this world, there's always something wrong with everything, giving you limitless opportunities

751
00:51:55,100 --> 00:52:02,700
to bitch about anything, anytime, anywhere. Conversation lagging? Fill it in by telling

752
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:08,480
your latest unpleasant experience. The weather, the government, other people, your job, your

753
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,480
other friends , all these and millions of other topics are fair game

754
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:19,480
for dissection. Ignore anything that looks okay, and seek out anything of which you don't

755
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:25,120
approve. It won't take long, believe you me. Be careful, though, because some people

756
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:30,480
use complaining as a form of communication, and actually gain comfort from sharing complaints.

757
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,580
You can count them out by drowning them out. Which leads to our next technique.

758
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:43,520
3. Disregard the feelings of others. Let's face facts. You are the only person who really

759
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:49,280
matters, and everyone else has to conform to your standards. So talk about yourself

760
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:56,080
all the time. Start sentences with I as much as possible, and tell everyone all about

761
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:01,840
the many fascinating experiences you've had, especially in regard to high school drug use

762
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:07,000
and any military service you may have enjoyed. They're lucky to have a chance to be your

763
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,340
friend at all, and if they don't like what you do, let them go be someone else's friend.

764
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,760
You've had it rough, been rejected all your life, and now you get to judge. You get to

765
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,720
accept or reject them.

766
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,560
If they tell you how they really feel about things without being careful to tailor every

767
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:29,580
phrase to your tastes, if they persist in having opinions of their own, if they refuse

768
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:33,860
to accept you as ultimate authority on the correct mode of life, out they go.

769
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:40,100
So they feel bad they'll get over it. That's why you don't trust anyone, so you won't

770
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:45,980
feel bad when they inevitably reject you. Beat them to the punch, and be sure to tell

771
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:49,260
them exactly how and why they have proved themselves unworthy of you.

772
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:58,440
Strangers? Don't talk to me about strangers. They aren't really people. They're just hollow,

773
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:05,500
instrumental beings. Feelingless flesh robots, designed to do things that you don't like.

774
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:10,680
Take every public opportunity to put them in their place without actually provoking

775
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:17,420
violence. And if they obviously can't or won't fight back, pop them one and go brag to your

776
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,300
friends about it.

777
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:23,480
They'll be so repelled by your apparent failure to evolve that they may terminate

778
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,000
your friendship on the spot.

779
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,100
And here's another very valuable one, friends.

780
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:36,380
Be unbelievably fragile. It's a delicate and refined art to be both utterly insensitive

781
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:41,800
to others and insanely hypersensitive about yourself, but it can be done.

782
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:48,100
Start by interpreting any points of difference between you and your friends as a criticism

783
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:48,280
of our inappropriate actions.

784
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:48,280


785
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:48,280


786
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:48,280


787
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:48,280


788
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:53,680
of you. Think of their lives as a critique of yours, and the more you agree on, the more they

789
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:59,060
approve of you. When you find you disagree, immediately point out one of their inadequacies

790
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:04,840
to even the score. If you've done well on the previous techniques, you'll find plenty of chances

791
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:11,680
to put this one to good use. Keep telling yourself, there's nothing wrong with me, while you interpret

792
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:19,080
their individuality as disapproval. Go even further by giving vent to your emotional reaction

793
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:25,560
to things you think they're implying by any statement they make. You don't have to wait for

794
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:30,620
criticism when you can create it out of expressions, gestures, tones of voice, or many other

795
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:36,200
undisprovable subjective statements. If their explanation starts to look too much like you

796
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:41,400
really are mistaken, accuse them of having whatever motives you think they're about to say you have.

797
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:48,660
It doesn't have to make sense as long as you come out on top. Or try these quick tips.

798
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:55,360
Always demand their attention. Never give them yours. Use those long dead periods in the

799
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:00,320
conversation when the other person is talking to prepare the next portion of your monologue,

800
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:09,100
like this one. Tell the same few stories over and over in great detail. This works best when drunk.

801
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,340
Pick your favorites and stick with them.

802
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:18,580
Making them longer each time. Never let others apply the same standards to you that you apply to them.

803
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,840
Be sure they know how silly they are to be upset when you destroy their personal possessions

804
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:31,340
through negligence. Mock any display of sincerity, sensitivity, or emotion you see in your friends

805
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:38,340
or others as weak or childish. Evade any responsibility for your reactions by blaming

806
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:41,660
whoever or whatever inspired the reaction. It's their fault.

807
00:56:41,680 --> 00:57:09,980
Man in a car.

808
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:56,800
oline

809
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:19,240
suffering victim. Send friends a copy of this rant with everything that you think applies to them

810
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:26,800
underlined in red. Yes, friends, millions of people use these valuable techniques every day

811
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:32,460
without even thinking about it. If you're like them and you've already lost most of your friends,

812
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:38,420
maybe you can find other ways of using this handy guy. Any of these techniques can be used to gain

813
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:45,040
friends simply by eliminating it permanently from your life. Sometimes just taking a good look at

814
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:50,260
ourselves and trying to see if we do any of these things we really hate in others is all it takes to

815
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:58,340
begin making ourselves better people. We can't do that though until we realize that everyone else is

816
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:06,440
just as human, just as sensitive, and just as desirous of attention and respect as we are.

817
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:16,880
Oh yes, and what a touching end to quite a wonderful self-help rant by Nenslow. Dear friends,

818
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:23,220
you are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack. And if you want more information

819
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:31,220
on the teachings of the Church of the Subgenius, Nenslow, or Bob, Bob Dobbs, you can write to Bob.

820
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:38,360
You can write directly and personally to that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs. And his post office box number is...

821
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:45,160
as follows. Got the pencil ready? That's w-what happened to the music?

822
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,880
philanthropy

823
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:53,820
Ok, that pencil ready is post office box

824
00:58:55,780 --> 00:59:06,180
1080306 Dallas Texas 75214, once again that's PO Box 140306

825
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:10,660
Dallas, Texas 75214

826
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:14,120
Ah yes, and I have no idea what we're going to play next

827
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,100
But I'm sure that it will be hilariously wonderful

828
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:17,960
Oh wait, yeah, I did

829
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,180
Excuse me

830
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,980
I didn't know what we'll put on next

831
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:24,380
This is Dr. Dinosaur with his latest report

832
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,680
From the Institute, thank you

833
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,740
Greetings from the Yeti Geneti Research Institute

834
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:36,100
This is Dr. Dinosaur, regional Tibetian Rantarian

835
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,660
And primary researcher

836
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,800
The doctor is on

837
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,740
Among the many projects constantly being developed

838
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,260
And exploding here at the Institute

839
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,160
Is the SCEEB device

840
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,060
Or the Self-Contained Exploding Head device

841
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,440
Using the high-pressure anti-vacuum

842
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,080
Created by explosive decompression of pinkness

843
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,260
We can promise consistent launching of any head

844
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,460
From any stage

845
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,720
To any place

846
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,840
For any distance

847
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:07,620
Unfortunately, so far it remains at the any head level

848
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:11,420
We cannot yet promise which head it will be that launches

849
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,580
Another startling discovery in loud noise

850
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:19,200
Is our Slackion particle accelerator

851
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,780
The development of this project

852
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,600
Was the reason that funding was cut

853
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,580
For the Superconducting Super Collider

854
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:29,040
That little pellet gun of a matter blaster

855
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:31,700
With the Slackion particle accelerator

856
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,660
We have been able to measure the local density of the luck plane

857
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:37,180
And influence its warpage and woofage

858
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:40,440
In order to tune the flow of reality in any manner we wish

859
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,540
In fact, this is the only way the device can exist

860
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,340
Its entire output must be directed at searching out the exact luck pattern

861
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:52,260
Which allows it to stay in operation without exploding

862
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:55,980
And taking most of the matter-energy universe with it

863
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,580
The accusation that its inevitable failure will doom the various races

864
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:01,680
Uber races, and other projects that are in the process of being destroyed by the SCEEB device

865
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,180
And gods in its vicinity

866
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:06,160
To be completely obliterated

867
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,200
Is entirely unfounded

868
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:13,520
We are, however, accepting donations to help pay the electric bill

869
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,800
This is really, really important

870
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,720
That's all for now from the Institute

871
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,120
