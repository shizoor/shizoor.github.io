1
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,720
Oh my, oh, oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, he's not dead, he's not, like that.

2
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:54,520
And now, the subgenius hour of SWAC!

3
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:06,520
I sometimes feel that I am impersonating the dark subconscious of the whole human race.

4
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,740
I love the smell of my cum in the morning.

5
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,780
You'd much rather have us happy and satisfied, believe.

6
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,360
Smells like...

7
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,260
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

8
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,940
I hate you.

9
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,620
I hate you.

10
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:39,680
Oh, oh, oh renovation Sorry, REVENGE

11
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,600
TheultricÃ©mon

12
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:09,640
Ah, yes, dear friends, that new itchy and slacky music at the top was by Reverend Artemia Salino.

13
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,280
And, well, folks, I put this show together last night, April 7th.

14
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,120
It's made from three weeks' worth of The War shows.

15
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,180
And this morning I got up and they were yanking down that big statue of San Jose,

16
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,440
effectively making this show instantly out of date.

17
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:44,060
Luckily, thanks to time control, I had already mixed a segment on time control into this show.

18
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,900
See, Bob always brings an excuse.

19
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,080
And Fernanda Nandeli-Murr always brings the collages.

20
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,460
They go in between.

21
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,100
The ESPN.

22
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,860
And this time we also have a running collage by champion Jack Codini

23
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:07,160
and some mystery clips culled by Reverend Inkpay Ispay.

24
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:15,820
And, as well, we have the world premiere of excerpts from Obsessions for Oil by Halim Eldab.

25
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,080
Seriously, Halim Eldab.

26
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,100
You'll be able to tell which one is which.

27
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


28
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,400
Which parts, those are my friends.

29
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:35,960
Anyway, again, this show is, well, it was assembled just before the fall of Baghdad on April 8th.

30
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,660
So take your medicine accordingly.

31
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,760
From NPR News in Washington, I'm a mysterious pneumonia-like illness.

32
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,120
The disease has afflicted more than 150 cunts in the U.S.

33
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,900
A summit meeting in Washington.

34
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,100
A summit meeting in Washington.

35
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,100


36
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,100


37
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,100


38
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,100


39
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,100


40
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,680
President Dick Cheney's butt prefers to characterize today's meeting as a last-ditch effort at a mysterious butt illness.

41
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,860
NPR's Don Gagne prefers Dick Cheney's butt with deadly gas.

42
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,940
White butt.

43
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,080
They have tried to stretch it out as far as they can.

44
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:19,420
That's why the British proposed this is a butt for them to come and to come again to country.

45
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,280
NPR's Don Gagne reporting sores.

46
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,860
The German foreign ministry has issued a sore dick for all Germans comedially.

47
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,180
German officials also plan to close its butt once all Germans have left safely.

48
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,660
Saying butt inspectors should be given more cunts to do their jobs.

49
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,100
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has vowed to retaliate if Iraq's butt strikes Israel.

50
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,120
According to Sharon, the threat of butts is low and Israel has the support of U.S. cunts.

51
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,300
Palestinian butt doctors say an American woman reports.

52
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,100
Palestinian doctors laying in front of a Palestinian house.

53
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,840
Dumped a large quantity of cotton on head and chest wounds.

54
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,540
International peace activists from Europe and America regularly attempt to strip by tunnel.

55
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,380
Israel says it carries out Palestinian Peter smuggled in from Egypt by butt.

56
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,300
The army said it was due to alerts about possible dicks against cunts.

57
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,680
You're listening to cunt Peter butt dick news.

58
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:22,060
You know that um, you know that, you know, you know, you know.

59
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,400
You know.

60
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,640
You're on.

61
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,760
Yeah, man, I know.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,460
Uh, you know.

63
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,700
You know.

64
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,980
Come on, you know.

65
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,060
But, but, but, um, uh, uh, uh.

66
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,420
You know.

67
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,000
But, but.

68
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,500
By virtue of the way she's used her mouth.

69
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,740
Uh, that's so hard.

70
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,100
I have a message for the people of Iraq.

71
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,940
It is.

72
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,600
Go home and die.

73
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,980
If you talk to an individual when the flashback is occurring.

74
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,120
The American flag.

75
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,940
Actually believe.

76
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,680
Corporate scandals.

77
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,220
That it is occurring.

78
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:47,980
Recession.

79
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,980
Right then and right there.

80
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,100
If I hit ten divisions.

81
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,000
He's having a flashback.

82
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,340
I'm a businessman.

83
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,460
Oh.

84
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,380
Then our troubles here would be over.

85
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,940
Doc's town would be ours.

86
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,100
We have five nuclear weapons.

87
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,040
Beep.

88
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,200
Beep.

89
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,520
Beep.

90
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:01,700
Beep.

91
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:01,860
Beep.

92
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:01,960
Beep.

93
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,100
Beep.

94
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,240
Beep.

95
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,360
Beep.

96
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,500
Beep.

97
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:02,540
Beep.

98
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:02,580
Beep.

99
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:02,580


100
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:02,760
Beep.

101
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:02,760


102
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,340
Beep.

103
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:04,820
Beep.

104
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:04,940


105
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:04,940


106
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:04,940


107
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:04,940


108
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:04,940


109
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,300
Beep.

110
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,720
We were witnessed.

111
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:26,240
Beep. Beep. Beep. mixed, mixed, mixed.

112
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,180
confirmation,

113
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,240
subversion,

114
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:31,260


115
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,400
Beep. Beep. Bible,

116
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,860
Beep, Beep, Bible.

117
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,860
umen eagle,

118
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,100
and lastly,

119
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,260
and later on,

120
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,320
past few hours.

121
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,980
This is certainly a decisive and important step in which we fly about attacking the Republicans.

122
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,140
A three pronged bag which has been encircled by British correspondents.

123
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,960
Uh, duh, um, um, uh, duh, because special biological bags they need, you know, to peanut

124
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,600
whirr, uh.

125
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,100
Well everybody's heard about the BBC in London.

126
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,360
Set aside a small supply of canned goods.

127
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,040
They're safe from radioactivity.

128
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,280
Have a good flashlight on hand.

129
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,020
Electric lights may go out.

130
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Keep a first aid kit and learn how to stop bleeding.

131
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,580
Well, tell us about your adventures in London.

132
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,120
During the war, Dave?

133
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,220
Well first I was, I was captured very early.

134
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,720
They asked us to try and like, we were.

135
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,160
Dave, what platoon have you been embedded into?

136
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,080
Um, SAC Wing Command.

137
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,380
It's kind of a bird thing you wouldn't understand.

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,760
It has to do with plasma.

139
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,700
It has to do with plasm, the ether.

140
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,740
And it also has to do with reading the minds of the enemy.

141
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,120
Wow, that's the real, the real super cool secret, PSYOPs, right?

142
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,120
Yeah, I know.

143
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,340
PSY, PSYOPs.

144
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,540
Yeah, I was never understood what PSYOPs were.

145
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,800
PSYOPs were until I was in doctrine.

146
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,960
Now I'm a 33 degree, um, durd, durdmation too.

147
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,200
That explains the breath.

148
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,620
Well that's because, that's a true thing.

149
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,040
To become a full initiate and to learn all the handshakes, you do have to lick a foulest

150
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,840
animal's ass.

151
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,780
And it's called capitalism.

152
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,360
No, I'm just kidding.

153
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,180
I'm just kidding.

154
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,160
That's a joke, right, Dave?

155
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,980
That is way a joke, man.

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,940
That is way a complete and total freaking joke, man.

157
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,240
You're just making fun of those pinkos, those commies.

158
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,520
Those war, those.

159
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,440
They're a protester, peacenik, hippie, a dippy, a dippity.

160
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,080
She hard!

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,640
She hard!

162
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,600
The Cold War's over.

163
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,380
Well, finally those capitalist pigs will pay for their crimes, eh?

164
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,620
Hey comrades, eh?

165
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,880
Austin, we won.

166
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,060
Oh groovy, smashing, yay capitalism.

167
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,180
Is there one leader that we should be most worried about?

168
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,260
Uh, well, uh, George Bush.

169
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,820
Uh, just, uh, I saw him announce with one of those, uh, mass murder cases.

170
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,640
So, uh, he was involved with, uh, that's why he's, uh, had, uh, serious war crimes in,

171
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,100
uh, Iraq.

172
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,060
Yeah.

173
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:13,060
Trying to, uh, create some, uh, minor laryngitis or some permanent laryngitis against my campaigns,

174
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:19,040
uh, committed by the CIA and, uh, Bill Clinton's and, uh, just our former presidents, uh, George

175
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,440
Washington's and, uh, Benjamin Franklin with some resurrections that were, uh, top secret,

176
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,260
uh, behind closed doors in Washington.

177
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,540
Those are, uh, quintological galaxies and, uh, alphatronic, uh, rocket vacations and,

178
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,960
uh, humanoid, uh, space vacations.

179
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,520
Some are quadrilogical, uh, uh, chemical, uh, war crimes with, uh, some are tetralogical

180
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,800
cosmopolitans, uh.

181
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,640
The U.S. imperialist aggression against oppressed peoples of the planet.

182
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,100
Ghosts.

183
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,780
Speeches and books.

184
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,700
Hey, Joe, the president's speech.

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,120
We will gain the inevitable triumph, so help us God.

186
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,960
But what about those empty beer cans?

187
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,140
Those who wield them are ruthless and daring.

188
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:25,720
And I should like to see this nation turn out at least 50,000.

189
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,240
50,000?

190
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:26,440
Yeah.

191
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,720
Listen, this country can turn out 4 million.

192
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,220
We have to.

193
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,320
We can turn out 14 million!

194
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,960
But now we have only half enough of them.

195
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:41,640
For beyond the horizon lay the British Navy to police these vast and now empty beer cans

196
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,800
filled with menace for French dummies and a supply of fine beer.

197
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,180
And what had we done with it?

198
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,020
First, to those empty unguarded beer cans.

199
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,220
We would rather see London taste.

200
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,240


201
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,240


202
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,240


203
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,240


204
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,240


205
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,240


206
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,240


207
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,160
and abjectly enslaved.

208
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,320
Then the unbelievable again.

209
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,540
And down she goes.

210
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,420
Well, while you're standing here

211
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,280
joking around, our troops are

212
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,380
in the most horrible, horrible environment.

213
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,040
What if it was all media, Stang?

214
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,440
Huh?

215
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,380
What if it was all a big media gag?

216
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,720
There were no casualties.

217
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,980
There were no even Iraqi irregulars.

218
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,620
Except for the ones that couldn't go

219
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,840
and had to take Metamucil.

220
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,300
So it'd be like heaven.

221
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,280
It'd just be like Burning Man.

222
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,800
It would be like heaven.

223
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,600
It would be exactly like Burning Man.

224
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,720
And just like Burning Man,

225
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,860
there would still be the strange

226
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,420
psyops creeps walking around,

227
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,980
taking pictures of people,

228
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,820
asking strange questions.

229
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,160
Playing the weird music.

230
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,100
What do you think Dr. Legume

231
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,320
is doing here tonight?

232
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,640
What are you doing here tonight?

233
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,660
Playing your weird music?

234
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,960
Am I here tonight?

235
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,520
Yeah, this is tonight.

236
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,900
Dr. Legume is ex-military.

237
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:58,840
That's right.

238
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,580
Very ex-military.

239
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,320
I remember Dave.

240
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,160
Dave was with the 34th R.E.M.F. Battalion.

241
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,560
The R.E.M.F.

242
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,860
The R.E.M.F. Battalion.

243
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,900
The Felch Battalion.

244
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,840
No, I was not with the Felch Battalion.

245
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,000
I couldn't pass basic.

246
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,420
It was like passing a stone.

247
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,720
R.E.M.F. is a rear echelon motherfucker.

248
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,040
That's what it is?

249
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,160
That's what R.E.M.F. stands for?

250
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:20,520
Yeah.

251
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,260
It's like...

252
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,560
Dr. Legume, you're lying.

253
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,160
You're lying.

254
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,720
It's my language.

255
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
I apologize.

256
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,600
I apologize to any mothers out there who I may have unintentionally...

257
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,180
Snafu.

258
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,580
What's snafu is?

259
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,800
My crudisms and my ghetto talk.

260
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,080
Your crudities.

261
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,520
That was really quite offensive.

262
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,800
What does snafu mean?

263
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,140
Military guy.

264
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,680
Situation normal.

265
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,640
All right.

266
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,040
Yeah.

267
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,760
Of course, we know Dave was with the Medical Corps specializing in personal hygiene.

268
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,460
I was a cop.

269
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,560
He was a combat proctologist.

270
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,920
He was expelled from the military after the hoof and mouth incident.

271
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,720
He was arrested in 1992.

272
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,720
Well, how do you think they synthesized the original anthrax strainers?

273
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,080
Some of them were used for spaghetti and the rest were used for our own medical corps'

274
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,100
luxury.

275
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,180
So, were you the guy that did the SSA?

276
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,840
R.

277
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,640
R.

278
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,560

279
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,460

00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,240

00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,080

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,300
R.

324
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:25,540

00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:25,580

326
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:25,920

R.

330
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,600
the oil ads. We're off to Iran

331
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,160
to take the rest of the oil ads.

332
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,300
We're off to North Korea to take whatever that is.

333
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,780
We're pirates of the Persian Gulf.

334
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,420
Pirates of the Persian Gulf.

335
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
We're going ashore to grab some

336
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,540
Iraqi booty and take it back

337
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,880
to God's country, Texas.

338
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,340
That kickin' camel booty and firin'

339
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,020
broadsides from the Gulf.

340
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,520
God has come to me and shown me

341
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,300
a vision, and he said to me that

342
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,380
every Iraqi should have

343
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,960
the right, the opportunity

344
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,120
in this life to have a hamburger

345
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,860
handed to them through their car window.

346
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,980
To own a brand new SUV.

347
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,280
To live and share

348
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,060
in this beautiful condominium.

349
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,940
To have high-definition television.

350
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,240
To have digital, digital

351
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,040
plus high-resolution

352
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,440
computers.

353
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,800
5,000 channels

354
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,520
over the Iraqis.

355
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,140
And 5,000 gallons of donkey pus

356
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,960
all the way to the 70s.

357
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,940
And wait till they see those great new

358
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,140
Iraqi Muslim

359
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,340
stroke film channels

360
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,540
that we're gonna give them.

361
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,260
Oh yeah, the repressed people

362
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,440
cut loose, you'll see the

363
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,580
finest porn.

364
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,440
Centuries of built-up

365
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,260
oozing and spunking.

366
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,380
They're gonna rebuild the Tower of Babel

367
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,740
and make it look like a big dick.

368
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,320
Watch the Nashville channel.

369
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,500
Yeah, sure they protest now, but wait till those folks

370
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,640
are living the life of freedom and luxury

371
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,280
in the state of New Texas.

372
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,580
That's right, New Texas.

373
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,920
Home of more...

374
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,300
More than steers and queers,

375
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,100
now we got candles and beard.

376
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,300
Come on out to Georgia's

377
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,360
No Pork Barbecue.

378
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,320
That's right, at Georgia's

379
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,300
No Pork Barbecue, not only is the

380
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,380
Saudi royal family quite welcome

381
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,480
at all times, but there's no pork served

382
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,640
ever, never, no, we don't eat no pig here.

383
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,280
We cut steaks from the

384
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,800
finest fatted calves.

385
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,440
That's right, Babylonian

386
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,300
fatted calf.

387
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,500
We don't eat...

388
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,260
Is that perfectly right?

389
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,360
Right.

390
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:29,880
Acres.

391
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,160
Parcels cheaper than you can imagine

392
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,800
in New Texas.

393
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,580
Sign up now.

394
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,260
And after dinner, come on down to Knockers.

395
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,180
We'll be using that excess oil

396
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,160
to oil down a couple camels

397
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,040
and let the girls have at them.

398
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,260
You'll be singing the yellow rose of

399
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,220
Bostra when you try on some of these

400
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,340
naughty, naughty ladies.

401
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,680
You'll be so happy you'll hurt your goat.

402
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,060
Oh, see?

403
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,600
Oh, see?

404
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,920
Come on over here, all.

405
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,360
Knock, man.

406
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,260
And don't be afraid of me.

407
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,200
I ain't gonna cut off your head.

408
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,180
That's right.

409
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,120
Every day is barbecue day.

410
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,640
Hey, shove off and get your own, mate.

411
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,260
Thanks and shred.

412
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,540
Yes.

413
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,820
All this and more for the amazingly low

414
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,620
price of only, say,

415
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,960
what, maybe 50,000 lives this time?

416
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,800
50, 60?

417
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,660
Small price to pay for freedom.

418
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,680
Oh, screw those soldiers.

419
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,440
And 72 billion dollars.

420
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,660
Screw those soldiers out in the

421
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:27,900
Gulf.

422
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,320
Screw those soldiers out in the

423
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,320


424
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,320


425
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,000
hell with them.

426
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,000
That's what I say.

427
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,100
They volunteered for the shittiest

428
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,940
job in the world.

429
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,820
And by God, now they've got to do

430
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,020
it.

431
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,600
They must have known what they were

432
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,480
getting into.

433
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,600
You know, I really.

434
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,040
They did.

435
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,540
They volunteered.

436
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,920
I was there.

437
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,680
I volunteered once for the

438
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,160
shittiest job in the world.

439
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,620
But Bob was with me.

440
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,140
Some would say they were talking

441
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,140


442
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,040
I just happened to slide in there

443
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,360
during one of those short periods

444
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,540
when we weren't trying to kill

445
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:51,840
someone.

446
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,180
How come you're not still in the

447
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,040
military, Dr.

448
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,220
Lucky?

449
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,640
Because it's the shittiest job in

450
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:57,900
the world.

451
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,660
Well, Reverend Stang, aren't you listening?

452
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,340
And you fled, my politician.

453
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,260
I got smart.

454
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,840
Who else would just be sent out and...

455
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,140
Who else would volunteer for a job like that?

456
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,440
But the lowest of society's poor and uneducated.

457
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,680
But you got all those free implants and stuff.

458
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,560
Yeah, you got a chip in the back of your head.

459
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,000
We ain't got no digital angel, man.

460
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,740
We're all semi-normal and stuff.

461
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,060
Well, you know, the drugs and everything, but, you know.

462
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,740
Hey, what do you think old George Bush is taking, man?

463
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,320
He glows like a big dog when he does his speeches lately,

464
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,800
and he looks confused as hell.

465
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,080
What is that stuff?

466
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,280
I think it's Ibogaine.

467
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,200
Ibogaine?

468
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:31,960
Ibogaine, yeah.

469
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:32,900
Ibogaine, what?

470
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,040
Ted Muskie used to be hooked on that stuff.

471
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,180
What the hell is it?

472
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,700
Is it like, you know, a European drug?

473
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,760
Too much acid, man.

474
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,640
It's the downfall of every world leader.

475
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,500
They make it from chihuahua glee.

476
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,500
Officer, you're too late.

477
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,140
I've seen it all.

478
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:47,840
You have?

479
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,640
I can explain everything.

480
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,620
You don't have to.

481
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,060
I don't.

482
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,620
Don't worry.

483
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,240
There's nothing illegal about any of this.

484
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,120
Are you sure?

485
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:54,900
Of course.

486
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,660
This is America.

487
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,400
I see.

488
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,940
It's a free country.

489
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,180
Don't you know that?

490
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,460
I didn't know it was that free.

491
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:11,820
Secretary of State Powell will play up information to incite fear about Iraq's links to terrorist groups.

492
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,980
In all these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow a process.

493
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,620
It is to achieve a result.

494
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,820
The end of the civilized world.

495
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,620
Dave, if you support the troops, is that the same as supporting the president?

496
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,040
I'm confused about this issue, too, because I sure as hell don't support W.

497
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:51,640
Right.

498
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,360
Although I don't see no reason why somebody I know from down the street should get his head shot off,

499
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,520
because he's in Iraq now.

500
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,940
Well, but here's the thing.

501
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,100
At one point or another, somebody's going to say, well, what does that mean?

502
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,700
You'd rather have them Iraqis shoot our boys than us boys shoot them Iraqis?

503
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:07,920
Oh, yeah.

504
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,040
I'd rather have the Iraqis invade us, because either way, it's a good idea.

505
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,300
You know, I mean, it's so exasperating, isn't it, Steve?

506
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,480
It is exasperating.

507
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,000
Chaz, haven't you felt kind of exasperated over the last two weeks?

508
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,720
I'm tired of this one.

509
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,760
I want to, you know, let's go down with Iran now.

510
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,500
I heard that.

511
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:24,940
I'm tired.

512
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,160
I heard Iraq's a done deal.

513
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,720
Let's get on with Iran.

514
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,860
Well, just kick Syria.

515
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,340
We'll step on Syria on the way to Iran.

516
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,540
Syria's definitely got some shit kicking coming their way.

517
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,340
And then North Korea, and then Canada.

518
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,900
Well, the ultimate dumb down now is that these right-wing jocks have got people going, China,

519
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,140
next step, man.

520
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,000
We're going to make China.

521
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,060
Okay.

522
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,140
Okay.

523
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:44,780
Obsessions.

524
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,440
Obsessions.

525
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,080
Obsessions.

526
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,420
Obsessions.

527
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,360
Oil.

528
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,520
Oil.

529
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,220
Oil.

530
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,000
Obsessions.

531
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,700
Obsessions.

532
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,260
Obsessions.

533
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,940
Obsessions for oil.

534
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,680
Oil.

535
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,400
Oil.

536
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:01,480
Oil.

537
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,660
Germ warfare can wipe out an entire city.

538
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,340
Nothing could be further from the truth.

539
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,440
Biological warfare?

540
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,760
You're wrong.

541
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,040
You had better find out the facts about biological warfare or BW.

542
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,820
BW.

543
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:24,920


544
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:24,920


545
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,280
chests are big enough to capture a lifetime of fish all Environments.

546
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:31,840
We're right.

547
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:31,840


548
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:31,840


549
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:31,840


550
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:31,840


551
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:31,840


552
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:31,840


553
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:31,840


554
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,480
Get a copy of this official booklet at the first attorney's gadget.

555
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,660
Do your part.

556
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,900
And we can successfully combat biological warfare.

557
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,040
Robins will wear their feathery fire

558
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,240
Whistling their whims on the low fence wire

559
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,360
And no one will know of war

560
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,660
Not one will care

561
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,820
At last, when it is done

562
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,960
Not one would mind

563
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,980
Neither bird nor tree

564
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,440
If mankind perished utterly

565
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,260
And spring herself, when she awoke at dawn

566
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,300
Would scarcely know that we were gone

567
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,140
Bye-bye, planet Earth

568
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,680
Bye-bye, Mother Earth

569
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,420
Hey, babe!

570
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,700
Life after man

571
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,140
Well, you know the best thing that we can do

572
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,500
Is get those little red children together

573
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,040
In a pile, in a sprue

574
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,260
In a place where we can divvy out our oriental secrets

575
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,180
And slam them where it needs to be slammed

576
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,080
The little red children?

577
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,120
Are you talking about the Martians

578
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,000
In the Chinese Martian colony of moon miners?

579
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,900
The ones who influence our daily behavior

580
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,560
With a big pulsating bio-phonic thing

581
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,280
That changes our thoughts

582
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,200
From Mars that's directed towards

583
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,680
Our planet Earth

584
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:06,680


585
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:06,940
And our brain

586
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,680
Kick it open

587
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,060
Those bastards!

588
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,080
Those bastards!

589
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,620
Rotten Martian bastards!

590
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,840
That has to do with getting...

591
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,600
A spirit of national masochism prevails

592
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,280
Encouraged by an effete core of impudent snobs

593
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,220
Who characterize themselves as intellectuals

594
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,620
Wow, just doing my job

595
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,700
Did you know that the first Matrix

596
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,120
Was designed to be a perfect human world

597
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,420
Where none suffered?

598
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,960
Where everyone would be happy

599
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,380
It was a disaster

600
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,640
No one would accept the program

601
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,400
Entire crops were lost

602
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,360
Some believed that we lacked the programming language

603
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,660
To describe your perfect world

604
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,900
But I believe that as a species

605
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,660
Human beings define their reality

606
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,920
Through misery and suffering

607
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,960
The perfect world is a dream

608
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,820
That your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from

609
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,500
Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this

610
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,520
The peak of your civilization

611
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,800
The Matrix

612
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,020
The Matrix

613
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,500
The Matrix

614
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,140
The Matrix

615
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,280
The Matrix

616
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,280


617
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,880
The Matrix

618
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,920
The Matrix

619
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,720
The Matrix

620
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,720
The Matrix

621
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:40,720
The Matrix

622
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:41,900
The Matrix

623
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:41,900


624
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,060
The Matrix

625
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,720
The Matrix

626
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,640
Mommy is going to get similar

627
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,140
It's though you're crazy

628
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,940
United is how I feel

629
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,940
The Matrix

630
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:55,940


631
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:55,940


632
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:55,940


633
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:55,940


634
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,300
It's taught to the many

635
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,880
money fear money anger money war business

636
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
i'm afraid

637
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,800
i'm afraid

638
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:56,480
the first job is to look over your own home for shelter possibilities

639
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,860
if you live in a private home that is well built

640
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,280
you can live in a private home that is well built

641
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,140
the cellar is the safest place to be

642
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,180
the lower you get the more barriers there are likely to be

643
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,420
against blast, heat and radioactivity

644
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,300
select the basement wall nearest the probable target area of your city

645
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,480
if the house is blown over

646
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,880
it will most likely fall away from this wall

647
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,720
you can get fired for being anti-war or pro-war

648
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,480
listener discretion is advised

649
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,260
you can be removed from the air for being anti-war

650
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,740
and be replaced by somebody who goes

651
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,160
i flaked tom dad

652
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,260
i flaked tom dad

653
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,100
tom dashiell is to be shot

654
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,760
killed, solicited and hanged for being tom dashiell

655
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,260
getting out there

656
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,620
so what's going on somebody calling, somebody going because i, really

657
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,600
for some reason the real player won't work here

658
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,120
Somebody go out onto cbs news.com rather than

659
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,140
click on the bagdad cam

660
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,380
and let us know what's going on

661
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,480
on the bagdad cam

662
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,100
we're surfing the avenue of olives right now and it looks like

663
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,160
Like there are many people laying around just doing nothing, I guess.

664
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,520
There's a new look in the cars.

665
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,240
Blackened and smoking.

666
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,060
Yes, a no window look.

667
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,300
No tires and no human smells.

668
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,200
Oh, boy.

669
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,120
What have we got our show?

670
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,300
Well, I'm not there right now.

671
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:21,700
What the hell?

672
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,260
What do I care?

673
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,920
Well, Saddam's going to step out onto that balcony.

674
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,820
Gypsy woman told my mother.

675
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,280
I've got to get born.

676
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,020
Hey.

677
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,280
The king of the Middle East.

678
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,780
And you can take that in your orange bush.

679
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,200
Shove it up your tush.

680
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,820
I heard a woman on the air on one of these talk shows the other day who said all her kids were in the military.

681
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,580
And many of them were over there.

682
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,200
And she was an elderly African-American woman.

683
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,080
Quite wonderful.

684
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,420
Well spoken.

685
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,920
But towards the end of her conversation, she said, you can take that effing George W.

686
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,460
And stick that effing flag up his effing butt.

687
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,740
And it got on the airs.

688
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,640
I mean, the lilting.

689
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,700
She supports the troops without supporting the war.

690
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,500
If you can make that distinction.

691
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,140
Well, she's sending her kids cookies, but she's hoping they can eat them with mouths that still work.

692
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,440
Right.

693
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,560
Some people don't want you to make that distinction.

694
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,000
And that distinction, I believe, can be made.

695
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,180
In times of war.

696
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,300
I'll go back to blanket condemnations of my whole culture and heritage.

697
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,180
Carpet bombing, blanket condemnations, and carpet bombings.

698
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,340
I don't want you fighting.

699
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,380
Yes, ma'am.

700
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,460
I forbid you to fight.

701
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,600
Have it your own way.

702
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,180
Yeah!

703
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,760
Maybe you're right.

704
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,140
You're going to hear some ugly talk about this in school.

705
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,020
I did!

706
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:56,980
I did!

707
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,740
I did!

708
00:27:59,880 --> 00:27:59,980
I did!

709
00:27:59,980 --> 00:27:59,980


710
00:27:59,980 --> 00:27:59,980


711
00:27:59,980 --> 00:27:59,980


712
00:27:59,980 --> 00:27:59,980


713
00:27:59,980 --> 00:27:59,980


714
00:27:59,980 --> 00:27:59,980


715
00:27:59,980 --> 00:27:59,980


716
00:27:59,980 --> 00:27:59,980


717
00:27:59,980 --> 00:27:59,980


718
00:27:59,980 --> 00:27:59,980


719
00:27:59,980 --> 00:27:59,980


720
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I did!

721
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,760
I did!

722
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:39,740
I did!

723
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,000
I did!

724
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,860
I did!

725
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,080
I did!

726
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,080


727
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,080


728
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,300
You're been such a big part of my life, I didn't even notice the butterflies.

729
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,480
If you were certain I would rot in a suit, you wouldn't dare to say anything.

730
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,600
I thought that wasn't too bad for most Stop entered by a mustache but did wait just to be asked

731
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:47,680
to fire.

732
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:47,680


733
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,980
Hello, Hassler.

734
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:57,500
Ha-ha-ha!

735
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,880
This is my room, boss!

736
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,820
Ha-ha-ha!

737
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,940
core guys I surrounded.

738
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,600
Three or four of them, man,

739
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,320
they were dropping from trees and they could not

740
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,360
stand and they were easy to move

741
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,840
except for the heavier ones.

742
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,900
But McDonald's employees put up a fight.

743
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,400
They did. They defended the Golden Arches

744
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,540
with their lives and with

745
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,440
all of their hearts and minds.

746
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,480
Yes, they were

747
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,340
battle-hardened with an eight-year war with

748
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:21,920
Burger King.

749
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,020
Not only battle-hardened with that, they were

750
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,240
battle-hardened with the burger wars

751
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,920
of the 80s claimed thousands

752
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,740
of victims.

753
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,100
I can remember the 82nd Airborne

754
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,540
as they parachuted down

755
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,020
over the McDonald's parking lot

756
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,740
in my town.

757
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,500
And there was fearsome fighting from inside.

758
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,360
I'm glad the 7th Cavalry

759
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,520
was the lead guys

760
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,040
on the way to Baghdad.

761
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,900
Ronald's much-vaunted

762
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,000
berms.

763
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,480
Berms?

764
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,040
Berms?

765
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,280
Sir, have you been waiting by the berm?

766
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,900
The bus is not coming.

767
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,600
Dropping the berm.

768
00:29:59,400 --> 00:29:59,940
Dropping the berm.

769
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,000
An enemy would like nothing better than to have us

770
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,080
leave our cities empty and unproductive.

771
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,460
If an emergency should come,

772
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,680
our factories will be battle stations.

773
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,860
Production must go on

774
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,660
if we are to win.

775
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,360
Good, Speaker.

776
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,040
Okay.

777
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,400
And again, looking at the map for our viewers,

778
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,020
what we have there is

779
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,680
the division of the various hash

780
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,720
districts. All tremendously

781
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,820
important. It is part of

782
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,840
what is maybe

783
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:28,900
maybe

784
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,460
the second largest hash field on Earth.

785
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,720
They would produce clouds in neighboring towns and what have you.

786
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,020
Set on fire.

787
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,400
Thank you, Tony.

788
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,360
I knew now that my every impulse was to kill Bob.

789
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,720
But I had thought of one idea.

790
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,160
It was worth a try.

791
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,020
If I tried to kill Bob, I had to act like the doll.

792
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,880
Anything was worth a try.

793
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,860
But I didn't dare.

794
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,960
I had to act like the doll.

795
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,300
Yes, yes.

796
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,640
And I had to kill Bob.

797
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,100
Yes.

798
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,660
I had to kill Bob.

799
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,060
Yes.

800
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,940
Kill Bob.

801
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:13,660
Yes.

802
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,420
Kill Bob.

803
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,300
Yes.

804
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,720
I had a chilling urge to get out of my clothes and get out fast.

805
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,820
It's true.

806
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,580
Yes?

807
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,760
It's all true.

808
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,180
Yes, I understand that.

809
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,880
I had to admit it.

810
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,500
Uh-huh.

811
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,340
And I live near San Francisco.

812
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,820
Yes, naturally.

813
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,720
Well, I guess that about does it.

814
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:36,600
Goodbye.

815
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:38,880
Ah.

816
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,540
Let's talk.

817
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:39,860
Let's talk.

818
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,820
Let's talk about the big retired urban special surprising noteworthy religious flares in the Israeli desert.

819
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,480
Which I find a little bit comical.

820
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,700
Well, there certainly was a finding important intelligence.

821
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,100
Captain Bag Scope turned the lights off.

822
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,940
For that, I want to kick just about everything.

823
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:58,860
Thank you.

824
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:58,860


825
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:58,860


826
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:58,860


827
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:58,860


828
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,500
Thank you very much.

829
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,420
And, uh, thanks.

830
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,680
Uh, right?

831
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:02,520
Right.

832
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,040
Right.

833
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,640
I think that's very, very cute.

834
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,400
Goodbye.

835
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:15,440
The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently had an advanced nuclear program chemical in his arse.

836
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,320
Even while inspectors were in his country.

837
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:26,440
Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase seven million hydrogen powered doctors.

838
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,460
And the Western Wall.

839
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,380
Of the Pentagon.

840
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,160
Like a burning man.

841
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:36,180
Or maybe a gray guy all stiff that they just prop up and take around from house to house.

842
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,040
You can't trust anybody.

843
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,340
Not even the dead.

844
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,740
There were government trucks going up and down the street saying, walk towards the airport.

845
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,800
Walk towards the airport.

846
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,120
Resist the...

847
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,060
Ah, it was nuts.

848
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,560
I was going, oh yeah, sure I'm going to get out my nightgown and walk towards the airport.

849
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,480
We come from the western shore.

850
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,360
But half of the neighborhood was doing it.

851
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,680
This is it, man.

852
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,600
This is George's song.

853
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,140
The minions of the oiligarchs.

854
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,500
We have come to subdue your land.

855
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:04,960
This is George's song right here, man.

856
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,740
To take your resources.

857
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,880
Edwin Starr.

858
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,960
Yeah, the hammer of the guards.

859
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,360
That's a...

860
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,780
That's that big bomb they made.

861
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,120
It's a liar.

862
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,360
Yeah.

863
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,000
Oh, the bomb of the tall.

864
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,980
The only goal will be the western shore.

865
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,440
The only goal will be the western shore.

866
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,460
For the olives of death.

867
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,340
Robert Plant predicted this war in the year 1078.

868
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:55,240
Did you know Robert Plant went to Mali and went to one of those far out in the country

869
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,860
things and sang Whole Lotta Love with a bunch of weird guys beating on drums?

870
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:58,860


871
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:58,860


872
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,020
Yeah.

873
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,180
And they were playing the drums and playing ooze and shit.

874
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,760
Of course, have you seen the kitty cat version of this on the internet?

875
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,460
The little viking kitty cats?

876
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,160
Oh, it's hilarious.

877
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:08,880
It's so...

878
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,100
It's like cut out character type thing.

879
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,220
And they're kitty cats dressed as viking.

880
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,260
That's inspiring in these days of turmoil.

881
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,960
Viking kitty cats.

882
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,640
You purring and you pet them on the neck and they chop off your hand.

883
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,280
That's just like the world...

884
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,220
The paradigm we're faced with.

885
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,260
A new crusade.

886
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:28,860
A new crusade.

887
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:28,860


888
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:28,860


889
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:28,860


890
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:28,860


891
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:28,860


892
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:28,860


893
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:28,860


894
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:28,860


895
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:28,860


896
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:28,860


897
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,560
Guaranteed to wipe clean the shores of every land not touched by the red, white and

898
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:36,880
blue.

899
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,300
Word.

900
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:44,020
We'll all keep getting younger and younger until we suffer a fate worse than death.

901
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,060
Free life, then death.

902
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,700
Our offices and homes will also be posts of duty, not to be deserted.

903
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,840
With the help of the government.

904
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,520
With the knowledge of the first atomic explosions to guide us, our chances for survival will

905
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,560
be far better than those of the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

906
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,740
Here is a certain part that you do not understand in your simple diplomacy.

907
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,800
Yes, my little bird, who will die.

908
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,200
Oh, now you laugh at birds dying.

909
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,180
Bombing and killing many people is going to help a little bird.

910
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,820
Listen to the laughter of this little bird.

911
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:28,820


912
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,920
You are a dope bird.

913
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,660
There will be civilian bird ping pong, little bird girl.

914
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,780
But here is a simplistic Nickelodeon that you do not understand in your certain diplomacy

915
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,340
is that you are guaranteed to have civilian bird pong.

916
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:54,500
So now you try again to answer my question without ping power, little civilian bird girl.

917
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,820
How does this girl learn ping pong?

918
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:03,060
If you just answer his question, he will be happy.

919
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:11,440
I mean, I guess a little bird is saying that it seems like you need to bomb and kill a little girl.

920
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,240
Okay.

921
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,200
Thank you.

922
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,960
Thank you.

923
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,720
An attack could come without warning.

924
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,340
The sky would suddenly light up.

925
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,660
If the doorway is right at hand, use it.

926
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,580
If the nearest shelter is more than a couple of steps away, fall to the ground immediately.

927
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,040
You know, take your pick.

928
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,540
The lesser of all swines, that's what we're looking for.

929
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:34,820
Yeah.

930
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,280
Whatever you do, don't throw your vote away voting your conscience.

931
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,760
The U.S. Army and the Marines are going to be slipping it in overnight.

932
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Slipping it in where?

933
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,180
Like you got to ask.

934
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,680
But where will they put the disease?

935
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,780
Well, they're entering Baghdad from the missionary position, not from the rear.

936
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,540
Will they bring the disease home?

937
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,480
The probes have already done their job.

938
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,060
Now it's time for the main thrust.

939
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,660
We're just hoping Baghdad's well lubricated.

940
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,980
We've been bombing for days.

941
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:21,900
The filthy tunnels under Saddam's seat of power will be filled with the power of the American Marine as he rams home his victory.

942
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,720
Arby's, nasal, fluorine, nerve force, nerve, nerve force, nerve force.

943
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,260
Goat riper or goat roper?

944
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:34,020
That'd be cool if like the tank battalions came roaring into Baghdad with this jamming on their speakers.

945
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:34,420


946
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,680
He started it all way back then.

947
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,020
I ain't gonna lie to you.

948
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,660
What if the Iraqis came into Washington playing that, man?

949
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,000
Oh man, I'm getting scared now.

950
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,720
That's what I think they're planning.

951
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,100
Like there's all this talk that the Iraqis aren't fighting back.

952
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:51,740
No.

953
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,800
They're hiding in little trap doors.

954
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,580
Remember the saying about...

955
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,460
Remember that old hippie saying?

956
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:02,580
What if they held a war and no one came?

957
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,940
And I think that's what the Iraqis are doing.

958
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,460
They've got that old war movie poster.

959
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,440
Yeah.

960
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,760
What if they had a war and no one came?

961
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,040
None of them are coming.

962
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,340
They're just going, what would the U.S. Army and Marines do if they rolled into downtown Baghdad and there was a big rave party going on?

963
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,180
Everybody's dancing.

964
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,120
Yeah, big block party, man.

965
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,680
War is unhealthy for...

966
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,820
All those bombed out blocks filled with punks.

967
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,020
Osama bin Laden and other living things.

968
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,680
Smokable comestibles.

969
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,200
Yes.

970
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,920
Hummus and baba ghanoush.

971
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:31,900
Smokable little bud, you know.

972
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,880
Belly dancers.

973
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
Everybody's just sitting around.

974
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,920
Rasta dudes sitting around reading the Koran.

975
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,760
Discarnate feet dancing by themselves.

976
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,900
Burning incense and everything.

977
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,260
What if?

978
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,880
Well, back to reality now.

979
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,440
Yeah.

980
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,580
Back to raping goats.

981
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:44,920
Oh!

982
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,140
Ow!

983
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:46,840
Ow!

984
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,060
Ow!

985
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:47,460
Ow!

986
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:47,860
Ow!

987
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:47,960
Ow!

988
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,320
Ow!

989
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,360
Ow!

990
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:48,360


991
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:48,420
Ow!

992
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,080
Ow!

993
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,680
Ow!

994
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:51,220


995
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:51,420
Ow!

996
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:51,840
Ow!

997
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:51,840


998
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:51,900


999
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:51,940


1000
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,680
Ow!

1001
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,120
Ow!

1002
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:53,460
Ow!

1003
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:53,460


1004
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:53,540
Ow!

1005
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:53,540


1006
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:53,540


1007
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:53,540


1008
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:53,540


1009
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:53,540


1010
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:53,540


1011
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:53,540


1012
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,000
Wow, Striebeck.

1013
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,620
Oh, it's awesome.

1014
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,740
I'm looking for a shapely communist goat.

1015
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,700
A goat with shapely socialist curves and...

1016
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,800
You ain't going to make an old felch in my goat.

1017
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,960
Now let me tell you something, Strebeck.

1018
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,200
There are two things which clearly differentiate the human species from animals.

1019
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,800
One, we use cutlery.

1020
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,120
Two, we're capable of controlling our sexual urges.

1021
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,900
Now you might be an exception, but don't drag me down into your private hell.

1022
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,480
No way.

1023
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,860
Prince Fuzzwell and the wonderful First Lady himself.

1024
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:30,020
And also, of course, the presidential chorus, which will be accompanying the leader tonight.

1025
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:35,220
Tonight, there's going to be singing as well as the usual pep rally and cheering team.

1026
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,120
We've got the girls of the 401st Armored Infantry Battalion.

1027
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,240
They're going to be doing...

1028
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,540
Oh, the Pleasure Battalion.

1029
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,280
Well, well, they're employed.

1030
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,340
Let's just say they're on the job tonight.

1031
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,100
Nexus 7 models they've got in there now.

1032
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,420
Oh, they're all the black-haired beauties, the Baghdad babies, they like to call them.

1033
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,260
And they're made for confusion, and so are we.

1034
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,560
We'll about split a zipper just watching the training video for...

1035
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,940
The zipper is already in.

1036
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:05,820
My brain, yes, it's already to be zipped up.

1037
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,920
Things are getting much, much worse.

1038
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,580
Much worse over there in the land of hair.

1039
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,600
Where the people are cruel and nice and eat cheese and ice.

1040
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,860
Somewhere where we've never been.

1041
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,840
The world is cracking once again.

1042
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,180
I saw the darkness grow today.

1043
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,260
Have you seen it?

1044
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,600
The darkness grow?

1045
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,600
Yeah, I was just outside.

1046
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,980
It was dark already, and all of a sudden it was like, wow, it looks a lot darker.

1047
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,020
And I realized...

1048
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,380
That's because they set the oil wells on fire.

1049
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,540
That could be a shine effect from the atmospheric bubble,

1050
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,180
because the last time I saw the darkness,

1051
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,060
it was a scene of somewhere in the Middle East that got ho-hunk-um-dom bombed out.

1052
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,300
And so I think it's here.

1053
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,320
I think the darkness is here.

1054
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,580
Could it be?

1055
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,900
I carry my darkness deep inside.

1056
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,420
I carry mine in a pocket in a little silver bag, baby.

1057
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,900
They can bring on that darkness all they want,

1058
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,860
as long as I get my pizza delivered on time.

1059
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,580
That's right.

1060
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,480
That's what Dr. Leigh Eames said.

1061
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,980
As long as we get our pizza on time,

1062
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,060
as long as we can get our pizza in 30 minutes or less,

1063
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,260
we got no right to protest what the government's doing.

1064
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,840
Because we all have a pretty damn good life.

1065
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,460
And those brave soldiers are protected.

1066
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,480
They are protecting that life.

1067
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,660
They are protecting your right to enjoy your pizza.

1068
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,400
And yet there's the irony that the very man who would be delivering my pizza

1069
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,340
is over there defending my right to have that pizza

1070
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,920
while his replacement is delivering it.

1071
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,740
Well, he is delivering you from freedom.

1072
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,780
And his replacement is late.

1073
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,380
Not only pizza, he's delivering you from freedom.

1074
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,060
And freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom.

1075
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:53,020
Just another word for nothing left to buy.

1076
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,100
I thought you were going to say bomb.

1077
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,520
As long as the pizza's hot.

1078
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,820
Freedom's just another word for nothing.

1079
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,740
Nothing left to bomb.

1080
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,680
As long as the pizza's hot.

1081
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,420
It's a valid trade.

1082
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,300
I'm trading my freedom as long as the pizza's hot when it gets there.

1083
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,440
As long as there's plenty of soft slurpees

1084
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,900
set upon you by Arabic women.

1085
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,680
Isn't that what you're waiting for, LeGoon?

1086
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,560
Your own 7-Eleven with your own harem?

1087
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,480
You slut.

1088
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,400
That's all I can think about.

1089
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:20,920
That's right.

1090
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,500
I'm a 7-Eleven harem slut.

1091
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,100
I'm proud of it.

1092
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,220
I'm not ashamed.

1093
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,680
You can't insult me by calling me a 7-Eleven harem.

1094
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,000
I'm a 7-Eleven harem slut.

1095
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,120
You're not ashamed.

1096
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,960
You're a shamer.

1097
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,780
I had to come up from nothing, man.

1098
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,800
I had to come up from nothing.

1099
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,640
You're still not ashamed.

1100
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,160
I was just a parking lot of the 7-Eleven slut.

1101
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,240
He was just one of the unit guards before he became one of the sluts.

1102
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,080
I'm more from a...

1103
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:41,520
Give him credit.

1104
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,380
I'm more from a slime unit into the full-grown bling I am today, man.

1105
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,100
I...

1106
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,860
Oh, wait a minute.

1107
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:49,860
I...

1108
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,920
Either way, you're still a slut.

1109
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,540
I'm from nothing, man.

1110
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,900
I'm from nothing, man.

1111
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,500
I'm from nothing.

1112
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,240
And back to it you shall go.

1113
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:57,580
Well...

1114
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,220
It's all gino.

1115
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,320
What a long enough timeline.

1116
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,680
We all do.

1117
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,820
Well, I don't know if it's going to be so long.

1118
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,500
Aren't you paying attention to the avenge?

1119
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,980
I mean, not the avenge of war.

1120
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,320
I mean, the avenge in your own bowels.

1121
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,820
Just because we're at the end of it doesn't mean that it wasn't a long timeline.

1122
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,160
That's true.

1123
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,160
You confused the hell out of me, man.

1124
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,220
And that's what we call a baggy daddy.

1125
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,960
When you do something like that...

1126
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,960
Time control!

1127
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,140
Time control!

1128
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,460
Time control!

1129
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,180
That's why Bob wants you to have time control!

1130
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,400
Time control!

1131
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:28,780
Time control!

1132
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:29,660
Time control!

1133
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,660
Time control, an indispensable framework for freedom.

1134
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,620
Time, to the pink, is only what oozes through his watch.

1135
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,820
He sees not its total pervasiveness.

1136
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,820
The subgenius knows that time is what we beads are strung on.

1137
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,900
It makes possibility possible.

1138
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:51,480
It kindly allows us to feel we are continuous and mercifully hides from us that we are instantaneous.

1139
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,880
Time control is what we've wanted all along.

1140
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,380
It makes pain hurry and slack slow.

1141
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:57,880
All the moral and emotional work to continue and to eventually fall down.

1142
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:04,660
We perceive the lack of it clearly when, for instance, we are in a crowded room and must withhold a tremendous fart.

1143
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:13,200
In those hor Elliottless moments before the gas ball seeps back in, we consciously wish we could ignore it, and we could had we true time control.

1144
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:19,980
Any form of postponement or procrastination is a subtle bite of time control, and so slightly sacred.

1145
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,460
Even pinks strive for time control without knowing it.

1146
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:29,920
It is the reason they love stories, movies, jokes, songs, what are these, if not time control.

1147
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,320
Unlike mundane live experience, these media seem to compress time.

1148
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,200
They make events happen with more clarity than normality would allow.

1149
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:44,380
All the following are time control, language, writing, photography, recording, shortcuts,

1150
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,260
matter transmitters, stimulant drugs, fossils, pyramids, TV dinners, torture,

1151
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,920
daylight savings time, and prophecy.

1152
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:59,180
And so the subgenius pays attention to the strange rates and paces at which our lives are projected.

1153
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:05,280
He rewinds back to whatever memory frame he desires and lets it stand frozen for his inspection.

1154
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,900
He manipulates his own moods by splicing together the appropriate thoughts.

1155
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:15,460
For even hallowed time may be compressed, preserved, extended, traversed, frozen,

1156
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:20,500
twisted, reversed, knotted, circled, recycled, looped, and even erased.

1157
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,540
Time control is possible.

1158
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,440
Preserved.

1159
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:23,800
The past.

1160
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,820
Boil it down.

1161
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,280
Extract its patterns.

1162
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,020
And wield it without mercy.

1163
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,800
Cry havoc!

1164
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,500
And let's slit the dogs of war!

1165
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:39,200
A miscellaneous religion has declared war on the Christian business class of this land of the free!

1166
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,640
And if they are as dumb as we are stupid, you better start digging your shelter now!

1167
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,660
What do you know about the prophet above all?

1168
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:52,840
Authoritarian commerce machine careers grinding bones as they turn vain from a human!

1169
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,000
No!

1170
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,060
You know nothing!

1171
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,200
And what you do know is from the dead look in your father's eye!

1172
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,580
From the way the bank teller rubs the money!

1173
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,080
From how cops pose like action figures with hands on their guns!

1174
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:10,220
No matter what the truth is, they think their job is to make some superheroes!

1175
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:16,500
No matter what, the news anchors will sit there, smirk, and lie in your face!

1176
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,280
These people are no longer human!

1177
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,100
They do not blink, except when they need to breathe.

1178
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,440
So when the normal Duke tries to breathe, they don't blink!

1179
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:23,440


1180
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,340
And they convince you that no, they're not all bad!

1181
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,140
They'll come out straight in their pink face and say,

1182
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,900
Nay! Nay! Capitalism has mutated to a disease!

1183
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:39,780
And has infiltrated our masses with their Walmarts, their Starbucks, their oil, and their greed!

1184
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,420
Rotten Republic, uh, did that rant.

1185
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,040
New subgeni apparently, mysterious.

1186
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,640
They posted that to all binary slack.

1187
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,420
The time control lecture is a lie!

1188
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:58,040
The time control lecture is something I wrote 23 years ago that was almost used in Revelation X but cut,

1189
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,960
uh, now rendered in Machinespeak by Dr. Philo Drummond.

1190
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:07,620
Before that, Halim El-Dab, uh, did Obsession for Oil.

1191
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:14,100
And almost everything else on this particular next to the last of the war shows, uh, we hope,

1192
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:23,060
is by Fernanda Nandi-Libmer and ESO Swamp Radio of WCSB Cleveland, which is, uh, Professor Chaz Smith.

1193
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:30,840
And, uh, the host, uh, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, the longtime, uh, sort of, uh, creature that goes with that show.

1194
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:39,020
Princess Wiardo, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, and in this case, guests, Reverend Ed Strange and Dr. Katahdin Legume.

1195
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:44,100
The background music, uh, right now is by The Cosmix.

1196
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,280
Uh, spelled C-O-S-M-I-K-S.

1197
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:53,400
And you can check out www.thecosmix.com.

1198
00:47:53,420 --> 00:48:01,660
Uh, just remember that it's spelled The Cosmix as, uh, C-O-S-M-I-K-S.com.

1199
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:07,380
We'll start playing the other submissions, uh, in future shows now that the war is slowed down.

1200
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:14,220
And you are listening to, uh, the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1201
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,340
For more information, see www.subgenius.com.

1202
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,220
Subgenius is spelled without an O.

1203
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,400
Church of the Subgenius.

1204
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:26,760
Friends, see our website for information and a catalog.

1205
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:35,300
And I should mention, uh, just heard that they have let Revelation X, our last book, go out of print.

1206
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,540
Uh, so the last copies are soon to be gone.

1207
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,860
Praise Bob. Check the catalog.

1208
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:44,820
Uh, our first book, uh, Book of the Subgenius, is still in print at better bookstores everywhere.

1209
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,480
Let there be slack.

1210
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,660
Uh, yes.

1211
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,080
My boy.

1212
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,440
We're pilgrims in an unholy land.

1213
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,840
How does that make sense, though?

1214
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,660
I really like how convicted felon, Olly North, is a...

1215
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,060
Me too.

1216
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,460
...is a correspondent.

1217
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,920
I thought I was hallucinating for the first week.

1218
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:06,060
I did too.

1219
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,360
We all did.

1220
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:13,320
But convicted felon, Olly North, is a correspondent.

1221
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,200
Hey, that's Fox.

1222
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,340
Is it Fox?

1223
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,000
That's Fox.

1224
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,260
The same network that brought you Geraldo.

1225
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,080
The same network?

1226
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,060
And canceled Futurama.

1227
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:26,320
The same network where the guy who's in charge goes to Bush's residence, or the Oroville Orifice, frequently and says,

1228
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,460
Hey, I want this, I want that.

1229
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,340
And he says, Well, what do you want?

1230
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,380
And he goes back and forth.

1231
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,020
He's George W.'s buddy.

1232
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:32,420
Hey.

1233
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,060
Roger Ailes and all those other squimbags.

1234
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,620
You could be like that, too, if you would play the game.

1235
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,220
But you don't play the game, do you, Dick?

1236
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:43,100
Oh, I would have assets of over five million dollars if I played the game.

1237
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,060
Where's your stick?

1238
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:44,940
You could do that any minute.

1239
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,120
Where's the hockey stick?

1240
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,140
I'll play it.

1241
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:47,340
I can walk out.

1242
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,040
I can walk out at this college radio station and play it.

1243
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,180
I can play the game and be a millionaire.

1244
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:56,940
He could straighten his ass guard and pull up his long, slender socks up around his knees

1245
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:04,980
and walk, stride, yes, stride with his head held high, out of the door, into the stock market, and pull down his moon band.

1246
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,120
Tonight I have a message for the people of Iraq.

1247
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,680
Go home and die.

1248
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:24,420
The American flag stands for corporate scandals, recession, stock market declines, blackmail,

1249
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:30,340
burning with hot irons, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues.

1250
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,880
Thanks, brother.

1251
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,680
Dr. Holt is reporting for WXXI.

1252
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:37,680


1253
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:37,680


1254
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:37,920
Thanks, brother.

1255
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,320
Thanks, brother.

1256
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,460
Thanks, brother.

1257
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:43,800
Thanks, doctor.

1258
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,760
Wrong, Mr. Chekov.

1259
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:46,940
There are casualties.

1260
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:52,380
My wits are as enfrightened out of Captain, sir.

1261
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,400
You are my brothers.

1262
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,760
You are my sister.

1263
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,680
Across the sea.

1264
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,340
And my name is Peace.

1265
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,020
Peace.

1266
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,120
Look in the mirror.

1267
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,560
Look in the mirror.

1268
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,920
Look in the mirror.

1269
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:12,940
You're fired.

1270
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:13,660
You're fired.

1271
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:13,660


1272
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:13,660


1273
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:13,660


1274
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:13,660


1275
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:13,660


1276
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:13,660


1277
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:13,660


1278
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:13,660


1279
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:13,660


1280
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:13,660


1281
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:23,620
Hidden deep, hidden deep, your enemy hidden deep in your heart.

1282
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,480
Your enemy hidden deep in your heart.

1283
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,440
guitar solo

1284
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:06,480
One night, one night

1285
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,240
One night, one night

1286
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1287
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:20,860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

1288
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:24,140
Ooh, loo, loo, loo, yeah, yeah

1289
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,880
Ooh, loo, loo, yeah, yeah

1290
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:34,680
Oh, oh, oh

1291
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,300
You, oh, yeah, yeah

1292
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:39,300


1293
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,040
Ahh, yeah, yeah, yeah

1294
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,120
Ahh, yeah, yeah, yeah

1295
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,320
Well, the paroxysms have begun again.

1296
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,440
This time, the vegetable matter is cringing,

1297
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,300
and most of the humans here in the sack,

1298
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:57,020
the sack elevated nearly 3,000 miles above the city of Braggdad,

1299
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,860
5 million people below us,

1300
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:03,160
some of them still standing, other ones wearing their correct harpoons,

1301
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,480
cursing skyward and hoping somehow, someway,

1302
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,040
that the machinery fails.

1303
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,300
This machinery, this is God's free machinery.

1304
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,020
Machinery, free and full of liberty,

1305
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,640
and made for, uh...

1306
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,080
What was this made for?

1307
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,740
Holy mother of...

1308
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,700
Okay, all right, we're back now.

1309
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,200
Holy mother of...

1310
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,240
Please, for four hours.

1311
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:33,900
Hey!

1312
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,720
Hey!

1313
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:39,740
Hey!

1314
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:40,460


1315
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,460
Hey!

1316
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:41,920
Hey!

1317
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,380
Hey!

1318
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:45,700
Hey!

1319
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,520
Hey!

1320
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:47,680
Hey!

1321
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:47,800


1322
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:48,440
Hey now!

1323
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:48,900
Hey!

1324
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,520
Trusting in the sanity and restraint of the United States

1325
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,720
is not a strategy, and it is not an option.

1326
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,020
Well, things sound blinkier than they ever did before on this radio station.

1327
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,040
And blinkier, too.

1328
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:09,880
Man, I'm telling you.

1329
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,280
How much did you pay for that MP3, Chad?

1330
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,660
I taste only neoliberalism.

1331
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,580
the bitter rank waters of nihilism

1332
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,940
coming from this radio show.

1333
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:18,900
I can only say...

1334
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,780
Oh, here we go, this one.

1335
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,860
I hear no truth and no positive.

1336
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,620
Everything's all right.

1337
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,440
No love.

1338
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,760
Oh, now I hear some.

1339
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,320
A little small...

1340
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,200
What are they?

1341
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,040
They look kind of human,

1342
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,100
dancing in the grass.

1343
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:32,480
Oh, look, they got balloons.

1344
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,540
No, wait a minute, those are...

1345
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,720
Oh, man, those are exploding

1346
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,880
vests full of sutures.

1347
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,260
Oh, my...

1348
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,280
Those are the last of the Martians.

1349
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,880
Those are the nearly extinct Martians.

1350
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,160
They're frolicking in the little Martian field.

1351
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,680
Look, look, part of their brains are exposed.

1352
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,400
You could even have a night, little droogie.

1353
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,880
Let the world do without you tonight.

1354
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,520
It was me and my three drinks.

1355
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,160
I just decided...

1356
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,320
Those ancient Martians are partying

1357
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,500
on top of our very nuclear beer, Ram.

1358
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,260
Are you going to let them do that?

1359
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,380
Are we going to go in there

1360
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,380
and get our nuclear beer?

1361
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,780
For a new...

1362
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,720
Nuclear day tomorrow.

1363
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:14,980
The sun.

1364
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,260
Yes.

1365
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,360
The thousand suns

1366
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,580
of a nuclear holocaust

1367
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,740
are shining.

1368
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,420
I'm going to sell real estate, Sting.

1369
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,180
I'm going to sell those, um,

1370
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,880
those, you know, sandy things

1371
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,720
that have been turned to glass

1372
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,560
by the explosions.

1373
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,940
I'm going to send the great wastelands.

1374
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,120
I'm going to sell, uh,

1375
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,220
everything I can find.

1376
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:33,820
What's left?

1377
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,920
Oh, you're going to have to be

1378
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,000
in competition with J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1379
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,420
my friend.

1380
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,760
But what will we use for money

1381
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,680
as a change, you know,

1382
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,940
for exchange and stuff?

1383
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:41,520
Souls.

1384
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,320
Souls.

1385
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,080
I thought, you know,

1386
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:43,860
like maybe pemmican

1387
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:44,880
or pieces of butter.

1388
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:45,320
Human souls.

1389
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:46,900
Human souls.

1390
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And little liters of anguish

1391
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,600
and horror.

1392
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,540
Bottles of anguish and horror.

1393
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,900
Enthusiast form.

1394
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,560
You've been selling the same

1395
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,680
foul elixir for,

1396
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,540
since day six.

1397
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,160
It's a medium of exchange.

1398
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,380
Snake oil.

1399
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:01,880
Snake oil.

1400
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,740
And the exchange that creates

1401
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,080
the power of a thousand mediums

1402
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:06,080


1403
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,760
How many stangs of pain

1404
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,580
does it leave the past?

1405
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:09,920
No!

1406
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,720
Martian blood

1407
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:10,980
for the sake of life.

1408
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:11,560
Did you see that?

1409
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:11,840
No.

1410
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:11,860


1411
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:11,960
No.

1412
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,140
Did you see that new

1413
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,080
paid-for-view show

1414
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:14,480
called

1415
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,140
Harnford's Airborne Gone Wild?

1416
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:16,840
Yep.

1417
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,000
Yeah, pretty cool stuff.

1418
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,640
They put them on an island

1419
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,320
somewhere near

1420
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,600
the Gulf of Arabia.

1421
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,800
Give them all the tequila

1422
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,260
they want.

1423
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,720
And all the pemmican

1424
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,420
and saltwater corn.

1425
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,840
They get speed, too, right?

1426
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:28,140
Yeah.

1427
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,380
Harnford's Airborne Gone Wild

1428
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,240
We love speed.

1429
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,160
A parrot to wear

1430
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:31,840
on their shoulders.

1431
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:32,860
Each one has their own

1432
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:33,520
private, you know,

1433
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,320
they wear on their shoulders.

1434
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,260
Somebody follows them

1435
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,040
around with a camera.

1436
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,340
Well, the guy with the

1437
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,260
pet leg follows them

1438
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:39,740
with the camera.

1439
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,720
The guy with the one good eye.

1440
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,080
The guy with the one good eye.

1441
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:42,080


1442
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:42,700
follows them with the

1443
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,020
The guy with the peg eye.

1444
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,240
The aluminum.

1445
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,680
That peg eye

1446
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,760
is really a camera.

1447
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,780
The sky is as a peg.

1448
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:50,960
But it really works

1449
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:51,560
as an eye.

1450
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,720
I've seen plenty

1451
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,700
of peg eyes lately.

1452
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,100
I've seen people with

1453
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,120
actually with stakes

1454
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,580
driven into their foreheads.

1455
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,980
I'm having bad dreams today.

1456
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,940
I think the end is nigh.

1457
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,360
You think the

1458
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,080
collective unconscious

1459
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,420
is creeping into your

1460
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:05,920
It's balking.

1461
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,540
It's stopping at the

1462
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,740
terrible step it's ready

1463
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,260
to take into the latrine.

1464
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:11,620
I think it's

1465
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,240
It's a full moon

1466
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,360
and you're just, you know,

1467
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,420
kind of teetering on

1468
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:15,300
Well, how can we attack

1469
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,360
with a full moon

1470
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,180
in our eyes?

1471
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,760
We need a stellar thing

1472
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,000
We need a full moon

1473
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,540
A full moon

1474
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,760
to guide our stars.

1475
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,360
We need a full moon?

1476
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:23,680
Yeah.

1477
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,340
Well, I guess we got one.

1478
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,280
That's like broad daylight

1479
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,020
if you got those

1480
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,960
night vision things.

1481
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,040
Easier to shoot at, too,

1482
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,160
if you think of it that way.

1483
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:31,380
Yeah.

1484
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:31,640
Oh, well.

1485
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:32,660
Oh, yeah, the other guys.

1486
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:33,680
Depends.

1487
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,720
Well, what if we start

1488
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,560
shooting at each other

1489
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,500
like we usually do?

1490
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:36,680
It's hell.

1491
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,480
What, shooting at yourself?

1492
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,240
Here we are trivializing

1493
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,460
this hellish thing.

1494
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:42,920
That we don't really

1495
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,880
know anything about.

1496
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,600
We're trying to get

1497
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,800
a handle on each other.

1498
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,720
We're trying to get

1499
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,940
our nature running.

1500
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,220
We're trying to understand it.

1501
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,240
Keep your head on tight.

1502
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,140
You're back to the wind

1503
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,280
and you're sacking the saddle.

1504
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,060
Bums me out, dude.

1505
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:54,660
Yeah.

1506
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,520
Bums you out.

1507
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,440
It's going to bum you out

1508
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,580
pretty soon.

1509
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,840
It's going to be a bummer, man.

1510
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,020
Bob said so.

1511
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:01,620
He said,

1512
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,680
it's going to be a bummer, man.

1513
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:04,880
Your eyeballs are hanging

1514
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,780
from your socket.

1515
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,020
It's going to be really beautiful.

1516
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,640
He said that in 1980.

1517
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:10,940
Yeah.

1518
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,680
It's going to be fine.

1519
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,240
It's all right.

1520
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,460
It's all right.

1521
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,540
It's all right.

1522
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,720
It's all right.

1523
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,640
It's all right.

1524
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,760
It's all right.

1525
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,080
It's all right.

1526
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:23,980
It's all right.

1527
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,120
It's all right.

1528
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,340
It's all right.

1529
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,500
It's all right.

1530
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:34,880
It's all right.

1531
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,420
Wash the exposed areas.

1532
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,000
Pay particular attention

1533
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,000
to your hair. Get all the dirt from under your fingernails. If the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

1534
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,120
had known what we know about civil defense, thousands of lives would have been saved.

1535
00:58:53,740 --> 00:59:00,520
Yes, the knowledge is ours, and preparation can mean survival for you. So act now.

1536
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,080
Someday your life may depend on it.

1537
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,640
Emergency alert.

1538
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,800
Orange alert.

1539
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,300
This is an actual emergency.

1540
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,520
Orange alert.

1541
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,100
This station serves 50 equipment.

1542
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:39,040
If the time comes when you actually have to take shelter, lie under the table.

1543
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,940
I think you hurt my head real bad.

1544
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,300
I'm dizzy.

1545
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,500
I need a doctor.
