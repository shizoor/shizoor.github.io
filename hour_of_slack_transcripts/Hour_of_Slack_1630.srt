1
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,300
The Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,820
The Hour of Slack!

3
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,140
The Hour of Slack!

4
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,900
This is Operation Experiment, a secret base far north of the Arctic Circle.

5
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,280
Experiment was the code...

6
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,780
...code name for this top priority scientific expedition.

7
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,400
These men arrived here on X-Day minus 60.

8
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,460
It has taken them the full two months to get ready.

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,900
Today is X-Day.

10
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,320
It is now H-Hour minus 59 minutes.

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,560
There is less than an hour left.

12
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,100
You guys ready for a song?

13
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,320
Yeah!

14
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,280
All right.

15
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,480
Give it up for Alan.

16
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:42,080
It's the Last of Us.

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,180
As an intellectual, it is my duty to perform.

18
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,200
There is a responsibility to which I must enforce.

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,280


20
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,140
All the people of the world wake up, you're asleep

21
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,260
European land is slaughtered like mindless sheep

22
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,120
Aliens did 9-11, FEMA is taking our guns

23
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,560
There's no go inside the pyramid, the earth does not read

24
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,980
All around the sun

25
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,160
Yes sir

26
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,960
A flag attack, yes sir

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,720
A flag attack, yes sir

28
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,760
A flag attack, yes sir

29
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,780
A flag attack

30
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,260
Ha ha ha

31
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,500
Cause you see, the police are really lizards

32
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,260
The moon is owned by Jews

33
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,400
The Freemasons will run Monsanto

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,620
And there's fluoride in our booze

35
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,840
We got chemtrails in

36
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:49,940
We got chemtrails in

37
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:49,940


38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,180
We got GPS in our shoes

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,140
But trust me cause you know I care

40
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,080
And what have you got to lose?

41
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes sir

42
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,300
Yes sir

43
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,960
A flag attack, yes sir

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,920
A flag attack, yes sir

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,720
A flag attack, yes sir

46
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,720
A flag attack

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,320
Yeah sir

48
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:43,940
I know it's said that it couldn't decide

49
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:43,940


50
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,300
We're learning about history

51
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:44,940
We didn't learn at all

52
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,300
It's what we do

53
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:45,300


54
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:45,300


55
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:45,300


56
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:45,300


57
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:45,300


58
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:45,360
Thats right

59
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,360


60
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,820
Deutz

61
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,540
Deutz

62
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:47,800
Daızın

63
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,940
We did that on picture

64
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:49,940


65
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:59,180
the game just blame heart when you get locked out of your house just blame heart when you hear

66
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:06,800
disinformation just blame the lizard face plus a king top has a one percent that insidiously

67
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,460
plans your inevitable devil only to declare a lot to leave labor force a broken spirit

68
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,920
homo sapiens

69
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,540
don't worry

70
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,860
i guess you're back i'm an american

71
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,520

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,060
i like to eat meat i like to make love

73
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,680
i'm talking about the water they put that turns the freaking frogs gay

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,940
don't take my children away from me

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,820
well dear friends that was dr argus fox and the right angles

76
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,680
from a cd and uh

77
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,680
and doctor hall is here

78
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,780
hello

79
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:22,060
Start İ사랑

80
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:30,180
there's no point and needs just stating the obvious

81
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:30,420
what

82
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,180
friends are holding single thing that's that

83
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,040
all of their words changes and escort fashion

84
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,340
those somber really disturbing revelations the

85
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,140
that were revealed during the course of actually,

86
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:52,700
we're going to play a recording of the event shortly.

87
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,280
But first, since we have Dr. Howell in the studio,

88
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,480
and since he has at least three new songs that we haven't heard,

89
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,020
which, by the way, we will also be following up this show

90
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,160
with Dr. Sinister's show for the next three hours.

91
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,040
But, so what is this new one that you guys have?

92
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,620
Well, it's a traditional tune called I Am a Subgenius.

93
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,180
I can't wait.

94
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,080
G-E-R Bob Dobbs

95
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,780
I am your man who calls your name

96
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,000
G-E-R Bob Dobbs

97
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,060
And through this world I'm bound to ramble

98
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,380
To spread your word and slackful fame

99
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,760
To spread your word and slackful fame

100
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,420
I am a subgenius

101
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,340
Of yeti stock and ancient blood

102
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:06,420
I seek for slack where I can find it

103
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,480
Through storm and calm

104
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,720
And fire and flood

105
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,820
He seeks through storm

106
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,060
And fire and flood

107
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,380
You must hear his story

108
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,700
And let his words and work be known

109
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,500
Don't let the conspiracy prevent you

110
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,820
From finding slack that's all your own

111
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,360
Go find the slack

112
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,880
That's all your own

113
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,740
Go find the slack

114
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,700
That's all your own

115
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,120
Go find the slack

116
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,120


117
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,760
Go find the slack

118
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:47,760


119
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,060
Wow.

120
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,440
Was that song in Oh Brother Where Art Thou?

121
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,640
No, not in the version that most people see.

122
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,400
That was wonderful.

123
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,000
It is similar to The Man of Constant Sorrow,

124
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,600
but it's not the same tune,

125
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,500
but it is in the same voice, certainly.

126
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, that's wonderful.

127
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,980
Well, I'm glad to get a nice clean recording of that.

128
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,780
Thank you.

129
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,480
We should have a couple more songs coming up.

130
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,300
I do have to play this revelation tape, as it were.

131
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,780
It was, what night was it?

132
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,460
Tuesday night?

133
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,600
No, Wednesday.

134
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,740
No, Sunday night at X Day.

135
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,880
An event occurred.

136
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,200
Yes, Sunday night at X Day,

137
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,000
and the professional film crew was there.

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,100
To shoot it, I don't have their footage.

139
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,900
And there are, well, there's this artifact

140
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,380
that you just have to see a picture of.

141
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,040
We'll try to describe it when the time comes.

142
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,920
Oh, it looks like that might be Lonesome Cowboy Dave, is it?

143
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,740
It is. I'm aboard.

144
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,060
Oh, good. Okay.

145
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:02,980
Well, friends.

146
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,660
Well, I'm not a piece of wood, but I mean, I'm part of the, yeah.

147
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,000
We're all together waiting.

148
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,200
And we're waiting once again to depict your glandular dysfunction, right?

149
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:15,960
Yeah.

150
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,300
Well, unavoidably, yeah, not going out of our way to do so.

151
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,740
What I'm going to do is play this recording.

152
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,800
It goes for 23 minutes.

153
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,100
Moves pretty fast, actually.

154
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,320
I may fade in at a couple of points to explain,

155
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,900
give a blow-by-blow description.

156
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,940
And I'm going to fade all of our microphones,

157
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,440
all of our microphones out for the most part

158
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,700
so that we, like the listeners, can only hear but not speak

159
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:54,140
during this possibly very troubling moment.

160
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,640
Well, we have to accept it.

161
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,100
Okay, I'm going to bring Dave down.

162
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,440
I'm going to bring you guys down.

163
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,400
You're going to bring me down, Daddy Owen.

164
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,600
And here, we'll see what happens.

165
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,360
On January 1st, 2016,

166
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,500
the Subgenius Foundation received an envelope in the mail,

167
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:24,340
an overdue bill for a storage locker in Washington State.

168
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,660
By coincidence, I happen to live in Washington State,

169
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,880
having moved there recently,

170
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,740
and Reverend Stang sent me the address of the storage locker,

171
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,920
and it was registered to, you know,

172
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,440
it was registered to J.R. Bob Dobbs.

173
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,460
There were certain items that were in the storage locker that were retrieved.

174
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,820
I'm a little freaked out by what's about to happen here,

175
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,640
and it takes a lot to freak me out, but...

176
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,980
You freaked the out of me.

177
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:07,860
Let me tell you, just, would he explain to me what they found in that storage locker?

178
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,240
The first thing I found was a plan,

179
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,120
a blueprint, a diagram.

180
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,680
It was of vital, valuable importance to the church.

181
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,020
Here it is.

182
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:31,160
And it has the blueprint for a radio for contacting the exists.

183
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,820
As I attempted to follow these instructions in this blueprint,

184
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:46,260
I, uh, I just got more and more disturbed at some of the things that I had to do.

185
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:52,340
And I found out some information that was sort of disturbing.

186
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:01,660
On July 5th, 1998, everybody assumes nothing happened.

187
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,800
But in fact, something did happen.

188
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,300
What?

189
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,520
The saucers.

190
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,200
The saucer did arrive.

191
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,100
They sent one saucer from the subgeniuses.

192
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,760
People have joked about this before.

193
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,820
And, uh, it was real funny when it was a joke.

194
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:29,500
You kind of hinted at the idea that perhaps the exists just sent a very tiny flying saucer and nobody saw it.

195
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,460
Ha ha ha ha.

196
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,740
As it turns out, that was the truth.

197
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,920
But only one person was affected on X-Day.

198
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,480
The exists, having arrived in their tiny little saucer,

199
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,000
realized that there was no way they were going to make it back to Planet X.

200
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,540
And there certainly was no way they were going to be able to take their payload.

201
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,480
And without the subgenius souls to power the ship, there's no way it could make it back.

202
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,100
The saucer...

203
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,040
There's no really delicate way of putting this.

204
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:16,960
The saucer flew up into the reproductive organs of a female subgenius that we're not going to name.

205
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:28,080
The saucer chose this particular female subgenius because she had the most concentrated Dobbs DNA in her bloodstream.

206
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,960
Ha ha ha.

207
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,080
She just had a higher level than anybody else there.

208
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,620
And so the saucer began to harvest that Dobbs DNA

209
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,460
and attempted to meld it with alien technology

210
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,740
to create a storage device, as it were,

211
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:55,320
to store access codes to contact the exists.

212
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,980
Now...

213
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,120
You're probably asking, how does he know all this?

214
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,480
How do you know all this?

215
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,300
Well...

216
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,440
Dr. Le Guim, at this point, produces a beat up old box.

217
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,960
It all sounds very scientific, but it was messy.

218
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,960
It looks like something from the 50s.

219
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:27,880
You know, they say that any sufficiently advanced technology will appear to be magic to people who don't understand it.

220
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,940
Well, that's us.

221
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,760
Ha ha ha.

222
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:41,340
The female subgenius who was afflicted by this died from it.

223
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:51,400
Before the Dobbs clone alien technology storage device baby could be completely formed.

224
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,080
They could find nothing in the autopsy.

225
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,360
Nothing showed up on the x-rays.

226
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,380
So they buried her.

227
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,560
And...

228
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:06,640
The saucer, as long as it had power, continued to attempt to build this device.

229
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,040
A hybrid.

230
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,200
This hybrid.

231
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,720
A living machine.

232
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,280
How we got to know this?

233
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,720
I dug her up.

234
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,560
You fiend.

235
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,980
That was another thing we used to joke about.

236
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,700
There were two items that I extricated from her corpse.

237
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:33,980
One of them is the actual X-est flying saucer itself.

238
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,060
Now depowered from having been stuck in the ground for so long.

239
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,480
It still smells pretty bad.

240
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,800
The other...

241
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,880
Legume slowly opens the box to reveal the...

242
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,660
The...

243
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:55,820
The...

244
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,220
The...

245
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,220


246
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,300
The...

247
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:56,960
The...

248
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:56,960


249
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,280
Rotting machine baby thing.

250
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,020
What is it?

251
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,760
What is it?

252
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,020
What is it?

253
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,180
What is it?

254
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,420
There are pictures on the members-only.

255
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,880
The actual Dobbs robot fetus clone.

256
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,680
Depowered!

257
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,240
Also extracted from the corpse of that dead subgenius.

258
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,540
It's too much!

259
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:18,860
I can't look!

260
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,100
Jesus.

261
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,700
Oh, God.

262
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,340
Oh.

263
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,260
Oh.

264
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,660
It's got to be...

265
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:24,860
Oh, God.

266
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:24,860


267
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:24,860


268
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:24,860


269
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:24,860


270
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:24,860


271
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,440
You can hear me vomiting in the background at this point.

272
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,160
You can't imagine how ugly this thing was.

273
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,180
It's that toilet paper.

274
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,080
I didn't sign up for this.

275
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:49,680
This is going to require a little bit of rocket Scientology here.

276
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,820
There were certain items that were very hard to procure.

277
00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:00,380
In order to use this device, Reverend Stang has to wear these protective goggles that

278
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,680
belong to Jim Jones.

279
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,540
I would wear them if I were willing to...

280
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,680
If I were interested in keeping my sight, just in case.

281
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,660
I have no idea what's going to happen when we activate this.

282
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,100
I don't know if this thing's going to come to life and start talking.

283
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,120
Don't do it.

284
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,640
I...

285
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,820
Don't do it.

286
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,800
I'm...

287
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,080
Well, now, friends, remember...

288
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,580
I'm really reluctant to do this.

289
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,080
I'm really reluctant to do this.

290
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,900
Let's brush up on your prescriptions, okay?

291
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,780
Your church history.

292
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,200
Look at this altar.

293
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,960
If you recall correctly...

294
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,180
That's right.

295
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:39,940
When J.R. Bob Dobbs, in the year of 1953, underwent his divine immaculation at the fist

296
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:45,900
of Jehovah One, the eminent space god, he happened, by chance, to have been tinkering

297
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,420
with a build-it-yourself early television kit.

298
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,460
He was always, you know, had to be ahead of the wave.

299
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,940
Always buying the latest gizmos and stuff.

300
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,680
And he was in his basement working on this thing.

301
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,720
Stepped in a puddle.

302
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,400
Some sort of circuit got completed.

303
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,420
He fell down and...

304
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:05,920
But...

305
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,580
And, in fact, this is little known.

306
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:14,560
Connie, for the first time, was unable to remove the pipe from Dobbs' mouth when that

307
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,940
happened.

308
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,740
After that...

309
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,760
That was when Dobbs received his first immaculation.

310
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,460
The vision of July 5th, 1998.

311
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,440
Oh, my God.

312
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,560
7 a.m.

313
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,400
The details about the end of the world when he scrawled all this stuff on a napkin.

314
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,200
Little known is the fact that Bob had a second immaculation.

315
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,080
But this is also described in Book of the Subgenius.

316
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:46,300
Following a hernia operation, something about the painkillers or the medicine they gave

317
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,900
him caused him to have yet another vision that was somewhat more detailed and complete

318
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,640
and involved...

319
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,440
Is the material you read?

320
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:54,440


321
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:54,720
No!

322
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,560
No!

323
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,160
No!

324
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:57,460


325
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,020
Now...

326
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,560
I'm no Bob.

327
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,240
But Bob's not here.

328
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,160
Bob was working towards, obviously, from...

329
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,260
We can tell from these detailed notes here that he was working towards a third immaculation.

330
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:22,480
Now, we have the choice of just putting this thing in a museum and guessing what it was

331
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:22,900
for.

332
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,980
Or thinking, oh, if only Bob were here...

333
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,740
Well, isn't that kind of like saying, oh, if only the X's were here, they could give

334
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,280
us a whole new life or everything.

335
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,160
Well, the X's haven't showed up for 20 years and some of us made a whole new life anyway.

336
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,440
We did build our own ship, some of us, and we at least cleaned up the one we were on

337
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:41,940
a little bit.

338
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,560
So, but, are we gonna just sit and wait?

339
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:52,880
Well, I don't blame you or Dr. Legume for not wanting to get up here and do this.

340
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:52,880


341
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,360
We do what Bob was obviously planning to do, which is activate this machine, whatever

342
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,440
the hell it is.

343
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:07,520
We don't know if it's a telephone, a television, a radio, some kind of weird 50's alien internet,

344
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:13,500
or if it's supernatural, or it's the spiritual possession or some such.

345
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,520
We don't know, but I'm willing to try!

346
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,440
And the reason I'm willing is because I have already achieved SLAP.

347
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,520
Yes, I have.

348
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,780
I'm a SLACK-FUL SON OF A BITCH.

349
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:32,820
After decades of anti-SLACK, my study of Bob's word has caused me to believe that I'm feeling

350
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,220
lucky.

351
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,900
That's all there is to it.

352
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,080
I'm feeling lucky.

353
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,420
And if Bob takes me home tonight, well, then I had a great rhyme.

354
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:50,440
If I enter a tunnel of light and see my loved ones, you won't hear me complain.

355
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,560
And if I'm just dead, you won't hear me complain.

356
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,840
But what if, what if we're able to complete some sort of ancient circuit, some bizarre

357
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:08,340
Lovecraftian-Dobbsian hybrid interface that could possibly reveal what it is we're missing?

358
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:17,500
July 5th, according to our calendar, our pathetic calendars of some year, is a couple of days

359
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,040
from now.

360
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,400
I can tell you what.

361
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,540
I don't want to go through the same thing.

362
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,620
I don't want to go through the same thing we have, and I'm willing to try a change.

363
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,340
I'm willing to take a risk.

364
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,520
Because I'm tired, frankly, I'm tired of getting up at 6 in the morning one day a year.

365
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,900
It is a lot to ask from Bob.

366
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,620
It's a lot to ask from me.

367
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,780
It's true.

368
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,280
Now, one of the things, as you said, we are missing some things.

369
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,560
One of the things we're missing is, I think, page three of these blueprints.

370
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,880
But we're going to try to...

371
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,640
I've never...

372
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,520
I don't know what's going to happen.

373
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:52,520


374
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,740
It's just...

375
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,220
What is it?

376
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,140
How does it refer to this wand antenna thing?

377
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,060
What is it called?

378
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,540
The quantum antenna.

379
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,800
Where do you stick it?

380
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,740
Where do you put it?

381
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,320
That's real funny.

382
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:04,980
Actually...

383
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,720
It's located to its third...

384
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,940
Well, it's an antenna.

385
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,740
There's a little...

386
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,860
Yeah, there's a little note that's showing a crotch.

387
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,280
There's a little note on the crotch that says, no.

388
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,180
Right.

389
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,000
So it doesn't...

390
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,280
It's not what you think.

391
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:14,500
No.

392
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,620
It's obviously not that.

393
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,500
So don't even suggest it.

394
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,840
I'm feeling triggered.

395
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,120
This is the time of light.

396
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,520
I believe it's the time of light.

397
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:22,520


398
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:22,520


399
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:22,520


400
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:29,560
I believe it's some kind of a broadcast machine that converts time into light or light into

401
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:29,900
time.

402
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,480
I have no idea how this works.

403
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,200
Every time I move the light here, it converts it into a weird sound feedback.

404
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,320
And I'm a little worried about step four.

405
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,480
It just says magic .

406
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,800
I'm up for it.

407
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,360
I'm up for any program to quote the great Coochie Cootie.

408
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,540
And according to this, 75980...

409
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,520
What?

410
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:52,520


411
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:57,580
0700 is actually some kind of phone number.

412
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,420
And not an actual prophecy date.

413
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,940
I guess let's see if we can...

414
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,680
A phone number.

415
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,320
Yeah, phone numbers are shorter now.

416
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,400
Let's see if we can fire this up.

417
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,720
I don't know about the three red candles.

418
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,320
I think it's covered under step four, magic .

419
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,000
Always need candles and jumper cables when performing forbidden signs.

420
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,520
I don't know.

421
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:22,540


422
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,120
I'll go get a new one.

423
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,120


424
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,720
And friends, speaking of forbidden signs, I keep wanting to talk into this thing.

425
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,140
Maybe that's what it is.

426
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,040
Anyway...

427
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,360
This year, all science is forbidden.

428
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,600
They're outlawing all science.

429
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:43,320
So that means if you're any kind of a scientist, you're doing forbidden signs.

430
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,500
Praise Bob.

431
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,120
Welcome to the church of the subgenius, Mr. Egghead Smartypants.

432
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,480
This is nerve wracking.

433
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,520
Don't have to do it.

434
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:52,520


435
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:52,520


436
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:52,520


437
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:52,520


438
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:52,520


439
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:52,520


440
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:52,520


441
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:52,520


442
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:52,520


443
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:52,520


444
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,740
We don't have to do this.

445
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,880
But we're going to.

446
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,400
All right.

447
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,080
Okay.

448
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,500
Let me see if I can center myself.

449
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,040
You don't get used to it.

450
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,780
Or spread my...

451
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,200
Whatever.

452
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,880
All right.

453
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,600
Now...

454
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,300
I can't unsee this.

455
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,280
Do you have the protective goggles?

456
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:11,760
Yes.

457
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,680
I have the goggles.

458
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,920
All right.

459
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,600
Now, the instructions...

460
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,080
So what are we doing again here?

461
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,060
You have to point the quantum antenna toward the sky.

462
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,800
All right.

463
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,340
I understand.

464
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:21,780
Wait.

465
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,500
I'm supposed to sit here?

466
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:22,500


467
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:22,500


468
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:22,500


469
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:22,500


470
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:22,500


471
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:22,500


472
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:22,500


473
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,560
I'm supposed to speak into the box?

474
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,460
Yes.

475
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,540
All right.

476
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,300
Any time you're ready to start sending the X's a message, we're powered up.

477
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,460
Go.

478
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,740
In the name of J.R.

479
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:41,680
Bob Dobbs, I mentally and verbally beseech you.

480
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,500
Reveal yourselves.

481
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,920
Oh, no!

482
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,200
Oh, no!

483
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,860
What's happened?

484
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,300
What's happening?

485
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,560
Stop biting his tongue.

486
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,780
Put the...

487
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:17,460
I was on the ground and then died.

488
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:17,760
All right.

489
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,560
See you okay?

490
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,840
What's going on?

491
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,500
I'm sorry.

492
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:22,500


493
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,000
He's not breathing.

494
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,120
That's where I was cussing.

495
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,980
Reverend Pang.

496
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,660
ocquést wrap

497
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,160
What!

498
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,160
It's not light.

499
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,760
It's the...

500
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,380
I'm sorry.

501
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:45,820
My bad.

502
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,660
Oh, hold on.

503
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,920
You'll take your time.

504
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,480
Let me close this thing for real.

505
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,500
I've got to do this one quickly.

506
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:52,500


507
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,400
You remember.

508
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,500
We'll do it.

509
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,740
It wasn't, it wasn't.

510
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,440
It's right.

511
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,440
It's a phone number.

512
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,840
It's a phone number.

513
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,720
The 1998 is a phone number.

514
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,220
What?

515
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,400
July 5th.

516
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,080
Seven, five.

517
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,600
There it is.

518
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,520
He didn't mean the seven and the five.

519
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
But the reverse.

520
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,760
It's five, seven.

521
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,640
What?

522
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,520
It's five, seven.

523
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,440
That's me.

524
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,340
I don't know what.

525
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:22,720
May.

526
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,360
May 7th.

527
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,940
And it's not.

528
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:27,880
What?

529
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,060
It's not 7 a.m.

530
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,060
It's 7 p.m.

531
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:31,520
Yeah.

532
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,060
7 p.m.

533
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,360
What?

534
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,060
May 7th.

535
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,880
That's crazy.

536
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,680
That's crazy.

537
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,140
Come on.

538
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,400
The year.

539
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,340
What year?

540
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,980
Dammit, you brought me back to life before I could find out when we all died.

541
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:47,440
What year?

542
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,360
I don't know when the year was.

543
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:49,860
Jesus.

544
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,240
What was the year?

545
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,240
This is not happening.

546
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,640
The little icon in the corner, the one that we couldn't decipher.

547
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,000
It's a no smoking sign.

548
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:57,880
What?

549
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,340
It is.

550
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,480
You blew it.

551
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,620
It is.

552
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,440
It's a pipe with a.

553
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,660
Well, it's kind of messy.

554
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,580
No, it can't.

555
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,400
That can't be it.

556
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,260
Wait a minute.

557
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,040
This is ridiculous.

558
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,860
I know.

559
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,760
I know it sounds contrived, but I.

560
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,080
I can't.

561
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,420
I can't.

562
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,400
I just can't.

563
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:20,860
I can't.

564
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,900
This is not adding up.

565
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,320
I can't unsee this.

566
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,560
I can't unthink this.

567
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,600
Five.

568
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,460
Seven.

569
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,860
Not seven.

570
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,260
Five.

571
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,540
That was the main message.

572
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,460
I wasn't getting it in numbers.

573
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,820
I was getting it in.

574
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:42,260
I want to say images, but it was more like sound feeling colors.

575
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,400
But it was clear.

576
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,800
It was clear.

577
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,200
Not 7 a.m.

578
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,820
7 p.m.

579
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,780
It was a P.

580
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,620
It was important.

581
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,640
Not the a.

582
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,300
The P.

583
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,660
The P was important.

584
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,440
The P.

585
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,060
The P.

586
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,700
May.

587
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,300
You.

588
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:00,900
That's it.

589
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,240
The world ends tomorrow.

590
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,020
You may die.

591
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,120
Why didn't they capitalize the May?

592
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,680
May.

593
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,180
Seven.

594
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,600
Five.

595
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,020
Seven.

596
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,740
Not seven.

597
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,100
Five.

598
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,240
July.

599
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,060
July.

600
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:15,940
Gobs.

601
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,080
Did you die gobs?

602
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:19,660
Yes.

603
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,340
It's.

604
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,340
It's possible.

605
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,600
He leaves us guessing again.

606
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,700
Damn him.

607
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,340
damn him again.

608
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,800
We're left to kiss and hope.

609
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,120
And dare.

610
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,880
I say, pray.

611
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,240
I had to dig through a cord finger.

612
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,740
Oh, Jesus.

613
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,780
This changes everything changes, everything KarenaNothing.

614
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,360
This means you really came.

615
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,280
And stay up late the day before X day, because it's at 7pm.

616
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,220
He can stay up all night partying.

617
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,700
But we missed it.

618
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,660
Unless it's, well, no, it never said what year.

619
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,940
Damn him!

620
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,720
Damn you dogs!

621
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,100
Damn you to hell!

622
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,360
Look away.

623
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,620
That's just what he wants.

624
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,820
That's exactly what he wants.

625
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,580
He's got us trapped.

626
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,000
We're boxed in.

627
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,560
What else can we do?

628
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,540
We have to believe.

629
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,000
Do we really have a choice?

630
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,080
As with all religions.

631
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,960
Rowling.

632
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:37,440
The one other message that came, that seemed to come through,

633
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:43,700
again, not like words, not like even a burning bush,

634
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,720
it's just a knowledge, a feeling, a surety,

635
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,760
of the one true law.

636
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,160
F*** them if they can't take a joke!

637
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,760
That is what rings true through the whole vision.

638
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,400
And by the way, it's very clear that it was not meant sexually,

639
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,540
but as a sort of a blow them off, forget them kind of thing.

640
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:15,540
But still, that's, I guess, the one saving grace,

641
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,660
the one grace we have.

642
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,540
The one...

643
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,540
Amazing.

644
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,620
...final excuse.

645
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:30,160
In the midst of this muddy mystery, this blurring of reality.

646
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,800
You know, this could be like a schism in the church.

647
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,420
It could lead to a complete disruption.

648
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:44,000
There's going to be the Julyists and the May-diasts, or whatever.

649
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,660
Something like that.

650
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,320
They're all going to hate each other.

651
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,480
They're all going to hate each other.

652
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:48,540
They're all going to hate each other.

653
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:48,540


654
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,580
And they're all going to hate me the most,

655
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,720
because that's always how it works, isn't it?

656
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,020
Yeah.

657
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,700
Oh, yeah.

658
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,220
Oh, see.

659
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,540
Bob's got rounds.

660
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,280
Let's throw rocks at Reverend Stang.

661
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,520
Oh, Bob's got rounds.

662
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,020
Let's just...

663
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,220
Boy, Philo was so smart not to show up this time.

664
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,780
He seems to know.

665
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,640
Well, he knows when...

666
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,780
He's like the dog.

667
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,080
Friends, I just don't know what to say.

668
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,120
I don't know how to feel.

669
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:28,760
I quit trying to foretell the future in 1998 conspiracy here.

670
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,400
But I don't give up.

671
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,240
I shan't give up.

672
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:46,520
I retain my faith in something in Bob, whether he will deliver us good or evil or slack or

673
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,440
anti-slack.

674
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,520
In the end, I'm going to be a slave.

675
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:48,520


676
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:48,520


677
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:48,520


678
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:48,520


679
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:48,520


680
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,440
But that, I think, is a fact, that we can only wait and see.

681
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,080
Maintain our faith.

682
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,460
And the important thing, I guess, I guess the main lesson once...

683
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,400
God, I end up getting a little tired of saying this, friends.

684
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,840
Because I say it every year.

685
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,220
But think about it.

686
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,460
The only thing any of us really has to do is stay alive until next day.

687
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:18,060
No matter how bad things get, there is that one hope dangled in front of us.

688
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,520
And that hope is to keep on going.

689
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:18,520


690
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:18,520


691
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:18,520


692
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:27,000
And now it's dangling from two, shall we call them, nutsacks of Bob, two questions.

693
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,940
Shall it be July? Shall it be May?

694
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,100
Is this year 1998? Will the year after be 1998?

695
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,220
I leave it to you, my friends.

696
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,960
You must find the answers in your own hearts.

697
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,680
Because Bob is not the answer.

698
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,960
But neither is anything else.

699
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,460
Question authority.

700
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,120
Why?

701
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,680
Because you bet.

702
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,080
What have you done to me?

703
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,880
I wish I didn't know.

704
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,100
So where do we go for our refunds?

705
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,520
What's the weather like in Maine?

706
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,860
Was that someone who couldn't take a joke we just heard?

707
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,420
Because I think I know what to do next.

708
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,380
Yes, friends.

709
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,560
That was it.

710
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,400
Dave, are you still there?

711
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,680
I'm still there.

712
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,240
I was totally and completely evacuated.

713
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,480
I felt power ripped.

714
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,900
I could sense your unusualness in every step of your breath.

715
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,020
It was just an incredible performance.

716
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:43,520
And it's scary enough to make me think that perhaps you were demaculated right there on stage as you were trying to do something else.

717
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,480
Well, he received many megafolts of enlightenment.

718
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,260
There, right?

719
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:48,840
Right on the stage.

720
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:53,520
You could see his hair lift and the blue sparks around him.

721
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,140
It was alarming.

722
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,140
I was terrified.

723
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,140
I thought he had had another heart attack.

724
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:57,960
I did.

725
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,840
I did have another heart attack.

726
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,940
I was dead for a little while.

727
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,900
For very, just a few seconds.

728
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,380
I know I was.

729
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,780
That's when the...

730
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,600
I'm not sure if it was that or when that loud noise went off.

731
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,060
It was the loud noise because in that slight...

732
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:28,580
In that slant between the beats of your heart, in that arrhythmia between the pockets of success and failure that you translate as slack as long as your heart beats.

733
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,960
It's a very simple story they teach us in business college.

734
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,840
And I'm really certainly happy that you learned how under such negative circumstances.

735
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,520
I mean, you didn't really have to do that to yourself.

736
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,700
Well, that electric fan was kind of loud.

737
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,120
The funny thing is, you know...

738
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:48,900
That noise.

739
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,740
But see, there's another layer of mystery.

740
00:34:53,980 --> 00:35:06,700
There was a much more specific but equally maddening part that was buried in that loud hum that happened when they gave him through the switch.

741
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:17,420
And it wasn't 24 hours before a Reverend Sinfaltimus Ex Mortis, who works as a computer whiz kid.

742
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:18,880
That noise.

743
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:28,620
Had developed an algorithm that he was able to use to extract a message from that burst of noise.

744
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,420
And it's a real spooky message.

745
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,760
But I kind of feel like maybe I'll wait and close the show with that because...

746
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,100
Well, don't forget.

747
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,080
It's just such a...

748
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,760
Don't let the time run over and forget because it's vitally important that all subgeniuses...

749
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,520
here this evidence for themselves.

750
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,640
Right. It must be

751
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,920
for posterity's sake.

752
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,600
Everything must be maintained

753
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,800
and intact, even if it's

754
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,220
really kind of stupid sometimes.

755
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,840
I think it's broken.

756
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,780
Let them be the judges.

757
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,580
As Bob said, the stupider

758
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,580
it looks, the more important it probably

759
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,160
is.

760
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,360
Yep. Which makes

761
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,240
most of us subgeniuses fairly

762
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,700
important. Yeah, it's nice the way

763
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,160
it works.

764
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,020
Yeah, and if there are

765
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,820
certain proclaimers of religion

766
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,080
called Jesuits, why can't we be

767
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,260
the offbeat colors of the half-witch?

768
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,120
But why is Bob

769
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,600
doing this to us? Why

770
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,760
is he parceling out these

771
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,040
hints and clues?

772
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,080
Could it be that he's impatient with our

773
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,940
long failure to

774
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,280
understand the facts?

775
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,980
Could it be that

776
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,000
Bob has waited for the last three hours

777
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,860
at the parking lot of the bowling alley?

778
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,720
Well,

779
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,840
when you hear

780
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,700
this

781
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,020
computer voice

782
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,860
message that

783
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,180
Sinfaltimus

784
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,440
decoded out of that noise,

785
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,840
it only

786
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,540
makes things

787
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,640
worse. You'll see what

788
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
I mean. After this

789
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,620
happened, a lot of people

790
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,600
assumed, oh, well, they're

791
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,440
going to change the dates of X-Day

792
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,500
and they'll probably start doing it in

793
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,520
Texas. No,

794
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,100
we don't know that much.

795
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,400
Call it Tex-Day. Well, there was a

796
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
Tex-Day. It was

797
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,240
poorly attended. It was in a

798
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,040
much

799
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,940
inferior facility

800
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,820
to Wisteria's, and

801
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,400
I don't think

802
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,320
it's available anymore. I think it was

803
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,640
wiped off the face of the earth after

804
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,020
the under

805
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,220
attendance. Actually,

806
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,400
this X-Day was probably one of

807
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,040
the smallest

808
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,160
attendance numbers

809
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,700
we've had.

810
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,220
And yet,

811
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,600
it was perhaps the

812
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,860
most slackful.

813
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,660
Well, you see, only the elect are to be saved

814
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,800
in any case, so it's symbolically

815
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,460
appropriate that only a few

816
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,760
seeds of the future

817
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,620
subgenius universe were

818
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,840
physically present

819
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,480
this time. It's like the

820
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,720
shreds of the Daironis

821
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,680
or what do you want to call them, the druids, when their

822
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,480
testicles shrink and everything? Everything

823
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,600
is imploding back to a central focus

824
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,420
and that makes it more powerful.

825
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,520
Just like the god or dam wrong of the

826
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,940
Feast of 19, or 1623,

827
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,620
I don't know if that was Gus Davis

828
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,340
or whatever his name was, or

829
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,660
Martin Luther, yeah.

830
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,920
And it's very similar, just as you said,

831
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,900
there would probably be Mace Embers and there'd be

832
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,500
Decembers that want to shoot them.

833
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,640
Well, one thing

834
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,960
that we know from this X-Day,

835
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,600
the audience elimination

836
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,960
experiment is proceeding

837
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:41,700
handsomely.

838
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,820
There's almost no

839
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,700
one in the audience.

840
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,580
Everyone

841
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,060
is on the stage.

842
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,520
That's right. It's like Burning

843
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,680
Man. Everybody's

844
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,020
a participant. No spectators.

845
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,540
Everybody get up

846
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,500
there on the stage and do your

847
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,420
thing. And everybody is a

848
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,540
star. There are a lot of titers

849
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,600
as well as spectators, and most of them have

850
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,280
specs. Yes, that's true.

851
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,400
Put that polyethylene to go right where it belongs.

852
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,780
Yeah, that's where to put it.

853
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,160
This will,

854
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,300
although it was the

855
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,880
most sparsely attended X-Day,

856
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,920
it will probably be the most

857
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,780
widely seen one because

858
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,960
the subgenius movie

859
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,580
crew was there. That's right.

860
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,040
And this time, it's not one of those

861
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,480
amateur movie crews. No, subgenius

862
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,220
has really gone Hollywood now.

863
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,220
Oh, big time. Big time.

864
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,060
I can't wait to see the special effects

865
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,760
where they fill in the

866
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,920
crowds. I thought those

867
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,120
PR butts were so beautiful. I mean,

868
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,100
if I didn't know you, I'd want

869
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,100
to kiss it right now.

870
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,560
Man, this is really going to sell

871
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,780
Stang and his stupid idea.

872
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,280
Praise Bob.

873
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,080
Praise Bob. This is really

874
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,560
going to kick off the bells

875
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,920
in Hollywood where they belong for so

876
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,860
many years. I mean, just think of Charlie and the

877
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,800
Angels and Otis Kurtz.

878
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,100
You know, all those,

879
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,000
you know. Well, it's funny.

880
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,640
Something that occurred to me just

881
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,680
yesterday was that

882
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,260
okay,

883
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,540
we're now looking at two

884
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,060
possible dates.

885
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,740
July 5th.

886
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,740
But it seems like

887
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,640
someone's trying to discount

888
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,620
that. Then there's the

889
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,900
May 7th thing.

890
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,460
It occurred to me, why not both?

891
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,680
Couldn't, could

892
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,040
one of the

893
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,800
drills or whatever,

894
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,140
the saucer of waitings,

895
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,520
take place

896
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,660
indoors? Don't you

897
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,400
know that we'd get ten times

898
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,840
as many of the

899
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,060
city-fied, sissified,

900
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,500
softies that would

901
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,400
never, and poor people, who could

902
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,120
never make it to the

903
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,500
extremely remote obstacle course

904
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,860
that we put people through

905
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,740
for most X days.

906
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,600
Yeah, and they could just be voyeurs and don't

907
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,400
have to worry about being voyeuristic

908
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,460
and stuff like that. They don't have to

909
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,540
march around sky-clad or anything. They just

910
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,540
get the old screen going

911
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,600
and a hypothetical.

912
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,680
But are you saying we'll have

913
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,600
two X days? No, not

914
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,580
necessarily, but we have that option.

915
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,460
We have the option of having,

916
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,320
you know how many people have begged,

917
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,520
have said, well, if it wasn't at a campground

918
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,440
in the middle of summer, if it was at a comic book

919
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,440
con where I could sit around and drink

920
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,240
all day in air conditioning because

921
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,460
I'm so morbidly obese, I'd much

922
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,400
prefer that. I'd go to every one of those.

923
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,140
And we could have subgenius cosplay.

924
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,540
Oh, yeah. In other words,

925
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,400
the bobbies could have their X

926
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,760
day and the hardy,

927
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,260
true, true

928
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,580
subgeniuses, the

929
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,020
masochistic ones,

930
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,840
like ourselves, we could

931
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,500
continue to sweat in the

932
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,580
summer heat. It's easy for

933
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,440
me to say because actually, Princess

934
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,680
Wee and Dr. Howell and I

935
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,520
and Wee Ma Ma and Dammit

936
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,340
spend all of the X day profits

937
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,680
staying in an air-conditioned bed

938
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,260
and breakfast. But

939
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,100
I'm still...

940
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,120
I'm not going to be idiotic right now.

941
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,980
The amount of waves going into your brain,

942
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,200
the central focus here, just would have

943
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,880
made you imbecilic by now. You'd be

944
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,840
babbling and doodling.

945
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,800
Over the place. You know how I fend that off?

946
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,600
I do all the physical

947
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,680
labor myself. I do all the

948
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,160
packing, the unpacking,

949
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,840
the engineering.

950
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,400
I, at one point, was

951
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,520
running two video cameras

952
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,620
and performing,

953
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,740
and a recorder, all at the same time.

954
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,480
That's

955
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,220
what, that's why

956
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,480
even though I stay in the

957
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,720
B&B, I'm still tougher than the rest of them

958
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
punks. But

959
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,440
let's not get lost in

960
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,400
a dogma. Perhaps it's

961
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,960
time to play that other

962
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,700
recording

963
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,040
from less than 24

964
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,220
hours later. As I said, Reverend

965
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,240
St. Faltimus X. Mortis

966
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,400
of the Poconos

967
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,080
Fortress

968
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:00,680
Clench

969
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,880
had decrypted

970
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,080
that buzz into this

971
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,320
bizarre message. Now,

972
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:09,880
interestingly,

973
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,220
he was showing me

974
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,440
this on the main stage.

975
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,360
Late at night.

976
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,480
That wasn't the only thing happening on the

977
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,380
main stage. There happened to

978
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:20,940
have been

979
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,880
lovely young

980
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,160
ladies, townies,

981
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,820
or wisterians who

982
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,560
work at the place.

983
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,120
Bombed out of their mind.

984
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,640
And caterwauling

985
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,280
in the background.

986
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,940
They were expressing themselves freely.

987
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,900
Some people, some

988
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,280
geniuses hated that

989
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,000
because it seemed so much like

990
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,600
kind of a takeoff on

991
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,720
corny millennials. Others

992
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,860
of us were just so happy to see

993
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,800
suntanned,

994
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,440
barely dressed young

995
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,900
bodies populated the X-Day

996
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,480
stage. And then

997
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,800
Reverend Fox

998
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,680
wandered on stage

999
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,620
and stood there.

1000
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:04,940
Was she?

1001
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,800
Reverend Fox. No, Reverend Fox

1002
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,780
is the

1003
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,840
confusingly spelled name of

1004
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,880
a male doctor.

1005
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,540
Yes.

1006
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,600
He was seized in a trance

1007
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,680
that night. And in fact,

1008
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,740
even though we had just burned

1009
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,700
a Bob Icon that

1010
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,820
Fox himself had built for burning,

1011
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,840
he was seized

1012
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,840
up in the spirit. And not only

1013
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,620
did he stare balefully

1014
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,680
at that young crooning beatnik

1015
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,380
girl for about half an hour,

1016
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,860
as if shooting laser beams through her,

1017
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,660
he went and grabbed

1018
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,640
the 25-year-old Bob

1019
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,720
dummy that we'd been hauling around

1020
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,940
for all these years.

1021
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,560
Took it upon himself

1022
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,640
to drag it by the

1023
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,740
hangman's noose that's always on its neck

1024
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,340
over to the fire,

1025
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,780
carefully remove its

1026
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,740
jacket, which we still

1027
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,760
have. And it had

1028
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,800
the little pipe in the pocket.

1029
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,920
And then he held it over

1030
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,760
his head and tossed it upon the

1031
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,840
fire where it landed in a very dramatic

1032
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,420
pose. I'll see.

1033
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,800
I'd probably be

1034
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,640
angry at Reverend Fox for

1035
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,360
doing this, but for the fact that

1036
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,260
Dr. Onan can't abide

1037
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,740
a deftly videotape

1038
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,520
the whole thing, which is all we wanted

1039
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,460
out of the death of that dummy anyway.

1040
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,520
Praise Onan.

1041
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,360
So it was a strange...

1042
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,720
...for so many years now.

1043
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,680
I hate to just see it at the Bibles

1044
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,620
or something like that, and when nobody's looking

1045
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,500
at it, punch the damn thing right in the face.

1046
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,740
It happened all the time.

1047
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,780
Oh, the thing, it was ravaged.

1048
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,800
But I once found

1049
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,600
it covered with condom.

1050
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,800
But we had planned

1051
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,820
to possibly burn the thing

1052
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,760
the next night. We just expected

1053
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,700
to have more cameras. Anyway,

1054
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,460
that was one of the mysteries.

1055
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:55,660
Only

1056
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,540
that's a mystery that's over with. It's solved.

1057
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,740
We don't have to worry about that Bob dummy anymore.

1058
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,740
We'll make a different, more

1059
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,140
realistic robot.

1060
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,660
But shall I play?

1061
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:06,620
The spectacle seems

1062
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,460
rather eccentric to me.

1063
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,640
Especially the part where you fall

1064
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,420
down on your hands and knees and you

1065
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,940
just angel Gabriel

1066
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,000
or March, March, um,

1067
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,400
you know, the Archangel Gabriel

1068
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,500
is, you know, what you should do

1069
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,800
and he tells you to read and write.

1070
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,520
And while you're slathering like a peacenik,

1071
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,420
the whole rest of the world falls

1072
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,660
apart. And there's like Bob Dob

1073
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,140
looking like Hitler standing like,

1074
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,220
I'm talking into your

1075
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,700
subconscious right now.

1076
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,460
You know, something like that. And then you get

1077
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,940
real scared and fall asleep again.

1078
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,540
Yeah, I almost

1079
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,000
did. So,

1080
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,380
we will go now

1081
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,320
to that strange recording.

1082
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,640
Now again, you get to hear

1083
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,360
the crooning

1084
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,620
young, lovely hipster

1085
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,660
girl in the background.

1086
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,500
But pay her no

1087
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,220
never mind. It makes an interesting

1088
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,980
contrast with the computer voice.

1089
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:02,980
Extraordinary message.

1090
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,300
All of this has been shortened.

1091
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,520
Space. This has all been

1092
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,820
shortened a great deal.

1093
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,520
You can hear the uncut versions

1094
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,540
of both of these with all the cussing.

1095
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,960
And a lot more stuff.

1096
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,400
On both of

1097
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:17,940
the

1098
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,480
members only places that you would

1099
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,260
think of. Sorry, members only.

1100
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,460
Right. And, uh,

1101
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:28,300
but you non-believers

1102
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,520
are lucky to be able to hear any

1103
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,960
of this. Okay, so I'm gonna

1104
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,380
pull out the John Carpenter music. I'm gonna

1105
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:34,120
play this

1106
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:35,960
shortened

1107
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,480
version of this thing.

1108
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,660
It's four minutes long.

1109
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,220
By the Archangel

1110
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:44,840
Carmichael.

1111
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:45,740
Carmichael.

1112
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,020
Carmichael.

1113
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,800
Tell me again how you

1114
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,400
arrived at this?

1115
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,560
How did you crack the code?

1116
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,260
I had to go back to the

1117
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,540
1980s technology

1118
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,240
to decipher a message from the

1119
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,340
1990s in the year 2017.

1120
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:05,980
And this was the message.

1121
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,340
That part makes sense.

1122
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,640
The message. I don't understand

1123
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,620
the message, though.

1124
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,040
And the data?

1125
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:14,480
B.

1126
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:14,600
Where?

1127
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:15,580
O.

1128
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,020
B.

1129
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,300
This is the output so far.

1182
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:11,980

1196
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:28,120
because we're leaving the whole solar system

1197
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,360
oh where is planet x

1198
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:36,920
nobody gave me that input maybe that's why i'm getting the errors that's a good question

1199
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,140
that's one of the missing variables

1200
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,200

00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,380

1203
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,840
um

1204
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,820
this is such a mystery

1205
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,240
it's an ever deepening mystery

1206
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,320
how many onion skin layers does it go

1207
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,120
like actually where where are they taking us

1208
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,460
how far does the old how deep does the old sequel hope go

1209
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:11,920
we wait together we wait together goodbye problems

1210
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,180
goodbye problems

00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:12,180


1212
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,580

1213
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:16,800

1214
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,300
we gotta get on this

1215
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:18,920
ride

1216
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:18,920


1217
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:18,920


1218
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,840
frightening

1219
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,020
they're

1220
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:26,920
surface

1221
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:26,920


1222
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:26,920

1224
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,220
Where do we go from here?

1225
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:49,440
Make it up is what I say because it seems to me like you've made an omelet out of four different eggs.

1226
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:51,240
You've got your old school.

1227
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,780
You've got your new school.

1228
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,560
You've got your, you know, revelation of the last revelation.

1229
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,320
And then you've got this final and ultimate revelation.

1230
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:04,600
If I were you, I'd feel like the prophet Mohammed or Jesus or somebody important right now.

1231
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:09,120
You've got like a whole doctrine of work behind you now.

1232
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:16,480
Yeah, but the question is how do we deal with the faithful with this new and definitely unwelcome information?

1233
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:21,600
What do we say to the heaving masses of disaffected subgeniuses?

1234
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,720
Now, of course, a lot of people have been advising me to just keep it quiet.

1235
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:26,520
Sit on it.

1236
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,560
Bottle it up.

1237
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,300
Pretend it didn't happen.

1238
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,600
Make it an unhappening.

1239
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:36,080
But I just, it seems to me like we should just, transparency.

1240
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,500
That's what we need.

1241
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,100
Let all of the subgeniuses.

1242
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,380
Look at all of the evidence.

1243
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:51,060
Only maybe one of us will come up with something that makes sense from it all.

1244
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,800
Not that we're famous for that.

1245
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,500
Here's how I see it.

1246
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,800
This is the way you want to brand yourself.

1247
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:05,060
You want to get out and do like it's a press conference right after an important loss or victory, whichever way you want to play it.

1248
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,240
And you just candidate for the mayor of Cleveland, perhaps.

1249
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,100
Or Cleveland.

1250
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,500
Any of those airwaves at Cleveland Road or someplace like that.

1251
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,940
And you just come out and you do some hand gestures and everybody's cheering and stuff and you're smiling.

1252
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:15,840
Hand gestures?

1253
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:16,880
Yeah.

1254
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:25,620
You know, like screw off and bumpkin and some of the other ones they do nowadays and stuff like some of them have five different parts.

1255
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,020
That can get you killed.

1256
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,200
Oh, of course.

1257
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,040
That's the meaning of it all to begin with.

1258
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,520
It's like it's a murder weapon.

1259
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,620
But he can pretend like it's not.

1260
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,940
It's something to save a little children or something like that.

1261
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:38,960
And he can have.

1262
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,560
have a graph behind him and bullet point things and stuff.

1263
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,920
But mainly, you know, he comes out and storms out onto the stage

1264
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,860
and he's smiling just like he's getting ready to get one of those

1265
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:52,220
steak and beans type of, you know, campaign things.

1266
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,760
Well, friends, we'll have pictures.

1267
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,120
There are pictures in those members-only places like the 20X Day page.

1268
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,500
Now, I guess we could call it the 22nd X Day drill.

1269
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:12,280
And, of course, subgenius.com will eventually have the complete documentation.

1270
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:24,260
My YouTube channel, RevStang, will probably have the visuals of the device,

1271
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,560
the thing that Legume exhumed.

1272
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,780
You said it looked like it came from the 1950s.

1273
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,240
Well, the box that he had it in looked old.

1274
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:46,040
And the doodads attached to the baby robot circuit thing that smelled dead,

1275
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,380
that stuff was all antique.

1276
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,820
It was all tube technology.

1277
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,660
Anyway, friends, we have to move on.

1278
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:58,980
We're approaching the end of this groundbreaking hour of Slack.

1279
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,480
Again, I can only...

1280
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:04,480


1281
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:04,480


1282
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:04,480


1283
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,560
suggest that each subgenius study and try to draw its own conclusions.

1284
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,060
I'm gonna close with a piece of music here.

1285
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,860
Prior to Dr. Sinister's show for which we shall hang around.

1286
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:25,080
Dave, you should probably hang up and then call back in in about 15 minutes.

1287
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:31,640
Friends, I'm gonna play an instrumental by the Rudy Schwartz Project.

1288
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,120
You know, you've never heard of them.

1289
