Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the subgenius of OVSLUG.
I feel real good. And then other times, I feel like I was going to get sick right in my stomach.
Well, that doesn't take much doing.
Hello, Bob. I need someone to talk to.
Hello, Bob. It seems there's nothing I can do.
Hello, Bob.
I need someone to listen to me.
I'm hitting all the locked doors and I need some help.
And I was hoping you'd have the key.
Hello, Bob.
Have you been listening to my thoughts?
Hello, Bob.
And I'll tell you all the thoughts.
I've got.
Hello, Bob.
Hello, Bob.
I can't seem to find the truth.
I read the books.
I took the drugs.
And I drank a whole bottle of Verluce.
Yeah.
Hello, Bob.
I seem to have misplaced my slack.
Hello, Bob.
Well, I just can't seem to get it back.
Hello, Bob.
Can you point out what it is I lack?
I've climbed to highest heights, hit the lowest lows.
But now I'm on my back.
Hello, Bob.
Are you still hearing me?
Hello, Bob.
Give me a sign that I can see.
Hello, Bob.
It's not that I've lost all my hope.
But I'm really tired and I'm really broke.
And I smoked up the last of my dope.
Hello, Bob.
Am I coming through to you?
Hello, Bob.
I thought I already paid all my dues.
Hello, Bob.
I've lost my slacks.






I know that you can see me through
But it's damp and dim and I can't swim
What am I supposed to do?
Well, hello, Bob
I'm feeling better
Now you've listened to me
Hello, Bob
Well, the sun's out now
Now I can see
Hello, Bob
A great change has come over me
My eyes are wise
My thoughts are clear
And I'm as happy as I could be
Yes, my eyes are wise
My thoughts are clear
And I'm as happy as I could be
Hello, Bob

Oh, it's a miracle, Fran.
It's a miracle revival starting up.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Perform the salute.
Freedom America.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Perform the salute.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But here's how to do the salute.
Yeah.
Ah, shake, right, ready?
The finger is on the neck.
Hands, left hand up.
Up and down.
Left hand up.
Left hand up.
Oh.
Finger on throat.
Finger on throat.
Ready?
Come on.
All right, perform the salute.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Excellent.
It's a miracle.
I think before we start the service,
we should have just a moment of noise.
Oh, yeah, I can feel it.
The spirits.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bullets can't stop it.
Oh, bullets can't stop them, friends, no.
The mark of the beast.
Oh, you don't need to worry about it.
You've got your credit card.
It won't do you any good tomorrow, but it's okay.
Well, oh.
I love you, John.
I guess now Bob's gonna have to work through me, friends.
Your command.
Fleecing snow mixed with freezing rain and rain.
The cold weather is much better.
And it looks like I can see you through the afternoon.
The temperatures are going to be
a little bit lower for the presentation.
We'll continue in all the desired conditions.
Snow accumulation at mid-morning range,
from near one half inch,
will deliver two inches of west.
The best we can do is to go one to two inches on.
We're going to come from the front.
We're going to come from the back.
Snow accumulation.
We're going to come from the front.
We don't need to worry about it.
We really have to keep sure that we're having a good Summer.
Snow accumulation grouped across the entire coast,
no aoenty snow婆ings.
What value do you plan to get over this?
Well, we should talk about snow accumulation.


Yeah, that's going into the relationship.
It's going to be a pretty nice picture.
I'm not sure that we really need to talk about it.
Wow.
I'm...
I'm...
I'm...
I'm...
I'm...
I'm...
Sometimes I've got these
these rats and they're like
they're like inside my stomach and I haven't swallowed them
I mean they're like hot hot hot dogs but they're eating their way out
and they're
coming out and I just
sometimes I just want to take these hot dogs and just
shove them away. I'm taking these hot dogs
and just...
I'm taking these hot dogs and just...
Please Bob send me some more
more pills Bob please
Bob send me some more
some more of those pills
Bob...Bob...Bob...
Bob...Bob...
Bob...Bob...Bob...
Bob...Bob...Bob...
Oh...
Oh... Lonesome Bob
says
you gotta get some
pills
Oh...
Lonesome Bob
just telling
me
Oh yeah
Just give him some more pills
and Bob
will kill
I'm sorry mom, if I upset you, but sometimes I just don't feel too good, you know?
I mean, I really don't feel real good, and I don't know why, but Reverend Booney says,
um, my head, my head is, um,
obsessed with, um, the anti-bomb.
Um, and I don't really, um, know what he means,
and so that's why I'm talking to you directly,
because,
he isn't, um, much help.
But Bob says,
if you don't give me some money,
you just won't ever get any slack.
And then,
you don't get no slack, you can't get no money and no food and no pills.
Sounds bad.
So what we have there really is, uh,
two rituals going at once.
Um,
on the, uh,
the radio.
It's, it's a miracle.
What can we say?
We're used to them by now, but it's definitely miracles, and we've got proof.
Yeah.
It's amazing.
It's a miracle.
It's signs, signs in the heavens, signs in the earth.
Uh, we're seeing the signs everywhere.
And, uh,
they, uh, they still seem to be, uh, washing the implements on the other side in this blood of the lamb.
This is the blood of the lamb.
It wants us to
If we have to buy things and die, and we'll all come back older men, we'll all come back older men, we'll all come back older men, or know the reason why.
We have to buy.
We'll all come back older men, we'll all come back older men, if we don't come back older men, there ain't no reason why.
All wildest gizms, they will fall beneath our laser blades, and we'll all come back older men, we'll all come back older men, we'll all come back older men, in victory parade.
Okay, okay, Dr. Drummond has on his anti-alien possession shades so we won't go off the road
like we did last time.
I'm going to put them up here.
The dogs, the mongreloids back there are safely...
Oh, God.
He's got a screwdriver.
It's a key.
A key.
It looks like a screwdriver.
Right, it's disguised as the sacred screwdriver, and it's the key, and it makes the Bobmobile
begin to move.
You can hear it.
You can hear that good sound effect of motor rumbling, because this thing doesn't have
any real motor sound, and we have to use it or else superstitious peoples will run in
fright.
Little Rock is embraced with techno boredom just as usual, and I just want to tell you
it's no tour to live here.
I just want to extend greetings from the Archbishop of Slack Abuse of the mega fist temple lodge
of the church.
The Archbishop of Slack Abuse of the mega fist temple lodge of the church.
I want to thank the church for the subgenius of Little Rock.
It's nice to find out that there's some more like us around, and since we found Bob by
golly, we've just been having a great time and getting some money and finding out who
sounds like us and what the scam is and all.
The time now is 2.15, and the following program is sponsored by the New Testament Holiness
Church.
You do what you do because you won't...

I do what I do because Bob told me to.
That's what I think everyone needs to remember.
You do what you do because you won't to.
I do what I do because Bob told me...
I did, Bob.
Whatever you say, I swear to God, I did.
And I don't care if people laugh at me.
I did, Bob.
I did, Bob.

He...
He ain't no man.
He ain't no God.
I don't want to walk the path that Bob's trod.
Ain't no man, ain't no God.
I don't want to walk the path Bob's trod.
Okay, let's do it right this time.
And people ask me, where do you get this energy, this life I see glowing in you, Jander?
And I just point it up.
And I don't even have to say...
I don't even have to say...
I won't even...
I won't even say the word Bob when I said it.
But I just point it at the sky because it's not me that's doing it.
And you know and I know who it is.
It's Bob.
Now we take you into a great Holy Ghost revival that is now in progress.
Bill, you want to say something to the...
To the clinch?
I think it's all too deep.
To the Dallas clinch?
The conspiracy of the peaks.
And I don't know...
It's too pink and they refuse to comment.
If they're so hip, what are they doing in Dallas?
Yeah, really.
We can put on the Bob tune tape and sing along.

Wakanda Reid Hawks.
I got the blues cause Bob let that pickup run over my wife.
Hey, you get three points for hitting that hippie, girl.
Bob stayed father, eager to fit in in America.
He disliked the old man filling the boy's head with garbage and stinking Mayan occultism.
Bob grew up having to fight the stigma of a Mayan dad.
Other kids made fun of that prognathous slurped head of full-blood Mayan-ry.
And little Bob was in many a scrap, battling for his father's honor.
It was a troubled childhood and it had a telling effect on the society.

Bob was a representative youth who became, thanks to the pharmacy's wares, a chronic alcoholic at age six.
It didn't affect his precocious salesmanship, however.
And he made his first small fortune selling stolen prophylactics and other things to high school boys.
Wash it out, Bob.
Freak it out, Bob.
Zap it out, Bob.
Hook it out, Bob.
Shlarp it out, Bob.
Slurp it out, Bob.
Munch it out, Bob.
Punch it out, Bob.
And drink it out, Bob.
Scrunch it out, Bob.
Hunch it out, Bob.
Tear it out, Bob.
Mutate it out, Bob.
Slack it out, Bob.
Barf it out, Bob.
Kill me, Bob.
Thank you. Thank you, Sterna.
Coming up next, we have the original Doctors for Wotan album,
which is called Doctors for Negi.
And the song, I'm driving a car that Bob sold me.
You're so damn merry.
Back?
What do you mean, ha, ha, ha?
Take that pipe out of your mouth.
What are you grinning about, buddy?
Where'd you get that haircut?
Are those dots on your face, or have you got some kind of disease?
You look like Ward.
You look like Ward Cleaver on Leave it to Beaver.
You look like Mark Trail.
What's the deal, buddy?
What's the deal, buddy?
You look like Mr.
Appleton.
You look like Big Van Dyke with a pipe in his mouth.
What?
What'd you say?
Did you say, yeah, sure.
Sure, I'll buy that used car.
I'll buy that used car from you, mister.
Sure, anything.
How much is it?
It's only a dollar?
That used car is only a dollar?
Sure.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow, you got any other good deals, mister?
You got something else that'll only cost a dollar?
A little booklet?
I don't know.
That doesn't look like it's worth a dollar to me.
Oh, it does have a lot of print inside.
And some neat pictures.
Sure, I'll give you a dollar, mister.
Here.
Whoa, whoa.
I feel weird.
I feel, I feel really weird.
But, I feel kinda, I feel, I feel kind of good.
I like this, this little book.
Hey where'd you go, buddy?
Hey.
I wheels.
But.
But.





Where'd he go?
Where'd the guy with the pipe go?
Hey, I gotta talk to him.
Hey, what happened?
Hey buddy, where'd...
He took off with my two dollars,
and he left me this little book and this car.
I'll get in this car.
I'll start it up.
He left the keys in for me.
Okay.
Okay, here goes.
I'm driving the car that Bob sold me.
Boy, I can go pretty fast.
Hey, hey, that Bob guy's okay.
He made me forget about,
he made me forget about Odin for a minute.
That's really weird.
Boy, this car is smooth.
I like the way this feels on the road.
I like the way it feels.
Feels good.
It's throbbing.
It's throbbing.
Hey, it's leaving the road.
It's going up in the air.
Where's it going?
Hey.
Hey, it's, there's a cloud up in front of me.
A big cloud.
It's got a sign on it.
A big sign.
It says, it says,
it says, welcome, welcome to Odin's place.
It says, this is Nirvana.
Wow, Bob, thanks.
I can't wait to meet Odin.
Hi, Bill.
Oh, the world looks better since Bob is my blindfold.
World looks good to me.
Oh, the world looks better since Bob's my blindfold.
The world looks okay to me.
Oh, the world looks to you like some kind of big mess
Put a barbed line, fold on
The world looks to me like a nice place to be
Cause I got my barbed line, fold on
This is gonna be a real Bob revival tonight.
And right now, we are Buck Naked and the Jaybirds.
And we're going to sing Bob is Leaving Me.

Well, you're wrong!
What is Doctors for Bob?
Doctors of Bob!
Where is the Bob, y'all?

Let me go.
Cause I'm a subgenius.
Cause I'm a subgenius.
Let me go naked in the park.
Let me feel like my head's coming apart.
I don't know.
But I have been told.
Every 30 things that people gotta get old.
But I don't believe it.
Cause I'm a subgenius.
Well, I don't believe it.
Cause I'm a subgenius.
I take everybody for what they're worth.
I don't make no exception.
I don't like it when people try to talk back to me.
Cause I'm a subgenius.
I'm a subgenius.
I don't want you to get away from me.
You better like me for what I am.
If that isn't what pleases you.
Better make it right for me.
Cause I'm a subgenius.
Cause I'm a subgenius.
And I'll never be a subgenius.
We're super subgenius.
And we're super subgenius.
And we're super subgenius.

On our way to a Malaysian holiday in a place called Dobstown where they all stay.
They gotta get hip, get straight, and get cool.
They ain't gonna allow no fool to hang around with Bob.
Well, they never found Bob that day.
They said he just had gone away.
He was out to lunch or off to get shoes or gone buying groceries for people to blues.
I must not have been in need of slack because I never really managed to make it back.
But I sent my dollar to those people in town and I still keep getting them pamphlets sent around.
And I feel a little closer.
A little closer.

A little more in touch.
And I know it's helped me a whole lot of much.
But I sure do wish I'd been managing to hang out in the right place to actually catch a look at that shining face of Bob.
Bob!
