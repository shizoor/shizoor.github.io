1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:14,520
All things dull and ugly, all creatures short and squat.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,620
All things rude and nasty, the Lord God made the lot.

3
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:31,600
Each little snake that poisons, each little wasp that stings.

4
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:38,840
He made their brutish venom, he made their horrid wings.

5
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,880
All things sick and cancerous, all evil great and small.

6
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,600
All things foul and dangerous.

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,200
The Lord God made them all.

8
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:03,400
Each nasty little hornet, each beastly little squid.

9
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:11,620
Who made the spiky urchin, who made the shots, he did.

10
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:19,900
All things scabbed and ulcerous, all pox both great and small.

11
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,320
Putrid, foul and gangrenous, the Lord God made them all.

12
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,940
Amen.

13
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,320
Amen.

14
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,620
, send compassion from above to raise them all today.

15
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:04,240
In the fullness of thy power, shed thy glorious beams.

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,920
Upon the earth and all thereon, where life in shadow seems.

17
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,920
Let the light of God blaze forth to cut men free from pain.

18
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,580
Raise them up and clothe them with your love.

19
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:21,580


20
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,780
Congratulations to God with thy mighty, I am name.

21
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,580
Meditations on Love with Elizabeth Clare Robb

22
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,800
are a gift from this station and Church Universal in Toronto.

23
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:53,020
In fact, most people from Texas smile and tell me that that's what they've thought for years.

24
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:06,120
Smile to Texas. Smile to Texas. Smile to Texas. Smile to Texas. Smile to Texas. Smile to Texas.

25
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:13,760
These people are not some kind of UFO organization speaking for 10,000 scientists out there. These are

26
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,820
a couple of very far out people who are not even accepted in the UFO movement.

27
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,240
And if that is the case, why are we shooting at them?

28
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,760
I think

29
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,020
they're saying that people tell you the God's truth.

30
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,680
And I still transfixed. As a matter of fact, I was scared,

31
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,160
very badly frightened. I don't know what they are. I don't claim to know.

32
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,220
I'm not sure I even want to know, but I know that they do exist. They call themselves preachers.

33
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:54,380
They're not. They just call themselves that. They go all year long acting just exactly what a Christian

34
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,020
ought to and they'll take off about two weeks out of the year and go hide somewhere and sin.

35
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,780
SCENE

36
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,280
An evil plan began to form in a

37
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,620
Sils washed myself in clean water in 8 hours of Women's Land alltogether.

38
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,380
movie or on the radio or television

39
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,680
As it happens, that incident can only be described as a

40
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,900
confrontational event between 2 people.

41
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,580
telling a story in the word of what he had chosen as

42
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:17,700
a chance at the possible end

43
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,920
During this incident, a student in class when told he wanted to come to the

44
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:18,920


45
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:18,980
Takeaze. I'm even sure that it isn't a random littleνη

46
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,760
even if that silence initially took place.

47
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,280
Initially, certainly not certain to the scene in that scene but that woman's face sounds a vehemently

48
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,360
ん'. Grow up The feeling of the mind of boiling off as long as time allows things broaching into an

49
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,880
and control his mind.

50
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,460
A movie or on the radio or television,

51
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,800
in many cases those sounds...

52
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,440
Control his body and control his mind.

53
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,980
In a movie or on the radio or television,

54
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,700
in many cases those sounds...

55
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,120
He won't live that way.

56
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,680
I think the chimps are trying to talk to Dad.

57
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,560
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

58
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,060
Who are you?

59
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,660
Where are you going?

60
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,780
You think you know the answer.

61
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,060
But do you?

62
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,800
Do you know that you're a...

63
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,740
A hybrid?

64
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,720
A hybrid creature?

65
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,080
Son of a hybrid?

66
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,040
The grand...

67
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,820
Daughter of a hybrid?

68
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,480
Do you know the beginnings?

69
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,600
The real beginnings of life on this planet?

70
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,560
The beginnings that you can't know,

71
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,060
hence you don't know.

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,020
Where did you come from?

73
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,780
Where are you going?

74
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,640
Perhaps some mindless evolution,

75
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,420
you conclude,

76
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,040
causes you...

77
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,300
To be.

78
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,180
Where is the Earth going?

79
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,320
Where is the universe going?

80
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,980
Do you know?

81
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,840
You think these things are knowable?

82
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,060
So therefore you preclude thinking about them?

83
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,640
This is a battlefield, sir!

84
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,800
This is no recreation room!

85
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,100
Every nerve,

86
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,460
every muscle.

87
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:46,240
Seven, so heavy. Eight, so calm, very calm. Nine, you are relaxing deeper and deeper and deeper. Twenty-two, relaxing deeper, deeper and deeper.

88
00:06:47,740 --> 00:07:00,760
Twenty-three, only my voice matters not. Every nerve, every muscle completely calm.

89
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:08,900
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

90
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:32,180
What am I saying? It's your imagination. Use it and have fun. Be sure you get this.

91
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:39,560
Hour of Slap. Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

92
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,740
If you're coming to kill people and eat them, don't eat me. I'm a friend. I'll help you.

93
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:56,740
I think I would ask them, like, how do they talk? How's the weather? What do they eat? You know, you know, stuff, calming stuff, you know.

94
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:04,060
Definitely, um, if they have the secret of, uh, eternal life, give it to us.

95
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:11,980
Horror, humor, danger, and dignity. The rich, strange, and secret drama of...

96
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,720
...

97
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:12,940
...

98
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,820
...

99
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,900
...

100
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,240
...eternal salvation.

101
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,060
Or triple your money back.

102
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,660
The Church of the Subgenius.

103
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:45,000
Bring you another thirty-three minutes of condensed, eraglic function over the quality audio-visual techniques exacerbated and complicated by...

104
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,220
...the Church of the Subgenius.

105
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:46,800
of genius.

106
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,800
Copy.

107
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,460
This is your war.

108
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,040
Every time you drive your car or

109
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,240
take a walk, you're on the battlefield.

110
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,040
That's right. No man's land

111
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
is on our streets and on

112
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,180
our highways. The selfish

113
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,940
act, the heedless act,

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,840
is enemy work. In fact,

115
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,760
it is the enemy.

116
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,860
And these are

117
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,920
its victims, the innocents who must

118
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,960
pay the price in this pointless war.

119
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,740
Men of America,

120
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,820
men who work

121
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,680
with their hands,

122
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,820
men who know the difference between

123
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,860
imitation and the very best.

124
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,980
Yes, men of America

125
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,940
smoke Chesterfield cigarettes.

126
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,640
We do not want,

127
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,680
we don't want complete

128
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,840
zombies. This is, we only take,

129
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,920
as the tape said before, we only take

130
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,780
a portion of your mind, and even

131
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,680
that we give back to you when we're through with it.

132
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,800
Uh, as opposed to most any

133
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,400
other mind control cult.

134
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,720
When do you decide when you're through?

135
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,820
When is the

136
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,300
end, and how do you know?

137
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,860
We'll finish them off before they have

138
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,840
a chance to do anything about it.

139
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,000
Well, here's how I'll answer you.

140
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,520
Let the cyborgs resume work.

141
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,040
Right.

142
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,820
Yeah, the cyborgs

143
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,860
have resumed work.

144
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,840
Well, you're listening to the subgenius

145
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,320
radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

146
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,960
Dear listeners, your regular

147
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,480
host,

148
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,540
Reverend Ivan Stang, is

149
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,380
he's out working.

150
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,720
It's funny, most shows, their

151
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,020
host can't appear

152
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,880
when they go on vacation or whatnot.

153
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,000
Ours doesn't appear when he's

154
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,860
out working, and he is out

155
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,120
working. So it's

156
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,040
it's your friend

157
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,860
and mine, Will of Dobbs,

158
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,240
tonight speaking to you.

159
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,860
Here at the Hour of Slack,

160
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,920
and I think

161
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,100
to get started tonight, it's going

162
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,420
excuse me.

163
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,780
Ah,

164
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,060
my phlegm.

165
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,820
I want to start out with a song

166
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,080
tonight, and I don't know about you.

167
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,120
Well,

168
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,140
yeah, actually I do.

169
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,820
But if you're anything

170
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,920
like me, you're not much

171
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,840
into sports or sports

172
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,920
figures, but

173
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,140
there's a song here by

174
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,280
the great John Bartles

175
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,920
that expresses

176
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
emotions, however

177
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,440
related to sports

178
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,480
it may be.

179
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,000
I believe the emotions expressed

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,300
are so universal,

181
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,740
and mostly the performance

182
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,340
is

183
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,020
so good that I'm going to play

184
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,480
this for you tonight.

185
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,000
John Bartles.

186
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,220
De Fired Ditka.

187
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,140
I go to Chicago

188
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,420
January 5

189
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,800
I turn on the TV

190
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,040
Can't believe what they say

191
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,520
That dumbhead

192
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,880
McCaskey had his head in his

193
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,100
...

194
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,020
He fired Ditka

195
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,200
Decision was bad

196
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,560
They fired Ditka

197
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,600
They make a mistake

198
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,220
That dumbhead

199
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,880
McCaskey should go

200
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,160
chomping the leg

201
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,820
They fired Ditka

202
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,880
The bear's not the same

203
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,380
How does this McCaskey

204
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,420
Get ski in his name?

205
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,160
Now I like the bears

206
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,760
I'm a big footer

207
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,400
Football fan

208
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,920
When I go to Polka

209
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,020
I watch all I can

210
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,380
But they fired Ditka

211
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,600
Now Chicago is sunk

212
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,020
Without big Mike Iron

213
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,840
The bears must be chumped

214
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,700
They fired Ditka

215
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,640
They make a mistake

216
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,280
That dumbhead McCaskey

217
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,300
Should go chomping the leg

218
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,780
They fired Ditka

219
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,040
The bear's not the same

220
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,740
How does this McCaskey

221
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,580
Get ski in his name?

222
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,360
They fired Ditka

223
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


224
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


225
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


226
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


227
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


228
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


229
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


230
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


231
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


232
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


233
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,720
Now I quit Chicago

234
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,140
I quit football too

235
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,700
I did not come this country

236
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,840
To be treated like fools

237
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,160
McCaskey a dumbhead

238
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,460
Don't let money fool ya

239
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,760
When bears fire McCaskey

240
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,100
Then I say

241
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,120
Jankoo ya

242
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,740
I did not come this country to be treated like fools

243
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,360
They fire in the car, they make a mistake.

244
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,220
That dumbhead McCaskey should go jumping the lake.

245
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,720
They fire in the car, the bear's not the same.

246
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,300
How does this McCaskey put Steve in his name?

247
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,420
The School Bus.

248
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,080
You ever think of trying sleep instead of Benzedrine?

249
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
You know you might like it.

250
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,660
What the heck? I'm human. We're all human here.

251
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,460
We're not monsters from outer space.

252
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,620
Oh, I can't believe it.

253
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,800
Lieutenant, you'd better get me to a hospital.

254
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,940
This drug is starting to take effect.

255
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,220
Oh.

256
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,140
Yes.

257
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,920
Oh, my God!

258
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,020
Our communication system is not functioning properly.

259
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,100
Our transmissions are being blocked.

260
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,240
Oh!

261
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,460
Are you afraid to die?

262
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,460
Are you afraid?

263
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:15,840
Are you afraid to die?

264
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,400
Uh-uh.

265
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,780
But if you're smart, you'll make opportunities.

266
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,680
Hi, baby.

267
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,120
Some of this, maybe?

268
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,220
Ooh!

269
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,960
Let's talk about love.

270
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,080
Love.

271
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,180
Love.

272
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:39,920
Love.

273
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,100
Love.

274
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,560
Love.

275
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:43,980
Love.

276
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:44,900
Love.

277
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,200
Love.

278
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:46,640
Love.

279
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,120
Love.

280
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,440
Love everything.

281
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,660
Love the creepy crawlies.

282
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,960
The spiders.

283
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,000
Love all of it.

284
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,860
Love?

285
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,060
Love!

286
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,320
Love?

287
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,320


288
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,120
Sorry!

289
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,340


290
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,920
Shoot!

291
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,540
No, stop!

292
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:10,540


293
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:10,540


294
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:10,540


295
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,620
This is three cars ahead of me and this is a three car light.

296
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,800
And the first one, look, the first one hadn't even moved.

297
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,540
It's already been green for 20, look at that.

298
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,040
It's 109 degrees.

299
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,220
The first one is such a, ah, the way these people are.

300
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,000
As for you, you yourself involved, oh.

301
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,380
You shouldn't even be allowed on the road.

302
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,700
I can't believe.

303
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,000
Sit there for 20 seconds while the lights are out.

304
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,880
I went through it red.

305
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,980
It's just, you know, they're all so sound asleep, Doug.

306
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,280
You wonder what the f*** are they doing.

307
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,520
What's wrong?

308
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,780
It's the wind.

309
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,200
I can't see it.

310
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,780
Oh, no.

311
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,640
It's like the whole world moves around you in a trance-like state.

312
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,300
Unheeding, unfeeling, unseeing, unthinking.

313
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,240
The whole thing stops.

314
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,980
You insensate me.

315
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,700
Me too.

316
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,240
Mone.

317
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,660
God.

318
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,220
You're not a real doctor.

319
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,060
Kids.

320
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,840
Who make little bastards.

321
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,340
Kids.

322
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,860
Let go.

323
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,760
Let go.

324
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,800
Don't hurt him.

325
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,700
I'll have another one.

326
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:08,900
Look.

327
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:08,980


328
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,240
We'll bring him up right.

329
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,100
Consuming.

330
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,080
Gobbling it in one end and f***ing it out the other.

331
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,520
That's what 99% of the population, that's all they do.

332
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,820
They don't create anything.

333
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,000
They don't think.

334
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,400
They don't have interesting conversations.

335
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,300
They don't even talk to each other.

336
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,180
The whole thing is just absolutely ridiculous, Doug.

337
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,900
I'm just, you know, American culture is really,

338
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,020
starting to get my case bad.

339
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,480
I hear you're doing wonderful things with adipoidal tissue.

340
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,400
They're just all so self-involved.

341
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:54,100
I mean, I thought Brazilians were self-involved, but at least when things like traffic and

342
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:59,940
stuff like that, dangerous and self-involved as they are, at least they're awake, you know.

343
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:05,880
They're dangerous because they drive so fast, so speedily and so sportily, but at least

344
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,660
they're running at 95% when they do this.

345
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,060
People here drive on about 12%, man.

346
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,380
You can tell, especially in the mornings.

347
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,420
They got their little coffee cup, the one with the big wide flat bottom so it won't fall over.

348
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,000
And you know, they're just drinking coffee or doing their damn makeup or hair in the mirror.

349
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,160
You get behind them and they're not paying any attention to the traffic.

350
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,700
All they're looking at is the taillights of the guy in front of them.

351
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,440
That's all, that's as far as they can see.

352
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,180
On the left stairs.

353
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,620
Followers of obsolete, unthinkable trades.

354
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,880
Doodling in Etruscan.

355
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,600
Add to that the

356
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:56,600


357
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:56,600


358
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:56,600


359
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,000
The

360
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,180
The

361
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,440
The

362
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:02,840
The

363
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:02,860
The

364
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,120
The

365
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,760
The

366
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,040
The

367
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,040


368
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,600
The

369
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:07,600


370
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,180
The The

371
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,560
The

372
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,520
The

373
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,780
The

374
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,020
The

375
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,000
The

376
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,240
The

377
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,300
The The

378
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,680
The

379
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,580
The

380
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:28,580


381
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,040
The

382
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,040


383
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,040


384
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,460
The

385
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:29,460


386
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:29,460


387
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:29,460


388
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:29,460


389
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:29,460


390
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:29,460


391
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:29,460


392
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:29,480
The

393
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:29,480


394
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,480
The first thing that happens is that the bones splinter.

395
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,420
We're moving over to conquer.

396
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:44,300
Our intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe searching the skies for an alien signal.

397
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:51,100
Is our sun being scrutinized for some sign of orbiting planets that might harbor traces

398
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,000
of life?

399
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,800
Could be.

400
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,180
Could be.

401
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,760
Could be.

402
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,100
Could be.

403
00:21:59,440 --> 00:21:59,460
Could be.

404
00:21:59,480 --> 00:21:59,480


405
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,000
Could be.

406
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,880
And now, our next topic.

407
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,000
The caller, threat, menace, or blight.

408
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,480
A symposium presented by the show.

409
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:21,380
Of all the vexations and problems which afflict the show from time to time, none is as deadly

410
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:27,520
in its far-reaching effects or as potent a radiotoxin as the caller.

411
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:35,860
These pestiferous individuals who persist in contacting the show and causing the lights

412
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:41,320
on the board to flash, distracting the doctors as they attempt to do their work, never give

413
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:49,960
up or even consider the fact that their puerile spoutings and spewings may be of no slight

414
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,980
interest to the great minds and brilliant intellects of the doctors of the air.

415
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,680
Yet, they persist.

416
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,900
In attempting to contact us.

417
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,380
What's your phone number?

418
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

419
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,540
Just you and me.

420
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,240
Hi girls.

421
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,700
Let me get a hold of myself.

422
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,240
We haven't given out the phone number once, but that's the way the show is, of course.

423
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,320
So we're going down to the...

424
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,820
Okay girls, the lineup is up.

425
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,100
Brother, I've had some tough nuts to crack in my time.

426
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:20,660
Thanks.

427
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,960
Osteopaths, and the spirits...

428
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,160
It's all right.

429
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,380
It's all right.

430
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:25,380


431
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:25,500
I'm not a doctor.

432
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm a doctor.

433
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,000


434
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,000


435
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,000


436
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,000


437
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,000


438
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,000


439
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,000


440
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,000


441
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,860
Nothing like this.

442
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:39,160
Investigators of infractions denounced by bland, paranoid chess players.

443
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:54,000
Servers of fragmentary warrants taken down in hebephrenic shorthand.

444
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,160
Charging unspeakable mutilations of the spirit.

445
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,860
Officials of unconstituted police states.

446
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,440
Broke.

447
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,160
Officials of unconstituted police states.

448
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:16,540
Broke.

449
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:35,100
Brokers of exquisite dreams and nostalgias tested on the sensitized cells of junk sickness

450
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,180
and bartered for raw materials of the will.

451
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:46,120
Drinkers of the heavy fluid sealed in translucent amber of dreams.

452
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,280
What do you see, Michael?

453
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,120
Tell me.

454
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,020
It's all natural.

455
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,220
Natural.

456
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,200
It's made from aquatic Brazilian centipede.

457
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,800
Of course, some such outlandish thing.

458
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,480
It shuts down the brain's response tool.

459
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,740
Looked in the attic, then ceases to be addicted.

460
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,920
Side effects?

461
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,620
Nothing that will surprise the attic.

462
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,000
It's like darkness.

463
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,240
It's hell down here.

464
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,320
Small fire, oppressive heat.

465
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,680
Who the hell's in charge down here?

466
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,140
We're in a war zone.

467
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,500
Horribly wounded in a deadly crossfire.

468
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,320
It's completely out of control down here.

469
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:37,920
No!

470
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,040
Here's your pills.

471
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,960
Almost done.

472
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,640
I can't...

473
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,540
You're scaring him.

474
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,680
Am I?

475
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,980
Am I?

476
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,860
Oh, well, mister, you scare me, too.

477
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,880
You don't look like me.

478
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,440
You don't act like me.

479
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,480
You hate me.

480
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:09,980
Well, you know what?

481
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,200
I'm not so crazy about you, either.

482
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,620
Do you think you could rub some of this powder on my lips?

483
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,120
Yes.

484
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,780
Yes.

485
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,680
Yeah.

486
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,420
Well, I've got some.

487
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,420


488
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,420


489
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,420


490
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,420


491
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,420


492
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,420


493
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,420


494
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,420


495
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,420


496
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,420


497
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,420


498
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,420


499
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,420


500
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,420


501
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,420
Indeed, my son, it is all ugalabuga here.

502
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,940
That is what these callers have brought to us.

503
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,140
You!

504
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,700
Let us pause and consider what the world and the show

505
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,080
would be like without callers.

506
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,600
Would it not be a peaceful place?

507
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,720
There are no annoyances or distractions.

508
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,100
As we stumble through life,

509
00:26:54,020 --> 00:27:02,660
can learn to do without and among these are lice lizards and pursuing calls all right so you get

510
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,720
depressed and you go what and you go to a mental hospital and they what they smoke your brain they

511
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,600
put you on a table and hook you up to electrodes is that what they do to you what do they do to

512
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,660
you i picture dick somewhere in a mental institution naked rocking back and forth

513
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,080
in his own feces i just i just see that image of dick well they weren't my own

514
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:33,260
there are jews in the world there are buddhists there are hindus and mormons and then

515
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:42,360
there are those that follow muhammad but i've never been one of them

516
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:52,440
i'm a roman catholic and have been since before i was born

517
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,000
i'm a roman catholic and have been since before i was born

518
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,700
and the one thing they say about catholics is they'll take you as soon as you're warm

519
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:08,300
you don't have to be a six-footer you don't have to have a great brain

520
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:17,000
you don't have to have any clothes on you're a catholic the moment that came

521
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,120
because

522
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,080
every

523
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,840
is sacred every sperm is great

524
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:39,160
if a sperm is wasted god gets quite irate

525
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,480
every sperm is sacred

526
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,920
every sperm is great

527
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,980
if a sperm is wasted

528
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,400
if a sperm is wasted god gets quite irate

529
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:07,700
let the heathen spill theirs on the dusty ground

530
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:17,360
god shall make them pay for each sperm that can't be found

531
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,940
every sperm is wanted

532
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,980
every sperm is wanted

533
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:23,980


534
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:23,980


535
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,560
every sperm is good

536
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,660
every sperm is needed

537
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,560
in your neighbourhoods

538
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,160

take care of them

543
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,080


544
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,080

In your neighborhood

Every sperm is useful

552
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,300
Every sperm is fine

553
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,580
One is everybody's

554
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:41,340
Mine

Every sperm is great

561
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,040
Every sperm is wasted

562
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,300
God cares quite

563
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,260
My life

564
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,660
You know, it's true.

565
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,860
Every fellow

566
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,680
Only I can help

567
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,320
And ちゃんと

568
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,320


569
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,280
The world

570
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,160
So it's okay

571
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,420
To see

572
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,600
我

573
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,180
Probably

574
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,880
One attempt

575
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,380
To whatever

576
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,060
Things

577
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,100
For me

578
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,160
To be

579
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,220
worthwhile endeavor. Arnold Mathis

580
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,800
with a little bit of his End of the World

581
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,100
ink. Ren and Stimpy

582
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,840
of course with their famous

583
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,060
countdown. And John Bartles

584
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,780
with De Fier Ditka.

585
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,500
A lot of

586
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,260
barrage put together by

587
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,540
puzzling evidence.

588
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,820
There's some negative land.

589
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,520
A fair amount of

590
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,020
the KPFA show

591
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,560
out of Berkeley, California starring

592
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,440
Dr. Howell.

593
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,400
And a little bit of

594
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,540
Reverend Stang on an interview I believe with

595
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,580
the WFMU.

596
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,720
And Every Sperm

597
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,680
is Sacred by

598
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,660
Monty Python. I never know whether

599
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,620
we should be playing anything

600
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,360
from them.

601
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,420
Goodness knows they're

602
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,420
funny and always have been but

603
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,700
don't you just hate those

604
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,480
people that all they ever do

605
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,260
are Monty Python routines

606
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,280
as if nothing had

607
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,740
been invented in the meantime.

608
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,480
Yes.

609
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,180
They're very annoying.

610
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,980
I hate them.

611
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,620
A small minority but

612
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,420
a very vocal minority.

613
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,620
And now because he's not

614
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,300
here to speak for himself

615
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,400
uh

616
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,180
your good friend in mind

617
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,040
Reverend Ivan Stang.

618
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,700
Thank you.

619
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,960
Thank you.

620
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,320
Thank you so much.

621
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,480
Thank you.

622
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,060
Thank you.

623
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,100
Thank you.

624
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:51,260
Tell your colleagues

625
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:51,260


626
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:51,260


627
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:51,260


628
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:59,160
We're following our readings from the Long's Hat,

629
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,840
gateway to the dimensions,

630
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,080
allegedly by Dr. Hakeem Bay.

631
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,220
You would not be listening to this radio broadcast

632
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,440
had you not already penetrated halfway to the ICS.

633
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,600
You have been searching for us without knowing it,

634
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:27,280
following oblique references in crudely Xeroxed marginal publications

635
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,960
and crackpot mystical pamphlets,

636
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,640
mail-order cult courses in chaos magic,

637
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,860
a paper trail and a coded series of rumors

638
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,600
spread at street level through circles involved

639
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,220
into the illicit distribution of certain controlled substances

640
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,420
and the propagation of the virus.

641
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,060
Of certain acts of insurrection against the planetary work machine

642
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,580
and the consensus reality.

643
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:58,080
Or perhaps through various obscure mimeograph technical papers

644
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,760
on the edges of chaos science.

645
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,440
Through pirate computer networks

646
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,780
or even through pure synchronicity

647
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,460
and the pursuit of dreams.

648
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,320
In any case, we now know something about you.

649
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:15,520
You.

650
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:16,400
You.

651
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,400


652
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,400


653
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,280
Your interests, deeds and desires,

654
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,240
your works and days,

655
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,500
and we know your address.

656
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,140
Otherwise, you wouldn't be hearing this.

657
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,200
During the 1970s and 80s,

658
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,180
the chaos, so-called,

659
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,420
began to emerge as a new scientific paradigm

660
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,260
on a level of importance with relativity and quantum mechanics.

661
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,400
It was born out of the mixing of matter,

662
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:59,800
macro dtistematics,

663
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,860
ена and conophoroboeja

664
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:07,560
and a wonderful name for pollution says

665
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:07,560


666
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:07,560


667
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:07,560


668
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:07,560


669
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:07,560


670
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:07,560


671
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:07,560


672
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:07,560


673
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,220
on the national site of E3uk,

674
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,580
Dr M.

675
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,700
claim to have helped away all sinister waar einen

676
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,260
��

677
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:27,400
paradigm. The slogan, order out of chaos, summed up the gist of this new science, whether it studied

678
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:33,500
the weird fractional dimensional shapes underlying swirls of cigarette smoke or the distribution of

679
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:40,580
colors in marble paper. Ordov's dealt with harder matters such as heart fibrillation, particle beams,

680
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:50,640
or population frameworks. However, by the late 1980s, it began to appear as if this chaos movement had split apart

681
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:59,160
into two opposite and hostile worldviews, one placing emphasis on chaos itself, the other on order.

682
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:08,780
According to the later sect, the determinists, chaos was the enemy, randomicity a force to be overcome or denied.

683
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:16,740
The opposing faction, however, experienced chaos as benevolent, the necessary matrix out of which arises

684
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:26,120
spontaneously an infinity of variegated forms, a pleroma rather than an abyss, a principle of continual

685
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:38,540
creation, unstructured, fecund, beautiful, a spirit of wildness. Chaos as hell. Easy to predict

686
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:38,760
what would happen if chaos was a part of the chaos. Chaos as hell. Chaos as hell. Chaos as hell. Chaos as hell.

687
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,380
Which of these two schools of thought would receive vast funding and support from governments and

688
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:50,100
multinationals and intelligence agencies? And by the end of the decade, quantum chaos had been forced

689
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:56,720
underground, virtually censored by lack of money for research, literally censored by prestigious

690
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:07,360
scientific journals which published only papers by determinists. So even when the leading theoreticians

691
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,740
of quantum chaos were not able to find a way to solve the chaos, they were able to solve it.

692
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:15,780
When the chaos began to be fired from university and corporate positions, they were still able to pursue certain goals.

693
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:25,120
Even when they began to suffer political pressures as well and sought refuge and space among the mutants and marginals, still they persevered.

694
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:37,240
Up until the crash of 1987, the alternative network amounted to little more than a nebulous weave of bent pals and computer infersions.

695
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:54,420
The whole earth of nostalgia, futurologists, anarchists, food cranks, neo-pagans and cultists, self-publishing punk poets, armchair schizophrenics, survivalists, and male artists.

696
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:02,660
The crash, however, opened vast but hard to see cracks in the social and economic control structures of America.

697
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,220
Gradually, the marginals and mutants began to be destroyed.

698
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,580
The world began to fill up these fissures with the webs of their own networking.

699
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:24,220
They created a genuine black economy, as well as a shifting and insubstantial autonomous zone, impossible to map, but real enough in its various manifestations.

700
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:35,400
The orphaned scientists of quantum chaos theory fell into this invisible anti-empire like a catalyst.

701
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,220
Or perhaps it was the end.

702
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:37,940
Or perhaps it was the other way around.

703
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,380
In either case, something crystallized.

704
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:47,720
To explain the precipitation of this jewel, we must move on to specific causes, cases, people, and stories.

705
00:40:50,600 --> 00:41:01,140
The Moorish Orthodox Church of America is an offshoot of the Moorish Science Temple, the world's first Islamic heretical sect.

706
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:07,200
Founded by a black circus magician named Nobel Drew Ali, the first Muslim to have ever been a Muslim.

707
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,600
The church was founded in Newark, New Jersey in 1913.

708
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:17,480
In the 1950s, some white jazz musicians and poets held passports, so to speak, in the MST.

709
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:32,860
And they founded the Moorish Orthodox Church, which also traced its spiritual ancestry to various wandering bishops loosely affiliated with the old Catholic Church and schisms of Syrian Orthodoxy.

710
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,180
In the 1960s, the church acquired a new direction.

711
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,900
From the psychedelic movement.

712
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,200
And for a while maintained a presence at Timothy Leary's commune in Millbrook, New York.

713
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:51,260
At the same time, the discovery of Sufism led certain of its members to undertake journeys to the East.

714
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:07,160
One known by the Moorish name, Wali Fard, traveled for years in India for the purpose of

715
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,160


716
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,360
property for insane Muslims.

717
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,200
At the age ofytic

718
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,200


719
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,960
Import時

720
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,140
When history forced him to return to America in 1978,

721
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,140
he was able to launder his savings

722
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,720
by purchasing about 200 acres of land

723
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,120
in the New Jersey Pine Barrens.

724
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,020
Around the turn of the decade,

725
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,500
he moved into an old rod and gun club on the property

726
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,480
along with several runaway boys from Paramus, New Jersey,

727
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,620
and an anarchist lesbian couple from Brooklyn

728
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,980
and founded the Moorish Science Ashram.

729
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,120
Through the early to mid-'80s,

730
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,200
the commune's fortunes fluctuated,

731
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,040
sometimes nearly flickering out.

732
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:00,420
Bard self-published a series of Xeroxed visionary recitals

733
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,220
and chaos science.

734
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:07,500
After the crash, a number of destitute moors and sympathizers

735
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,300
began turning up at the ashram seeking refuge.

736
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,460
Among these were two young chaos scientists

737
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,600
recently fired,

738
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:18,380
fired from Princeton on charges of seditious nonsense,

739
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,720
a brother and sister, Frank and Althea Dobbs.

740
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,900
The Dobbs twins spent their early childhood

741
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,620
on a UFO cult commune in rural Texas,

742
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,700
founded by their father,

743
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,040
a retired insurance salesman

744
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,820
who was murdered by rogue disciples

745
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,220
during a revival in California.

746
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:44,340
One might say the siblings had a head start in chaos,

747
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:49,180
and the ashram's modus vivendi suited them admirably.

748
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,900
The Pine Barrens have often been called

749
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,560
a perfect place for a UFO landing.

750
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,020
They settled into an old Airstream trailer

751
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,340
and constructed a rude laboratory

752
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,020
in a rebuilt barn hidden deep in the pines.

753
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,240
Illegal sources of income were available

754
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,260
from their agricultural projects,

755
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,280
and the amorphous community took shape

756
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,500
around the startling breakthroughs

757
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:14,600
with the Ashram.

758
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:14,600


759
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:14,860
The Dobbs twins were the first to make a new project

760
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:14,860


761
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,220
The project was made by the Dobbs twins

762
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,380
during the years around the end of the decade.

763
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,980
As undergraduates at the University of Texas,

764
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,880
the siblings had produced a series of equations,

765
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,260
which they felt certain contained the seeds

766
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,080
of a new science they called cognitive chaos.

767
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:37,060
Their dismissal from Princeton followed their attempt

768
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,000
to submit these theorems along with the theoretical,

769
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,480
philosophical system built upon them,

770
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,780
as a joint PhD thesis.

771
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,960
On the assumption that brain activity can be modeled

772
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,460
as a fractal universe, an auteur topology interfacing

773
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,680
with both random and determined forces,

774
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,460
the twins' theorems showed that consciousness itself

775
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:05,100
could be presented as a set of strange attractors,

776
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,520
or patterns of chaos, around which specific neuronal activity

777
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,020
would organize itself.

778
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,240
By a bizarre synthesis of Mandelbrot and Cantor,

779
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:21,440
they solved the problem of n-dimensional attractors,

780
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,480
many of which they were able to generate

781
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,520
on Princeton's powerful computers

782
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,960
before their hasty departure.

783
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,460
Two more scientists already resuscitated the scientists,

784
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:42,460


785
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:42,460


786
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:42,600
and the two of them,

787
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,840
the students of Ong's Hat, joined with Fard and the twins

788
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,760
in founding the Institute for Chaos Studies.

789
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:53,480
By sheer chance, their work provided the perfect counterparts

790
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,000
to the Dobbs research.

791
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:00,340
Harold Acton, an expatriate British computer and reality hacker,

792
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,700
had already linked 64 second-hand personal computers

793
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,980
into a vast ad hoc system, based on his own

794
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,300
I Ching-oriented speculations.

795
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,760
And Martine Kalikak, a native of the Barrens from nearby Chatsworth,

796
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,580
had set up a machine shop.

797
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,960
Martine had long since proven herself a bricoleuse,

798
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:28,260
an electronics buff and backlot inventor of great genius and artistry.

799
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,540
With the arrival of the Dobbs twins,

800
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:35,680
she discovered her true metier in the realization of various devices

801
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,840
for the implementation of their proposed

802
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,620
experiments.

803
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:43,460
The synergy level at the ICS exceeded all expectations.

804
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,720
Contacts with other underground experts in various related fields

805
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,920
were maintained by black modem,

806
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,180
as well as personal visits to the ashram.

807
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,140
The spiritual rhythms permeating the place proved ideal.

808
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:03,700
Periods of dazed and lazy contemplation and applied hedonics,

809
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,960
alternating with peak bursts of energy,

810
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,300
and the

811
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,240
self-overcoming activity and focused attention.

812
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,280
At this hodgepodge of Moorish science,

813
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:23,020
Tantra, Sufism, Ishmaelic esotericism, alchemy and psychopharmacology,

814
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,200
biofeedback, brain machine meditation techniques, etc.,

815
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,120
it all seemed to harmonize in unexpectedly fruitful ways

816
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,860
with the pure science of the ICS.

817
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:38,560
Under these conditions, progress proved amazingly swift,

818
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,440
stunning even the institute's founders.

819
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:47,280
Within a year, major advances had been made in all the fields predicted by the equations.

820
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:52,120
Then followed a slight lull, while software programming and hardware machining

821
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,140
caught up with the initial breakthroughs.

822
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,820
Somewhat more than three years after the founding,

823
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,720
there occurred THE breakthrough,

824
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:03,760
the discovery which served to reorient our entire project in a new direction.

825
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,160
The Gate.

826
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:21,600
The accident occurred while we were in the first stages of developing the fourth generation egg,

827
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,940
The Gate.

828
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,200
At the time, we had no idea of its full potential.

829
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,900
However, all of us, except for the very youngest who were evacuated,

830
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,480
had by then been trained in elementary self-directed regeneration.

831
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,080
A few tests proved that with care and effort,

832
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,440
we could resist at least the initial onslaught of radiation sickness.

833
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,560
We decided to stick it out at least until the authorities,

834
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:51,320
rather than the dump, proved too hot to endure.

835
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,020
The Gate.

836
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,160
Once the Gate was discovered,

837
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,220
we realized the situation had been saved.

838
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,720
The opening, and actual interdimensional travel,

839
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,600
can only be effected by a fully trained cognitive chaotic.

840
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:12,220
So, the first priority was to complete the course for all of our members.

841
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,980
A technique for carrying young children was developed,

842
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,200
and it was discovered that all inanimate matter within the egg

843
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,280
is also carried across with the operator.

844
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,060
Little by little,

845
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,100
we carted our entire establishment,

846
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:32,600
including most of the buildings across the topological abyss.

847
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:36,060
Unlike Baudelaire, who pleaded,

848
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:39,320
anywhere so long as it is out of this world,

849
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,320
we knew where we were going.

850
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,900
Ong's hat had indeed vanished from New Jersey,

851
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,980
except for the hidden laboratory deep in the backwoods

852
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,440
where the Gate, quote, exists.

853
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,840
On the other side of the Gate,

854
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,240
we found a pine barren similar to ours,

855
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,800
but in a world which apparently never developed human life.

856
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,160
Of course, we have since visited a number of other worlds,

857
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,180
but we decided to colonize this one,

858
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,960
our first Newfoundland.

859
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,260
We still live in the same scattering of leather gray shacks

860
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,680
and Airstream trailers,

861
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,500
recycled chicken coops and mail order yurts,

862
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,200
only a bit more spread out and considerably more relaxed.

863
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,440
We're still dependent on your world for many things,

864
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,820
from coffee to books to computers,

865
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:33,640
and in fact we have no intention of cutting ourselves off from anchorites

866
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:37,660
and merely scarpering off into dream world.

867
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,360
We intend to spread the word.

868
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,380
The colonization of new worlds,

869
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,360
even an infinity of them,

870
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,480
can never act as a panacea for the ills of consensus reality

871
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,580
only as a palliative.

872
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,660
We have always taken our diseases with us to each new frontier.

873
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,260
Everywhere we go, we exterminate Aborigines

874
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,340
and battle with our weapons of law and order

875
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:08,040
against the chaos of reality.

876
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,420
But this time, we believe,

877
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,400
the affair will go differently,

878
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,000
because this time, the journey outward

879
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,440
can only be made simultaneously with the journey inward.

880
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,460
And because this bootleg

881
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,760
strap trick can only be attained by a consciousness

882
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,620
which has overcome itself,

883
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,140
liberated itself from self-sickness

884
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,940
and realizing itself.

885
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,220
Not that we think ourselves saints

886
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,080
or try to behave morally

887
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,760
or imagine ourselves a super race

888
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,620
absolved from good and evil.

889
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,420
Simply, we like to consider ourselves awake

890
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,120
when we're awake,

891
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,500
sleeping when we sleep.

892
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,680
We enjoy good health.

893
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:58,080
We have learned that desire demands the other

894
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,940
just as it demands the self.

895
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:05,200
We see no end to growth while life lasts,

896
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,920
no cessation of unfolding

897
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,160
of the continual outpouring of form from chaos.

898
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:16,320
We're moving on, nomads and monads of the dimensions.

899
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,700
Sometimes we feel almost satisfied,

900
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,840
at other times, terrified.

901
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,300
Meanwhile, our agents of chaos remain behind

902
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,480
to set up ICS courses

903
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,720
and distribute Moorish Orthodox literature

904
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,460
and subgenius propaganda

905
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:36,580
to subvert and evade our enemies.

906
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,240
We haven't spoken yet of our enemies.

907
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,780
Indeed, there remains much we have not said.

908
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,240
This lecture,

909
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:51,160
disguised as a sort of New Age vacation tape,

910
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,300
must fall silent at this point,

911
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:58,360
satisfied that it has embedded within itself

912
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,140
enough clues for its intended listeners

913
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:05,840
who are already halfway to Ong's hat in any case,

914
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,260
but not enough for those of little faith to follow.

915
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,120
Chaos never died.

916
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,760
It Mans Stefan

917
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:45,820
Tom Seroun

Finaster

919
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:46,300


920
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:46,300


921
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:46,300


922
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:46,300


923
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:02,740
1968 is over, it's over

924
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:08,480
1981 is over

925
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,700
Future is now

926
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,540
It's really gonna be a better world

927
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:23,600
So many people try again and again and again

928
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,600
To change, it's over, gone, up and from

929
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,400
Let it get a little better

930
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:35,940
24, 5, 6, 7, left and right and right and freedom

931
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:39,640
23, 4, 5, 6, 7, left and right and right and heaven

932
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,580
1960, it's over

933
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,760
It's over

934
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,540
1900, take care, well, it's over

935
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:02,520
Future is now

936
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,760
My love for you was bigger than my love for me

937
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,800
Surely you see

938
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,680
Now I am free, I found the key

939
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,020
And I love everybody

940
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,680
Just gonna free everybody

941
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,060
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, left and right and right and freedom

942
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:31,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, left and right and right and heaven

943
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,020
1968 is over

944
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,500
It's over

945
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,220
1990, it's over

946
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,780
1981 is over

947
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:57,600
Future is now

948
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,960
Slavery will free you

949
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,300
Slavery will free you

950
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,080
Now you forget, the first thing that comes to mind

951
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,060
The love is coming, you will not forget it

952
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,200
You will be drunk, you will be drunk

953
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,260

What can we do?

Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye!

1002
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,760
This is again Radio Yellow.

1003
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,740
Must breach oxygen switch.

1004
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,420
Rocket going out of control. Off trajectory.

1005
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,020
Must lose consciousness.

1006
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,080
Must breach oxygen.

1007
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,340
Passing out.

1008
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,000
Gravity too strong.

1009
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:06,960
Can't take it.

1010
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,980
Must stay awake.

1011
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,480
Give me a minute, Mr. Fireball.

1012
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,480
Ahhhhhhh!

1013
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,780
That is a shocking one.

1014
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,660
Well, what about that, Mr. Fireball?

1015
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,060
Get that cat out of here.

1016
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,160
Smoke filled the refrigerator.

1017
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,780
Dr. Fireball laid behind the bar.

1018
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,760
Come here, son. Let me feel the bumps on your head.

1019
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,240
The CAT scan will solve the mystery of the bump.

1020
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:29,680
What's going on?

1021
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,520
Okay, here we go.

1022
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,580
As Dr. Fireball and Cat in hand,

1023
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,900
the doctors begin the surgery.

1024
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,840
They don't call me Fireball for nothing.

1025
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,260
We'll get that bump off your head, Bill.

1026
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,600
Oh, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1027
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,460
That's what's called a bump.

1028
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,480
That electric cat's going crazy.

1029
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:47,220
The show comes out of the stomach.

1030
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,860
This is some of that sidekick surgery.

1031
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,820
That bump has caused you, hippest love child,

1032
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,880
to clean you off the patient.

1033
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,360
Wow, I'd like to be cleaned off like that.

1034
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:55,860
Interesting.

1035
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,560
What kind of phrenologist are you?

1036
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,120
Situation normal.

1037
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,640
All phrenology done.

1038
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,980
I wouldn't do this except if I knew where to stay.

1039
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,000
Hold still, Philo.

1040
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,120
An attitude of peace and harmony.

1041
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,460
I'll say this to Philo.

1042
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:12,460


1043
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:16,300
It's true I may smile owing to my sincere faith in Bob.

1044
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:20,160
Though I lost my career and I cry in my beer,

1045
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,320
this show is my only real job.

1046
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:22,920
What was it?

1047
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,620
Never surpassed.

1048
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,940
They say it can fly thousands of miles on its wings.

1049
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:31,920
Wings as big as you can tell.

1050
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,100
Metal implements out of the patient?

1051
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:38,020
They built little metal implements in agriculture

1052
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,820
and in starting their civilization.

1053
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,140
I know.

1054
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,680
I hope you're being stern.

1055
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,400
I hope you're happy.

1056
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,260
I'm a hooker barter for the love child.

1057
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:51,600
Be comfortably seated or prone prior to inhaling the vapors

1058
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:56,060
of the hideous, bloated, southwestern touch.

1059
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:09,600
The sounds of KPFA fade into the distance as...

1060
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:11,860
As we must know.

1061
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,040
Well, most of this...

1062
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,020
Excuse me.

1063
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:14,500
Again.

1064
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,400
Half hour was your good friend and mine, Reverend Stang,

1065
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,780
reading the Hakeem Bae piece,

1066
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,460
which I believe he also was using.

1067
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,060
Mr. Philip Glass.

1068
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,660
Mishima, I think.

1069
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,080
And then Nina Hagen.

1070
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:31,960
Sorry, go ahead.

1071
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,700
And then more KPFA show.

1072
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:39,800
In fact, that's what you'll be hearing once I've finished speaking,

1073
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,680
is more KPFA show.

1074
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,100
While you're getting your pens and pencils ready

1075
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,980
to write down that address like you always do every week

1076
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,300
and mean to send something,

1077
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,860
if you've seen the latest issue of Mondo 2000,

1078
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:53,820
you probably have.

1079
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,740
I don't think it's come out yet, but we got our copy.

1080
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:58,980
There's a long interview and many pieces of artwork

1081
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,800
from St. Paul Mavridis.

1082
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,620
And just, they ask him at one point,

1083
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,180
who is Bob?

1084
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,180
What is Bob?

1085
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,800
And he says it better than I.

1086
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,400
When he says,

1087
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,720
J.R. Bob Dobbs is a mystery

1088
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,040
enfolded by an enigma,

1089
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,960
bound by a puzzle,

1090
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,340
wrapped in a strip of bacon,

1091
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,120
surrounded by creamy nougat

1092
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,200
and a rich milk chocolate coating,

1093
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,760
held together with a toothpick,

1094
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,600
served on a greasy paper napkin.

1095
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,400
And he also goes on to say that since he found subgenius,

1096
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,060
he owes a lot more money than he used to

1097
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,700
and he has to work harder than ever.

1098
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,980
Well, that's not everyone's case.

1099
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,700
He's a special individual.

1100
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:43,760
Now, that address, as always, is

1101
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,600
Church of the Subgenius,

1102
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,040
or just write to Bob, it's easier,

1103
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:53,320
at Post Office Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

1104
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,560
Texas 75214.

1105
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,660
14306 in Dallas, Texas.

1106
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:00,840
75214.

1107
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:03,000
Thank you, praise Bob, and good night.

1108
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:12,460
Okay, we all did that.

1109
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,500
That's a real cheap-time effect

1110
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,340
where we all get 60 cents each time we do it.

1111
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,580
Okay, now Hal is riding up the hill

1112
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,700
on a giant white Charger.

1113
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,220
You know, and I did want everybody to remember

1114
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,600
that after 14 years,

1115
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:25,460
the link to the spacecraft is lost.

1116
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:30,000
Today, NASA lost contract with the Pioneer 12 spaceship

1117
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,760
orbiting Venus as the craft began a slow,

1118
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,840
fiery plunge into the planet's atmosphere

1119
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,940
14 years after starting a mission.

1120
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:37,960


1121
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:37,960


1122
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:37,960


1123
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,060
It plunged like an impatient lover

1124
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:43,220
beneath the outer mantle of the albedo.

1125
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,440
Initial indications are that it's gone or damaged,

1126
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,200
and this is happening while we speak.

1127
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,500
The radio signal was lost, possibly forever,

1128
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,980
after the spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus.

1129
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,020
This is Phineas Narkos' I Have a Dream's Venus.

1130
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,140
Mr. Dyer said,

1131
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:00,500
engineers will try to regain contact with Pioneer 12

1132
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,480
and will not be absolutely certain until it was...

1133
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,580
There it is.

1134
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,200
There it is.

1135
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,400
There it is.

1136
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,960
No, I'm afraid, as we speak,

1137
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,600
the 810-pound spacecraft,

1138
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,620
which was built by the Houston Aircraft Company,

1139
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:13,620
built in Segundo, California,

1140
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,400
was meant to study Venus for 243 days.

1141
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,240
The planet Venus?

1142
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,580
It would only operate for two or three years.

1143
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,980
We never dreamed it would last this long.

1144
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,660
Commander Wellman here has just landed on Venus.

1145
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:24,800
But as we speak,

1146
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:27,600
the friction from the spacecraft's entry into the atmosphere

1147
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,100
had been expected to melt its radio equipment.

1148
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,880
Even if contact is briefly restored,

1149
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,320
much of the spacecraft will burn and vaporize

1150
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,380
as we speak.

1151
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,780
He means that Commander Wellman has been to Venus.

1152
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,800
And now, as we're doing this show,

1153
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,580
no, to Venus, the planet Venus.

1154
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,940
A little tiny space adventure.

1155
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,180
The planet Venus?

1156
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:48,880
Yeah.

1157
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,940
I knew it.

1158
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,340
This operation was connected to something.

1159
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,000
Dang.

1160
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,320
But the planet Venus?

1161
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,040
Come on, Hell, we gotta get out of here.

1162
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,380
See, I mean, I think it's a good thing.

1163
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:06,560
But, really, for now,

1164
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:06,560


1165
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,600
we're gonna have to fucking distribute something to this show.

1166
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:13,800
How odd.

1167
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,760
This is the last time in the past 8.5 hours

1168
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,720
that 8.5 people have told me

1169
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,140
that they had a dream about an 8.5 earthquake.

1170
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:22,740
Huh.

1171
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,180
Well, dog my cats.

1172
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,660
I guess it takes all kinds.

1173
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:28,800
What a world.

1174
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:30,840
Kinda makes you wonder, doesn't it?

1175
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:31,800
Kinda makes you.

1176
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:33,780
No.

1177
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:39,180
In the small isolated community of River Falls after dark, Jack Flynn is trapped in an enormous

1178
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:42,060
spider web stretching across the road.

1179
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:47,420
His teenage daughter, Carol Flynn, sets out with a high school friend, Mike Simpson, to

1180
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,700
find her missing father.

1181
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:55,660
In a series of caves some miles out of town, the two youngsters discover and barely escape

1182
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:58,600
the mandibles of an enormous spider.

1183
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:04,200
That's the one where they bring it back to the high school and put it in the gym or something.

1184
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:08,620
Yes, as a result of their find, the spider is cornered and knocked out with DDT, then

1185
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:14,560
returned to the high school auditorium by science teacher Ed Kemmerer to await a scientific

1186
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,880
inquiry by men from the state university.

1187
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:17,180
It's huge.

1188
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,340
And then they have a brand-new...

1189
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:20,160
Reverend Howe, look at its... its...

1190
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,000
Don't look at that.

1191
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:22,760
That's obscene.

1192
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:28,580
But the monstrous creature revives unexpectedly during the rehearsal of the spider web.

1193
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:28,580


1194
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:28,580


1195
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,640
It's a cool swing band.

1196
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,160
Yeah, it's playing right now.

1197
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:38,140
Revivified by the pulsations of the rock and roll teenagers, the unholy thing goes scrambling

1198
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,620
out, washing...

1199
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,600
Scroogey, scroogey, scroogey, scroogey...

1200
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:46,500
...the janitor, Mr. whatever-his-name-is from, uh, from, uh, Green Acres, you know, that

1201
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:46,720
guy.

1202
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,940
He plays the old janitor and the...

1203
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:54,880
Well, actually, it was Mr. Green Jeans, but in the flash of green was the janitor's

1204
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,200
death.

1205
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,580
That Hal thought it was the guy from the...

1206
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:58,580


1207
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:58,580


1208
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,240
...the Zoller or Zoller or Z...

1209
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:00,780
Yeah, I know.

1210
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:01,840
...Z-Caucus or something.

1211
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,000
Yeah, no, yeah.
