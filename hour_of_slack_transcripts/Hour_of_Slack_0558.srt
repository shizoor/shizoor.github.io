1
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,660
This is Joe Offric of the Order of Dionysus Abasios, and you're listening to the Hour

2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,660
of Slack with Reverend Ivan Stagg.

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,780
I want you to suffer from up-against-the-underwear syndrome.

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,620
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the upper pelvis to the

5
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,040
subgenius hour of slack.

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,400
Don't ever try to have a deep personal relationship with a subgenius.

7
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,560
They can't get it on without a pipe.

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,420
Don't listen to these guys.

9
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,120
They're really silly.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,640
I personally...

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,260
You should always have relationships just with tape recorders.

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,300
Have you been in this elevator long, by the way?

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,560
I've been here about 20 minutes, and I thought I'd be where I wanted to be by now.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,100
Well, Doug, well, I know just how you feel, pal.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:17,760
It reminds me of the time in around 1938 when J.R. Bob Dobbs was despairing in his cups,

16
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,760
drunk as hell, at the Hop Frog Tavern in Wichita, California.

17
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,040
He was drinking a bottle of Cicada, honey.

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,500
He said to Philo, who witnessed this,

19
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,800
You can lead them to the promised land, but don't expect that to mean they're gonna keep

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,260
their promises to you.

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,240
Now, ten minutes later, while heading for the bathrooms to puke, Bob met his future

22
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,760
primary wife, Connie Dobbs, for the first time.

23
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,600
time. But again, the thing he's talking about here is not just society at large, but within the church.

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,840
These are sins within the church. Here in this seaport dive, women can be bought for what you

25
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,180
pay for a highball, but that doesn't stop men from fighting over them.

26
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,620
And this woman believes that seaweed rubbed into her skin will make her irresistible.

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:26,080
Ah yes, beauty. The magnet that draws the attention of the opposite sex. Desired by all people in all parts of the world.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,760
They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And all these women are making themselves more beautiful.

29
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,260
No matter how much it hurts, or how bloody the process. But peculiar ideas are not only women's.

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:46,440
This man is hunting the elixir of youth. Eating freshly killed raw turtle, he believes, is the

31
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:46,600
most important thing in the world. He believes that the most important thing in the world is to be able to live a life of beauty.

32
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:46,600


33
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,960
This man believes that a mouse will cure this poor woman's nervous disorder.

34
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:05,300
I fell into a burning ring of fire. I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.

35
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:16,340
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire, the ring of fire. But eventually you'll melt down. One day

36
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,340
you'll suddenly scream, why the f*** am I killing myself?

37
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:28,060
But enough of that depressing fare. Hello and welcome to Happyland. The people here in Happyland are very calm.

38
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:37,160
And the drugs are very effective. Announcements may be heard over our PA system. And as we walk toward Happyland's gates,

39
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,900
let us remind you, no pushing, no sharp objects, and no writing to your family at home. Thank you.

40
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,360
This is a crook.

41
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,060
And perverse nation, my friend.

42
00:03:48,520 --> 00:04:01,020
The devil is in the supermarket. The devil is in the post office. The devil is in the movies and TV. The devil owns this world. It's his.

43
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:14,300
The world's crawling and the world's crawling. The ones that go in are lean and thin.

44
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:25,660
The ones that come out are bats and stouts. Your eyes fall in and your teeth fall out. Your brains come tumbling down your snout.

45
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,540
Be merry, my friends, be merry.

46
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,800
Merry Christmas to all and a happy, happy new year.

47
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,280
Oh, dear friends, I'll tell you. I think I'd be a serial killer without y'all to help me.

48
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,280


49
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,800
erե�ль

50
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,640
我 several times Homestay

51
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
and a temperamental

52
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,200
I realize some screws are gern

53
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,440
every little

54
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,880
It's three nights

55
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,480
well and a just a lot

56
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:12,160
Oh, dear friends, I think I'd be a serial killer without y'all to help me.

57
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,300
I've heard a lot of trouble

58
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,860
Hello, the destruction near my house

59
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:13,860


60
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,260
It's a very哦

61
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,260


62
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,820
a wonderful year, friends.

63
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,840
The best one since I don't know when.

64
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,680
And life

65
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,840
was great

66
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,440
up until last weekend

67
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,400
when it turned into a living

68
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,520
nightmare.

69
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,000
And to save it, last Saturday

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,160
when I would have otherwise been doing a show,

71
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,820
I had to give up

72
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,860
the thing I loved the most

73
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,180
in all the world.

74
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,240
It's true.

75
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,660
I had to quit thinking about her.

76
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,760
Had to banish her

77
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,040
from my mind.

78
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,040
Had to pretend I didn't care at all

79
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,680
while I watched her let the

80
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,500
other guys use her.

81
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,640
And I needed her so bad.

82
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,320
I needed her so bad

83
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,020
that I had to hate her

84
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,920
in order to free myself

85
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,020
from her.

86
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,560
Because even though

87
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,220
she wasn't even thinking about it,

88
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,220
she was hurting me more and more

89
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,440
and more and I couldn't stop coming

90
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,240
back for more punishment.

91
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,700
It was an addiction.

92
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,100
I guess you could say an addiction.

93
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,560
And Bob Dole might not agree with me.

94
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,620
But I really think that's what it was.

95
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,480
And I ain't over her yet.

96
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,860
No, sir.

97
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,720
Not by a long shot.

98
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,700
Even now, I can see her

99
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,320
as if she were floating

100
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,540
in front of my face, just like smoke.

101
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,680
And I want to inhale her

102
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,380
so, so bad.

103
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,020
But I know I must

104
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,200
just say no.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,300
And there are some things

106
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,140
that I guess that phrase does apply to.

107
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,720
I know it's something I have to do.

108
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,600
I know I'll be healthier for it in the long run

109
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,060
if the effort doesn't kill me.

110
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
But my friends, it just hurts

111
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,040
so bad!

112
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,980
Yes, friends, you guessed it.

113
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,940
Queen Tobacco

114
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,100
broke my heart.

115
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,700
Lady Tobaccy.

116
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,440
Sister Nicotine.

117
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,100
Miss Conspiracy herself.

118
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,040
Tore my poor heart in twain.

119
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,900
Just as she's done to so many

120
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,960
countless millions of other fools

121
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,820
before me.

122
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,980
Now, this ain't no New Year's resolution

123
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,120
I'm talking about, friends.

124
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,800
This was a soul-searing battle.

125
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,180
It has been for 25 years.

126
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,400
But this was D-Day.

127
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,080
I was again

128
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,740
faced with two

129
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,940
divergent paths, my friends.

130
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,140
Life or death.

131
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,520
And life without

132
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,980
her is gonna be hard.

133
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,820
Hard, hard, hard.

134
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,900
But life with her

135
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,260
will be shorter.

136
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,900
She's so sweet.

137
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,060
She is so fine.

138
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,280
She's the finest.

139
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,600
But sooner or later,

140
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,700
she sucks you dry.

141
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,200
The slack is gone

142
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,880
and a bunch of black gunk

143
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,720
and scar tissue has taken its place.

144
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,680
And, friends,

145
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,220
you feel

146
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,780
dumber than human.

147
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,960
But,

148
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,180
but,

149
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,540
last Saturday, my friend,

150
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,840
I decided since everything else in the world

151
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,700
was going totally to hell

152
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,360
and life was an endless struggle

153
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,040
and only the fittest and the meanest

154
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,500
survive,

155
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,620
hell, why not?

156
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,500
There's no time like the present.

157
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,140
Dump her before she finishes

158
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,400
dumping me.

159
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,500
Big time.

160
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,680
And one must

161
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,740
draw on one's own.

162
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,520
There's hidden reserves

163
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,200
of self-respect

164
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,760
and strength of character

165
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,360
and sheer, giant,

166
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,680
ego-driven,

167
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,860
gut-blowout,

168
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,520
subgenius will.

169
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,180
In fact, if I'm, hell,

170
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,660
if I'm gonna break one bad habit,

171
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,940
I might as well break them all.

172
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,060
Bring them on, man.

173
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:00,980
Where's a chair?

174
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,020
I'll smash it.

175
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,700
Sit down as a habit.

176
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,780
Where's a clock?

177
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,600
Oh, I already smashed all those last year

178
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,280
when this happened.

179
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,200
Where's the pathetic, blitherin' little human?

180
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,740
I'll be glad if I get her.

181
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,720
to gut it!

182
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,740
He's suffering a human

183
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,760
to live. Now that's a nasty habit,

184
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,260
ain't it? Where is the

185
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,440
conspiracy? Let me at him!

186
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,720
I mean, I'll tell you what, I'll just

187
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,580
say no! Damn it!

188
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,680
Now how many of you can make that

189
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,880
New Year's resolution and keep it,

190
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,700
huh? Just say no to the conspiracy.

191
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,760
I want to see you do it. Resolve

192
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,380
that you're going to break the conspiracy

193
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,720
habit this year.

194
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,460
Just try it.

195
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,380
And by gobs, friend, if you do try it,

196
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,360
if you do just try it,

197
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,440
well, maybe this time

198
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,900
you'll actually do it!

199
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,800
You've invested in things,

200
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,220
and when that eventual crisis hits,

201
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,760
you'll fold like jello

202
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,960
and won't be able to lead yourself

203
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,220
because you won't have any handle on the deeper meaning

204
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,280
of your life.

205
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,220
And that meaning only comes through

206
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,200
understanding, and unless you learn

207
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,460
to understand and see, you're doomed.

208
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,080
The rest of your life, pure

209
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,160
confusion, never knowing

210
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,880
what lays beyond doubt and fear.

211
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,080
Sure,

212
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,500
look to your friends, but they're no help.

213
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,460
They're as confused and directionless

214
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,420
as you are, and besides,

215
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,940
why should they want to help you?

216
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,660
Unless, of course,

217
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,780
there's something in it for them.

218
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,520
Sure, maybe some friend brings you the latest

219
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:38,880
packet

220
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,520
of self-help seminar

221
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,720
series from the latest...

222
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,700
the latest anointed expert

223
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,980
who knows you and your empty searching friends

224
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,500
will gobble up his 12-step formulas

225
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,860
for getting ripped off

226
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,840
and toss them away when you get tired

227
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,940
or bored.

228
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,940
But you're so filled with doubts

229
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,660
that you dive into the package anyway,

230
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,080
hoping you just might get a kernel or two

231
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,180
of useful information, which will calm

232
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,880
a few fears long enough to forget

233
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,240
what the experts said.

234
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,380
Then, bammo!

235
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,520
You're right back facing your day-to-day reactions

236
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,600
to the day-to-day, since you haven't

237
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,200
got the time, energy, or discipline

238
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,600
to really change your life.

239
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,380
Or do you, dear friends?

240
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,520
Or do you?

241
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,220
Personally, I think that you probably do.

242
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,020
You know, one can follow that line of thought

243
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,720
for a goodly while.

244
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,240
One can, as Mr. Thought Alchemy there

245
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,600
was talking about.

246
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,940
Sure, maybe you failed utterly the last

247
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,140
hundred tries.

248
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,140
Guess what?

249
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,720
I got 150 rejection slips

250
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,620
for the Book of the Subgenius.

251
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,860
Now, can you imagine that?

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,600
But I kept sending them out.

253
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,280
Now, maybe your every previous attempt

254
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,720
to follow your dream climaxed

255
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,640
with you dreaming about the day

256
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,680
that you'd start planning to pursue your dream.

257
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,800
Well, now maybe you ought to try

258
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,620
getting off of your butt

259
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,180
one more time.

260
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,720
Of course, there's something to be said

261
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,300
for just plain giving up,

262
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,240
as that great old subgenius,

263
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,320
uh, wino, said in the temple,

264
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,920
if I can't whoop it, I'll go down.

265
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,900
And that's exactly what I had to do, friends.

266
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,540
I had to quit.

267
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,420
But whatever it is, you have to,

268
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,640
you do have to do it.

269
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,660
Even if not doing something is what you have to do.

270
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,400
Slack is not the same as sloth and indolence.

271
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,260
Not necessarily, anyway.

272
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,580
I, personally, have always found that the most, you know,

273
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:43,580


274
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,020
slack comes from action.

275
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,860
When I am in the zone, the pure act of the action,

276
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,880
the pure do of the doing,

277
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,440
with total concentration,

278
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,840
flying with the equipment and the words effortlessly,

279
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,980
not even thinking, even when the phone is ringing

280
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,820
in the background, but just doing.

281
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,640
Those are my moments of true slack

282
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,840
when one is most alive.

283
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,560
Oh, but friends, you know, I was letting, you know,

284
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,620
That which I thought made me alive.

285
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,300
Kill me!

286
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,920
I was getting too uptight.

287
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,280
I was pushing too hard.

288
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,880
I was working too hard for slack.

289
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,520
Again.

290
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,080
Not gliding, but forcing.

291
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,220
And when you try to force it, slack hardens.

292
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,020
It becomes like a wall.

293
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,580
Like cornstarch in liquid suspension hardens like a rock if you hit it.

294
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,940
But it's like water if you caress it.

295
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:48,560
The most devilish trick, friends, is finding that delicate balance between too much and not enough.

296
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,420
Oh, by the way, did you know that we recently found the bottom half of that old memo from Bob?

297
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,780
You know, the top half said,

298
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,020
Too much is always better than not enough.

299
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,280
The bottom part says,

300
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,780
But it's almost as bad.

301
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,600
And friends, you gotta figure out the balance.

302
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,780
But you can't learn that unless you try and try again.

303
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,620
Screw up and screw up again.

304
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,260
Screw up, but admit that you did, and do it better the next time.

305
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:28,080
Easy for me to say since right now, but personally, I'm in the kind of mood where I'd rather be killing optimists.

306
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,920
In fact, I'm going through a nicotine fit like you wouldn't believe.

307
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:38,220
I haven't had to do an hour of slack without five packs of cigarettes going through my lungs during that hour.

308
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,680
In five or six years, at least.

309
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,520
And in fact, I would very much like to go out and kill, kill, kill.

310
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,060
To crush and destroy all in my path.

311
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,580
Hell, it's better than sitting here just dreaming about it.

312
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,900
I'll break every habit and every law, too.

313
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:08,000
I'll go through a 50th total lifestyle rebuild before I let the forces of entropy devour any more of myself.

314
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,880
I'll go through a 50th total lifestyle rebuild before I let the forces of entropy devour any more of myself.

315
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,800
That is my New Year's resolution, YES!

316
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,520
That is my Christmas present to myself.

317
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,560
I'm good enough.

318
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,080
I'm smart enough.

319
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,720
And gosh darn it, people like me.

320
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,720
I'm good enough.

321
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:35,720


322
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:35,720


323
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,620
Walking through the ghost bar,

324
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,200
Walking through the ghost bar,

325
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,200


326
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,200


327
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,200


328
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,780
Feeling really hopeless.

329
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,220
And wondering how I ever will see through this darkness.

330
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,980
And that drop of blood can be so beautiful.

331
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,640
And I sure was bleeding the drops by the bucket full.

332
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,680
I have a strength to endure.

333
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,800
And all the love that's pure.

334
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,860
I have a strength to endure.

335
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,180
I have a strength to endure.

336
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,620
Because, because, because,

337
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,580
I'm not afraid to tell her,

338
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,680
I'm not afraid to tell her,

339
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,400
Just how things work.

340
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,140
Just how things work.

341
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,020
I ride a hurricane through the fast lane,

342
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,880
I ride a hurricane through the fast lane,

343
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,140
Always looking over my shoulder.

344
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,420
She said there's something about you and,

345
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:27,800


346
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,860
Neonites always go hot.

347
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,860
Baby we can see this through,

348
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,320


349
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,960
Just give me all the strength you got.

350
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,580
I have the strength to endure.

351
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,840
I have the strength to endure.

352
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,040
And all the love that's so pure.

353
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,080
I have the strength to endure.

354
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,480
Because, because, because,

355
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,600
Be cool, be cool.

356
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,440
Because.

357
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:53,600
Because.

358
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:53,860
Because.

359
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,600
I have the strength to endure.

360
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,760
And all the love that's so pure.

361
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,800
I have this terrain to endure

362
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,560
Because, because

363
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,440
I'm not afraid to tell her

364
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,240
Just how things work

365
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,780
Ride a hurricane through the past day

366
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,120
Always looking over my shoulder

367
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,740
She said there's something about you

368
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,720
And neon lights always glow hot

369
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,540
Baby, we can see this through

370
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,760
Just give me all the strength you've got

371
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,640
I have this terrain to endure

372
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,760
And all of us are so pure

373
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,820
I have this terrain to endure

374
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,600
Because, because

375
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,980
I have this terrain to endure

376
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,120
And all of us are so pure

377
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,060
I have this terrain to endure

378
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,880
Because, because

379
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,300
Yeah

380
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,100
Oh, I don't know what I'd do

381
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,680
Without the Ramones, too, sometimes

382
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,140
Friends

383
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,000
Or Zook's Rift, for that matter

384
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,520
Who's instrumentalist

385
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,980
Playing in the background here

386
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,580
Is one of the most beautiful pieces of music

387
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,360
In my collection

388
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,620
Let's listen to it for a minute

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,680

409
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,320
Yes, friends, that's Zug's riff from his CD Villagers.

410
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,160
I believe that Joe Newman may also be one of the musicians on that.

411
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:55,780
But so, so, dear friends, I have resolved to turn from the quick-fix comforts of my old mistress,

412
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,180
the demon weed from hell, cigarettes,

413
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:05,800
and devote myself solely to that true and faithful wife,

414
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,120
Frop.

415
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,940
Have a Frop Zippy Lops, friends.

416
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,600
No more.

417
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,140
Will the soul.

418
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,640
Eaters get my 20% interest?

419
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,380
No, sir.

420
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:28,300
And despite the sheer mind-obliterating, total relentless agony of giving up her,

421
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,520
I shall deal with it.

422
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,600
Because that's the only thing you can do, friends.

423
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,160
I'm no Superman.

424
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:43,060
In fact, I'll admit that I must sate my physical desires

425
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,140
with...

426
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,600
with a plastic lover.

427
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,080
My little fantastic...

428
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,900
plastic fantastic lover, I call it.

429
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,980
A little square patch slapped upon a hairless part of my skin daily.

430
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,980
21 milligrams of the master molecule.

431
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,400
Next month, 14 milligrams.

432
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,200
Then six.

433
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,900
And by then, you forget.

434
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,380
And no longer must you obey.

435
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,220
The master molecule.

436
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:13,860
Ha!

437
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,820
Until...

438
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,300
You're sure you got it licked.

439
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,160
Just when you know you got it licked and you quit worrying about it,

440
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,120
that's when the demons leap out of hiding and hit you with their big guns.

441
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,020
But this time, my friends, I know.

442
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,720
I know.

443
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,960
I actually know that I shall defeat them.

444
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,060
But I...

445
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,740
For anybody who thinks about doing this,

446
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,060
the patches are a big help.

447
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,660
They make a heck of a lot of difference.

448
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,180
Five bucks a patch.

449
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,740
Cheaper than what I was spending on merits, actually.

450
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,660
And funny how the insurance companies won't pay for them.

451
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,340
No, they won't pay for cancer prevention.

452
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,560
I just...

453
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
I just...

454
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,780
Makes you wonder who's really running things, you know?

455
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,560
Makes you wonder where...

456
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,520
The war on what?

457
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,800
We're having a war on what?

458
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,580
But I tell you, if they made a frot patch,

459
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,060
I'd replace my clothing with those.

460
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,180
I'd make a wet suit out of frot patches.

461
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,580
But seriously, folks, I had a mean, I mean a vicious cigarette habit.

462
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,840
Just like every teenager nowadays.

463
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,920
And just like every teenager, I started out thinking I'd...

464
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,020
I'd just smoke one now and then for the buzz.

465
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,800
Thought I was too smart to get hooked.

466
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,480
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

467
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,700
Friends, I'm sorry. What am I doing?

468
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,640
What am I doing?

469
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,560
I'm not that kind of a pretty person.

470
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:41,780
I'm not that kind of a preacher.

471
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,140
I ain't that kind of a preacher.

472
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,160
Um...

473
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,720
Yeah!

474
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,040
Huh!

475
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,600
I don't mean to preach at you, friends.

476
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,180
I'll tell you what I'd much rather do.

477
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,540
I'd much rather hit you upside the head with a stick.

478
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,900
That's what I'd like to be doing right now,

479
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,040
is hitting every one of you right across the face

480
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,680
with a great big stick with big red straps.

481
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,240
Oh, and speaking of sticks with dead guys nailed to them,

482
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,200
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, Happy Hanukkah,

483
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,100
Hail Satan, Praise Bob, Nam-Yo-Ho, Ren-Gek-Yo,

484
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,560
Moe, Larry Curly, and Him-sa!

485
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,120
Ah...

486
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,180
Ah, it feels a lot better.

487
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,080
It feels so much better to hate.

488
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,940
How can they deny us our hate, friends?

489
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,860
I just don't get it.

490
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,240
And you know, Christmas is...

491
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,040
Needless to say, as everybody points out,

492
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,560
the most depressing of holidays.

493
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,540
That special time when so many take time out

494
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,820
to find suicide in their hearts.

495
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,460
When the subgenius skulks through the malls,

496
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,740
hating and hating all the happy, chappy faces

497
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,180
and well-dressed people and piped-in,

498
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,140
ever-present Christmas carols

499
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,880
and the forced dinners with the family

500
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,840
who are mostly pinks or else crazy.

501
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,880
And...

502
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:08,940
And...

503
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,060
Well, the presents are cool.

504
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,440
And...

505
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,540
And then...

506
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:20,060
Everybody gets all drunk and weepy on New Year's and...

507
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,400
I know I'll be the weepiest bastard of them all this time, too.

508
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,640
I can already see it coming.

509
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,260
But let me tell you one thing, boys and girls.

510
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,580
Nobody hates Christmas as much as Jesus.

511
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,660
And, you know, I wanted to let Jesus speak for himself

512
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,640
on this show, this...

513
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,860
special New Year's Christmas hate-smoking show.

514
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,300
Um...

515
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,560
Because he had a lot to say, but...

516
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,320
But you know what?

517
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,740
He had to work.

518
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,760
He had to work for the conspiracy

519
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,560
because they don't pay Jesus enough

520
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,600
at the Subgenius Foundation.

521
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,500
He has to do these temp jobs

522
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,560
displaying Web TV

523
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,540
and the Subgenius website, actually,

524
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,520
in shopping malls.

525
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,320
Jesus!

526
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,540
And that was one thing that ticked him off.

527
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,720
He said, how come there's a million Santa Clauses

528
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,840
and there's only one of me?

529
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,360
Who's the important guy here?

530
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,540
And why...

531
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,560
And, you know, he has to...

532
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,600
Of course, Easter is a lot harder on him.

533
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,740
He really hates Easter.

534
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,120
But he was, uh...

535
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,880
He was saying, man, I've got to drive by these manger scenes

536
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,900
in these rich people's front yards

537
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,900
and in front of schools and stuff.

538
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,240
And it's so humiliating for my dad, you know,

539
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,160
to think about my dad.

540
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,400
Everybody thinks he never even made it with my mom or something,

541
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,360
which is ridiculous.

542
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,500
And, uh...

543
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,700
You know, it's like, oh, my God.

544
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,500
They never put the little brown piles all around the manger, you know.

545
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,140
And on top of that, I didn't get any presents.

546
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,000
There weren't any wise men.

547
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,700
There were some grays, apparently,

548
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,280
but that was later on.

549
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,760
Friends, like I say, unfortunately,

550
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,840
Jesus couldn't make it to talk to you about Christmas

551
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,420
because he, um, had to work.

552
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,240
Ain't it ironic, though,

553
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,680
that the only stations that would even play tapes

554
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,060
of the real Jesus Christ live nowadays talking

555
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,680
are subgenius stations that carry the hour of slack?

556
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,320
You have to wonder, what...

557
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,220
What is this world coming to?

558
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,860
I mean, poor Lord, you know.

559
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,220
I can see how he'd feel.

560
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,520
You know, there's all these guys dressed as Santa Claus

561
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,340
with little kids sitting on their laps.

562
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,020
Where's the guys dressed as Jesus with little kids?

563
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,660
Whatever, you know, sitting on his lap or praying.

564
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,920
Of course, that's the problem.

565
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,600
God, the newspapers around here.

566
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,240
We've got some ill-behaved preachers in Dallas

567
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,160
of non-subgenius denominations.

568
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,540
Every week, one of them molests a kid

569
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,760
or beats his wife or, um...

570
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,740
Oh, God, just sexual harassment cases.

571
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,500
Not to mention Robert Tilton.

572
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,120
All of them here in Dallas.

573
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,000
It's just one after another.

574
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,600
It makes...

575
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,040
It makes me ashamed of myself

576
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,800
because my behavior pales in comparison.

577
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,840
Sometimes I feel like I let y'all down, you know,

578
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
that I haven't been...

579
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,040
keeping up with the Swaggerts.

580
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,000
Haven't been keeping up with the Barry Baileys,

581
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,780
the Bob Tiltons.

582
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,180
But we'll make up for it, friends.

583
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,140
I guarantee you.

584
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,140
We're gonna make up for it.

585
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,180
We got plenty of time left.

586
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,980
I bought myself a few extra tickets.

587
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,760
I'm gonna make up for years by...

588
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,500
by breaking this evil habit.

589
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,260
I know I have.

590
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,780
I haven't done a damn lick of work all week.

591
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,500
But, man, I've got some stuff.

592
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,300
Wait until you see.

593
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,640
Anyway, let's prepare to go to side two of show.

594
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,440
This seems like an awfully long show

595
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,500
for one side.

596
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:54,880
I...

597
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,780
Like it's...

598
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,280
Anyway.

599
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,080
Time stretches out, you see,

600
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,680
when you're waiting.

601
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,900
For something you know must never come.

602
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,280
The end.

603
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,600
Wow, isn't it amazing

604
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,980
how the music will help you out like that?

605
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,740
That's Nina Rota music

606
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,180
from Federico Fellini's great film,

607
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,000
Eight and a Half,

608
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,080
my favorite movie of all time, I think.

609
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,560
And, uh...

610
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,020
You don't know what the heck I'm talking about.

611
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,680
And frankly, I just don't care.

612
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,140
I don't care, I don't care.

613
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,160
Because I'm a crazy man.

614
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:40,900
I'm crazy.

615
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,660
I can't...

616
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,640
I've got a Nick Derm patch on.

617
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,660
And I can't even drink coffee

618
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,200
because it makes me want to smoke too much.

619
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,220
But I'll tell you what it...

620
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,660
All of this makes me want to do.

621
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,360
It makes me want to rat my fool head off

622
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,600
so loud that it destroys everything within sight.

623
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,340
Just...

624
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,240
I'll rat this microphone if that's what it takes.

625
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,080
I'll take my cue from the great church of new faith.

626
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,900
Please, Bob!

627
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,080
Please, Bob!

628
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,740
Kill Bob!

629
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,240
Maybe we should go to...

630
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,200
Back to tapes.

631
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,120
Christmas tapes.

632
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,340
Happy Christmas tapes for side two.

633
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,200
I don't know.

634
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,140
Maybe we should look at Book of the Subgenius

635
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,360
and see what's predicted for 1999.

636
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,820
Maybe we should do both.

637
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,300
Maybe I'll just go on and on and on like this

638
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,620
in this strange limbo.

639
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,880
This purgatory

640
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,620
where Joe Camel

641
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,520
humpeth not

642
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,040
and nay,

643
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,540
not even the Marlboro Man

644
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,560
hacks and coughs his

645
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,620
hour upon the stage.

646
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,020
It is a fropped stick

647
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,800
smoked by an idiot

648
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,040
full of...

649
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,200
bugs and resin

650
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,100
signifying...

651
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,060
MONKEY!

652
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,620
Tree walking brain socket.

653
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,800
Doctors.

654
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,160
Huff.

655
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:08,960
Huff.

656
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:09,380
Huff.

657
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,020
Uh-huh.

658
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,180
Uh-huh.

659
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,880
No, it won't be Christmas tapes

660
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,360
because I pulled out my old faithful copy

661
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,680
of Book of the Subgenius,

662
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,300
my old tattered, leather-covered,

663
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:28,500
blood-smeared, semen-encrusted preacher's copy here.

664
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,580
And, uh, and I looked at the...

665
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,820
predictions in this holy book.

666
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,580
I looked at Dateline for Dominance.

667
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,600
I looked at 1996.

668
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,680
And I looked at what's coming up for 1997.

669
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,760
And I thought,

670
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,360
my God, you know,

671
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,160
it's been a long time since I looked at these.

672
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,740
I thought I'd memorized it all.

673
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,120
But I'd forgotten and all of this stuff happened.

674
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,300
1996.

675
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,260
Now, remember,

676
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,160
this book was published in 1983.

677
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,240
Bob spoke of things that would come.

678
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,980
And they did.

679
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,600
1996.

680
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,820
Greenhouse effect reversed by Bob Science.

681
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,660
You notice any greenhouse effect going on?

682
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,460
There is some greenhouse effect.

683
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,320
But believe me,

684
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,420
this would be Waterworld

685
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,960
if Bob Science had not intervened.

686
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,920
And did we even ask for credit?

687
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,500
Nuff said.

688
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,540
By the way,

689
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,200
it...

690
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,820
Hey, what happened to my messengers of deception?

691
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,420
Anyway, friends,

692
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,560
you...

693
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,920
Anybody who can disprove anything that I'm about to say,

694
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,680
have at it.

695
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,820
Also in 1996,

696
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,960
this was predicted.

697
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,240
Bob unmasks anti-Bob

698
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,140
as perpetrator of the Ice Age

699
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,880
and exposes the bowels of the conspiracy.

700
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,440
Whoa.

701
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,440
I'd say the conspiracy...

702
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,740
We're swimming in the conspiracy's bowels, friends.

703
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,460
I guess in a way that was already exposed.

704
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,860
But look what happened in the presidential election.

705
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,740
A perfectly good crippled war hero

706
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,540
couldn't even get elected by our people in this country.

707
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,620
She couldn't even think about ethics.

708
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,580
All they could think about was the economy.

709
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,080
World War V.

710
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,500
Between Bob Crusaders and minions of the anti-Bob.

711
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,620
Okay.

712
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,040
It happened.

713
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,860
Hey, I was there.

714
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,760
I don't know about you.

715
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,720
It was a hell of a bomb.

716
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:29,720


717
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:29,980
It was a battle.

718
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
The newspapers didn't write about it

719
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,840
because it was between the Bob Crusaders

720
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,540
and the minions of the anti-Bob.

721
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,940
The other anti-Bob.

722
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,360
They ain't gonna talk.

723
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,340
See, it's a controlled media.

724
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,360
Bob wins this war,

725
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,540
and he did, obviously,

726
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,740
or we wouldn't be here,

727
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,340
but only after traces of the elixir trademark

728
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,180
is released into the atmosphere,

729
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,860
causing the dream plagues.

730
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,880
And I think you all can agree with me

731
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,380
on the point that the dream plagues

732
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,940
have indeed shown themselves.

733
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,440
All of this, it says,

734
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,560
takes place in the first three months of the year.

735
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,440
Rest of the year finds world at peace

736
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,720
for the first time,

737
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,080
and that's certainly been true.

738
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,080
There have been a few commercial wars,

739
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,440
but Bob wasn't talking about it.

740
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,500
Commercial wars hadn't even been invented in 1983.

741
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,780
Well, they'd been invented.

742
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,560
They were being planned,

743
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,300
but they hadn't really been sponsored.

744
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,360
Longevity drugs and drugs.

745
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,780
Gravity drugs released,

746
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,680
but in short supply.

747
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,540
Well, obviously, it was in short supply.

748
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,820
Another prediction came true.

749
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,200
Couldn't even buy them.

750
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,060
Didn't hear about them.

751
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,600
Considerable rioting,

752
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,400
especially by elderly persons.

753
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,480
Well, they're the easiest ones to shut up quick now,

754
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:43,880
aren't they?

755
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,840
1996.

756
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,300
Church reveals secrets of fornicationalism.

757
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,760
Trademark.

758
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,520
Code retrieval from cosmic archives.

759
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,260
Other excess derived theories.

760
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,120
Now, hey,

761
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,660
if you don't have a computer

762
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,160
and can't check out the website,

763
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,640
don't complain to me,

764
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,220
but it's all there in black and gray.

765
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,360
Printed on hand-picked electrons

766
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,020
and little special mutated pixels,

767
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,720
gene-spliced pixels that we create ourselves.

768
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,340
Bob now trying to prepare world for visit from Planet X.

769
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,280
Well, we certainly did that all 1996.

770
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,100
Now completely subdued,

771
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,260
sub...

772
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,380
No, actually, hmm.

773
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,260
Now completely subgenioid

774
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,180
are more than half of the world's nations.

775
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,200
Populations are still primarily pink or normal,

776
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,260
but almost all leaders take orders from the church.

777
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,060
Well, now...

778
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,580
We might have been wrong on that one,

779
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,480
but we don't know.

780
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,800
We don't know who the leaders are really taking orders from.

781
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,560
It may be Bob.

782
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,240
Things are senseless enough that that could easily be.

783
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,100
The chaos in the world,

784
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,920
the chaos in today's newspapers,

785
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,780
could easily be the very spore of Bob Dobbs,

786
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,240
the footprints,

787
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,100
the so-called cotter pins, so to speak.

788
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,320
1996, immortality drugs developed,

789
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,760
bootlegged, yet more rioting.

790
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,620
Okay, that'll happen.

791
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,820
Average lifespan now considered to be 150

792
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,700
if death by cataclysm is not counted.

793
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,620
Well, two moot points.

794
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,980
Of course, those didn't make the news.

795
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,380
Ghosts are recognized as citizens and given voting rights.

796
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,020
That did happen in Burma.

797
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,220
Overpopulation becomes so bad

798
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,040
that most people give up fighting it.

799
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,520
Score another one for Bob.

800
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,620
There is another baby boom,

801
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,980
partly inspired by subgenius fertility rights.

802
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,320
Bob continues assuring world, quote,

803
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,900
not to worry.

804
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,980
And seventh...

805
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,300
Hey.

806
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:52,960
Hey.

807
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,060
Like I say,

808
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,980
I don't know what radio stations you've been listening to,

809
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,880
and 7,000 Americans in 1996

810
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,460
will defect to Malaysia,

811
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,000
the new church headquarters,

812
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,460
and that is indeed what happened,

813
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,500
although the church headquarters does remain in Dallas.

814
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,500
We have a new building there.

815
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,280
Bob perhaps may have been seeing the Temple of...

816
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:18,740
And what do we have coming up for 1997, dear friends?

817
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,520
Now, this is from the word of Bob.

818
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,980
This is from page 121

819
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,960
of Book of the Subgenius.

820
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,080
Simon & Schuster edition.

821
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,720
1997.

822
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,160
Nuclear chain reaction across the face of Europe.

823
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,920
Oh, that ought to be fun.

824
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,180
Ghosts identified as the culprits,

825
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,540
then revealed by Dobbs to be Nazi hell creatures

826
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,460
masquerading as dead people

827
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,400
in order to subvert subgenius

828
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,880
and speed up arrival of the New Age world order,

829
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,320
which is, of course, enslavement of the humans

830
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,920
by the demon.

831
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,240
The heroes, the supersonic Nazi hell creatures

832
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,940
from beneath the hollow Earth.

833
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,480
Oh, go ahead and laugh.

834
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Funny, funny.

835
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,500
Wait until March 30th,

836
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,880
morning edition of the paper shows up,

837
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,840
and suddenly that movie Mars Attacks

838
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,340
won't be so funny either.

839
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,880
World, space, hollow Earth, war one.

840
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,320
That's like World War I,

841
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,220
but it also involves space and the hollow Earth

842
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:17,880
for the first time.

843
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,400
New York City nuked.

844
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,900
Sorry, you WFMU.

845
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,280
New listeners, you'll have to tune in somewhere else.

846
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,420
Sea monster Leviathan attacks coastal cities.

847
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,300
The Elder Gods are summoned.

848
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,620
I'm surprised it hadn't been done yet.

849
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,060
Scouring of planet.

850
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,660
Humanity brought together by common foes, so to speak,

851
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,560
defeats invaders using newly released secrets

852
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,500
of time control, time addiction.

853
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,440
Living clones of Elvis, Hitler, Jimi Hendrix,

854
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,500
and John Fitzgerald Kennedy,

855
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,580
lead mankind to finally,

856
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,300
and Martin Luther King Jr.,

857
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,840
finally lead mankind to crush forever

858
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,480
the threat from the hollow Earth.

859
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,460
Unfortunately, details were unclear to Bob on this one.

860
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,160
Humans worldwide will be inoculated

861
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,240
against future accidents with the elixir.

862
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,980
Of course, man, you're gonna love those inoculations.

863
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,000
They never wear off.

864
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,980
Bob will go in, next year, friends,

865
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,460
Bob will go on television for the first time in 40 years

866
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,700
and make a speech,

867
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,660
which will move billions to tears.

868
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,360
Bob and the Church of the Subgenius Hierarchy

869
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,120
will be installed as lords

870
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,940
over the entire governmentless Earth.

871
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,680
You know, maybe y'all better be nice to me for a change.

872
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,440
And, uh, oh, and the last thing,

873
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,340
late in 1997,

874
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,680
cheap, brittle fiber-cutting,

875
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,540
composition broomsticks will be introduced.

876
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,300
Friends, you can invest in those broomsticks now.

877
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,680
We're going to manufacture those broomsticks,

878
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,280
because we know, because of the word of Bob,

879
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,640
what the next fad's gonna be.

880
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,080
How long can they shock their parents

881
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,400
by cutting slits down their privates

882
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,980
and hanging padlocks from them?

883
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:11,760
Uh-uh.

884
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,940
The broomstick up the...

885
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,600
the end...

886
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,020
shall be the new coolness.

887
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,140
Anyway, friends, we here at the Church of the Subgenius,

888
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,100
you know, having gone over that...

889
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,720
that prediction,

890
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,440
that true prediction of the way things will be,

891
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,760
we here at the Church Headquarters in Dallas

892
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,340
wish you, sincerely,

893
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,860
a very happy new year,

894
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,440
because it's the last one you're gonna have.

895
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,920
1998 won't last a whole year.

896
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,060
When you get that 1998 calendar,

897
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,180
you might as well do just what Dr. Legume did,

898
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,420
just tear it in half,

899
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,140
tear the whole back end off,

900
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,900
starting at July 6th, 1998,

901
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,280
because my friend, my sister,

902
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:04,120
there ain't gonna be a July 6th, 1998.

903
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:07,880
Ahimsa.

904
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,560
No, that ain't what I mean.

905
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,580
What I mean to say is,

906
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:13,940
AHIMSA!

907
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,440
You are fans,

908
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,480
far and near.

909
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,860
We're so glad you can all be here.

910
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,940
And when life gets oh, oh so hard,

911
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,840
you make it all worthwhile.

912
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,500
Screaming, shouting, whims, ranting,

913
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,400
and a wild hit, bang, and smile.

914
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,120
This is dedicated to

915
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,200
our fans across the world.

916
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,200
You're the best, most loyalists,

917
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,740
and that's for sure.

918
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,000
When life gets oh, so frustrating,

919
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,380
you make it all worthwhile.

920
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,040
Gonna have some fun tonight,

921
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,860
ain't it great to be alive?

922
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,300
It's gonna be okay.

923
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,480
It's gonna be all right.

924
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,740
It's gonna be, and you're the only ones who understand.

925
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,620
It's gonna be okay.

926
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,980
It's gonna be all right.

927
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:25,140
It's gonna be, and you're the only ones who understand.

928
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,020
You've got the feelings about this year.

929
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,680
All is very well, CJ is here.

930
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,600
Magic cheer spells for hope.

931
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,700
Let's get into gear.

932
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,600
It's the year that most are gonna be here.

933
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,180
Real funky, by yourself, the feeling.

934
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,540
It's gonna be okay.

935
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,520
It's gonna be all right.

936
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,100
It's gonna be, and you're the only ones who understand.

937
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,860
It's gonna be okay.

938
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,840
It's gonna be all right.

939
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,240
It's gonna be, and you're the only ones who understand.

940
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,840
It's gonna be, and you're the only ones who understand.

941
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,120
It's gonna be all right.

942
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,540
It's gonna be okay.

943
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:43,640
It's gonna be, and you're the only ones who understand.

944
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,600
It's gonna be, and you're the only ones who understand.

945
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,740
It's gonna be alright

946
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,340
It's gonna be alright

947
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,460
You're the only ones who understand

948
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,180
Who understand

949
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,700
It's gonna be alright

950
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,600
It's gonna be okay

951
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,340
It's gonna be alright

952
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,220
It's gonna be alright

953
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:46,580
It's gonna be alright

954
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,200
It's gonna be alright

955
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:33,980
It's gonna be alright

956
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,980
And so with great joy in my heart

957
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,000
I press the button that will light up

958
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,500
this beautiful symbol of brotherhood and love

959
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,520
And just as his finger touches the button

960
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:19,560
Bob?

961
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,260
With Astroscope

962
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,940
Here's something my wife could use in the house

963
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,940
An interocitor incorporating an electron sorter

964
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,800
Hey, I need one of those

965
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,940
Since we got all the hot, hot, hot mixing equipment

966
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,540
We've been having a lot of fun

967
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,620
Haven't we, Dr. Dogs and Maddox?

968
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,080
Haven't we?

969
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,640
Like a little kid at Christmas

970
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,720
And finally November

971
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,580
And the glow of the sun

972
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,220
Just don't go away

973
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,440
As sure as there's an X in Christmas

974
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,280
It's already almost Christmas

975
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,400
If you look around today's stores

976
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:54,940
Bye, bye, bye

977
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,000
Let's just call off

978
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,480
And rename the whole season

979
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,080
Advert

980
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,060
Advert

981
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,740
Advert

982
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,020
Advert

983
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,260
Advert

984
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:02,780
Advert

985
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:02,780


986
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:03,140
Advert, of course

987
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:03,780
Advertize

988
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,120
It's an advertising mechanism

989
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,420
As sure as there's an X in Christmas, folks

990
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,020
Welcome to Consumer Society

991
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,600
Chipmunks roasting

992
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,340
Personally, myself, I'm hoping it's gonna be a big disco kind of Christmas this year

993
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,500
I want it to be a Kung Fu Christmas

994
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,520
Could either of you describe a disco Christmas?

995
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,140
Well, that's when they play lots of music like this in the background

996
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:22,840
Wow

997
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,000
And everybody dances to Jesus

998
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,060
Wow

999
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,640
You know, the Church of the Subgenius

1000
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,060
In cooperation with the papacy

1001
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,960
Is actually going to be releasing a chocolate Jesus confection

1002
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,660
That's right

1003
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,380
For Easter

1004
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,760
So you heard it here first

1005
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,320
Silver wrapped for your protection

1006
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,560
I mean, none of this pagan fertility rabbits and eggs thing

1007
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,140
You know, none of that

1008
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,040
We're gonna get back to basics

1009
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,580
Chocolate Jesus is one of the ways we're gonna get back to basics

1010
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:46,580


1011
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:46,580


1012
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,740
And ways to get back to children

1013
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,420
Chocolate Jesus on cross by yours and the hell

1014
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:50,760
Yeah

1015
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,300
Marshmallow and peanut

1016
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,040
Yeah, don't eat the head

1017
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,800
The bleeding head

1018
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,240
Extensively promoted by J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Pope

1019
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,840
Both friends of KHSU and Arcata

1020
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,760
There's a spot for you in the sofa room

1021
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,220
Do you think we could lobby for a papal visit?

1022
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,240
Papal? Like Papal Magdalene?

1023
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,580
No, like do you think we could have the Pope come to Arcata?

1024
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,220
And bless the Church of the Subgenius?

1025
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,160
No, he might come to Arcata and we could bless him

1026
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,000
Well, we have the Church of the Subgenius

1027
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,600
Shroud of San Francisco?

1028
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,560
We subsist entirely on faith

1029
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,600
We don't need proof

1030
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,080
Proof is

1031
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,340
Faith is our proof

1032
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,780
Absolutely, absolutely

1033
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:31,600
Just like any

1034
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,520
If I'm this faithful

1035
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,080
Respecting modern religion

1036
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,720
Yeah, if I'm this faithful

1037
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,340
You better look damn well, believe it

1038
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:38,300
Absolutely

1039
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,640
The James Bond of world religions

1040
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,820
We and other non-pinks like us

1041
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,580
Will be saved by salvation alone

1042
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,560
By pure faith in J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Pope

1043
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,800
When that day comes

1044
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,780
And that day

1045
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,020
Yes, and the only religion that lets you talk over any radio for Bob

1046
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,820
That's right, you can talk over any radio for Bob

1047
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,440
Do it now

1048
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,920
And we also allow you to see another dimension on your television

1049
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,300
Which some religions will not allow you to do

1050
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,660
This is true, we will also advocate free sexuality, free speech

1051
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,860
Um, do you think J.R. Bob Dobbs would advocate pro-choice?

1052
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,620
Pro-choice? Um

1053
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,440
Continuously pro-choice

1054
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,600
I mean, perhaps he'd choose

1055
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,780
There's no doubt about pro-choice

1056
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,480
Oh, to whom are we speaking?

1057
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,480
I think he'd choose Vanilla Springer

1058
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:16,960
I think he'd choose

1059
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,840
Remy Lack

1060
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,500
Remy Lack

1061
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,040
Grendel?

1062
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:19,680
Good stuff

1063
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,300
Grendel, put your hand on the show

1064
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,920
Touch the show

1065
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,860
I'm touching it

1066
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,800
Touch yourself

1067
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,860
Ooh, I feel it, it's sacrament

1068
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,380
And so the law was passed making every day of the year Christmas

1069
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:35,060
And there were great changes throughout the land

1070
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,020
But did it make boys and girls happy?

1071
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,460
One year later, and the children have had Christmas every day for a year

1072
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,620
Once again, it's December 24th

1073
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,540
And the same two little boys are trying to make Christmas a reality

1074
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,320
And they've got a diploma

1075
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:47,320


1076
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,320
Hello, Norman

1077
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,780
Hello, Joey

1078
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,620
What've ya got there?

1079
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,700
A sled

1080
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,840
How many sleds you got?

1081
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,060
364

1082
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:00,020
Me, too

1083
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,760
How many footballs you got?

1084
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:04,780
364

1085
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,660
How many roller skates you got?

1086
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,980
Seven hundred twenty-eight

1087
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,960
Hey, here comes Santa Claus again

1088
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,540
Merry Christmas

1089
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,820
Well, hello, children.

1090
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,780
Merry Christmas.

1091
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,460
What's so funny?

1092
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,360
Watch the skies everywhere.

1093
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:31,940
Keep looking.

1094
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,120
Calling Santa Claus.

1095
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:34,720
Come in, please.

1096
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,660
Calling Santa Claus.

1097
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,220
Come in, please.

1098
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,180
Oh, Santa Claus.

1099
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,380
Come in, wherever you are.

1100
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:39,980
Funny, huh?

1101
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,600
Well, you're all scurrying around finding the ornaments and the lights.

1102
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,200
I'm going to make some popcorn.

1103
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,640
Then I take out our special extra-long Yule log.

1104
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,900
That's the biggest log we've ever had, Dad.

1105
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:01,760
Yeah.

1106
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,300
I want it by the window.

1107
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,200
We had it there last year.

1108
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,760
I want it in the middle of the room.

1109
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,260
Mm, it surely smells good.

1110
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,720
I think we should put it by the window again so the people outside can see it.

1111
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,460
Mom always settles all of the arguments.

1112
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,780
Christmas means many things to many people.

1113
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,560
To some, Christmas means glittering lights, gaily-wrapped gifts.

1114
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,520
That's right, sounds of laughter and good cheer.

1115
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,080
To the folks at Preparation H.

1116
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:36,320
And to the Roto-Rooter Man, it means Bob at Post Office Box.

1117
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,500
Hey, I'm going to give that Post Office Box again.

1118
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,860
You might as well get the pencil and write it down this time,

1119
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,620
and then I won't have to do this next time.

1120
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:49,340
We really want to force-feed the free information down your face, dear friends.

1121
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:56,440
And after that, you will take that whole log happily.

1122
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:09,960
Just write for free information from Bob at P.O. Box 140306.

1123
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,680
That's Box 140306.

1124
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:23,000
In Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1125
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,540
And now, this.
