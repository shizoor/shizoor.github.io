1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
At the moment, I'm thinking about my reputation.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,620
You're going to marry me, Bob.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,020
Listen, I've told you how it's going to be, and you might as well get used to the idea.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,340
Because if I have to, I'll smear you, Bob.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,360
I'll ruin you for the hour of swag.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,740
From PR News in Washington, I'm the deadly white supremacist on Thursday lying about reporting.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,300
On Sunday, the Dow was 3921 to 59.

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,460
Brian Wheeler says the non-name is a bad word.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,540
Activists say the death toll from Sunday's PR News has risen to at least 2.7 in Washington.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,820
Are we controlled by secret forces?

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,140
Are alien space monsters bringing a startling new world?

12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,860
Do people think you're strange?

13
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:00,960
Do you?

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,240
Then you may be on the right track.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,180
Unpredictables are not alone and possess amazing hidden powers of their own.

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,060
Are you abnormal?

17
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,500
Then you are probably better than most people.

18
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,580
Yes, your kind shall triumph.

19
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,280
Praise Bob.

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,060
Praise Bob.

21
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,800
Praise Bob.

22
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,960
Praise Bob.

23
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,500
The Church of the Subgenius is the pan-religion of the future

24
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:59,620
and rebels against the namby-pamby, goody-two-shoes, new age, and Aquarian ideals of most.

25
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,040
And most occult weirdos.

26
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,820
P-p-p-p-p-praise Bob!

27
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,360
P-p-p-p-p-praise Bob!

28
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,960
Such people are fools.

29
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,200
They do not curse.

30
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:18,040
They have no understanding of the need for spiritual violence in this modern space age-a-go-go society.

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,280
The Subgenius wants no part of the new age.

32
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,260
It is already here and it obviously sucks.

33
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,600
The Subgenius wants to be a part of the new age.

34
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:29,600


35
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:29,600


36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,000
The Subgenius would rather retrieve the manly past before 1971 or even 1953.

37
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,480
Or else dwell in the naughty, fun-loving, remote future.

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,820
That was an excerpt from Reverend Richard Negative's album,

39
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:58,660
Welcome to Dobstown, a song called Drip, Slowly, and Repeat featuring Dr. Onan Kanabite,

40
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,580
reading from Subgenius.

41
00:02:59,580 --> 00:02:59,580


42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:09,520
The Subgenius pamphlet number one, which I wrote with Dr. Philo Drummond from Bob's memos jotted on bar napkins.

43
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:17,100
We're still in Cleveland in my current time zone, but by the time you hear this, we'll be in Texas, I hope.

44
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:26,680
This episode is another of those legendary lost radio hours from the 2017 20X Day drill

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,580
that neither I nor the RoboStang had heard until this morning.

46
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,660
You can't foretell how well wonderful this show will be

47
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:32,660


48
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:37,900
We'll be starting next week with miles of рубric,

49
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,160
Everything Finds Its Way on Channel 4

50
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,460
Here is our D MAZE

51
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:43,600
Far from зов,

52
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,560
It'sopa´s treasure in the woods,

53
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Prey back on location school

54
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:08,020
placements and a bit jealous. But first, Onan politely leaves. I, for one, will now invite

55
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:14,980
one or more members of the audience to assume the microphone that I now hold in my hand. That's

56
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,100
right. We will not always be here, but someone needs to be here. Is there any volunteer? Anyone

57
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:29,100
who feels compelled? Who wishes to add to the symposium? What has been spoken before? A brave

58
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:36,200
What's your name? Timmy. And what grade are you in, Timmy? Mom says not to talk to strangers.

59
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:44,860
Yeah, let's not get, you know, Timmy has his own secrets. Has anyone here ever encountered

60
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:52,320
Aunt Bertha's Bible story hour? I fell down the rabbit hole of Aunt Bertha's story hour,

61
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,420
looking it up on Wikipedia, looking for old recordings. Timmy and Billy in that are always

62
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,080
being tormented by Aunt Bertha's Bible story hour. I fell down the rabbit hole of Aunt Bertha's

63
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:06,500
and they get salvation by the end, but sometimes it comes at a hard cost. The whiny,

64
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:13,400
adenoidal little kid voices, Aunt Bertha's smothering, matronly voice. Have you ever been

65
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,900
subjected to Unshackled by the Chicago Pacific Garden Ministries? No. Oh, it's a fine mine of,

66
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:28,420
and it's continuing to this day in Chicago. They are running, it's an ongoing series of

67
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:28,980
spirits.

68
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,940
spiritual and moral plays, radio plays.

69
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,560
So they're on the serious side, like the Children's Bible Hour?

70
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,700
Very much so. And spoilers, Jesus will save you.

71
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,360
The Children's Bible Hour, that secretive underground organization

72
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,880
which behaves with thorough ruthlessness in eliminating its enemies.

73
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,940
Anyway, they, my late brother wrote to them

74
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,080
pretending to be Bobby Brown, age eight or something like that.

75
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:04,220
And they wrote back and said that Aunt Bertha had expired.

76
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,240
They said, Aunt Bertha is in heaven now, Bobby.

77
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,220
The stories you heard her tell were tapes and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

78
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,700
And then this new letter was signed by Uncle Charlie,

79
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,920
a new and even more sinister persona in the Children's Bible.

80
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,040
Our organization. So I'm sure they're very active.

81
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,660
When my brother wrote to them, he received the free gift

82
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,380
that Aunt Bertha oleaginously promised at the end of every one of her episodes.

83
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,300
This was a packet of materials.

84
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,980
First, tiny stickers that resemble road signs,

85
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,160
but actually have a Christian message like,

86
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,380
Yield to Jesus. One way, Jesus. And so forth.

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,500
The other thing was, of course, a jack-chick tract.

88
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,900
One of the most poisonous of all of them, too.

89
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,260
Probably that was just a coincidence.

90
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,860
And, you know, since my brother wrote from the state of Arizona,

91
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,660
he received a little pamphlet, How to Get to Heaven from Arizona.

92
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,120
And inside, by George, that's what it told you, according to their lights.

93
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,460
Although this was only an experiment.

94
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,620
Is it harder to get to heaven from Arizona as opposed to some other place?

95
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,640
Well, it,

96
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,700
it depends. You know, you have to do the same thing.

97
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,900
You have to bow and kowtow to Jesus and blubber and cry.

98
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:42,420
Go through the Aunt Bertha and Jack Chick-like, semi-orgasmic, born-again process,

99
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:51,220
which afterwards you supposedly feel clean, and in the cartoons, large drops of sweat radiate from you.

100
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,000
A huge grin,

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,160
a grin spreads over your face as you know the good news, the gospel,

102
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,380
and are now dying to inflict it on every hottentot you can reach.

103
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,300
Every remote person must be inculcated because they are beloved, too.

104
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,380
And they must be saved by Jesus from the lake of fire.

105
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,100
Created by Jesus.

106
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,120
By Jesus!

107
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:18,900
Yes.

108
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,600
So this is all in the, in Jack Chick's comics.

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,920
And by the way, we have in the Church of the Subgenius, a certain subgenius,

110
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:36,620
Papa Joe Mama, who has actually been in a Jack Chick tract.

111
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,440
Who has had a cameo in one of them as a cop.

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,560
That is a rare distinction.

113
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,680
Yes it is, I must say.

114
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:53,900
Papa Joe was, he penetrated through to Chick's headquarters, the Holy of Holies.

115
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,980
In Chino, California, the war room where they devised all those little gospel comic books.

116
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,400
And he was trying to get Jack to draw an anti-subgenius tract.

117
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:10,560
It would have been so wonderful to do, but all that diplomatic Jack would ever say was,

118
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,460
well I'll prey on it, which means no dice buddy.

119
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:14,840
That's a no.

120
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:23,460
Yeah, I'm sorry brother, I don't believe that is a good use of my God-given ability to bring the straggling sinners toward the light.

121
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,280
So he's in that one, he's in the comic.

122
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,900
And Jack himself passed away.

123
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,920
So now there is no more Jack Chick.

124
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:43,960
I wonder if, it's like if you could have removed Hitler, the whole Nazi linchpin would have fallen apart.

125
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:53,880
I think Chick himself may have been the one essential man around whom a strange group of weirdos and religious groups,

126
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,940
hooks formed.

127
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,280
And some of them have comic books about them.

128
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:06,560
And Kurt even published a book, Papa Joe Mama, about one of the most persistent tract hander-outers

129
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,640
and his adventures in the military and as a cowboy on the open range.

130
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,180
So Reverend Pease, were you ever born again?

131
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,480
Did they get you?

132
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,320
No.

133
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,460
They got me young, like age four.

134
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:22,880
No.

135
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,960
So before you were baptized, you were baptized.

136
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,420
I wasn't a Baptist church.

137
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,400
Oh, you were a Baptist?

138
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,480
Well, I was born, I was, how do they call that, born in, I was Catholic.

139
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Oh, okay, yeah.

140
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,500
They get you young.

141
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,980
You see, they consider that, Catholics consider that to be when you're born again, when you are christened.

142
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,420
Correct.

143
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,220
But no, I have not.

144
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,220
I've been introduced to many people who have, and each to his own.

145
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,860
I kind of like my stuff better.

146
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,740
It's a little less complicated than the whole Christian thing.

147
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,600
Seems complicated.

148
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:04,120
Yeah, the industrial version of Protestantism that was pretty much founded by Dr. Moody,

149
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,920
Moody Bible Institute, it's very bureaucratic.

150
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:13,620
You get training in the form of your brainwashing in Sunday school, and then they hand you a

151
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,960
paragraph that says, you know, do you take Jesus into your heart?

152
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,200
And you sign it and date it.

153
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,900
It's a contract.

154
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,120
It's insidious.

155
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,800
The way it works is because that's how everything else in the world works too.

156
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,280
And you think, oh yeah, you're just supposed to sign this, and then you're covered.

157
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,300
You got Jesus insurance.

158
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,300
It's like L. Ron's, you know, one billion year contract.

159
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,080
Yeah.

160
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,840
And then you can get out of it.

161
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,260
Yeah, after one billion and one years, you're out.

162
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:39,620
Yes.

163
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,060
The reason I bring it up is what you'd mentioned before, Dr. Hal, about the poor unsaved.

164
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:49,000
That was the breaking point for me because I said, there's all these communists behind

165
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,780
the Iron Curtain.

166
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,460
They can't hear about Jesus.

167
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,800
So what happens to them?

168
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,020
Well, they can.

169
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,220
And luckily.

170
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,500
They do.

171
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:01,280
They are crouching by their radios, furtively saying their rosaries and so forth.

172
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,780
But wasn't Christ a commie?

173
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,080
Christ?

174
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,480
Yes.

175
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,120
Well, of course.

176
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,560
Christ, so-called, himself, did believe in holding things in common.

177
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,580
Sell all thou have.

178
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,440
Give it to the poor.

179
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,420
You can't take all those expensive objects with you.

180
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,060
It's like trying to get a camel through the needle's eye.

181
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,200
It's all a millstone around your neck.

182
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,700
Give it up and give me a sandwich.

183
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,420
And now we're going to have the Sermon on the Mount, you know, where I tell you to do

184
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,400
a bunch of other things that you will find absolutely impossible to do.

185
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,760
Isn't the camel through the eye of a needle actually a reference to a trade route difficulty

186
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,560
or something like that?

187
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,080
I don't believe that is the case.

188
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,300
I think it is the result of the fact that you can't take it with you, you know, that

189
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:58,200
the camel is too solid, large, and real to move through the eye of the needle.

190
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,960
But it also indicates, with the eye of a needle metaphor, that this transition is a harrowing

191
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,360
one.

192
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:12,540
I don't believe that that would be the primary aspect of naming it.

193
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:12,540


194
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,400
It's a secondary aspect.

195
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,200
But that's what attracted me to subgenius not many years later, which was that the church

196
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,020
paid its taxes.

197
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,820
That's a big thing.

198
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,820
Well, we can't.

199
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,640
It's not setting itself apart.

200
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,200
We're not tax exempt.

201
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:29,560
No.

202
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:37,580
But that is why your membership pack allows you an ecumenical bonding with the church

203
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,440
of the one founded by the Reverend Kirby Jacobs.

204
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,520
Praise God.

205
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,500
And by the way, the church was founded by the Reverend Gary Hensley of Modesto, California,

206
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,740
the Universal Life Church.

207
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,720
Now I already was a member of that one.

208
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,560
I was ordained in 1969.

209
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,100
And I've still got my documents somewhere.

210
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,000
But many people do not trust the ULC.

211
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,100
However, I think this documentary aspect is sort of like rent control.

212
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,720
It really does matter when you get documented.

213
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,500
Thank you.

214
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,500
But I would advise every subgenius who gets the membership packet to fill out and send

215
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,000
in those documents the first time you do.

216
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:27,280
Perform a legitimate wedding or something like that or a funeral, whatever, they'll

217
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,180
give you some money.

218
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,260
Don't forget that.

219
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:38,260
You'll make up in equity what you temporarily lost to receive the true ordination and elevation

220
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,940
to a doctoral membership in the true faith.

221
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,580
I was a minister in the same thing for a long time.

222
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,280
You well seen?

223
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,360
Yeah, absolutely.

224
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,620
I signed up back in the 80s.

225
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,020
Did you perform services for anyone?

226
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,220
I did not.

227
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:02,320
I came close when someone didn't show up at a wedding and my father called me up and wanted

228
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,840
to know if I could do it over the phone.

229
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:04,920
Good lord.

230
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,400
So I had to do some quick research and said, no, I cannot.

231
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,240
.

232
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,980
It helps to have the book of common prayer.

233
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:17,900
As long as you follow the skeleton of that, you can put in all the bells and whistles.

234
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,200
Well, it wouldn't have been legal was the problem.

235
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,020
Oh, I see.

236
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,060
Because over the phone, you're not actually present to make sure it's not, they haven't

237
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,740
slipped some false bride in or something like that.

238
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,020
Yes.

239
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,500
You must trade carbon dioxide in order to officially perform.

240
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,160
It's an ancient ritual.

241
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,600
I really loved the ceremony, especially what you said about Yog-Sothoth and his church.

242
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,960
Well, so long as they enjoy it, that's the important thing.

243
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,560
I married my own niece to her wife.

244
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,320
Anyway, it's-

245
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,540
How many weddings have you done?

246
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,140
I never have counted.

247
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,200
Never have counted?

248
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,000
But every now and then-

249
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,420
So that many.

250
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,240
People seem to want me to do one and I do it.

251
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,460
I've done it at Burning Man too, in the desert.

252
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,160
Do you enjoy doing it?

253
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,300
Not all that much, but somewhat.

254
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,280
Somewhat, as long as it's not a line of people.

255
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,900
I have to keep doing it again and again.

256
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,120
I guess that would be tedious.

257
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,880
Yes, it is.

258
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,320
Believe me.

259
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,360
I was married by a justice of the peace, by a judge, the only female judge in our county,

260
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,240
which was a blessing.

261
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:29,780
No good.

262
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,600
And yeah, it was pretty much that, an assembly line, one after the other for a whole afternoon

263
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,120
in chambers.

264
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,020
Well, you see the secular-

265
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,540
The secular get a bum deal.

266
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,220
Yeah.

267
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:44,020
And it's too bad because they should also get all the mind-breaking special effects

268
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,560
that the religions inflict on everyone else.

269
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,460
Hence, the Church of the Subgenius and its particular ministry.

270
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,080
Indeed.

271
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,060
So you've done same-sex unions, same-gender unions?

272
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,560
My niece and her bride, yes, was a same-sex union.

273
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,980
So when ... My home county in Ann Arbor-

274
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,620
Washtenaw.

275
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:14,680
They were one of the few in the nation when there was a brief window allowing same-sex

276
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,820
marriages before it closed up again due to judicial decisions, where they stayed open

277
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,400
on a Saturday.

278
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,140
The county board said, you have to stay open.

279
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,940
And then all of these ministers rushed in to the county building, married people, 300

280
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,880
of them in a weekend.

281
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,640
So that's something I'm proud of.

282
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,480
And that's the situation you're trying to avoid, correct?

283
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:34,800
Yeah.

284
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,500
For sure.

285
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:42,000
You want to avoid that, because the problem is everybody's marriage is supposed to be

286
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,220
a special thing, and that's what they want to be believed.

287
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,820
So the more you standardize it, the less satisfying to them it seems.

288
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,300
They deserve your original attention.

289
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,800
Now, are you going to be going to the Playa again this year?

290
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,940
I'm afraid so.

291
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,340
How many years in a row is that?

292
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:04,780
I don't know.

293
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,160
I don't know.

294
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,540
I don't know if you can tell.

295
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:07,540


296
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:07,540


297
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:07,540


298
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:07,540


299
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:07,540


300
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:12,420
So the reason is that they want me to continue doing this show that I always do out there.

301
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:18,720
And this year, they have given me two vehicle passes and tickets for two assistants, as

302
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,960
well as my own ticket, so I guess I got everything I wanted.

303
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,800
But of course, I still have to get there.

304
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:34,160
I have to create this enormous effort to get there and then live in the dust and the dirt.

305
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,760
I have to live in the dust and the dirt for two years.

306
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


307
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


308
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


309
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,960
all the time that I'm there.

310
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,800
And then do the show on the very next to the last day,

311
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,780
the night of the burn, in fact.

312
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,920
So that's happening.

313
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,980
And if you're going, you can also see me on the second stage

314
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,860
on Tuesday and Thursday from 3 o'clock to 3.15

315
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,360
doing my own presentation.

316
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,400
But the show is, as always, beginning at 5.30,

317
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,800
running through until 7 on the main stage

318
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,200
in the downtown area in Center Camp Cafe.

319
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,200
Do you think it's the same festival it was 21 years ago?

320
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,500
Absolutely not.

321
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:21,920
And yet there are similarities that can be traced and seen,

322
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,900
but it's not because it's so large and immense

323
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:32,500
and has different structural and administrative problems and so on.

324
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,140
It has an airport and it has the Department of Public Works

325
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,940
and it becomes one of the largest cities in the state of Nevada for a short time.

326
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,980
It actually does.

327
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,440
It makes all the news throughout the state, and it's a big deal.

328
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,460
Everybody avidly watches what's going to happen.

329
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,940
There are certain feeds out of there.

330
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,240
I participated in one, and we have our own radio station there too,

331
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,200
but there are other new types of feeds

332
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,700
that are going out.

333
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,540
I, of course, follow this vicariously,

334
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,780
but various Radio Valencia commentators in the mission

335
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,720
on your show and others, on the Ask Dr. Hal show,

336
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,220
on Radio Valencia and others.

337
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,240
Well, thank you for listening to that show.

338
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,020
I do. Very much so.

339
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,960
You've been listening to it lately?

340
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,220
You know what?

341
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,160
One o'clock in the morning Eastern time is rough to do, with apologies.

342
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,480
That's the time we're supposed to end,

343
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,460
but lately we haven't.

344
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,120
We've just...

345
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,420
It's continued.

346
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,200
Yes.

347
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,460
I need to get back into the habit.

348
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,780
I'm not going to BS you,

349
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,200
but I'm going to say that I spent many years listening with great pleasure

350
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,380
and put it on once in a while.

351
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,080
Well, we have a good group now,

352
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,460
and I hope they're doing it in my absence,

353
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,980
demonstrating how utterly unnecessary I am for my own show.

354
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,800
I think I'd always rather have something live than a rerun of any kind,

355
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,580
but the structure allows you to put in

356
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,040
any particular show you want for a rerun.

357
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,100
Well, you're fortunate there's so many talented people there,

358
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,800
like Puzzling Evidence and K. Robb and...

359
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,260
Yes, K. Robb is amazing.

360
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,420
Pete Goldie's knowledge is great,

361
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,280
and we have Michael Pepe also.

362
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,240
At K. R. O. B.

363
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,600
San Francisco.

364
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,860
Everybody should check him out on Facebook.

365
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,120
K. Robb. K. R. O. B.

366
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,920
You know, it's funny because I didn't know there was a...

367
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,060
Oh.

368
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:30,280
Oh.

369
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:31,680
Oh.

370
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:34,740
Okay.

371
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:39,900
Yike.

372
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,020
And that really kind of...

373
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,700
It's the thing about The Subgenius,

374
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,760
it's like a rabbit hole.

375
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,000
You scratch a little bit,

376
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,620
and you find this other person,

377
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,500
and you find some other shit.

378
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,440
Yes, it goes on and on.

379
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,760
It's half the fun.

380
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,980
Well, it might be all of the fun.

381
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,020
I don't know, but it's...

382
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,180
For me, finding these things out were, you know,

383
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,400
oh this guy Al Bernard

384
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,180
I like this guy and he likes this show

385
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,100
oh that's Dr. Hell

386
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,220
I didn't even know he had a show

387
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,060
I'm flattered there's nothing like a direct

388
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,260
when you tell somebody about something

389
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,200
you can personally

390
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,880
it makes you feel good

391
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,960
it does make you feel good and makes you feel like you want to put your time into it

392
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,200
Dr. Hell show of course being totally worth that time

393
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,340
I told you I'm a fanboy

394
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,200
thanks a lot

395
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,920
I appreciate it

396
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,360
I played at work and they were always like

397
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,000
what is that you're watching Superman

398
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,820
and I'm like no

399
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,640
it's not for you

400
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,600
it's safe for work

401
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,500
it might be safe for work

402
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,200
you have to listen closely to determine

403
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,180
I found that if you're not an actual

404
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,100
subgenius

405
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,360
you will start to tune that out

406
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,980
and they won't pay attention

407
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,340
it's just a background noise

408
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,480
but of course I am

409
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,060
well how do you think I learned about it

410
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,080
it's good that you shout things that can't be heard

411
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,340
yeah

412
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,320
from the audience

413
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,080
well you can also come up and shout through the microphone

414
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,380
if you like

415
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,460
he's busy coloring right now

416
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,920
I only mention that because there's a variety of opinions

417
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,120
about Burning Man in San Francisco

418
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,440
apparently many of them negative

419
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,540
and I know you're

420
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,400
I know you are employed by them

421
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,200
so you're not going to rubbish a contractor

422
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,720
that's part of being in San Francisco

423
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,140
I had to go to a meeting

424
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,620
there just recently

425
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,140
but I

426
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,000
you know it's strange

427
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,400
they do provide

428
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,540
some stuff for me

429
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,400
but then the rest I myself

430
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,080
must be responsible for

431
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,660
but they're famous

432
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,360
we're doing that

433
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,880
they will match fund with you

434
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,240
if you want to create an exceptional attraction

435
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,820
if you want to build a big cathedral

436
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,160
or something out there

437
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,040
they'll pay for half of it

438
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,760
and then the other half

439
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,580
you have to provide

440
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,640
including hauling in all the materials

441
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,940
and labor and to get in

442
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,040
you have a friend

443
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,000
he's right on you

444
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,140
so a large insect has found

445
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,100
Hal delicious

446
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,400
I saved you

447
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,740
thanks

448
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,820
Reverend Pease for the save

449
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,340
Reverend Pease

450
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,860
these black hornets are dumb

451
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,940
and they will bumble right into your face

452
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,820
and sting you

453
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,220
for an afterthought

454
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,600
usually just holding still

455
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
is a good thing to do

456
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,480
I've suddenly become much more alert

457
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,320
they've stung many famous

458
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,260
geniuses in recent previous

459
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,160
X-Day iterations

460
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,220
so anyway be thankful that you're

461
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,400
laid back pleasant X-Day

462
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,460
instead of the survival Olympics

463
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,960
of Burning Man

464
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,120
yeah beginners luck

465
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,360
this weather is knock wood

466
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,300
not too bad

467
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,860
not too bad not too shabby

468
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,060
no rain this year

469
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,960
no previous

470
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,040
scannings of the Facebook pages

471
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,180
just report a horror of

472
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,500
sucking mud

473
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,740
endless rain

474
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,180
110% humidity

475
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,840
all lies

476
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,200
chiggers and no-seams

477
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,780
not necessarily lies

478
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,660
but only a part of the story

479
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,180
the tip of the iceberg

480
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,380
but they haven't emptied the

481
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,940
the tortoises yet

482
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,700
no

483
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,980
doesn't that happen periodically

484
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,760
you can set your watch by it

485
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,580
like clockwork?

486
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,280
it's so bad

487
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,260
hey eggplant do you want to

488
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,420
I came to say that I walked 8 miles

489
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,340
uphill into this valley

490
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,600
in order to get here to X-Day

491
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,940
where the hell are you people?

492
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,680
thank you

493
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,520
thank you

494
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,480
eggplant uphill in order to get into this valley

495
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,680
I didn't get it till just now

496
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:53,900
yeah

497
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,320
no it was good man I'm just saying I'm slow

498
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,000
yeah we know

499
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,960
welcome to the church!

500
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,560
well uh

501
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,620
and there you have it

502
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,060
now once again I'm going to say it

503
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,300
I think in 10 minutes I'm going to step down

504
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,120
and we need someone else to come in

505
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,280
we need a paladin to come in and fight the good fight

506
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,860
I think Argus Fox should come up here

507
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,180
yes Mr. Fox is certainly adroit at this

508
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,980
but perhaps Reverend Eggplant himself is the guy

509
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,420
so let me just make a

510
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,640
swift switcheroo

511
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,620
oh no

512
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,520
I appreciate the invitation to speak with you and thanks

513
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,060
we're going to need to put it to life

514
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,440
yes but you see this goes on on Tarzan's radio station

515
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,680
this is one of the comfortable chairs too

516
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,720
there you go and put the

517
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,160
Reverend Eggplant steps to the microphone

518
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,480
steps to the microphone

519
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,320
oh that's right that's right yeah

520
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,960
he's got a little eyes upon him what will he

521
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,740
what is his opening gambit

522
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,160
he's putting the cans on his head

523
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,500
so like hi

524
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,360
it's on radio time

525
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,980
hey Eggplant what's going on

526
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,860
oh not a whole lot it's been an interesting day

527
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,940
gotta say

528
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,640
what's been your favorite event here at X Day so far

529
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,700
uh favorite event so far was actually getting here and setting up as quickly as ever man

530
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,860
it's like everything came right into place

531
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,340
the most uneventful event I've had in a long time

532
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,340
excellent

533
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,040
that's an uneventful event

534
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,460
yeah

535
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,400
in a long time that is the way to go

536
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,940
I'm learning a lot about camping

537
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:36,660
camping doesn't take much to put together my friend all you have to remember is

538
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,920
you gotta have the creature comforts

539
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,960
as long as you got a place to lay your head at night

540
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,940
and be comfy while doing it

541
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,120
and then some place to sit your ass in during the day

542
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,020
so you ain't totally uncomfortable there

543
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,640
out of the shade you know out of the sunlight so you're not like

544
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,580
baking like some kind of

545
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,860
of course I have none of these things

546
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,020
yeah some meat stuff

547
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,200
and I sit in the sun all day long

548
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,960
it's miserable

549
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,580
yeah you've got tent and that's about it

550
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,220
yeah you need to step the game up

551
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,780
we need to make us foods we have foods and we know how to make it

552
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,820
as a matter of fact I believe Argus Fox is preparing hamburgers later tonight

553
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,100
if I'm not mistaken

554
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,740
we'll have to eat the hell out of that

555
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,260
eat the fuck out of the hamburgers

556
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,520
Argus Fox

557
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,560
come come come here

558
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,000
you want you to

559
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,100
what?

560
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,840
he's trying to bail

561
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,460
where's he gonna go?

562
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,760
I'll have to use the Tardis

563
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,140
we'll just put the mic down

564
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,060
very good thank you Reverend Pease

565
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,800
Reverend Pease everyone

566
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,520
thank you Pease yay

567
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,580
he needs to urinate let's all celebrate

568
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,320
hooray

569
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,780
so I have to keep this show going somehow?

570
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,060
yes all by yourself bye

571
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,120
god damn it

572
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,400
you would leave me in this spot wouldn't you?

573
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,080
hi I'm a dancing monkey

574
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,840
no

575
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,080
hi Fox

576
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,840
what about dancing monkeys?

577
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,760
yeah that's what we need to manufacture here is some dancing monkeys

578
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,880
oh man

579
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,080
I'm glad I set up all these mic stands so we could just use two of them

580
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,100
just two

581
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,940
why is that happening you know what I mean?

582
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,820
why does that happen I don't know

583
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,240
just sitting next to one

584
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,360
maybe it's what happens when you let a

585
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,340
doddering old coot run a radio station out of the woods

586
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,300
oh well

587
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,160
does he happen to have only one ball?

588
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,660
only one bob?

589
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,920
only one ball

590
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,060
only one ball

591
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:35,040
yeah it's like the saddest weather vane you've ever heard

592
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,480
he's not able to buy a vowel?

593
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,460
he could easily buy one he could get a nudicle

594
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,220
like they use for dogs to help their self esteem out

595
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,140
sure gotta balance that shit

596
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:55,280
yeah it's very important you know it's not just making sure that you're comfortable but

597
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,200
that everyone else is comfortable when they look at your full set of testicles

598
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,660
right

599
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:00,480
that's uh

600
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,760
that's important

601
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,380
the tale of Rumpel Foreskin

602
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,180
thank you

603
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,260
hello x-day goers

604
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,600
fuck it up right here

605
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,220
you subgenius monsters

606
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,600
greetings and hallucinations all you x-day campers

607
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,980
it's just so magical out here

608
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,260
with all the lasers and megaphones and stuff like that

609
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,080
and the

610
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,080


611
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:50,700
uh

612
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:50,720
uh

613
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,120
uh

614
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,140
uh

615
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,160
uh

616
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,180
uh

617
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:51,200
uh

618
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,220
uh

619
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,240
uh

620
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,600
a

621
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,560
a

622
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,240
a

623
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,520
a

624
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:02,620
here

625
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,520
are

626
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,320
over

627
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,220
here

628
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:09,320
here

629
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,000
here

630
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,280
here

631
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,600
Stir fry, pork loin stir fry.

632
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:19,400
So if you're within the sound of my voice, you can come eat the hell out of a hamburger tonight,

633
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:28,720
but we need people to bring plates and forks and additional things like chips and lubricants.

634
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:38,180
Also, we're going to be having the Pease fundraiser for bad luck for shitty hombres.

635
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:49,660
So bring your loose change and bring as much of your hard alcohol and beer down here.

636
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,680
I guarantee you, you're not going to want to miss this dehydrated motherfucker

637
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,840
stumbling around into a turdace at three in the morning.

638
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,800
It's going to be wonderful.

639
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,320
It's going to be the best thing you ever did see.

640
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,040
It'll probably smell better too.

641
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,040
You stink, Pease.

642
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,160
They say don't beat a dog.

643
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,780
I'm a dead horse, but I'm going to beat this one with its own fucking legs.

644
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,960
Pease his penis.

645
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,900
You know, usually you just roast the ones that you love,

646
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,680
but you just came with your own fucking spit, man.

647
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,200
He's got such a cool hat, though.

648
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,320
Everybody else came with a spit.

649
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,820
Thank you, Dr. Lagoon.

650
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,100
Tonight we will be featuring the Peanut Gallery microphone.

651
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:37,960
So.

652
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,960
Bring your best witticisms.

653
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,640
And then bring your worst ones too.

654
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,600
Let's hear your droolings and salivations.

655
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,900
It's going to be absolutely delicious in here.

656
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,240
And then tomorrow we're all going to die.

657
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,400
Hooray.

658
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,160
I can't wait.

659
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,620
So it's going to be great.

660
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,860
The exes are going to come down and pick everybody up early in the morning.

661
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,360
I'm glad everyone was able to make it to their safety drill the other day.

662
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,040
Now, we understand.

663
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:13,760
We understand that Stang has been replaced with a shambling robot parody of himself.

664
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,880
That came to mind when Dr. Hal was talking about the Clark Kent duplicates.

665
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,820
Because now, 2017, we actually have the technology for the Stang 5000.

666
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,160
Yeah, every time he walks by a radio, they go off.

667
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,420
VHS tapes get demagnetized.

668
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,140
It's not great.

669
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,140
You'll notice a slight glow in the air too.

670
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,900
Is there a way to lure him, perhaps, into a Faraday cage?

671
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,000
Or, you know.

672
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,200
Some other way to...

673
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,880
We just have to place certain frequencies that his hearing aids will pick up only.

674
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,960
So if we can find that, we can voice of God him into the wall of the dome.

675
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,000
Is that the idea?

676
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,160
Apparently that's a diesel engine on an ice truck is the frequency to do him in.

677
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,800
So he just called the ice truck back.

678
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,200
The poor guy.

679
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,360
I'm always saying something and he's always mishearing it as something offensive.

680
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,540
And I'm like, no way.

681
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,080
I'm sorry.

682
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,340
I'm sorry.

683
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:05,840
I'm sorry.

684
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,060


685
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,120


686
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,200
I'm sorry.

687
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,620
I'm sorry.

688
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,260
I'm sorry.

689
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:07,260


690
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:07,280
I'm sorry.

691
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,280


692
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,280


693
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,380
I'm sorry.

694
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:07,380


695
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:07,400
I'm sorry.

696
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:07,400


697
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,160
I'm sorry.

698
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:11,680
I'm sorry.

699
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:11,680


700
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:11,680


701
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:11,680


702
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:11,680


703
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:11,680


704
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,260
He just takes everything as an insult and moves on.

705
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,540
I didn't hear what you said, but I didn't like the way you said it.

706
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,280
That's it.

707
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,680
That's one way to become holy, is to just absorb the abuse.

708
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,180
And that way you transcend to another level of understanding.

709
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:26,800
If you're really good, you reflect it.

710
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,280
Yes.

711
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,660
Exactly.

712
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,180
What a wonderful world to burn.

713
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:35,700


714
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,140
And good weather for it.

715
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,660
too. It's good apocalypse weather.

716
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,200
It's beginning to look a lot like

717
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,200
X Day.

718
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,900
The bones

719
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,020
are charring on the grill.

720
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,000
It's been dry. Ain't gonna take much to get

721
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,780
these forests aflame. Nope.

722
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,880
Especially when you're firing

723
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,020
heat rays concentrated at over

724
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,860
4,000 degrees Kelvin.

725
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,980
You know, it's not even that they're

726
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,940
going to set anything to fire. They're just

727
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,260
going to openly microwave

728
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,040
everything. People will

729
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,440
pop like hamsters.

730
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,040
Like hamsters popping

731
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,520
on the grill, yeah? Yeah.

732
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,480
Wrap them in a little foil and oil.

733
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,180
And then things will stop burning when the entire

734
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,100
atmosphere is torn off and they'll just

735
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,100
sort of get, the molecules will just get pushed

736
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,120
around by...

737
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,060
If you're not incinerated,

738
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,200
incinerated. If you're not

739
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,920
incentivized to be incinerated,

740
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,260
you will just

741
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,060
die of suffocation later after

742
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,100
all of the air collapse.

743
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,340
You know they're done when their eyeballs pop.

744
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,320
Yeah.

745
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,020
Pull out the molten core

746
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,180
of the earth and use it in probably

747
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,520
some giant alien

748
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,460
soft serve machine.

749
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,280
Like a

750
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,260
Menchies in another dimension.

751
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,140
Someone will be having a little molten core

752
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,900
of earth and cheesecake bites.

753
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,380
For some reason I imagine a giant

754
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,240
alien with a little line up

755
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,220
of people. Grab one, put its head in

756
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,760
a little machine, it goes squish

757
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,520
and it's a little dollop of

758
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,300
brain goo, whatever, and the lady takes off

759
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,640
and says, Mommy, look what I got.

760
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,060
They're handing them out.

761
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,520
First one's always free.

762
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,960
Mommy, Mommy, I want one.

763
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,060
The first bite of long pig is

764
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,240
always free.

765
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,220
Because you'll be coming back

766
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,340
for it pretty soon.

767
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,440
Can't quite place a taste.

768
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,120
Kind of like chicken.

769
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,380
Kind of porky,

770
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,060
kind of stringy, especially

771
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,520
if they've been eating at Dairy Queen.

772
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,520
Or Walmart.

773
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,400
You can look at your average subgenius

774
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,980
and figure out what their dietary

775
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,040
needs are usually based on

776
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,960
the CH food group.

777
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,980
It's just, you know,

778
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,820
subgeniuses don't have food pyramids.

779
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,480
They just have food pentagons.

780
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,780
And they just constantly rotate

781
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,140
between fat, grease,

782
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,480
oil, sugar, and just

783
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,360
shit.

784
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,480
Because everybody eats a little shit now and then.

785
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,340
Especially in a sandwich making church.

786
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:05,820
Like this.

787
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,220
Really, the crisis today is it's getting harder

788
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,000
and harder to find food with trans fats.

789
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,100
It's a true pity.

790
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,720
They said, you know, this might kill you.

791
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,660
So we're not going to let you

792
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,240
have it.

793
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,760
But then you want more.

794
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,480
But then you just want more.

795
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,600
So now we have a trans fat black market.

796
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,160
We have people moving from town to town

797
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,360
operating food trucks that serve

798
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,300
deep fried Twinkies roasted in goat's oil.

799
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,280
It's going to be

800
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,440
fantastic when we can get

801
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,500
all of the foods that we want

802
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,220
and not have to worry about

803
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,480
big government stepping on our

804
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,500
menus. Thanks Obama!

805
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,140
It'll be great.

806
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,240
You know, in space

807
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,600
without all the gravity, you can

808
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,360
eat as much as you want and no matter

809
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,500
what happens, your ship will just fly

810
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,460
one direction and propel you to the other.

811
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,420
You just move around

812
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,440
your spaceship with farts.

813
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,580
Or it'll become aerosolized and you'll

814
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,140
be enjoying it for a long time.

815
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:03,920
One or the other.

816
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,860
These new,

817
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,680
these new fart capsules will be handing out tomorrow.

818
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,620
You'll be able to take two or three of those

819
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,860
and you can make your fart smell like whatever you want.

820
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,320
The schnozberries smell like schnozberries.

821
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,280
And if you'd like to check it out,

822
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,960
I've been taking some myself and you're more than

823
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,620
welcome to come back here and check that.

824
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,220
It tastes like them too.

825
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,500
And if you haven't had a schnozberry,

826
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,060
well, you're in for quite a treat.

827
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,780
They grow off little,

828
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,680
little vines on the end of your ass.

829
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,340
And so you can cultivate them.

830
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,320
I'm horrified at them.

831
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,600
And there's, there's a good collection of them this year

832
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,180
because of the lack of toilet paper.

833
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,100
Thanks, thanks clowns.

834
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,520
Sounds like dingleberries to me.

835
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,080
Dingleberry pie, just like grandma used to make.

836
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,580
The literary.

837
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,960
She'd shave her upper lip over the frying pan.

838
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,880
That was the magic.

839
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,740
The literary theory is that Raoul Dahl actually meant

840
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,780
dingleberries when he said schnozberries.

841
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,660
He was just working.

842
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,700
And he marketed into the kids' book.

843
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,600
Because he was perverse.

844
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,960
He had a, yeah.

845
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
He, incredibly corrupt.

846
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,660
Yeah.

847
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,620
Just, just ridiculous.

848
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,300
A man who believes that there's no glass ceilings,

849
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,740
but we have glass elevators.

850
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,580
Give me a break.

851
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:17,840
Wonkites.

852
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,700
A-vator.

853
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,980
So, which direction are you guys heading in your

854
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,580
saucers when we get out of here?

855
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,520
Hm.

856
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,240
Up.

857
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:27,760
Yeah.

858
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,160
I was just gonna say up.

859
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,260
Away from this gravity well, thank you.

860
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:31,920
Yeah.

861
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,660
Had about enough.

862
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,640
And then.

863
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,340
Any, any big plans for some stops?

864
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:35,820
Take me away, Kelgon.

865
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,000
I was thinking about snagging the,

866
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,680
international space station with a tow rope and just dragging it

867
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,740
through an asteroid field for a few years.

868
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,920
Dr. Hell familiarized me with the Oort cloud.

869
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,260
Maybe I'll go visit that.

870
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,980
Oh, that's at the, end of the.

871
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,140
It's at the edge.

872
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,260
Of the, of the solar system or the, the noble universe?

873
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:54,980
Which one is that?

874
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,100
That's the Kuiper belt.

875
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:56,940
Yeah, right.

876
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,140
The Kuiper belt versus the Oort cloud.

877
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,460
I'm totally nodding in agreement,

878
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,960
not knowing what the hell you're talking about.

879
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,480
Subgeniuses can make up.

880
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,240
Words, but scientists can too.

881
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,220
If it's, I, I don't know how some people can get through the book of the subgenius.

882
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:11,900
Say, you know what?

883
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,160
That made a lot of sense, but you know what's hard?

884
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,040
Science.

885
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:15,820
Science.

886
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,840
Math and science.

887
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,500
You're using them big words.

888
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,460
You're making too much sense around me.

889
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:30,420
The, the only problem with the book of the subgeniuses doctrine is it has too many,

890
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,460
it's, it's too consistent.

891
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,320
Not enough internal.

892
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,460
Ingenuity.

893
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,420
And inconsistencies as all religions must have.

894
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,620
You haven't read it deeply enough.

895
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,640
You know there's more, have you, have you picked up your additional reading materials?

896
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,000
The great thing about Revelation X is it'll cancel out everything from the first, first

897
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,320
book.

898
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,040
You know, it's like a New Testament.

899
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,580
All it's, you know, it's god-lite.

900
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,340
Are you sure it's not a de-testament?

901
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,360
A de-testament, a debasement.

902
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:01,520
The church of the subgenius is the wet basement of religions.

903
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,280
Subgenius.

904
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:03,440
Subgenius.

905
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,280
we're just keeping people down there in a pit.

906
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,900
With the silverfish.

907
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,800
And lotions.

908
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,040
And lotions.

909
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,700
Now, is this a dirt floor one, or do we have a drain to spray everything down?

910
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,780
It's not a dirt floor after it gets wet.

911
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,880
I think it just becomes a pit.

912
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,460
I think the whole room is a pit.

913
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,580
But there's a washer and a dryer down there, so you can circulate in and out.

914
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,660
But it takes forever, and it really heats the room up.

915
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,900
That's probably going to be one of my favorite ways.

916
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,640
I'm going to bring a couple of pink boys with me.

917
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,380
I feel like my tractor rail will pull up one or two, maybe 300,

918
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,800
that I'll just keep in the freezer for a while,

919
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,160
and then we'll run them through a couple of experiments,

920
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,100
like how fast can you fly on the edge of a flying saucer.

921
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,560
Some people tie cans to the back of their car to celebrate.

922
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:59,980
I'll just have the neck bones of fucking humans as a wonderful decoration.

923
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,520
Instead of fuzzy dice,

924
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,660
I'll just have, you know,

925
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,440
a set of ears.

926
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,320
Well, now that you mention it,

927
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,100
if I've got a tractor beam in my saucer,

928
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,300
I'll stop by Berwyn, Illinois,

929
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,820
and get some bread dumplings,

930
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,080
because that'll go really well with the pink boys.

931
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,820
Can't eat human eyeballs, please.

932
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,860
I think the whole Midwest is going to be the first thing to go.

933
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,560
I think I'm going to shove the Midwest into the Grand Canyon and fill it in.

934
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,500
I approve.

935
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,340
As a Midwesterner, born and bred.

936
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,740
All the blandness in one space.

937
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,400
Oh, my gosh.

938
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,120
Can you imagine how horrible?

939
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,020
You can put every human being in the Grand Canyon and it still wouldn't be enough.

940
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,820
Do you have to jump up and down on top of them to get them to fit?

941
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,040
Stomp them down a little bit.

942
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,900
The running water at the bottom helps.

943
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,500
But Los Angeles...

944
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,440
It kind of flushes it out, huh?

945
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:52,000
But Los Angeles will grab it all before it gets to the sea, to Baja, California.

946
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,020
No, we'll save Flint, Michigan.

947
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:57,140
We'll give them the running bloods of pinks to drink.

948
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,620
That'll at least be a little cleaner and lighter on the iron.

949
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,100
Okay.

950
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,340
It'll be a different kind of poisoning, yes.

951
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,220
A wonderfully different kind of poisoning.

952
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:12,120
It's great, because if X-Day was to somehow be delayed for any reason,

953
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,180
we know that the human race will eventually wipe themselves out,

954
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,060
possibly before 1998 could ever get here.

955
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,000
Not fast enough.

956
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,200
Not fast enough.

957
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,220
But our Yeti blood will preserve us.

958
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,900
It's like the universal equivalent of antifreeze in our DNA.

959
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:37,400
And we'll be able to survive all of the radioactive nuclear holocausts that will rain down upon this planet.

960
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:43,140
If not at the hands of the X's, then at least our tiny-handed president.

961
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,060
You know what really counts is your maternal R-DNA, right?

962
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:46,920
My pardon?

963
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,100
Your maternal R-DNA is what really counts.

964
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,440
Your pirate DNA.

965
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,020
That's the one that's carrying the signal all the way down from...

966
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:56,360
Yeah.

967
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,140
It's just encoded in the DNA.

968
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,640
1,313 times over in one genome.

969
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,480
That sub-genome.

970
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,740
1-3-0-1-3.

971
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,140
I wish I had spooky music, but it ran out.

972
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,600
Out of spooky music?

973
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,780
At X-Day?

974
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,460
I'm going to find some spooky music.

975
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,980
It's not spooky enough in here.

976
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,100
I wish somebody could make X-Day just a little...

977
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,220
A little more spooky.

978
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:41,300
But no, I think tonight's going to be a very docile evening of gentle chit-chat and cordial invitations for libations.

979
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:49,960
And then we'll probably all retreat early to our tents this evening so we are all fully rested for the morning.

980
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,320
So everybody can get up.

981
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,060
And, yeah.

982
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,640
You want to be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed before the end of the world.

983
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,100
You want to make sure that you can be fully cocked.

984
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:17,300
You want to be cognizant of yourself in order to really experience the pain and suffering and the skin-melting, the murder, the general depravity we're going to visit upon all those motherfuckers who are too goddamn stupid to pay $35 to a man who never existed.

985
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,180
Bob?

986
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,180
Bob.

987
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,940
A man who doesn't exist anymore.

988
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:22,640
Bob?

989
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,200
Idiots.

990
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,100
Stang's next.

991
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:30,040
And I'm going to prove everybody that he's either a robot or fid-chewly in disguise.

992
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:45,320
So if I don't tie him to a stick and burn his robot skeleton out of him just to prove that he's a robot, then at least I'm going to shave his head and prove to everybody he's just fid-chewly in disguise.

993
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,020
You know, the church has been a long time.

994
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,760
Fid probably built the Stangbot 5000.

995
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:51,900
Yeah.

996
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,940
It's part of his scheme.

997
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,520
Fid-based over at Chewy Industries.

998
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,200
I think that Philo is actually a codename for Fid.

999
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,000
Yeah.

1000
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:00,580
If they...

1001
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,080
F-I-L-O.

1002
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,500
F-I-D.

1003
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:03,860
Orb.

1004
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,420
Drew Mond.

1005
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,660
Chewy.

1006
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,380
The same number of syllables.

1007
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,700
How deep does this conspiracy go?

1008
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:19,240
It goes back to 1978 when Fid Chewy came from the year 2018 riding in one of the Wisteria

1009
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,080
Portageons.

1010
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,740
Knowledge of the underthings.

1011
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:28,260
He came to a man in Texas disguised as another white man with a pipe.

1012
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,980
And this is how this all began.

1013
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,060
We've seen so many veils pulled back tonight.

1014
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:39,240
Perhaps this mysterious phone number this thing refers to in Legume's message was in fact

1015
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,500
Fid Chewy's cell phone number, which I do not actually possess.

1016
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:43,920
What's the guess?

1017
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:44,840
5309?

1018
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:46,600
That'll...

1019
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,780
Well, it depends on the area code you dial first.

1020
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,080
They never tell you that.

1021
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:51,840
I always forget that.

1022
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:59,520
But you can pick up your phone and dial 1234-REV-FOX and you can reach the Hypercube hotline.

1023
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:00,600
Nice.

1024
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,440
So that is...

1025
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,140
That's a working number you can always reach.

1026
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:11,680
And just dial 1234-REV-FAUX and you can reach the Hypercube hotline.

1027
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,860
$1.99 a minute with a $3.99 connection to the Hutt's sub-G's chat.

1028
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,960
We'll tell you all about what we're doing with our prayers.

1029
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:27,820
We're sorry, we cannot execute the call as dialed.

1030
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:28,820
We just kind of...

1031
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,940
Create a...

1032
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:35,340
Reduce physical, if possible, free credit cards, debit cards, RUs that we don't accept.

1033
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,160
Please check the number of public space cards, bat, and Starbucks coffee.

1034
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,500
Antidote pudding.

1035
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,260
Speaking of antidote pudding...

1036
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,200
Get that tingle going on.

1037
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,840
Our giant face fucking bat that was here last night...

1038
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,880
I asked for it.

1039
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:55,100
Our bat hasn't been handing out nearly enough semen.

1040
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,160
But I would like to put out that Anna Mall has...

1041
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,920
Let everybody know...

1042
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,880
That she is a bat.

1043
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,300
A giant bat.

1044
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,100
She is a giant bat.

1045
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,840
But because of that, she is scaring off the face fucking bats.

1046
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,040
There are far too few of those.

1047
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,100
She has only fucked five faces since she got here.

1048
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:21,380
You don't need to wear the protective masks tonight until you hear a bass...

1049
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,760
What was that?

1050
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:24,820
Oh, it's the spooky music.

1051
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,120
I thought we were just in the new air conditioning show.

1052
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:29,640
The new music.

1053
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:30,820
Spooky.

1054
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,680
Like the conspiracy...

1055
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,920
Hour of Slack, brought to you by Bob's HVAC.

1056
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,180
And Suboxone.

1057
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:37,580
Subox...

1058
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:42,860
When you go to X-Day, don't forget your Suboxone.

1059
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,760
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it can cure anything.

1060
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,060
From wanting to live to wanting to die.

1061
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,920
And crotch crickets too.

1062
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,140
You know, that man was...

1063
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:59,620
He reminded me a lot of the monsters from the Tenacton commercials that would crawl out of toenails.

1064
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:08,980
Just those long, gangly beasts with crippled fingers that would lurk around inside of your body, just spreading infectious disease.

1065
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,780
He was a nice guy.

1066
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,120
That makes my balls crawl.

1067
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,960
Balls are always crawling.

1068
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,700
When they've got legs.

1069
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,020
How many legs do your balls have?

1070
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,660
Just the average number.

1071
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,180
All of them.

1072
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,940
I mean, yes, my balls have the regular number of legs.

1073
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,920
I mean, how many legs do your balls have?

1074
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,560
You know, I mean, mine's got the same number.

1075
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,820
Mine have two. I carry them everywhere.

1076
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,260
Okay, yeah.

1077
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:43,120
Gee, sounds kinda like you don't have as many legs as my balls, actually.

1078
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,360
I got more legs than your balls do.

1079
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,760
Yeah, same.

1080
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:50,180
My dad's leg balls can kick your dad's leg balls.

1081
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:54,440
My dad's leg balls can kick my dad's leg balls too.

1082
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,980
It'd be great if you could just kick yourself in the nuts all day.

1083
00:49:59,120 --> 00:49:59,920
And eventually...

1084
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:04,500
Eventually you'd build up an immunity to it, and then you wouldn't have to fear it when you walk down the street.

1085
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,300
Because we all know that you can't walk down the street without expecting getting kicked in the dick.

1086
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,500
Especially at X Day.

1087
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:14,600
People wonder why I have this worried expression on my face.

1088
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:18,360
When am I getting kicked in the dick next? Watch.

1089
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,560
Dick kicks, five dollars.

1090
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,700
Pee pants for three.

1091
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,420
I noticed there was a...

1092
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:29,340
They took a lot of the urine out of the water here from the spigots this year.

1093
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,760
It's not quite as... It doesn't have as many electrolytes.

1094
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:31,960
It's not as foamy?

1095
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,500
It's a little... It's still foamy.

1096
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:34,780
Not quite as foamy.

1097
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,760
A little fizzy.

1098
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,100
It's a little fizzy.

1099
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:37,920
But not quite as foamy.

1100
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,160
But it doesn't stick to your teeth as thick as it used to.

1101
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:50,520
You know what I think is happening is all the leavings of the subgeniuses in the jankum fermentation chambers are sucking the urine out of the local aquifer.

1102
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:54,620
That's the only thing that's keeping them so fresh and moist.

1103
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,320
And moist they are this year, friends.

1104
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:08,900
If you look down there, you're going to see a lot of wasted protein that's just glistening in the green tinted light.

1105
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,880
It just sounds like a disgusting thing that you would peel off the back of your knees.

1106
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,780
One of the greatest things about X Days is the...

1107
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,900
You got a little slicker coming off of you there.

1108
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,180
Well, you're not trying to sleep.

1109
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,160
You're trying not to sleep and you just hear that rhythmic thumping coming from far away.

1110
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,620
You're trying to not un-sleep.

1111
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:29,760
The idea is anti-sleep. Lay down to rest, but with your eyes open.

1112
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,380
Knowing that as soon as you do start receiving rest, you've given up.

1113
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,180
You can beat nature at her own game. Stop sleeping now.

1114
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,680
The power of anti-sleep is... I don't even think it has a page on the subgenius wiki.

1115
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,280
Anti-sleep is a hell of a drug.

1116
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,420
It's better than FROP, but more dangerous.

1117
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,500
And unlike FROP, anti-sleep is a drug.

1118
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:53,600
Anti-sleep is a hell of a drug.

1119
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,200
It is a drug.

1120
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,080
It grows from the body.

1121
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,840
I think there's something in the air here.

1122
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,980
There's certain spores that, when you're deprived of a certain amount of melatonin in your system,

1123
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:09,280
just create this kind of a fungal growth in the digestive tracts, which...

1124
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,960
certain alkaloid problems.

1125
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,140
I get a runner's high walking to the fridge.

1126
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,880
But where does that end up mushrooming?

1127
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,340
I mean, from which orifice?

1128
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,340
Well, we're becoming edible mushrooms.

1129
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,140
That's why we can only have X Day once a year.

1130
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,760
We'll just turn into mushrooms.

1131
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:25,800
Just planted.

1132
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,860
Like, we'll grow next to the cigarette butt trees.

1133
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:32,440
I feel like I have only spilled my seed upon the ground.

1134
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,520
I have... I'm spilling about 20 seeds a ground every day.

1135
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,260
American Spirit seeds.

1136
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,740
Gonna grow some nice little bushes along the trees, and eventually the subgeniuses will come back,

1137
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:48,980
and they'll be able to just pick their cigarettes right off the bushes as they walk down to take a shit.

1138
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:51,240
And he spilled his seed upon the ground.

1139
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,640
I'm wearing headphones and I can't hear you, so don't bother me.

1140
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,220
The cafe will be closing in ten minutes.

1141
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,160
Not soon enough.

1142
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:05,080
The cafe will be closing in ten minutes.

1143
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,180
Can you move that up to five?

1144
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,180
Please bring all products to the register for checkout,

1145
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:16,260
and please prepare yourselves for the poison rock swallowing contest at 3 p.m.

1146
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:21,400
In other news, cups are free at Caffeina's in 25 minutes.

1147
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,500
You're the reason we get padlocks on everything.

1148
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,700
I haven't seen enough this year.

1149
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,040
Well, you can always make it over to the Gold Members Club behind the refrigerators.

1150
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,900
There's the giant walk-in.

1151
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:38,840
Is there a door there?

1152
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:42,640
Yeah, there's a door with a sign on it that says Gold Members only.

1153
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:43,540
I don't think we got time for a hand job, Joe.

1154
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:49,320
No, but I got enough time for him to try one out.

1155
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,720
Come on up here.

1156
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,120
Spit on your hand and say hello.

1157
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,120


1158
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:54,400
Fifty cents.

1159
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,020
Oh.

1160
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,660
I charge a dollar.

1161
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,940
Well, that's why you're poor.

1162
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:03,660
I'll provide the meat.

1163
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,860
You get no business.

1164
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,160
You're not competitive in the free market,

1165
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,020
and you have a vastly inflated sense of your own worth.

1166
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,380
You just stop outside of somebody's house.

1167
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,000
Well, it works for everybody else.

1168
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,140
You just run a meter.

1169
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,260
You hit the start button on your phone.

1170
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:16,380
You hit stop when they finish off the wrist.

1171
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,060
When you run around with a name like eggplant, that's very phallic.

1172
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,680
People think you're the one that's supposed to be getting the hand job.

1173
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,640
It's kind of bad advertising.

1174
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:31,320
You should be like Reverend Need a Hand or something.

1175
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,440
Come spit on your hand and say hello.

1176
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:38,120
Reverend spit in your own hand and just go to town on my knob.

1177
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,840
The newer, friendlier, cleaner Church of the Subgenius.

1178
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:45,400
We are here.

1179
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,500
Now acceptable in 49 states.

1180
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,500
We hear of the Suboxone slash Thorazine urine.

1181
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,140
Fuck itself.

1182
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,520
We're not even in the blood podcruster.

1183
00:54:52,700 --> 00:55:01,320
Our then in combination with Hypercube Laboratories have been acting out heavily against the Disneyfication

1184
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:06,400
of the Church as being practiced under our noses by this false android stang.

1185
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,940
Oh boy, I'm excited to meet Bob.

1186
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:09,720
Aren't you?

1187
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,660
Slasters are coming.

1188
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,300
For real this time.

1189
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,460
This is it for sure.

1190
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,680
What we don't know is that Stan talks about...

1191
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,660
Let me understand this, Mr. Reb.

1192
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,020
You killed your girlfriend because she was freaking crazy?

1193
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,420
No, I said she was fucking goofy!

1194
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:33,480
Who would be the goofy in the church to Reverend Stang's Mickey Mouse?

1195
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:38,920
If Stang is Mickey Mouse, then I imagine that goofy would probably be...

1196
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,100
I don't know, that's a hard decision to make.

1197
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:46,300
I know, there's so many, so many possibilities.

1198
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,480
Who's gonna be the goofy?

1199
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:57,800
The church is kind of like, what if the Mickey Mouse crew also had Dopey and every other

1200
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:02,020
stupid Disney character from every cartoon that Walt Disney made when he was high on

1201
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,020
Benzos prescribed by his doctor near the end of his life.

1202
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,040
2002 House of Mouse Disney Dope.

1203
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,940
Using all this money that he stole from Ub Iwerks.

1204
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,780
Yeah, what a nice guy.

1205
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,240
Probably fucked his wife too.

1206
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:15,560
That Walt Disney.

1207
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,060
Gee, thanks for everything you've shown us there, Walt.

1208
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,340
There's just something about...

1209
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:25,980
famous people who steal cartoonists' work, they love to just fuck their wife too.

1210
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,560
Just gotta turn that in.

1211
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:34,160
You can just imagine out at the art house in California back in the 30s,

1212
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,000
just guys slaving over boards and they're getting whipped.

1213
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,540
Put more shine on the buttons.

1214
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,380
Just all day.

1215
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,500
Make him jauntier. Jauntier!

1216
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,860
Scrape that thing.

1217
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,480
Yeah, just pull it on through.

1218
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,560
Pull it on through the other side.

1219
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,700
That sounds like wiping my ass after eating here for three days.

1220
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,420
X Day brought to you by Pease's Problems.

1221
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,620
Pease's Problems, now available in 45 grit sandpaper.

1222
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,140
His penis.

1223
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,040
Good call with the steamboat, Willie.

1224
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,120
Why'd they put pants on that duck?

1225
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,320
Why'd they put pants on that duck?

1226
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,080
If a duck wore pants when he wears them like,

1227
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:17,400
Who put pants on that duck?

1228
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,080
Quack, quack, quack.

1229
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,500
Or like, quack, quack, quack.

1230
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,200
I can't hear you. Don't talk to me.

1231
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,300
I'm wearing headphones, Pease.

1232
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,200
You incredible idiot.

1233
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:32,040
You shining example of human failure.

1234
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,460
I aspire to be you.

1235
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:38,440
One day, every night before I go to bed, I say,

1236
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,880
When I burn out, I hope that my charred remains look as good as Pease does.

1237
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,260
They probably will.

1238
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,320
99% of the time, that's true.

1239
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:50,320


1240
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:50,320


1241
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,460
But I have bad luck.

1242
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,680
He's trying to kill the Bob Icon.

1243
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,380
Be careful. It's sensitive.

1244
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:04,140
What many people, listeners who don't come to X Day because they're stupid, don't know is that Pease,

1245
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:07,340
X Day is just an elaborate excuse to roast Reverend Pease.

1246
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:14,240
We all come out here for several days and we just sit around and we just say horrible things about this poor man.

1247
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:18,720
This poor, loving, adorable man.

1248
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,180
Father-like man.

1249
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:25,520
A man of grandmotherly kindness who has done nothing to deserve all the scorn and yet...

1250
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:30,440
Pease is a father that went out for cigarettes and still came back even though it was two weeks later.

1251
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,120
Oh good. Somebody's checking the batteries. Hooray.

1252
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,000
Battery check.

1253
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,280
I'm staying for the battery check.

1254
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,800
No, you're going to do the rest of the show.

1255
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:43,060
Oh, the android came back. Let's not talk about the crimes.

1256
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,640
It looks like it is time to...

1257
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,440
He's saying something.

1258
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,360
It is a time for a battery check.

1259
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:50,680
In an intelligible...

1260
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:50,780
It is.

1261
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,220
Probably binary tones.

1262
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:54,860
It's lucky it's still running at all.

1263
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,100
No, we're not. Our listeners are not.

1264
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,320
It'll be lucky when more are running for more.

1265
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,720
They'll be happy when we stop.

1266
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,840
No, you'll still be heard.

1267
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,420
They'll be happy when we shut the fuck up.

1268
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,000
Well, we can't have that now, can we?

1269
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:11,500
Nope.

1270
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:12,680
Nope.

1271
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:13,900
Nope.

1272
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:14,880
Nope.

1273
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:14,940
Nope.

1274
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,520
Nope.

1275
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,980
But they can.

1276
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,220
Like ajoint prayed to unite the diocese of the United States that environment.

1277
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:28,220


1278
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:28,220


1279
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:28,700
of this Bolshevik basis.

1280
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,280
And if she had been killed then, that whole problem would have been down lock.

1281
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:29,280


1282
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:29,280


1283
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,660
Stop saying that slums aren't dangerous andénerous.

1284
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:33,040
Why we poor ‑‑

1285
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,040


1286
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,040


1287
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,140
to have the depending Đ vel ters Guru twitter or how to convict the criminal判

1288
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:44,920
to leave the real life, that's the res burger bardziejow thirty that has to go man.

1289
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:44,920


1290
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,520
76043.

1291
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,340
Praise Bob.
