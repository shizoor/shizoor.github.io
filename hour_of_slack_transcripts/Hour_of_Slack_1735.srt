1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,080
Instead of making your dollars shrink by investing in United States savings bonds,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,580
why not make them grow with interest by spending needlessly when prices are high?

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,320
Here's the way it works.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,420
Seventy-five dollars invested now each month will in ten years turn into an income of one dollar

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,080
for as long a period as you forcibly fought forces of evil each month for a fact.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,000
But now...

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,740
The Soul Genius!

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,160
Our House!

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,400
What?

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,980
Savings plan.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,100
Meanwhile...

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,520
Huh? That's weird.

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,260
It's like something out of that Twilight-y show about that soul.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,640
My God.

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,020
What is that?

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,840
What?

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,460
Well, there's my ride.

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,820
I got one.

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,480
I got one!

20
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,900
I got a spaceship!

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:54,960
They're coming!

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,700
I got a spaceship!

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,780
Bob!

24
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,300
There's something on the screen!

25
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:00,880
Yes.

26
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,420
It might be him, but the picture isn't very clear.

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,620
My God.

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,920
Bob, it's coming right at us.

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,700
I can't believe it.

30
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,180
Look at those tentacles.

31
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,140
They're coming!

32
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,280
From outer space, they're coming!

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,500
They're gonna enter our atmosphere!

34
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,680
We want the ocean!

35
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,920
We want the ocean!

36
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,160
We want the ocean!

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,640
We want the ocean!

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,620
We want the ocean!

39
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,140
We want the ocean!

40
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:42,560
We want the ocean!

41
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:43,580


42
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,700
We've already been stuck in rock'n'roll!

43
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:45,700


44
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:45,840
I've finally returned to Earth from thisendyr parsley crisis.

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,300
I think I Matter

46
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,400
I wanna experience As marca Pr trapped,

47
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:48,400


48
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:48,400


49
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:48,400


50
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:48,400


51
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:48,420
I want to explore you before I get

52
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:48,440
Re Christina ...

53
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:48,440


54
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:48,440


55
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:48,440


56
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,160
Knitting all of trader countries.

57
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,540
How to expand your Money général Know keys.

58
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,020
Oh, hello.

59
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,940
Alien? What do you mean, alien?

60
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,660
What do you mean from another planet?

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,620
That's a tricky one, isn't it?

62
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,360
Well, if that's the life, don't let them out there, flying saucer.

63
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,080
We don't want a lot of little green men terrorising the home counties during Ask It We Do It, hmm?

64
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,820
Yes, all right. Full emergency.

65
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,700
You hear the news? The three aliens are coming to New York.

66
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,040
One night only, $2,000 a ticket.

67
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:35,500
We want the aliens! We want the aliens! We want the aliens!

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,440
So what are you guys here for, to see flying saucers land? Is that going to happen tonight?

69
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,960
When they arrive, it's going to be the dawn of a whole new civilisation.

70
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,660
Space creatures conspiring with the Soviet government already control our thoughts.

71
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,740
By sending out electrical currents from the top of the Empire's...

72
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,680
State Building. And I'm the only one that knows.

73
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,960
If you're alienated, can you still help children?

74
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,720
Oh, sure. Alienation only affects the mind. It has nothing to do with the rest of your life.

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,980
We are going to see more and more of these visitors from space.

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,860
And that before too long, the evidence will be in controversial.

77
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:13,860
That you will have on your TV screens and on your movie screens concrete evidence that the ships are here and that they are real.

78
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,740
They're not fantastic things which have been cooked up to make a movie.

79
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,800
I have made telephones.

80
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:27,900
I've had telepathic contact for the past eight years with many space people from many areas of space, both inside and outside of the solar system.

81
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,420
Well, this device right here is one that we've used to contact the people in the flying saucers.

82
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:44,220
It receives the messages on a beam of light and it is in turn translated by this unit and brought out as intelligible voice speech.

83
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,940
You mean to say you actually receive messages from people in flying saucers?

84
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,460
That's right.

85
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,040
How about letting you try it, Dick, and see if I can get something on it?

86
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,240
Receiving transmission from galactic headquarters.

87
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,300
Bobby, there's nothing to be frightened of, man.

88
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,760
On my planet, all of you will be free men not locked away like animals.

89
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,320
Be free.

90
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,240
Find your own happiness.

91
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,660
Is that recording good enough to identify the thing?

92
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,540
Yeah, right.

93
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,300
Ha ha!

94
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,180
Hey, Bob is my only hope.

95
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,440
Back off and give him some more.

96
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,020
There's no room to think.

97
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:28,140
From that fateful day when stinking bits of slime first crawled from the sea and shouted to the cold stars.

98
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,980
I know I'm on the corner.

99
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,560
Our greatest dread has always been the knowledge of our own mortality.

100
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:44,960
But tonight, we shall hurl the gauntlet of science into the frightful face of death itself.

101
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,300
Tonight!

102
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,420
Tonight!

103
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,880
We shall ascend into the heavens.

104
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,780
We shall mark the earthquake.

105
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,540
We shall command the thunders.

106
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:09,260
And penetrate into the very womb of impervious nature herself.

107
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:14,820
God, please.

108
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,740
Enemy spacecraft, they are capable of 44.

109
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,180
Bob?

110
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,340
Well, he's up there.

111
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,420
Lost in space.

112
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,780
A hook.

113
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,080
I must go, huh?

114
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,140
Yeah, sure, honey.

115
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,400
I must leave this planet at once.

116
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,880
Has anyone seen my spaceship?

117
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,180
He's delirious.

118
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,080
Take me to your leader.

119
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,660
It's gonna be okay, honey.

120
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,540
Just relax.

121
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,900
Everything's fine.

122
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,820
Look, I am not talking to you.

123
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,740
I'm talking to him.

124
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,520
Oh.

125
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,940
She's not a woman.

126
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,200
The Terminator.

127
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
You'd better go now, Madge.

128
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,400


129
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,400


130
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,400


131
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,400


132
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,400


133
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,400


134
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,400


135
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,400


136
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,700
I won't go home alone.

137
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,260
Bob will take you.

138
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,680
I don't want to have anything to do with it.

139
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,680
Okay.

140
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,520
What's it for, you people?

141
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,280
I was joking!

142
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,860
Don't you know I'm joking here?

143
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,500
Everything all set for the big party?

144
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:04,960
We're getting there.

145
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,640
I'm gone.

146
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,700
I'll tell you about it.

147
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,600
Susie here still loves the walker.

148
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,480
Oh, yeah.

149
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,800
Thanks, Frank.

150
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,400
So who's all that ointment for?

151
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,480
They've been screwing us for a long time.

152
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,380
Now it's time we screwed that up.

153
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,380


154
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,380


155
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,380


156
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,380


157
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,380


158
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,380


159
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,380


160
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,380


161
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,380


162
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,380


163
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,180
Oh, Pat.

164
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,120
Ready to go?

165
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,840
Wait, honey.

166
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,620
I travel light.

167
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,180
That's a joke.

168
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,040
It's a bad joke.

169
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,280
You humans.

170
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,480
There's just no sense of humor.

171
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,120
Hey, check.

172
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,880
We're all ready.

173
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,680
Yes, you bet.

174
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,400
We're all ready.

175
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,720
He's gonna regret this.

176
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,200
I'll show him.

177
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,600
No, don't go.

178
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,700
You mustn't go up there.

179
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,740
I can't stand this.

180
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,340
But he's a robot.

181
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,340
He wants to take me back to the ship.

182
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,640
It's your old pal, Bernard.

183
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,360
I'm sorry.

184
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,360


185
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,360


186
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,360


187
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,360


188
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,360


189
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,360


190
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,360


191
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,360


192
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,360


193
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:48,880
I'm sorry.

194
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:48,880


195
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,300
The fourth alien.

196
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,760
There is no fourth alien.

197
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,580
I'm here.

198
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:51,840
Look.

199
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,280
Look.

200
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,440
Look at you.

201
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,600
You don't even look like an alien.

202
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,160
Ambrose, will you get rid of this autograph hunter?

203
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:58,760
No.

204
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,560
Don't.

205
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,360
Honey, help me.

206
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,580
You simpleton.

207
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,280
Don't you understand?

208
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,220
I'm the fourth alien.

209
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,520
Get out.

210
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,000
Get out.

211
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,580
Get out.

212
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,300
Get out.

213
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,420
Get out.

214
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:05,980
Get out.

215
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,160
Get out.

216
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,300
Some years ago, we were in the habit of sending chimpanzees into outer space.

217
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,700
Someone, somewhere has gone one better.

218
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,540
They're completely worthless.

219
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,280
They know as much about the secrets of the universe as my mother's labradors.

220
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,360
Oh, no.

221
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:25,740
enemy battle cruiser medusa class configuration length 6,324 feet

222
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:32,780
28 laser rocket guns their aircraft are so primitive it's no challenge

223
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,080
they're just gonna have to give up they've no choice but to accept all of our demands

224
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,000
army fighter planes are on patrol for flying saucers cameras installed to photograph them

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,180
Portland Oregon the area from which came the first weird reports this flying saucer patrol

226
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,240
shows how the air forces while not putting too much stock in the mysterious things in the sky

227
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,620
are investigating the control tower is in touch and on the watch so are a whole lot of people

228
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:11,540
these days they're seeing flying saucers everywhere blocks of fantastic discs flying

229
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:17,160
through the air is there something to it or is it an epidemic of people just seeing things

230
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,100
even the goat seems to be looking for the mysterious discs and the bears on the alert

231
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:32,680
or maybe there's a flying saucer with milk now let's have no more curiosity about this bizarre

232
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:42,760
cover-up it's an emergency maroon alert or even for a million these are no pinheads from another

233
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,440
planet these are no pea brains from beyond

234
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,400
the earth these are mind suckers

235
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:06,620
my god haven't any of you seen invasion of the body snatchers no no no no no no no no no no

236
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:17,780
yes I am I mean no no let's kill him well I've been up all night I've got a real story for you

237
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,720
up to now proof and everything the aliens have landed among us I'm not hot-dogging you we've

238
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,200
gotta start protecting ourselves

239
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,740
they said protect and you survive

240
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,960
but alpha's man didn't score

241
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,720
eight pounds of over

242
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,320
away

243
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,880
so

244
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:18,000


245
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:48,000


246
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,960
please

247
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,860
blast it

248
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:53,920
everybody

249
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,220
the

250
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,040
broad

251
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,040


252
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,420
this

253
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,780
goes

254
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:56,880
that

255
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,500
but

256
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:57,700
I

257
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:57,700


258
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,420
and

259
00:10:59,420 --> 00:10:59,420


260
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,300
get

261
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:02,540
to

262
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:02,800
look up

263
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:02,920
it

264
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:02,980
the

265
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,760
don't

266
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,700
I

267
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,700
I'll take your money with you!

268
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,700
Grab that woman's shot, will you?

269
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,600
Ah, yes, dear friends.

270
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,660
We're swinging and rocking and jazzing and jumping and jiving here.

271
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,020
Live in the studio this time.

272
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,700
It's not a rerun or an old tape.

273
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,880
Although you might think it was a tape from far away and long ago.

274
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,300
Well, it contains elements which have been heard before

275
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,380
under similar circumstances on other programs.

276
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,060
This should not make you think that it is not entirely original,

277
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,280
spontaneous and self-generated.

278
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,520
Here, on the spot, in this pre-X-Day Bobcast.

279
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,680
Well, the extra familiar thing...

280
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,640
was you, Dr. Howland Owl.

281
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,000
Me?

282
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,100
Oh, well, gosh.

283
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,340
They've heard that before, too.

284
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,240
Hi.

285
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,660
Well, I guess I'll have to try to live up to that.

286
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,460
At any rate, yes, I'm here now,

287
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,660
inextricably intertwined with the substance of this program.

288
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,800
We also expect to have familiar voices and guests

289
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,100
during the interval that follows.

290
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,180
Some, in fact, all of whom will be recognizable

291
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,220
to regular listeners of this program.

292
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,420
But he isn't due to call for...

293
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,900
Well, I better not say, because some imposter

294
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,860
could use the special code that way.

295
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,400
If I gave it away one time, they'll all start doing that.

296
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,460
A code in the head.

297
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,580
And I would love to hear somebody try to imitate Dave.

298
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,140
Well...

299
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,660
That could be...

300
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,680
They could...

301
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,300
It's done probably for up to ten seconds.

302
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,080
But it's like Jimi Hendrix, you know.

303
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,820
Lots of people can sound like Jimi Hendrix

304
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,680
for a little while.

305
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,500
Well, it gets hard to riff in character.

306
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,960
Right.

307
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,480
So, yeah, friends, we're all geared up for the...

308
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,700
Well, for X-Day.

309
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,780
The final solution to all of our problems.

310
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,840
Yes.

311
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,480
Thank goodness.

312
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,620
Final frontier, perhaps.

313
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,320
There's plenty of them.

314
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,340
But, yeah, the saucers will be lifting us up

315
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,800
to meet Bob and Glory, or escape Bob in horror.

316
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,320
You never know with Bob.

317
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,540
Never know.

318
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,260
And that's July 5th coming up.

319
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,840
Yes.

320
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,360
Of this year, 1998.

321
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:06,740
That's after the first 2,520 years of the Gentile rule ends,

322
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,300
according to the Holy Scriptures.

323
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,400
Therefore, God said to the subgenius first,

324
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,940
and then to the Gentile,

325
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,500
so by the same token,

326
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,480
the Lord is telling all subgeniuses

327
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,560
what is going to happen to them

328
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,060
for forsaking the God of the universe

329
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,440
and persisting in their war on God.

330
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,720
Oh, come on now.

331
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,120
You know God must be amused by that,

332
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,480
or he would have struck us...

333
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,660
Well, he would have stricken me dead by now.

334
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,940
Well, God is not in time.

335
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,660
I was the one who was always yelling that phrase.

336
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,140
Mm-hmm.

337
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,100
Sounds good, though.

338
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,980
War on God!

339
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,520
Oh, give me a break.

340
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:49,920
Really?

341
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,380
Well, you know, you don't have a challenge.

342
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,640
God expects a person to...

343
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,060
To kick back against the traces a little bit.

344
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,520
Should exceed one's grasp.

345
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,060
Or what's a heaven for?

346
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,920
Yes, just so.

347
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,260
And the Lord is not slack concerning his promise,

348
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,920
as we also know.

349
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,120
As much.

350
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,360
And then, no, slackness.

351
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,280
Mm-hmm.

352
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,060
In the elastic waistband of the trousers.

353
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,420
The elastic waistband of heaven.

354
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,760
That's true.

355
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,060
It can expand, but not infinitely.

356
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,060
Many are called, but few are chosen.

357
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,100
Sometimes the elastic waistband of the slacks.

358
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,280
Yeah.

359
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,100
Yes, it's true, but...

360
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,480
Tightness on slacks.

361
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:43,920
Ah.

362
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,940
Foolish fashion statement

363
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,400
that should fool no one of any greater than average sensibility.

364
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,100
Well, when you first get the elastic waistband,

365
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,880
it's tight.

366
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,120
But as it ages, like so many of us,

367
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,640
it becomes more and more slack.

368
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,960
Well, rubber doesn't have a long life, you know.

369
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,080
It turns leprous and horrible,

370
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,900
like those old animation models.

371
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,840
And our bodies in the same way.

372
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,060
And the werewolf mask from Captain Company

373
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,260
that I got when I was 10, by the time I was 15,

374
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,900
that thing had become slag.

375
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,280
The hair was falling out?

376
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,480
Well, it didn't have hair.

377
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,100
It was a cheap rubber mask.

378
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,320
Rubber over the head.

379
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,180
Well, you see, that's the thing.

380
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,240
The rubber loses its youthful fatality and sloughs off.

381
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,200
And this wasn't class rubber.

382
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,220
Mm-hmm.

383
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,880
I've got some older masks that are, you know,

384
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,620
some masks that have aged quite well for 20 years.

385
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,460
They're still...

386
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,140
They have a better quality of rubber these days.

387
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,240
The full over-the-head animal masks you can buy

388
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,000
in San Francisco's Chinatown, for example.

389
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:02,400
Those things are still, you know, ones purchased years ago,

390
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,540
still viable.

391
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,980
I bet a whole lot of the radio listeners don't know

392
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,880
or even believe in the bob rubber masks that are now available

393
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,780
from Sick Rick.

394
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,200
Which is not the same as saying Don Post Studios.

395
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:18,840
No.

396
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,140
Sick Rick is spelled strangely.

397
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,380
It's S-I-K-R-I-K.

398
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,420
That's all the dot com you need to know.

399
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,520
Someone with a speech impediment saying cyclic,

400
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,520
only it's Sick Rick, you see.

401
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,560
Dr. Howell, you've seen those Dobbshead masks, right?

402
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,480
Yes, they are a source of terror and veneration.

403
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:38,800
Yeah.

404
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,120
He does them in black and white.

405
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,080
They're all hand-painted.

406
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,940
And the black...

407
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,840
I asked for the black and white one first

408
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,060
because I thought it was the most terrifying Dobbshead

409
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,720
I've ever seen.

410
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,100
They're called Dobbsferatu.

411
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,160
Mm-hmm.

412
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,500
Really vampire-like.

413
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,420
And the color one is pretty scary.

414
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,540
And you get them with eyeballs or without.

415
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,900
Well, aren't you supposed to supply your own eyeballs?

416
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,360
But that's all right.

417
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,160
It depends on if you want to use it for display

418
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,940
or as an actual mask.

419
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,080
So have a mannequin head equipped with eyeballs.

420
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,760
And you can display it proudly in your home, den, or rumpus room.

421
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,160
Well, that's right.

422
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,660
You saw that mask at last X Day.

423
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,520
I did see it.

424
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,740
It was an astonishing sight.

425
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,760
That boy that YB Dobbs wore it,

426
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,240
I think maybe you or Philo brought it.

427
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:27,860
Mm-hmm.

428
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,540
Princess Weeb brought it.

429
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,720
Yes, I remember promises made years ago about...

430
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:33,740
Yes.

431
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,340
I wasn't there.

432
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:34,940
I just saw pictures.

433
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,000
...who would wear a Dobbs mask.

434
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,020
It was YB Dobbs that wore it.

435
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,220
They never came about.

436
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,040
Well, it's risky.

437
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,800
Yes.

438
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,080
People shoot at you.

439
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,340
Shhh.

440
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,500
The last person for a long time there to wear one of those

441
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,880
was Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo.

442
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,920
Yes, and look where it got him.

443
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,680
Yeah, he got shot.

444
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,880
He jumped out.

445
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,540
He was terrified.

446
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,440
He was so scared.

447
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,120
It was like a trap door under the stage

448
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,980
that he was supposed to pop out of.

449
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,900
And he'd immediately get shot and go back down.

450
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,360
That was it.

451
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,560
This is a guy who's been doing crazy stunts on stage

452
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,860
for half his life.

453
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,920
And he became terrified.

454
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,480
He was just certain.

455
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,480
His psychic spidey sense, his Devo mutant power

456
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,020
told him that somebody was going to use real bullets

457
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,860
and it'd be an accident.

458
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,160
And puzzling evidence wouldn't remember

459
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,420
which was the blanks and which was the starter pistol

460
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,620
and which was the real handgun.

461
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,200
Right, the Finnish pistol.

462
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,420
Yeah.

463
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,460
As it was, Mark survived after hours of surgery

464
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,140
in the hospital.

465
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,200
But he did survive.

466
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,600
Well, it was all in good, clean fun.

467
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,280
Yeah.

468
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,100
I thought he got someone else to do it.

469
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,080
No, he tried to get my wife, my ex-wife.

470
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,040
That's why I said it that way.

471
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,920
Yeah, Reverend Someone Else.

472
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,440
Yes.

473
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,940
Was her name.

474
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,440
And she was there and she was helping him.

475
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,560
And he said, I don't want to do it.

476
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,120
I don't want to do it.

477
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,860
And she pushed him.

478
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,080
When the cue came, she actually pushed him.

479
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,620
Now it all comes up.

480
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,260
He's not a real big guy, you know.

481
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,340
Hey, what are you doing?

482
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,500
And he pops up.

483
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,160
There's a really bad still of him in that it's a pretty bad mask, too.

484
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,640
And no good video.

485
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:26,420
However, of course, the first assassination of Bob,

486
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,560
performed by puzzling evidence, is beautifully caught on three cameras.

487
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,380
It has been videoed.

488
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,180
Yes, that's right.

489
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,260
Including the bottling down of puzzling evidence himself.

490
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:45,160
And everything on the stage is shown and has been studied in great detail.

491
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,640
Much like the Zapruder film.

492
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,860
There have been many talk shows about it.

493
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,580
They pop up and there's clips from all that in Arise.

494
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,380
And I think you see a little bit of some of that in, well, they show it in the feature movie.

495
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:08,160
They definitely show it in the subgenius documentary film, J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church.

496
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,420
The Church of the Subgenius.

497
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,260
By the way, I just heard about another film festival it's in.

498
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,080
Montreal, Canada.

499
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,820
What film festival is that?

500
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,880
So they went to Melbourne, Australia.

501
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,040
And what happened there?

502
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,420
They haven't been there yet.

503
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,980
They're doing Galway, Ireland first.

504
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,300
Then Melbourne, Australia.

505
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,580
And then Montreal, Canada.

506
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,200
And this is all in July.

507
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,880
Sandy Boone, the director, is exhausted just thinking about it.

508
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,840
Yes, he certainly is.

509
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,700
He sounds rather exhausted.

510
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,520
Become a foot soldier for Bob.

511
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,520
Trudging from festival to festival.

512
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,780
No, and the funny thing is she's a Christian.

513
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:50,000
I think she's in a fairly fundamentalist church like Church of Christ or something like that.

514
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,920
I don't know for sure.

515
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,340
She was a Baptist.

516
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,360
A joyful Baptist.

517
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,460
She's very worried about where her congregation is going.

518
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,020
I probably shouldn't be talking about this.

519
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,080
Well.

520
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,320
Some Christians are upset by the way their preacher is supporting it.

521
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,780
You know, it.

522
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,340
Yes, it's true.

523
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,700
But they have been corrupted.

524
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,020
These preachers are corrupt.

525
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,380
They have all gone aside.

526
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,540
They are all of them become filthy.

527
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,240
There is none that doeth good.

528
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,840
No, not one.

529
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:26,040
Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up these people as they eat bread?

530
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,320
There were they in great fear.

531
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,440
For God is in the generation of the righteous.

532
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,300
For example, recently, a bunch of Republicans were booing the words of the president of

533
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,300


534
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,300


535
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,300


536
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,300


537
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,300


538
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,300


539
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,300


540
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,300


541
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,300


542
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,480
Christ when they were quoted about helping the poor and so on, not recognizing their

543
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,040
origin since they are such poor Christians that they're all into this nonsensical prosperity

544
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:53,460
gospel that they've come up with when in fact the founder of the Christian religion said

545
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,940
over and over again, you can't take that stuff with you.

546
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,880
You know, it's easier to get a camel through the eye of a needle and so on and get your

547
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,700
precious possessions through to the other side.

548
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:11,440
Through the kingdom of God, only the purest sliver of the soul can be accepted.

549
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,680
All the rest of this stuff is like a millstone around your neck.

550
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,720
So sell all thou hast and give it to the poor as if they're going to do that.

551
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:28,620
No, instead they'll boo the words of the Nazarene when some plucky individual tries to stop

552
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:35,280
this disgusting bilge which is fastened like a sucking parasite on the ground.

553
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,460
The religion of peace.

554
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,660
Well said, Dr. Howell.

555
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,700
It's true.

556
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,340
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.

557
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:49,580
And one part of the knowledge that they lack is the origin of that phrase, the needle's

558
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:49,840
eye.

559
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:59,900
It was in fact a kind of gate used in bazaars in the Middle East that was narrow for people

560
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,540
to walk in and out freely, but they didn't want camel traffic everywhere.

561
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,260
Right.

562
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:11,840
So it was too narrow of a little area for a camel, especially a laden one, to get through.

563
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,500
So it was possible to take a camel through the needle's eye.

564
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:16,900
Well, the head can get in.

565
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,540
You just have to chop it into pieces.

566
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,640
Not fun for the camel and not a practical proposition in any case.

567
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:31,060
I can imagine now, I can envision a crew of rich, fat merchants struggling to prove they

568
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,540
can shove that camel through that narrow opening.

569
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,260
Well, I don't know.

570
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:35,640
Unfortunately.

571
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,740
Well, see, it's not impossible.

572
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,500
Enough rich men can push a camel through the needle's eye.

573
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,420
The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor.

574
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,300
Let them be taken in the devices which they have imagined.

575
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:55,780
For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire and blesseth the covetous whom the Lord abhorreth.

576
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:03,640
The wicked through the pride of his countenance, that smirking, smug, orange-painted countenance,

577
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,240
will not seek the camel.

578
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,940
There is no more thought of him except after God.

579
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,300
God is not at all in his thoughts.

580
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,960
His ways are always grievous.

581
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,040
Thy judgments are far above, out of his sight.

582
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:20,020
And as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them, probably with a vape device.

583
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:30,160
And as Bob once told me while worshipping Moloch, he said, Bob saith, I only believe

584
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,240
in two things.

585
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,820
Santa Claus.

586
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,220
And the fact that he doesn't exist.

587
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,220


588
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,660
And with that, we shall call in Lonesome Cowpoke Dave.

589
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,000
I mean, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

590
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,980
Lonesome who?

591
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:44,460
Dave.

592
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,980
Oh, Lonesome Cowboy.

593
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,400
Yeah, there he is.

594
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,440
Lonesome Poker-Faced Roy.

595
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,900
Oh, he's holding a phone.

596
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,960
Oh, it is an imposter.

597
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,960
I was afraid of that.

598
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:59,440
See, if I said we were expecting Dave to call in some imposter trying to sound exactly like Dave.

599
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,100
And it's easy to do.

600
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,920
He's the easiest guy in the world to imitate.

601
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,820
No end of fold.

602
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,980
But this imposter, I suppose, would have to introduce himself with a few apostrophes

603
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:14,260
by locating the genius and the subgenius in each and every single little word he said.

604
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:21,260
That fluttering spirit which hovers even against the dank background of a subgenius personality.

605
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,640
Yep.

606
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,220
That flatulent weasel underneath your feet is nothing better than something to eat.

607
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:29,980
Wow!

608
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,520
Yeah, if you're desperate.

609
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,600
We're full of poetry and Bible quotes.

610
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:34,980
Tonight.

611
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,860
That was from the Bible, wasn't it, Dave?

612
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,740
Yeah.

613
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,120
Certainly would have.

614
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:46,080
Because I went to a poetry slam conference in San Francisco one time when I was out there a long time ago.

615
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,100
And this guy was talking.

616
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,440
I couldn't understand what the hell he was talking about.

617
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,220
And everybody was cheering.

618
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,000
And then he started imitating Deputy Dog having sex.

619
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,740
The old 70s cartoon character, Deputy Dog.

620
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,020
Yeah.

621
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,540
Deputy Dog having sex.

622
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,540
With some other cartoon animal.

623
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,640
And everyone was just laughing, laughing up and jorbing and joking uproariously

624
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,440
as if it was the most wonderful thing they'd ever heard in their lives.

625
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,620
Well, that was Deputy Dog's downtime.

626
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,700
Sorry.

627
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,540
He's got to relax, kick out the traces, kick out the jams.

628
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,780
Law enforcement is something that, well, it takes its toll.

629
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:33,780
Yep.

630
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,660
That's the way I tend to agree with that, especially thinking in terms of, like,

631
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,100
X-Day, what it really, really, really means, you know?

632
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,860
Well, up until the point where we are outside the effects, the efforts of law enforcement,

633
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,760
operating according to our own law.

634
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,580
I hope it wasn't bad for me to say that.

635
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,860
You say we can control gravity with our minds and stuff?

636
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,280
And comedy, too.

637
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,100
Oh, no.

638
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,740
At least nothing funny is going to happen around here, so.

639
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,940
Not on this show.

640
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,460
Not on my watch.

641
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:16,140
This isn't a time for ludicrous goofing and wacky antics.

642
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,480
We're on the cusp of the destruction of human civilization and the Earth.

643
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,220
Are we supposed to come here and make goofball jokes?

644
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,240
Yes.

645
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,940
Yeah, that's what I was going to ask you.

646
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,100
Apparently, there's this Mayan city they discovered that's got all these wall paintings that are real like...

647
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,720
It's your city?

648
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:33,900
You know.

649
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,680
Oh, no.

650
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,000
In Mexico.

651
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:37,720
Oh.

652
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,760
The Mayan city they discovered is the Mayan city.

653
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,540
Oh, it's Mayan.

654
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,720
Okay, sure.

655
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,220
Okay, well, how do you pronounce it?

656
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:43,960
No, it's Mayan.

657
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,060
No, it's Mayan.

658
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,640
No, Mayan.

659
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,400
Yeah, it's Mayan.

660
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:53,160
Well, anyway, they discovered it, and it's full of bar reliefs and wall hangings and things like that.

661
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,420
Yeah.

662
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:00,260
And one of them looks just like J.R. Bob Dobbs, and I just wanted to be either in it or...

663
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:00,600
No!

664
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,100
...were aware of that.

665
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,660
Well, we are now.

666
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:03,900
Right.

667
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,580
He and the...

668
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,580
Can't be unsaid.

669
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,940
...subgenius publication soon.

670
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,900
Can't be taken back.

671
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:14,860
We're going to have to make room for that in the subgenius canon, already bulging with irrelevant factoids.

672
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,000
But we'll get that in there, the Mayan glyph of Dobbs.

673
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,440
They smoked pipes.

674
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,560
That, it was only a matter of time.

675
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,000
Well, what was...

676
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,700
I don't understand what was a matter of time.

677
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,580
That makes no sense.

678
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,800
Well, no, that Mayan...

679
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,760
There's a Mayan glyph that shows this piped man who...

680
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,620
Actually, kind of looks like a Mayan-style Bob might look.

681
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:37,880
Yeah.

682
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,340
And he's greeting these gods from the sky and offering them some kind of canisters.

683
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:56,060
And there's what appears to be a city in flames and symbols of death and destruction.

684
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:01,180
But then somewhere along the line, there's this glimpse of heaven.

685
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,540
But you don't get to see that image.

686
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:11,500
You don't get to see that image very often because it's like those temples in India that are dedicated to raw sex and every position.

687
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,000
So it's a mixed message, you know.

688
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,680
It's doom for some and salvation for others.

689
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:23,620
Predicted by the Mayans only 1,998 years ago.

690
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,820
Bonampak is the name of the city where the frescoes are.

691
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,540
The name of the city is Bonampak.

692
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,080
Bonampak.

693
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,520
B-O-N-A-M-A-K.

694
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,100
B-O-N-A-M-A-K.

695
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,840
Most interesting.

696
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,320
There's an argumentative woman.

697
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,560
I have to go for a second.

698
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:45,660
I'll see you in 23 seconds after I tell this old lady across the hallway who's got a TV blaring to shut up.

699
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,680
Hang on.

700
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,000
Well, she's watching her story.

701
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,600
She's watching her favorite show.

702
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,620
But I guess it's time to call everyone's attention into the center.

703
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,680
Goodness.

704
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,740
You're not getting along with your neighbor, that's for sure.

705
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,860
I didn't know that Dave had neighbors like that.

706
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,340
He does have a book, Neighbor World.

707
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,260
He who backbiteth against his neighbor.

708
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,900
He wrote the book, Neighbor World.

709
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,160
Nor doeth evil against his neighbor.

710
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,620
Yeah, we're all neighbors, neighbor.

711
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,220
Yeah, all gym neighbors to each other.

712
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,140
Gym neighbors to each other.

713
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,920
What an ill prescription that is.

714
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,900
Yeah, all singing in a sort of...

715
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,520
Whoa, whoa.

716
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,080
Whoa, whoa.

717
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,860
Yeah, kind of singing in an uptight way, which is unusual.

718
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,940
Does any of you guys read his autobiography, Gym Neighbors World?

719
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,060
Uh-oh.

720
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,120
Wasn't Gym Neighbors and also Annie Griffiths, weren't they all like sex...

721
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,840
Oh, no, that's Barney Rubble, or Barney...

722
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,040
Barney Fife.

723
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,780
Barney Fife, Gym Neighbors, and...

724
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,100
He's a pervert.

725
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,460
Not a pervert, but he called a staple of ladies, right?

726
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,020
His brother was Goober, you may remember.

727
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,900
Goober was an unwholesome character.

728
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,360
Yeah.

729
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,780
He was nuts.

730
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,440
Well, yes, he was part of that rural community featuring Aunt Bea,

731
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,020
who's also in The Day the Earth Stood Still,

732
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,500
claiming that flying saucers are coming from Russia.

733
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,860
And the little squinty-eyed Opie, also,

734
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,460
director of movies about giant whales and aged aliens.

735
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,640
Huh.

736
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,200
Huh.

737
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,720
How come everybody's laughing?

738
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,880
I have no idea what you're talking about right now.

739
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,600
Well, a little Opie directed a movie called Cocoon,

740
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,320
and he might have even directed the sequel of Cocoon.

741
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,420
Who could forget that, especially if you've got dementia?

742
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:49,220
Yeah, see, these are these oldsters who aliens get all revved up and so forth.

743
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,240
A kind of prophetic, considering what we, the subgeniuses, believe.

744
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,700
And then more recently, he developed a movie which Hollywood considers a total flopperoo

745
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,500
about giant whales.

746
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,460
And he's got these little whales crashing into whale boats

747
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,900
and hounding and harassing the survivors as they attempt to reach out.

748
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,260
Are you talking about Heart of the Sea?

749
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:09,800
I am.

750
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,340
It's based on a true story that Moby Dick is based on.

751
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,240
Have you seen the movie?

752
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,200
Yeah, I loved it.

753
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,080
I thought it was great.

754
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,140
Well, it didn't do well in Hollywood.

755
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,420
And so they're now saying, you know, he's lost his magic touch.

756
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,820
But he just came out with something.

757
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,160
I thought it was really good.

758
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,120
I liked it.

759
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,140
It's an intelligent way of treating the theme.

760
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,580
What is wrong?

761
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,960
What's wrong with him to say such a thing?

762
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,660
Did he direct...

763
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,540
They're pictures and vampires.

764
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,460
First Man, I think he did.

765
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,220
Neil Armstrong's story.

766
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,780
Yeah, I recently watched that.

767
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,700
That was a good one, too.

768
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,960
Yeah, Opie's done some excellent movies.

769
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,060
And he did have flabby man tits.

770
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,140
And he tortured people in the Twilight Zone.

771
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:49,940
That's right.

772
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,280
That's a really good thing he did, however.

773
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,500
And he was a bad little kid.

774
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,320
Oh, pardon me, a good kid.

775
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,300
He was a good kid.

776
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:56,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

777
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,340
Very good.

778
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,120
You don't want him to get mad at you.

779
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,700
Right, right.

780
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,600
He could make your...

781
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,800
Your mouth just grow.

782
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,640
Send you out into the cornfield

783
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,320
to become a jack-in-the-box or something.

784
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,660
Mr. Howell is a bad man.

785
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,700
Yeah, he cut it out.

786
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,700
I send my tithes in.

787
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,020
You got nothing on me.

788
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,380
Yeah, that would be an ideal way

789
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,680
to start a perfunctory movement

790
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,640
would be like to say,

791
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,620
are you ready to go to the cornfields now yet?

792
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,200
Are you?

793
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,300
Well, you know, in old Ireland,

794
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,980
the people were actually terrified

795
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,480
of those supposedly cute little leprechauns,

796
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,620
and you were never allowed to criticize them

797
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,780
or say anything about them

798
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,160
except they were extremely good.

799
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,620
They were the good people, the good folk.

800
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,440
Bless them.

801
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,940
Let's hope they don't do anything.

802
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,640
They're good.

803
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,460
They're really good.

804
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,320
We tried to gain their favor, as a matter of fact,

805
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,720
rather than the way it is nowadays.

806
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,180
Even banshees were not considered

807
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,240
a very evil thing, per se.

808
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,880
They were just, you know, a portent of...

809
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,260
They're a spirit of mourning.

810
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:58,680
They're a spirit of mourning.

811
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,240
They're a spirit of mourning.

812
00:34:59,240 --> 00:34:59,260
They're a spirit of mourning.

813
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,560
It means a banshee is a woman of the she,

814
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,540
kind of like the Mexican spirit La Ilurona,

815
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,920
the weeping woman,

816
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,840
the howling spirit who appears

817
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,860
at time of mourning and death.

818
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,020
And so the banshee,

819
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,240
rendered even more scary by Walt Disney,

820
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,480
also comes along with the leprechauns,

821
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,860
the coach driven by the headless coachman,

822
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,280
the coach that takes you...

823
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,460
to the other place.

824
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,280
And...

825
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,060
You have to have a special beard

826
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,760
if you're going to go there in a passport.

827
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,740
You have to go underground

828
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,020
to live under the hill.

829
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,360
And as you're under there,

830
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,340
time passes at a prodigious rate.

831
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,240
So when you come out,

832
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,320
everybody you knew was dead, dead, dead.

833
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,980
Darby O'Gill got in a lot of trouble with that.

834
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,220
And so did...

835
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,220
No, that's not Stang's Paradox.

836
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,360
Stang's Paradox is basically some...

837
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:58,460
You're not like your grandfather

838
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,260
and had sex with him.

839
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,560
No, no, no.

840
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,500
That's the Fry Paradox.

841
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,520
Mine was just real simple.

842
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,980
I must, yet I cannot.

843
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,680
It's as simple as that.

844
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:07,940
Yeah.

845
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,620
It's everybody's situation.

846
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,920
Where does I must meet with I cannot on the graph?

847
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,900
Why is this not part of the plan?

848
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,720
To laugh like the human,

849
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,960
to dance like the human,

850
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,020
to make silly jokes like the human.

851
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,740
To wear silly shoes like Herman.

852
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,580
You are a Roman,

853
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,240
and a Roman you shall remember.

854
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:29,460
You shall remain.

855
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,860
Now I set you in motion,

856
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,540
said Great Guidance.

857
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,480
One, kill the family.

858
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,780
Two, kill the girl.

859
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,320
Fail to do this,

860
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,700
and I will kill you.

861
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,240
Yes, Great Guidance.

862
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,740
What a sack.

863
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,520
It's not like one of those memes

864
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,940
that are traveling around now

865
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,860
telling people to kill each other and stuff.

866
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,880
Well, that's what Great Guidance was all about.

867
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,120
And Roman had already killed everybody in the world

868
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,240
except the small family of chumps,

869
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,320
you see, in the motion picture.

870
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,860
Yeah, that was...

871
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,120
He'd already done...

872
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,900
He'd already done most of it.

873
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,200
That was a tragic, tragic Bible story.

874
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,060
Great Guidance, I will kill these people,

875
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,800
but not the girl Alice.

876
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,680
That one I will keep for my experiments.

877
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:13,920
Yeah.

878
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,320
Who was Vincent Price actually talking to

879
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,020
when he was by the refrigerator there

880
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,620
and his eyes were all lit up

881
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,300
and it sounded like he was flat-slinged, too?

882
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,080
Just like his mom and dad were.

883
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,940
Who was the one who was taking that down

884
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,820
in probate court back in the 20s?

885
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,100
Yeah.

886
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,040
That's what I'm asking.

887
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,920
Some evil spirit hovering through fog and filthy air.

888
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,060
I think you got your Bible stories mixed up, Dave.

889
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,640
Yeah.

890
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,360
That was a different one.

891
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,420
Yeah.

892
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,220
Hey, dear, any of you good people know anything

893
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:52,180
about the market in human fat that flourished

894
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,180
just a few hundred years ago?

895
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:54,980
Fat, fat, fat.

896
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,260
Yes, it's very valuable.

897
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,100
It's demonized in the present time.

898
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,300
But you gotta have it.

899
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,360
If you don't have fat,

900
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,100
you'll become an Alzheimer's patient.

901
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,140
The human brain is made out of fat.

902
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,640
The sugar industry has made fat seem like a bad thing.

903
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,280
But fat doesn't even make you fat

904
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,180
unless you eat it with sugar.

905
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:14,520
That's not what he's talking about.

906
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,040
It was believed...

907
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,540
We're talking about fat.

908
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,920
It was actual human fat.

909
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,020
The sale of actual human fat,

910
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,620
just like people would sell their urine

911
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,380
as a fixative for licensees

912
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,540
and paranoid colors and stuff.

913
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,220
Executioners recovered the fat called

914
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,420
armsunderfat or armsunderschmutz

915
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:40,520
for the fat or grease of poor executed sinners.

916
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,380
Or people who were tortured in the Middle Ages,

917
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,640
as you can find out from reading Ivanhoe.

918
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,220
Their fat was often rendered down in the dungeon

919
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,800
and collected by the torturers.

920
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,380
It was often a major source of income,

921
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,080
I'm reading here, for some executioners.

922
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,080
Uh...

923
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,780
That's scary, but think about...

924
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,300
Think about how there were urine factories.

925
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,440
Hey, it says it's good for gout and bone pain.

926
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,780
Yes, fat is good all around for the body.

927
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,460
If it is not taken at the same time as sugar

928
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:17,000
and those carbohydrates which instantly turn into sugar

929
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,640
after having been consumed.

930
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:19,740
Hmm.

931
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,020
Now, does this explain the dietary supplements

932
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,800
in the 1890s and stuff, the fatiners?

933
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,720
Or is it a young woman who looks fairly normal

934
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,540
to the rest of us?

935
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,480
Because in those days, in around the 1890s,

936
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,680
it was really sexy to be, like, kind of a chubby.

937
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,540
Oh, I've got comic books with ads in there

938
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,440
about how you don't have to be skinny

939
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,380
and it shows a girl busting out of a bathing suit,

940
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,640
you know, and it says...

941
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,120
They had all these products, these called fatiners.

942
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:47,840
Yes.

943
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,280
And you'd eat them like ice cream

944
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,500
and I don't know what they would do.

945
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,480
Maybe they were like treacle or pudding or something

946
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,480
or sandwiches.

947
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,420
Well, I think it's sort of...

948
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,100
It's like Metri-Cal, you know,

949
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,960
that stuff that's supposed to make you thin.

950
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,220
Actually, if you constantly consume it,

951
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,440
you'll grow nice and fat and sassy.

952
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,000
Oh, absolutely.

953
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,000
Maybe, yeah.

954
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,500
And you become a calvinist, too.

955
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

956
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,300
Don't be sorry, Dave.

957
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,100
Two-ton Tessie tripping along the Midway,

958
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,060
the fattest thing in creation

959
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,780
and a sensation at the old Coney Island.

960
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,040
Across the nation, yeah.

961
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,620
At the old Coney Island,

962
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,300
but she had to retire.

963
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,660
In 1938.

964
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,720
But now, they don't have any freak shows

965
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,720
or anything like that in Coney Island.

966
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,680
I believe that it's all no longer PC.

967
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,780
Yeah, they've outlawed it even in Texas.

968
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,940
So how do those different folks make their money now?

969
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:47,840
They don't.

970
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:48,820
I guess they don't.

971
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,380
We accept you, we accept you.

972
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,780
Wards of the state.

973
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,600
Wards of the Puntang state

974
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,400
because they don't have any money.

975
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,720
The Romney people refused,

976
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,940
absolutely refused on a stack of unholy Bibles

977
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,180
to stop roaming around.

978
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,440
They'd like government in Czechoslovakia

979
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,420
would build like a village for them and say,

980
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,680
you're staying here and the name of this village

981
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,800
is Romney Village number 12 or something like that, you know?

982
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,020
And they'd say, oh man, I got to move.

983
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,700
And they'd load up the trucks

984
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,460
and a lot of small horse-sized caravans.

985
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,180
Caravans.

986
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,160
Caravans, yes.

987
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,360
Yeah, like the song.

988
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:33,160
Well, a caravan also refers to a vehicle

989
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,460
used by the Romney folk as they travel around.

990
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,920
There's the one wagon caravan and the two wagon

991
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,760
where the two wagons are joined together,

992
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,740
pulled by a team of horses,

993
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,740
as seen in the Universal Motion Picture

994
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,340
House of Frankenstein.

995
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,860
Professor Rampini's Circus of Horrors,

996
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:56,660
taken over by Boris Karloff, a hunchbacked assistant.

997
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,320
I actually played a gypsy feast when I was a young lad

998
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,800
in a rock and roll band.

999
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,180
It's strange how we acquired the gig.

1000
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,360
The head of the band, they were on their way to St. Anne's,

1001
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:12,040
which is in the Montreal, Quebec area there.

1002
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,100
And they make a yearly pilgrimage

1003
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,240
and their religion is real bizarre

1004
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,840
because it's real heavy iconography and everything.

1005
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,020
And you can't tell whether it's Catholic, Roman Catholic,

1006
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,060
or Greek Orthodox, or you can't tell what it is.

1007
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,840
It's just like...

1008
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,160
Romney Orthodox or some weird thing.

1009
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,660
It's robust.

1010
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,020
And they ate a whole sheep at this festival we played at.

1011
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,260
What did they do?

1012
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,560
They ate a whole sheep and a dog ate the paw.

1013
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:40,940
Well, I'm glad they saved something for man's best friend.

1014
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,800
Yep, that little big-eyed fella sitting by the fire

1015
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,400
deserved at least something,

1016
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,620
including the cloven hoof of a ruminant,

1017
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,100
a sheep-type critter.

1018
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,820
That's all I can say.

1019
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,420
That's all I can get out of it.

1020
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,180
There's restaurants in areas near where I live

1021
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,560
named after the cloven-hoofed one.

1022
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,280
And I'm like, man, how come you said

1023
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,860
that was a cloven-hoofed thing and so forth?

1024
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:08,860
What is it?

1025
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,380
Is that back to the Church of the Subgenius

1026
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,520
why a goat mantra?

1027
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,100
No, why not a goat?

1028
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,600
And are not fed, as John Milton says.

1029
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,500
No, they are cloven-hoofed creatures, certainly.

1030
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,620
We know that for sure.

1031
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,700
Just like the pig, man.

1032
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,700
John Milton's other best friend.

1033
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,240
Oh, I see.

1034
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,000
A pig's hard to ride, too.

1035
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,620
It's hard to get a saddle on them and...

1036
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,060
They'll be cooperative if you treat them well.

1037
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,620
Make America goat again.

1038
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,000
Yes.

1039
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,200
I've got a T-shirt that says that.

1040
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,080
It comes from the goat ranch.

1041
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:45,780
No, recently.

1042
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,300
Greatest of all time ranch.

1043
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,980
Some of our listeners will know when this is and where it was,

1044
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:55,040
but some atheists tried to set up a huge statue

1045
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,820
of the goat-headed goat.

1046
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:56,820


1047
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,200
It was a great baphomet

1048
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,980
when they had posted the Ten Commandments

1049
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,560
in a public location.

1050
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,580
Did you follow that?

1051
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,980
Yeah, I think they did it.

1052
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,640
This great statue, this great bronze statue

1053
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,780
with a plaque and a pedestal,

1054
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:17,720
and it caused the good Christian folks to freak out.

1055
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,300
The movie about that, Dr. Howell,

1056
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,420
is why J.R. Bob-Dob's In the Church of the Subgenius

1057
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,220
was not shown at Cannes.

1058
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,380
No, what's a huge one in Colorado?

1059
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,360
Yeah, the Aspen Film Festival.

1060
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,760
The quaking Aspen.

1061
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,800
Well, you know which one.

1062
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,780
The most famous film festival in the world.

1063
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:41,800
Telluride?

1064
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:43,640
Telegraph?

1065
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,100
No, no.

1066
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,700
Even the biggest one of all.

1067
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,800
That's why I can't remember it.

1068
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,040
Well, it's not Aspen, and it's not Telluride.

1069
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,140
Well, it's whatever it was,

1070
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,100
so that kept the subgeniuses from...

1071
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,680
We want to get it in.

1072
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,200
We want to get it in.

1073
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,560
I'm trying to remember.

1074
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,780
Anyway, it didn't get in.

1075
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,480
It was because the Church of Satan documentary

1076
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,880
had been also entered,

1077
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,200
and they didn't want to have two church of documentaries,

1078
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,240
and Satan had a bigger name than Bob,

1079
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,400
at least with these film festival credits.

1080
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,940
Well, at least it's a longer name,

1081
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,060
because Bob's just B-O-B,

1082
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,880
and Satan has four letters in it.

1083
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,360
Well, the movie title, actually, is long and clumsy.

1084
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,200
J.R. Bob-Dob's In the Church of the Subgenius.

1085
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,300
The Church of the Subgenius.

1086
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,200
But it beats Slacking to Bethlehem.

1087
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,800
Boy, it sure does.

1088
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,920
What a relief it was that that wasn't used.

1089
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:38,400
And as printed, as written on a sign,

1090
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,560
it could say J.R. Bob-Dob's in huge letters,

1091
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,780
and then in little tiny letters,

1092
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,480
and then Church of the Subgenius in big letters under that.

1093
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,460
It would look just fine on a marquee.

1094
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,740
Have you seen the posters, Hal?

1095
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,000
The ones that have...

1096
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,120
You mean...

1097
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,900
The one that Paul Mavridis made?

1098
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,080
No, no.

1099
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,140
That one's terrible,

1100
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,860
and I've told that to Paul myself.

1101
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,540
Did you look at it on a phone?

1102
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,740
No, I looked at it on a great big screen.

1103
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:14,360
So you did see the large-size version of that.

1104
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,860
I didn't think it was terrible at all.

1105
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,300
I'm talking about the one that used...

1106
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:25,420
It's the painting done by a street artist in Bangkok.

1107
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,120
That was...

1108
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:26,740
For a dollar.

1109
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,900
That was the beginning of it, yes.

1110
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,660
It was an elaboration on that image.

1111
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,040
It's the worst portrait of Bob there is.

1112
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,960
Well, you see, by the weakest link in the chain,

1113
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,760
we must stand or fall.

1114
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,040
Well, anyway...

1115
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,620
I keep on wondering why nobody ever wants to use

1116
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,920
my revolutionary period communist posters

1117
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,640
from the Russian Revolution.

1118
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:47,660
They did.

1119
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,140
They made millions of bucks off of those, Dave.

1120
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,160
Didn't you get royalties?

1121
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,800
God, are you a chump?

1122
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,420
Well...

1123
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,000
Well, they said something was...

1124
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,140
It's going to be on its way soon,

1125
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,420
but they kept on referring to it

1126
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,160
like a person who was gagging on food.

1127
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,500
Well, you saw him, right?

1128
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,980
Somebody got something stuck in their throat.

1129
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,160
That was your prize.

1130
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,340
That was my pride.

1131
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:07,900
Yeah.

1132
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,240
Pride goeth before a fall.

1133
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,560
No, the poster, the last poster I saw,

1134
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,640
is black and white,

1135
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:19,500
and it's got the right half of Bob's face

1136
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,920
on the left side of the poster

1137
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,260
and the left side of Bob's face

1138
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,460
on the right side of the poster.

1139
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,720
With the pipe all mixed up and turned around?

1140
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,100
No.

1141
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:26,100


1142
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:26,100


1143
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:26,260
No, no.

1144
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,240
If you put two posters together,

1145
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,280
you get a great big job in the middle.

1146
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,500
They match perfectly.

1147
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,540
It's kind of clever.

1148
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,160
Hit the neighborhood with the pasteboard

1149
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,860
and put it all up and down the fences.

1150
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:38,380
Yeah.

1151
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,160
The triumvirate of Bob.

1152
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,040
But, uh...

1153
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,400
Psycho-technical morning.

1154
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,320
What about that strange realistico Bob

1155
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,380
that showed up,

1156
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,960
the actual physical, fleshy, middle-aged Bob

1157
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,560
that some people were embracing a while back

1158
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,000
and...

1159
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,720
And...

1160
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,100
And...

1161
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:56,100


1162
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:56,100


1163
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:56,100


1164
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:56,100


1165
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:56,100


1166
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,740
And using his navel as a place

1167
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,220
to store the salt for the salary.

1168
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,440
They were junking the old Bob,

1169
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,580
although there were some who said,

1170
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,080
I like the old Bob.

1171
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,340
But one thing about it is

1172
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,060
they found the actual guy,

1173
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,420
and it was exactly the way it was described

1174
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,840
in the book of the subgenius,

1175
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,600
a terrifying occurrence.

1176
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,840
And he was fleshy.

1177
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,120
He was kind of like a back-slapping Rotarian guy.

1178
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:24,300
And they had arbitrarily cut off Bob's chin

1179
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,100
just to make the famous subgenius

1180
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,700
glyph, but once the rest of the body was restored,

1181
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,620
he was a rather solid fellow

1182
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,820
with more than one chin.

1183
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,420
Dr. Howell, by coincidence,

1184
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,600
the listeners of this station

1185
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,120
will be hearing us discuss that Bob next week

1186
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,080
from an hour of slack two years ago

1187
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,760
done at Wisteria during X-Day

1188
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,820
that never was...

1189
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,200
Well, I forgot a lot of that stuff when we moved.

1190
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,000
And I recently...

1191
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,960
I recently rediscovered it.

1192
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,500
Oh, good.

1193
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,300
When we're gone for X-Day,

1194
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,280
everybody can hear all these X-Day reruns

1195
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,160
from two years ago that aren't reruns.

1196
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,020
Nobody's ever heard.

1197
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,840
It's a treasure trove.

1198
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,640
And they're really funny,

1199
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,440
but there's a long discussion of that.

1200
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,080
The photo...

1201
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,920
The pre-Dobbshead photo of a man

1202
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,100
that became the Dobbshead we used.

1203
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,680
Who posed for clothing ads and everything,

1204
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,200
just like in the Church of the Subgenius.

1205
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:25,140
Now, is Philo one of these discussors

1206
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:25,680
of the...

1207
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,700
the strange photo, Bob?

1208
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,960
No, that was...

1209
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,460
It was you, me, and Onan.

1210
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,480
And I confess that for the first two years,

1211
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,120
I refused to even think about it or look at it,

1212
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:37,840
which is true.

1213
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:38,720
Too disturbing.

1214
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,860
And someone made a GIF.

1215
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,920
What does GIF stand for?

1216
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:44,700
Do you know what I'm saying?

1217
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,140
A graphic...

1218
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,220
It's just a format.

1219
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,680
A graphic image format.

1220
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,920
Well, you know, like in that Bugs Bunny cartoon

1221
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,860
about duck season, rabbit season,

1222
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,080
duck season, rabbit season,

1223
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,580
they replaced the two,

1224
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,460
the duck and rabbit posters with the two bobs,

1225
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,440
so they're tearing down first the old bob,

1226
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,200
then the new bob,

1227
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,780
and behind it there's the old bob,

1228
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,000
and behind it there's the new bob.

1229
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,260
Yes, it's on a telephone pole.

1230
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,340
Paul Marfretti's did that, I think.

1231
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,900
What about all the Daffy Ducks looking bobs

1232
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,100
that suck around the neighborhood?

1233
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,540
They got, like, playing, smoking cigars

1234
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:14,800
and making jokes and...

1235
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,680
Out of luck.

1236
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,060
Out of luck.

1237
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,580
But, of course, we have to bobify everything

1238
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:20,520
in the neighborhood.

1239
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,120
That's easier to do now with those...

1240
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,300
pipe...

1241
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:25,660
pipe...

1242
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:25,660


1243
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:25,660


1244
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:25,660


1245
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:25,660


1246
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:25,660


1247
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,080
stickers that Fyre invented.

1248
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,180
You just stick a pipe on something

1249
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,040
and it's art, as we used to say.

1250
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,020
Well, now everybody can do it.

1251
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,020
It's within reach of...

1252
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:37,160
And now all 50 states have an additional variety, too,

1253
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,900
that you can vaporize on your forehead,

1254
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,320
or you can use little cheese modules

1255
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,640
that are stuck in your ear,

1256
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,660
kind of like a bob ball,

1257
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,740
like a bob, bob, bob, bob, bob.

1258
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,040
Oh, those things overheat.

1259
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,380
Those, you can get brain damage.

1260
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,800
You don't want anything overheating by your brain.

1261
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,600
You don't want incendiary in your ear hairs, you know.

1262
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:54,540
No.

1263
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:54,920
No.

1264
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,220
No.

1265
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:55,280
No.

1266
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:55,440
No.

1267
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:55,660
No.

1268
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:55,660


1269
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:55,660


1270
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:55,660


1271
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:55,660


1272
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:55,660


1273
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:55,660


1274
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:55,660


1275
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:55,660


1276
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,420
Poor guy Roknar,

1277
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,980
he was our first guinea pig with that.

1278
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:00,980
He volunteered.

1279
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,940
Yeah, he volunteered.

1280
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,560
Let's not wallow in sadness about it.

1281
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,380
He volunteered for all kinds of stuff.

1282
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:05,640
Yes.

1283
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,480
It was really dumb.

1284
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,060
Yes.

1285
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,180
Well, he was, you see, a cheerful volunteer.

1286
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,840
He was cannon fodder for the subgenius war.

1287
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,240
A soldier for Bob.

1288
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,500
And we need many more.

1289
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,240
Yes, we need the ranks to fill,

1290
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,740
and we need to send them into battle

1291
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,960
from our comfortable redoubt.

1292
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:25,180
Yeah.

1293
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:25,180


1294
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,360
I'd love to be out there in the field with you men,

1295
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,780
but they need me here.

1296
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,280
And these nose beads keep me on my back.

1297
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,000
Besides, my doctor says I have to have my feet elevated above my head at all times.

1298
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,040
I've got bone spurs.

1299
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,040
I've got bone spurs.

1300
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:39,640
I can't go.

1301
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,260
I can't.

1302
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,000
I've got bone spurs on my bone spurs.

1303
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,700
Men, I salute you.

1304
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,880
This is a wonderful time for you, and women, too.

1305
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:54,140
Go on out over the trench as soon as I blow the whistle and wipe out those pinks.

1306
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:54,640
Amen.

1307
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,160
Amen.

1308
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,380
Praise God.

1309
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,060
We'll be carrying our tooth powders with us in our jolly duffel bags,

1310
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,380
and we'll have, like, a bunch of postcards home to mom to visit dear old mother.

1311
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,380
Yes, we've prepared those in advance.

1312
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:10,220
And a whole bunch of dear John letters waiting for us with the next shipment.

1313
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,820
Well, uh...

1314
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,320
Unfortunately, that's the truest...

1315
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,440
That's the truest value of the whole engorgement.

1316
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:20,340
And what about Pope Perot over in Europe,

1317
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,980
now no longer as powerful as before,

1318
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,900
uh, waving his little paws,

1319
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,660
impotent to stop the carnage.

1320
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:28,700
I found a

1321
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,600
big string of

1322
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,800
Popero

1323
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,380
posters. Popero posters

1324
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,860
in the X-Day stuff I was sorting

1325
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,000
today. Does it mean like

1326
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,080
Pope doggy? Because I'm kind of out of this

1327
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,760
one a little bit. If you don't mind

1328
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,940
telling me. It's not poop dog.

1329
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,920
Pope dog. There was

1330
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,380
a foul-tempered little

1331
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,720
dog owned by

1332
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,920
a subgenius

1333
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,440
minister in Germany.

1334
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,380
With a prognathous lower jaw.

1335
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,600
And a

1336
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,680
one of the weekends

1337
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,600
that lower teeth snapping.

1338
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:03,680
Yes.

1339
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,480
The black coat.

1340
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,080
That's why they say

1341
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,920
and then they say

1342
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,260
you know what that means in German. When you say hi

1343
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,020
to somebody you go

1344
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,960
and they say

1345
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,940
the

1346
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:20,440
that means the same thing as

1347
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,200
Pendejo. It doesn't mean friend.

1348
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,960
They're making fun of you.

1349
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,840
Well, well, well, we're just talking about etymology here.

1350
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,320
I never have had any friends.

1351
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,420
Yes, not in the German

1352
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,920
nation. Anyway, the little dog

1353
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,820
Pero, who is a Spanish dog.

1354
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,520
A little grey schnauzer, yes.

1355
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,480
He was made Pope of

1356
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,300
Germany

1357
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,760
because of the

1358
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,700
failure of the black

1359
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,600
Pope to

1360
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,820
you know

1361
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,920
show up at all

1362
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,880
for a whole day.

1363
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:53,780
Two leaders.

1364
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,380
Yes, probably.

1365
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,920
Demotion in the church of the subgenius

1366
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,880
can be instantaneous and final.

1367
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,680
There's one of the slogans of the church is

1368
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,540
don't follow Pope Black.

1369
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,520
That was.

1370
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,840
Oh, he was the guy who's had the funnel cake wagon

1371
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,980
at the same time he was selling all this religious

1372
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,940
rumorage and all these false doctrines, right?

1373
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,660
Well, he did. No, he did a lot of really good work

1374
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,540
for the church of the subgenius.

1375
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,780
It's just that he also caused some terrible problems.

1376
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,540
He's kind of like the Martin Luther of.

1377
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,560
Yeah, I got you.

1378
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,920
He was a subgenius.

1379
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,940
What can we say?

1380
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,120
What can we say to us personally?

1381
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,760
That's why his papal crown was given to little

1382
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,020
Pugnacious Pope Pedro.

1383
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:37,880
Yeah.

1384
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,080
Yeah.

1385
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:40,640
Yeah.

1386
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:45,140
I've been leaving those little Pope Pedro pictures in in the

1387
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:51,760
those sweat lodges, those big blue plastic sweat

1388
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,200
lodges lined up.

1389
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,500
I do not want to play this kind of music that's being played

1390
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,660
right now in a sweat lodge because it can make it can make

1391
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,780
too much conversation.

1392
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,240
Because if you're trying to focus on getting out of off the

1393
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,140
reservation somehow.

1394
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,320
These are solo sweat lodges.

1395
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,040
One person.

1396
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,180
There's room for one person to sit down and you have to be

1397
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,540
careful because there's a hole in it.

1398
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,560
One and a half actually.

1399
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,420
Who knows what lurks beneath?

1400
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:18,640
Actually.

1401
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,740
The children of old Sequa, perhaps.

1402
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:22,300
Oh.

1403
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:26,160
It could be or other dire creatures.

1404
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,040
How?

1405
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,300
You haven't heard the news.

1406
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:33,180
Are the paleontologists subgenius has been studying those infants,

1407
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:37,900
those snapping turtle juveniles that have been showing up in the

1408
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:43,200
pond in old Sequa's pond, which is how we, we, you know,

1409
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,800
learned originally that the old Sequa is female.

1410
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:51,740
But he's he took a closer look at him and did some tests and he

1411
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:52,060
says.

1412
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:58,120
No, those are actually just ordinary mutated snapping turtles.

1413
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,920
But moreover, Dr.

1414
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:07,420
Howell, moreover, old Sequa is not, in fact, old.

1415
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,960
That is the juvenile.

1416
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,420
Indeed, the infant.

1417
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:19,460
When the when the parent of what we call old Sequa rises, there will be earthquakes

1418
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,960
infecting all of us.

1419
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:21,220
Oh.

1420
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:22,920
Would you feel something?

1421
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,080
Oh, my goodness.

1422
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:24,660
Oh, my God.

1423
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,020
It's like, could it be a tremor?

1424
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,680
Well, coincidence.

1425
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:32,020
It would be over seven skyscrapers tall.

1426
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,460
Yes.

1427
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,300
He's a big one.

1428
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:34,720
All right.

1429
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,120
No, she.

1430
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:35,720
She.

1431
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:36,100
Yes.

1432
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:41,120
And then there's the Loveland frogmen, another cryptid species from Ohio.

1433
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:47,600
They could erupt out of the ground and create chaos and disruption.

1434
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,360
We're reprinting that.

1435
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,120
We had a point.

1436
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,860
Or monsters of America.

1437
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:52,280
Gave us a point.

1438
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:52,880
We're going to have to get them down this year.

1439
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:53,480
Oh, good.

1440
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:53,780
Yeah.

1441
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,740
But all these earthquakes are not the problem.

1442
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,500
There was a four point earthquake just last week in the Cleveland area, four miles out

1443
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,180
into the lake.

1444
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:06,840
And I think it's strange that people made any mention of that.

1445
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,760
Somebody claimed to see a gigantic head as if the head of a dinosaur.

1446
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:16,140
Or they actually said it was a bit like Mitch McConnell.

1447
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,300
A kind of a turtle-like.

1448
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:18,880
Yeah.

1449
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,400
He's a turtle guy.

1450
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,400
He knows the handshakes, that's for sure.

1451
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,100
If that's all you have to know.

1452
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:35,480
Oh, Dave, it's 10 o'clock, which means it's the end of this hour of slack.

1453
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:36,520
Yeah.

1454
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,320
Howsoever.

1455
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,620
Do you know where your children are?

1456
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:46,280
I can check on the GPS tag I have on them.

1457
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:46,300
Yeah, okay.

1458
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:46,620
See how-

1459
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:47,820
But anyway, yeah.

1460
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,160
But don't go away.

1461
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:55,420
Not that any of you had the ability to do so, dear listeners.

1462
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,260
Or I'm sorry, yeah.

1463
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:03,320
Because Dr. Sinister's show is coming up and it's going to include-

1464
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:03,960
Filled with slack.

1465
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,260
When should Dave come?

1466
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:06,900
I'm so kidding.

1467
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,500
I mean, how do you guys want to do it?

1468
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,280
Do you want to just keep rolling?

1469
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:11,500
We could.

1470
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,860
Don't you have some sort of-

1471
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,460
I see no reason not to.

1472
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,180
I do have to say this one thing.

1473
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,640
You're listening to this station.

1474
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,140
Okay.

1475
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:20,140


1476
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:20,140


1477
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:20,140


1478
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:20,140


1479
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:20,140


1480
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,320
Now we're fine.

1481
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,600
We keep you legal for less.

1482
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:28,560
I have to insert a thing that says, this station for the other station.

1483
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,920
And you can't give off the call letters of some other station.

1484
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,860
That's definitely against all the regs.

1485
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:38,100
Yeah, I have to be careful with that kind of thing because-

1486
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,240
That's on your broadcast license.

1487
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:41,600
Do you have a broadcast license?

1488
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:42,120
Yeah, really?

1489
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:42,200
You have to know who you're speaking for.

1490
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,260
Yeah, so you better believe I do.

1491
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,160
It's on mine.

1492
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:49,660
It says, never, never, never give off the call letters of a different station when your

1493
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:49,780
broadcasting.

1494
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:54,580
And yet, I know people who do that all the time.

1495
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:55,660
And you know what else?

1496
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:03,140
I've been doing this for, like I think my first time on the air was in late 2001.

1497
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,280
Uh-huh.

1498
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,900
Never once was personally licensed by the FCC.

1499
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,920
The station has an FCC license.

1500
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,180
So I think the regulations have changed since the golden age.

1501
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:19,000
No, I think they've been the same since about 2000, since about the mid-90s even.

1502
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:19,640
Yeah.

1503
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:23,460
And a lot of the actual performance things, you know, and stuff like that.

1504
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,000
Anyway, friends, this show is over.

1505
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,240
I could lose my license for this.

1506
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:30,320
And you've been listening to the Hour of Slack, number 1,735.
