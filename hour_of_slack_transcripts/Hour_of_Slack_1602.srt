Perfect.

Special.

28

Cheered.

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,140

Easy.

Ultimate.

32

Quicker.

38
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,420
And much more.

39
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:20,500
Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not

40
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:28,220
going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.

41
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:35,880
No, I'm going to compress it all into just this one intensive total rerun show, except

42
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,760
that actually it's not.

43
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:47,360
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,720
and holy days and the hole-in-head days, as it is for some people.

45
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,100
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of salad.

46
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,340
Selling.

47
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,140
Selling.

48
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,440
Yes.

49
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:05,560
Oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.

50
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,380
But anyway, happy whatever you do.

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,360
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.

52
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,400
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmus and Guitar Axmus.

53
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,540
It's cool, man.

54
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Cool.

55
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,840
And praise Bob and the whole world.

56
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,480
Oh.

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:33,600


58
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:57,560
I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong and stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree.

59
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,920
That's the English translation of the lyrics for our Q&A and it was ê°™ì•„ìš” .

60
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,020
I really enjoyed this song because it caught you walkingcio specifically into this panorama

61
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,840
Ch Baldur Du B father.

62
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,060


63
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,620
This is my don't have to be a student to go Bilbao7 face slop eBay.

64
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,980
My mom does because that has outside of myives angle, vnity and turtleneye are real.

65
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,060
I don't know that my mom is shit, but that really is why I posted this diary on Instagram

66
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,560
as well, because I remembered to say hat and his best friend who's entire break in the

67
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,100
country.

68
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,780
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree

69
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,500
When this angel heard

70
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:49,240
A dreadful fear went right into my heart

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,140
Those pine tree needles sting me

72
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,360
Ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-ding-dong

73
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,680
You'll never know how much that smarts

74
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,800
So who put the stump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp

75
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,460
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong

76
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,420
Who stood the wood where I boop-sheep-boop-sheep-boop

77
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,140
Who put the stick up my hip-a-dip-a-dip

78
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,920
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush

79
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,120
He made this angel beg for mercy, please

80
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,480
Too tight, too tight

81
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,900
Too tight, too tight

82
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,600
And I'm gonna say to you

83
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,620
It's already 9 p.m.

84
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,720
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him

85
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Don't go walking down to the bar

86
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,640
Cause old Frankie died last night in the backyard

87
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,880
I mean, I'm gonna park my store and look at the credits

88
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,460
And in the right

89
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,720
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?

90
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,520
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw, yeah

91
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,300
And I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells

92
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,240
Till I get to bed

93
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,920
I have chainsaw fixed and back in my arm the way it was Tuesday

94
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,400
Now you boys be good and I'll give you some of this here

95
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,440
Apple mango pie

96
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,580
You ain't no good of a child

97
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,520
That dog's running off with them brain cells

98
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,080
Can you do something about that, boy?

99
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,500
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to

100
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,300

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000


159
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,880
But still possible king

160
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,200
And this is my christmasness

161
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,200


162
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,480
Christmas

163
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:22,680
Where do you get them?

164
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:22,680


165
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:22,680


166
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:22,680


167
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,620
Oh my god!

168
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,260
Christmas

169
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,680
Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.

170
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,860
He's like a cowboy Santa.

171
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,440
How jolly.

172
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,640
Oh, Jazz is giving,

173
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,420
gives Dave the show pills.

174
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,580
Boy, I really need one of those.

175
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,120
What am I going to do about Laundromat and his suit, though?

176
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,380
I need the show bath.

177
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,540
The show de-lousing.

178
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,300
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones.

179
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,060
That's enough of that.

180
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,740
Oh, he's got headphones.

181
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,980
I also have the part of my pancreas

182
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,360
that I'd like to show you now.

183
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,680
It's been increased in size to...

184
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,460
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.

185
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,480
Look, it's swelling.

186
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,280
I actually have the capability of a man

187
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,560
with 190 IQ's brain.

188
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,020
I'll put more pills out for everybody.

189
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,040
Oh, those pills.

190
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,720
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.

191
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,760
And my brain feel like it's a puddle

192
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,360
of liquefied crap.

193
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,420
I'm shocked by the...

194
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,300
The red pills are really good.

195
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,840
I like to take the red one and the blue one

196
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,560
at the same time.

197
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,700
That way you go in and out.

198
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,840
The warp mix is easy.

199
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,840
It's so high, you can't go over it.

200
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,160
Angels we have heard on high

201
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,460
Singing about mountains

202
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,580
And those mountains in reply

203
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,720
Sing about mountains in reply

204
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:52,720


205
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:52,720


206
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:52,720


207
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,480
Like then we wish we had some too

208
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,080
Who are you?

209
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
Oh oh oh oh ooh

210
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,040
Oh oh, a warrior

211
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,900
In excelsis deo

212
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,620
Oh oh oh ooh

213
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,480
Oh oh oh ooh

214
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,080
Oh, a warrior

215
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,340
In excelsis deo

216
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,280
In excelsis deo

217
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,820
Sam's Cr Heidi

218
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,380
to Your Boyfriend

219
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,700
and to every artist

220
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,220
before y'all

221
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,280
ever get anywhere

222
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,280


223
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,320
before y'all

224
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,700
saUT

225
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:22,700


226
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:22,700


227
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,700
the X

228
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,660
Barbie Dolls

229
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,100
Women rape and memorialize their lives by role-playing with Barbie.

230
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,540
Barbie Dolls

231
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:53,120
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

232
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,640
It will empower this resistance.

233
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:05,640
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.

234
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,260
It will be a baller for kids.

235
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:22,760
But how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

236
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,240
Good has lots of muscles.

237
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,380
Good. Good!

238
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,380
The primitive Earth societies should accept this value judgment.

239
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:40,100
Good will have great physical attributes according to human desires.

240
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,980
Sexual desires.

241
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,600
Latent in children.

242
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:53,560
Brought out through the vehicle of this so-called farmacle.

243
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,200
This place is a church.

244
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,920
Better is not good.

245
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,460
She's new. From Kenner.

246
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,600
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

247
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,600
We must buy our toys!

248
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,760
Uh, yes.

249
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,120
Uh.

250
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,080
The old subject.

251
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,020
Genius toy marketing scheme.

252
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,900
Uh, recorded there at Dockstock 1984.

253
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,840
And me and Palmer Veedies.

254
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,480
Um, Angels We Have Heard on High.

255
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,740
It was by the Philistines.

256
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:32,200
Uh, the collage called All the Money You've Got is from the great Obtuse Christmas collage album,

257
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,600
which you can get for free.

258
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:40,080
Get this, um, check out this website, obtuse.iu.com.

259
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,280
I-M-A dot com.

260
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,540
That's obtuse.

261
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,480
Excuse me.

262
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,680
Ah, yes.

263
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,400
And next up, The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

264
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,240
Uh.

265
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,080
Uh.

266
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,500
Uh.

267
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,460
Once upon a time, there was the baby Jesus.

268
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,960
And he had two eyes made out of coal.

269
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,080
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.

270
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,760
And he wanted his two front teeth.

271
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,860
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.

272
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,300
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper.

273
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,820
And he took all the presents from Whoville.

274
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,620
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys.

275
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,340
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy.

276
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,540
But he couldn't.

277
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,340
He wanted tens and twenties.

278
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,840
Tens and twenties.

279
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,500
And he's, and he, he got McDonald's gift certificates.

280
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,320
And he got Zuzu's pedals.

281
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,860
And that's the real story of Christmas.

282
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,640
Iml poss ê±°ì£  to say hi.

283
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:19,680
Huguett Basqu'il saysì£¼ì„¸ìš” onÓš

284
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:19,840
Thank you.

285
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,340
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da

286
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,480
So separate, so separate, so separate

287
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,240
You from Tunker

288
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,700
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob

289
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,280
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal

290
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,540
Shut up, pink boy!

291
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,060
No way, I'll never sell out to the conspiracy

292
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,100
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien tool

293
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,800
Bob Dobbs comes with rocket pipe, head launcher, jayner device, all your cockatism

294
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,500
A fightin' Jesus and other action figures sold separately

295
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,140
Some assembly required, batteries not included

296
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,320
This toy falls apart in three days

297
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,980
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe

298
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,400
Too much is always better than not enough

299
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,460
From Bob Dobbs

300
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,560
Gorgeous secrets can blow from head to toe

301
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,200
Drawing everything you see here

302
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,260
Ken Dowsell separately

303
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,180
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message

304
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,940
Santa Claus

305
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,020
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas

306
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,180
He wanted an electric train

307
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,360
He had the whole thing on his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up

308
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,380
Santa Claus

309
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,140
Santa Claus

310
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:42,680
Santa Claus

311
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,560
He would dream so hard that the whole thing would come to life right before his eyes

312
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,520
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher

313
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,320
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy looking train set with locomotives and freight cars.

314
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,420
The station and the gateman.

315
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,320
The mortar tower and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.

316
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,240
So grand that you might think Tommy was waiting for something that just didn't exist.

317
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,360
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.

318
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,700
It is turnover.

319
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,260
The time of the year when all things sell.

320
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,800
The end of the year sale.

321
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,380
So come and get it everyone and just buy our products.

322
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,220
I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

323
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,660
Are we celebrating the day?

324
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,600
Birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

325
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,920
Well that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

326
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,700
But the present subgenie try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now.

327
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,580
And sell everything to the pigs.

328
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,760
Oh yes.

329
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,560
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

330
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,860
And it was something else in between there.

331
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,220
Before it was, after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season.

332
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,680
It was something else.

333
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,580
But I think he started.

334
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,440
He started a war over it.

335
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:43,860
Yeah.

336
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah.

337
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,380
Yeah.

338
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:12,820


339
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,220
And I've had extra sense

340
00:16:46,140 --> 00:17:12,800
I've had extra sense

341
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,800
I've had extra sense

00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,800
I've had extra sense

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:42,540
I've had extra sense

344
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:54,420
I've had extra sense

345
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:27,140
I've had extra sense

346
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,500
I've had extra sense

347
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,780
I've had extra sense

348
00:20:42,820 --> 00:21:12,480
I've had extra sense

349
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,800
I've had extra sense

350
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,800
I've had extra sense

351
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:42,800
I've had extra sense

352
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,320
I've had extra sense

353
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,260
I've had extra sense

354
00:23:53,040 --> 00:24:12,800
I've had extra sense

355
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:29,780
I've had extra sense

356
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,060
I've done my seems

357
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,500
I've done my sensory

Slides laser

363
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,460
It's my first time

364
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,140
Who's the head man?

365
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,540
Santa Claus

366
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,480
Santa Claus

367
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,340
He was a huge beastly

368
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,040
bulging man

369
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,960
He was so real

370
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,040
How come we didn't get squat last year?

371
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,900
Yes, the birth of the baby Satan

372
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,220
on

373
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,760
July 4th

00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,980
And now you can have it all

The birth of our baby Satan

378
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,700
as told by various authors

379
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,760
and eclectic scholars from around

including that announcer

382

00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,740
blessed anointment and birthday

385
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,220
of our Lord

386
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,340
Zeus

387
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,020
Praises

388
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,720
for

389
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,040
one

390
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,960
bright Christmas morning

391
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,460
was born

392
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,440
in a cradle

393
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,560
to a rich man's family

394
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,700
Oh, I know the rave Jesus

395
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,600
I'm part with the rave Jesus

396
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,340
Have yourself

397
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,820
a merry little Christmas

398
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,420
Have yourself

399
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,200

400
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,500
Merry little Christmaaaace

401
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,300
Let your sight

402
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,140
be light

403
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,480
from the harder

404
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,460
troubles

405
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,360
will be

406
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,920
out of sight

407

On a miles away

418
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,540
Once a day as in olden

419
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,220
Say happy golden

420
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,440
Be miles apart

421
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,780
Let your heart

422
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,800
Be out of sight

423
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,040
Out of sight

424
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,800
The Jackson Five

425
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,000
Wish everybody

426
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,560
A crystal merry Christmas

427
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,640
And a gloopy gloopy day

428
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,720
From Mutated Christmas, friends,

429
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:34,040
the Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas by No-L.

430
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,700
No-L.

431
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,820
No-L.

432
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:42,320
Before that, some year old ESO and Michael Shelley did that real story of Christmas

433
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,040
from the Tarkin Records All-Star Holiday Extravaganza.

434
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,140
I'm playing a lot from that.

435
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,140
So check out www.triage.com for that one also.

436
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,480
The Tarkin Records is also on www.triage.com.

437
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,980
And now, the Jethro's.

438
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,680
1, 2, 3, 4.

439
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:05,880
Go!

440
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:08,900
.

441
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,240
.

442
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,480
.

443
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:39,760
. .

444
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,260
. . . . .

445
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:58,100
. . . . . . .

446
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:58,480
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

448
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,240
Redrum, Stang.

449
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,460
The Weirbobs and Ima,

450
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,500
those who have the psychosis that convinces them

451
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,940
that they are the Santa Bob.

452
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,820
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.

453
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,500
And they go shuffling through the snow

454
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,120
on their nameless, hideous errands.

455
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,780
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus

456
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,520
and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

457
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,000
They stop using the locks of their doors

458
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,740
and they just kind of float into the keyhole.

459
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,240
Oh, friends, it's tough.

460
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,140
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.

461
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,580
You gotta send your money to the Santa Bob.

462
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,500
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me

463
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,560
told their kids that Santa Claus

464
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,720
bills them for the toys he brings.

465
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,680
Can you believe that?

466
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,660
The kids were asking if their parents,

467
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,520
maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.

468
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,820
And the mom said, no, no, he won't

469
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,240
because he bills us.

470
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,260
We can't afford that.

471
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,160
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.

472
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,980
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

473
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,160
Let's see.

474
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,540
Oh.

475
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,440
Oh.

476
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:57,840


477
00:31:59,340 --> 00:31:59,340


478
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,020
Oh.

479
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,180


480
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,080
Oh.

481
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,260
Oh.

482
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:01,260


483
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:01,520
Oh.

484
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:02,920
Oh.

485
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,640
Oh.

486
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,660
Oh.

487
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:13,800


488
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:13,800


489
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,400
Oh, boy, too.

490
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,140
Oh.

491
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,800
Oh.

492
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,280
Oh.

493
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:16,660
Oh.

494
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:16,960
Oh.

495
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,680
Oh.

496
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,980
Oh.

497
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,860
Oh.

498
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:21,500


499
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,660
And, uh, amazing.

500
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,860
More from Corporal Blossom.

501
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,520
I am really impressed by their editing work.

502
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,200
And that's on...

503
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:52,460
Corporal Blossom and the Mutated Christmas is on the Illegal Art label.

504
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,260
That's www.detritus.net

505
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,360
slash illegal art.

506
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,920
www.detritus.net

507
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,940
slash illegal art.

508
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,140
And now, more Jethro's.

509
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,880
www.detritus.net

510
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,000
Now you're blaming Jesus.

511
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,140
You're blaming our Lord.

512
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,480
I sort of understand because...

513
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,780
I understood the way any old fool would understand.

514
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,940
There was no Jesus.

515
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,140
No flatulent old woman waving her panties on the hill.

516
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,320
It's not that you don't want to.

517
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,720
It's that they won't let you.

518
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,620
No, there's just a crime in wilderness.

519
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,360
They're ashamed.

520
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,820
And the hot pursuit of wolves everywhere in the back.

521
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,540
I'm ashamed of them.

522
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,780
It's cold.

523
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,580
I'm leaving that city life behind.

524
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,080
I can't get my finger off the paper.

525
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,040
I can't get my noodle back in the pan, Jen.

526
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,180
Come on, cowboy.

527
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,460
No, man.

528
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,380
I was trying to hear a can against this here tree.

529
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,640
And it started whispering to me, man.

530
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,120
Oh, you've been drinking.

531
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,240
There's the face of Madonna right up there.

532
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,780
There's the face of Virgin Mary.

533
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
I swear to God, look at it.

534
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:51,880
Isn't it?

535
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,200
What?

536
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,720
It's her.

537
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,260
It's your Christmas witch coming true.

538
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:55,840
It is.

539
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:55,840


540
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,900
A Christmas witch?

541
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,900
I'll be whole.

542
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,800
Oh, my God.

543
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,300
Yeah, I guess it does look a little bit more witchy than angelic.

544
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,280
I know she must be a true witch.

545
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,720
I guess you could call her that if that's what she's talking about.

546
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,460
She's for real.

547
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,900
She's running by hovering Christmas ornaments.

548
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,060
It looks like a radar device.

549
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,580
What?

550
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,760
Yo.

551
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:14,820
Yo?

552
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,280
It's her.

553
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,140
What up?

554
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,040
Nothing.

555
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,020
What's up?

556
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,860
What a deep voice.

557
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,440
What's up?

558
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,480
First Christmas witch.

559
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,260
Grrr.

560
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

561
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,540
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

562
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,020
Grrr.

563
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,200
Grrr.

564
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,240
Grrr.

565
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,600
Grrr.

566
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,320
Grrr.

567
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,720
Grrr.

568
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:38,960
Grrr.

569
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
Ha, ha, ha.

570
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:39,960


571
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,540
Grrr.

572
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,580
Thank you.

573
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,160
Thank you.

574
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,880
Thank you.

575
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,920
Thank you.

576
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,760
Thank you.

577
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,240
Thank you.

578
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,160
Thank you.

579
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:23,740
Thank you.

580
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,920
Thank you.

581
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,320
Thank you.

582
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,740
Thank you.

583
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:35,340
Thank you.

584
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:35,340


585
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:35,340


586
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,800
It was.

587
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,760
It was.

588
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,920
It was.

589
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:49,400
It was.

590
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,700
It was.

591
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,400
It was.

592
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,140
flying Coca-Cola drinking Christmas,

593
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,560
not a crack-smoking, rubber-snapping Christmas.

594
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,640
It was a...

595
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,540
When your little brother fell through a hole in the ice sling,

596
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,360
and you went and saved him,

597
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,140
you didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.

598
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,320
It was a wonderful life back then.

599
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,880
I remember when Uncle Bud would come in with the candles,

600
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,840
like most people have.

601
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,220
And he would have that smile on his face.

602
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,080
But today, Christmas has lost its meaning.

603
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,240
Scott, you made your choice.

604
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,640
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.

605
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,260
And to your eternal soul,

606
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,680
you have found that only could you afford

607
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,580
to give to God that which was his.

608
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,460
But you could not afford to do otherwise.

609
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,860
The Senate still stands.

610
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,340
Into outer darkness,

611
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,240
where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.

612
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,540
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir.

613
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,780
I don't want to go to hell, sir!

614
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,100
Sir, no!

615
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,080
I don't want to go to hell!

616
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,560
No!

617
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,660
No!

618
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:19,420
No!

619
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,280
No!

620
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:20,780


621
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:21,800


622
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:21,800


623
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:21,800


624
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:21,800


625
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:21,800


626
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:21,800


627
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:21,820
No!

628
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


629
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


630
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


631
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


632
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


633
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


634
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


635
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


636
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


637
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


638
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


639
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


640
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


641
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


642
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


643
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


644
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


645
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


646
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


647
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


648
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:21,820


649
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:28,000
An Innocent Men Defer Jordan

650
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,820
AsklaÅŸ

651
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,560
Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.

652
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:21,940
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth and a baby is born with a head that

653
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,480
glows like a fluorescent lamp.

654
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,420
Dare I ask it?

655
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,240
Yes.

656
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:32,800
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God, but merely one of the countless aliens that

657
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,560
visit the earth each and every day?

658
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,940
The answer?

659
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,540
Yes, definitely.

660
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:44,260
Take that and shove it up the tube mark certainty in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

661
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:48,600
Merry Christmas to all, now you're all gonna die!

662
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:56,520
The night Santa went crazy, the night Saint Nick went insane.

663
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:03,900
Realized he'd been getting the wrong heel, something finally must have snapped in his

664
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,440
brain.

665
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:09,280
Well the workshop is gone now, he decided to vomit.

666
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,520
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet.

667
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,460
And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage.

668
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,260
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage.

669
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,500
He got dancer and prancer with an old German Luger.

670
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,540
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger.

671
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,260
And he picked up a flamethrower and a barbecue glitzen.

672
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,200
And he took a big bite and said it tastes just like chicken.

673
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:43,500
The night Santa went crazy, the night Santa went insane.

674
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:50,940
This grain go and done, now you can't hardly walk around the North Pole without stepping

675
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,900
in reindeer guts.

676
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,420
There's the National Guard and the FBI.

677
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,940
There's a van from the eyewitness noose.

678
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,420
And helicopters circling round in the sky.

679
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:13,500
And the bullets are flying, the body counts rising, and everyone gets gotten out.

680
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:13,500


681
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:13,500


682
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:13,500


683
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:13,500


684
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,200
Everyone's dying to know her Santa wife

685
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,180
My, my, my, my, my, my

686
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,180
You used to be such a jolly guy

687
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,880
So be good, for goodness sake

688
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,740
You better watch out

689
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,040
You better not cry

690
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,520
You better not pout

691
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,600
I'm telling you why

692
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:01,040
Santa Claus is coming to town

693
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,480
Santa Claus is coming to town

694
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,480
Have yourself an advanced dogmatic brain

695
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,840
Santa Claus is coming to town

696
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:17,840


697
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,080
Santa Claus is coming to town

698
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,200
Who gave the Lord the Claptrap?

699
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,640
Who made him talk in funny riddles so that we cannot understand?

700
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,600
Who made him so succinct and blind that he is actually blind?

701
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,720
My one good little thing

702
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,420
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season

703
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,480
The time of the Lord

704
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:43,480


705
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,700
How many before you reach your limit?

706
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,740
Jesus season

707
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:48,640
Jesuses?

708
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah, how many can you bag?

709
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,840
How many messiahs can you bag?

710
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,500
Hail Jesuses

711
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,420
If you're doing it in season

712
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,700
If you're doing it out of season, you need a special permit

713
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,280
Oh, you never do that

714
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,200
And you can only take one

715
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,580
You never bag the Lord in C, you bag the Lord in B-flat so you get that kind of rough sound

716
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,140
But when they're in season, it's every god for himself

717
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:09,360
This is the season for the fighting Jesus, obviously

718
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,280
We are between a rock and a hard place

719
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,200
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea in the old age and he got a very, very hard foot?

720
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,440
And he got elephantiasis of the rectum

721
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,720
You know, it's not something well known by many Christian scholars

722
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,620
Messy, messy, messy disease

723
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,100
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was

724
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,180
Well, I like the story

725
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:36,940
I kind of like those stories where the Lord dies and then comes here to America and settles, you know, tames the West

726
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:41,340
I like when he moves into a trailer park and cowboys walk with his dog

727
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,060
Jesus!

728
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,520
Jesus fought for the Confederate Army

729
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,420
The Ranger, I like the Texas Ranger

730
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,160
Jesus, Texas Ranger

731
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,260
Johnny River was a Jesus

732
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:55,580
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police, for maybe the Hopi police force

733
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,940
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus

734
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,580
Man

735
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:03,540
The white brother who came to instruct the Indians how to be liberal

736
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:09,000
Well, what about old peacemaker, the Jesus of the Iroquois who was actually Huron, a Huron

737
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,380
You didn't know that, did you?

738
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:10,980
I got you!

739
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,380
Thin rye

740
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:12,780
Jesus!

741
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,040
Elrond

742
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,120
I got a Jesus like no other Jesus you've ever seen

743
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,140
Oh, it tastes like butter

744
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,100
A new Jesus, a different Jesus

745
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,340
It tastes like crappie

746
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:22,720
A future Jesus

747
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,120
A future Jesus

748
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,240
A pipe-smoking Jesus

749
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,740
Hey, Dave, you know where it is

750
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,380
Go kick that window open

751
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,500
I already kicked it, I'll kick it again, though

752
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,940
Kick it good this time

753
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,220
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God

754
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:44,980
We hope that we thank you for all the nice things that you've done for us this Thanksgiving

755
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:49,900
We appreciate all that and we're just trying to insult your fan club

756
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,660
That's all, that's why we do this blasphemous stuff

757
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:57,600
But we knew that you knew that because you're in all things and everything, right, Jesus?

758
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,400
Right, I could hear him say that

759
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,880
Praise God and Bob and Jesus

760
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,380
Next topic, terrorist insurance

761
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,340
Could you see Jesus as a terrorist?

762
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,400
And science

763
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,100
Well, that's the life of Brian, isn't it?

764
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,420
And Greek mythology and Norse mythology

765
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,860
Listen to the sounds of hell

766
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:23,100
Jingle, jangle, jingle, we're on a sleigh ride to heck

767
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:29,300
Santa and his reindeer are really wicked

768
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,440
Wrapped in wrapping paper

769
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,060
We're gonna break our necks

770
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,120
Gotta rock it!

771
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:43,820
Put in my pocket on a sleigh ride to heck

772
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,580
Sleigh ride to heck

773
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:51,280
Sleigh ride to heck

774
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:55,760
Sleigh ride to heck

775
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,160
The elves are full of cheer

776
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,760
The kids are tucked in bed

777
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,160
Santa ain't coming

778
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,620
We're on a sleigh ride to heck

779
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,080
Their dreams are filled with toys

780
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,740
But they're out of luck

781
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:25,560
Cause Satan's taking Santa on a sleigh ride to f**k

782
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,020
Sleigh ride to heck

783
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,700
Sleigh ride to heck

784
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,160
Sleigh ride to heck

785
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:44,110
Santain this sleigh ride

786
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:44,630
Santa is administering notices

787
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:50,530
Santa shows off his supreme gift

788
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:51,890
But army ends in a row

789
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:56,350
Santa is in a clean crew

790
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:56,350


791
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:56,990
Santa is grateful

792
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:01,650
SchÃ¶n broughtazz

793
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:07,250
only can accept somebody making fun of Bob, stomping on a picture of Bob, he'll do it himself.

794
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:13,710
He has so much trust and faith in Bob. Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob. Now,

795
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:18,470
we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes, but we

796
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:27,930
subgeni may be bad, but our way of bad is holy, is holy compared to the evil of so, not all,

797
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:32,450
by any means, but so many American fundamentalists, charismatics, evangelicals,

798
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:38,830
et cetera, in general, of course, they and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya,

799
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:44,910
South Africa, et cetera, if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.

800
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:52,510
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about. Jesus and Bob, like we say,

801
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:56,890
our old drinking buddies, got nothing against Jesus. It's just his fan club,

802
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:03,090
now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve, he's more like the smear on God's

803
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:09,650
handkerchief, just like you or me, but the uptight rival cults, they don't think God has a handkerchief,

804
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:16,370
uh-uh, no, because God's perfect. He doesn't even sneeze. We're made in his image, except that we

805
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:22,190
have all these nasty parts attached to us, and we have to go in the secret room, the bathroom,

806
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:27,370
to do awful things, but God, oh, he's clean and pure.

807
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:33,170
According to them, oh, and he's male, but he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff

808
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:38,770
out of him like we do, because we sin, oh yeah, we all sin, we're bad, we're worthless, we're no

809
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:45,910
good to God, unless we sign a contract with his agent. We interrupt this program for a special

810
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:51,550
promotional announcement. We turn. He-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this

811
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:51,850
message.

812
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:27,910
You

813
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:46,390
Overconfident, I've spent

814
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:55,070
Just like the ones I used to know

815
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:04,990
I'm going to stop smoking

816
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:11,350
And it should be the same

817
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:20,090
To be a man that's in the snow

818
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:27,910
I'm going to stop smoking

819
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:27,910


820
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:36,410
Dreaming about the days you don't spend

821
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:44,910
When everyone can't find my life

822
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:52,150
Make your days be

823
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,770
Short and short

824
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:08,150
And they all will be your

825
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:12,250
Dumbstant new lives

826
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:23,990
By Fernanda Nande-Lemar

827
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:27,190
Oh, holy night

828
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:27,910
Oh, holy night

829
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:27,910


830
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:30,050
The stars are brightly shining

831
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:35,290
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth

832
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:38,270
Long lay, long lay the world

833
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:41,370
In danger and refining

834
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:44,770
The pit and the stone on its way

835
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:48,130
A thrill of hope

836
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,930
The weary world rejoices

837
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,490
Beyond the grace

838
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:54,630
A new and glorious dawn

839
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:56,010
Fall

840
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:57,830
Fall on your knees

841
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:02,870
Oh, hear the angel voices

842
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:06,390
Oh, night divine

843
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:11,090
Oh, night when Christ was born

844
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:19,230
Oh, night, oh, night divine

845
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:22,430
Have yourselves

846
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:27,330
A groovy little solstice

847
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:27,810
A groovy little solstice

848
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:32,470
Nithros won you spite

849
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:36,230
Nithros won you spite

850
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:36,590
Nithros won you spite

851
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,250
Ho, ho, ho

852
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,370
Come on, come on

853
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:42,450
It's He-Bob

854
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:43,950
Hey kids, you can help the mighty

855
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:44,830
So Genus Rice

856
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:46,510
Overthrow the evil normals

857
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:47,990
With new Bob Dobbs action figure

858
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,870
With rocket pie

859
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:50,270
What I wouldn't do for Bob Dobbs

860
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:52,490
Get no more chocolatey pebbles from you

861
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:52,990
No, no

862
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:55,370
Buy my chocolate spice cadet

863
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:57,670
Life support system down to zero cocoa

864
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:02,910
I have some of my new cocoa pimples now so trumpety.

865
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,290
Mmm, smells coconut-ish.

866
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:09,150
This cocoa liquid is...

867
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:10,390
Blow.

868
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:13,910
Well, friends, what do you think?

869
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:19,210
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?

870
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:24,570
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob,

871
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:28,270
as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures?

872
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:04,290
The Jethro's.

873
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,770
Friends, you need to know where to write to the Jethro's.

874
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:07,610
They're at...

875
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:12,290
They did that Wreck the Halls and so many other versions we've been playing.

876
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:19,750
The Jethro's are at 212 and a half Miller Avenue.

877
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:23,010
That's 212 and a half Miller Avenue.

878
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,110
Portsmouth.

879
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:25,870
New Hampshire.

880
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:27,990
Portsmouth N.H.

881
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:32,590
O-3-8-O-1.

882
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:37,330
Santa Claus is Coming to Town was by Corporal Blossom.

883

I'm Reverend Ivan Stang.

887
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:59,790

889
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:11,790
And friends, as always, the Hour of Slack is brought to you by

890
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:13,590
the Church of the Subgenius.

www.subgenius.com

892
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:21,650
It's all Christmassy right now.

893
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:23,670
There's a bright green bob in the window.

894
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:24,030
And a...

895
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:25,150
Is there a light out there?

896
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:25,570
And Christmassy lights.

897
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:26,750
Is there a DJA?

898
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:27,970
Is DJA out there?

899
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:31,630
And devilish artwork that's Christmassy.

900
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,830
No, that's something just left for DJA.

901
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:34,850
It's all Christmassy.

902
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:41,290
It's all wrapped up in a perfumed ribbon-wrapped present.

903
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:42,810
Under the tree.

904
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:43,790
Smell that cinnamon.

905
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,670
Open the door all the way so we can see if he comes in.

906
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,410
And the sugar plums.

907
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,570
Something's up the chimney hole in Satan's name.

908
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:51,410
Yeah.

909
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:52,810
Of Santa, I mean.

910
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:53,390
Otherwise.

911
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:54,690
Gosh.

912
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:58,350
I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.

913
00:57:58,570 --> 00:57:59,990
Oh, beloved Santa.

914
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,390
I have wanted to put your bag down for a minute.

915
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:05,850
Besides, I'm so ready to let him be.

916
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:06,450
What?

917
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,430
For so long.

918
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:12,130
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

919
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:16,410
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

920
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:16,650
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

921
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:23,570
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

922
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:34,710
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

923
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:38,910
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

924
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:39,010
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

925
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:41,530
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

926
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:44,830
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

927
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:46,890
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

928
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:47,370
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

929
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:47,370


930
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:47,370


931
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:47,510
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

932
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:47,510


933
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:47,510


934
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:47,510


935
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:47,510


936
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:47,730
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

937
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:49,590
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

938
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:53,510
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

939
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:59,370
Lone cow babe, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

940
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:17,270
Don't despair, just because it's Christmas Children there are so gay at Christmas

941
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:28,150
All the children on the street Hope they get something good to eat

942
