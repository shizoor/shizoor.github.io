1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,220
Hello.

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,860
Now wait a minute there.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,540
Kill me.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:12,760
Hi.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,420
Hi.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:13,880
Yeah.

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,380
Paul Wilbur.

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,580
Yes.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,020
I'm overly attached to my horse.

10
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:19,680
Good.

11
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,100
Paul Wilbur.

12
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,740
Yeah.

13
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,440
Please.

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,640
Temporary insanity.

15
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,080
Oh, Wilbur.

16
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,880
Just promise me one thing.

17
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,240
You won't marry a horse.

18
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,660
You could give him love.

19
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,340
All right.

20
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,060
All right.

21
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,560
Goodness.

22
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,700
The size of that...

23
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,520
Hello.

24
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,280
Hello.

25
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:39,760
Yes.

26
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,340
I gotta go.

27
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:40,840
I gotta go.

28
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,100
Hello.

29
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,300
Firm but gentle.

30
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:43,700
That's it.

31
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,400
99.

32
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,300
99.

33
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,000
99.

34
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,120
Say, how did she take it?

35
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,000
Now let's all smile.

36
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,920
Pretend to be gay.

37
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,680
Yes, it's the new Gay Family Series.

38
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,060
Brought to you by the C oggi nios.

39

Power diverse.

40
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,100
ions.

41
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,300
Frontiers.

42
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:28,720

43
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,880

Oh he big warrior's better look around.

45

High time with beautiful gal him settle down.

47

Tribe gotta have a princess,

48
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,720
So we make a powwow,

49
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,040
Tribe gotta have a princess,

50
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,800
You settle in powwow,

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,840
Big Chief Ogamog Og gotta have a squad.

52
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,940
Big Chief Ogamog Og gotta have a squad,

53
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,020
Big Chief Ogamog Og gotta have a squad.

54
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,560
This population is kinda lonesome around here, don't you think so Olive?

55
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,080
Uh huh.

56
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,700
Are you still here Olive?

57
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,420
There's another one.

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,600
What's the matter, no gas?

59
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,980
I think we got a flat.

60
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,360
Now I want you to see the perp, perp, perp, perp, perp,

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,980
Realize, I want you to look at this very closely.

62
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,080
I really believe this.

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,720
I believe in, I believe in,

64
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,300
Pew.

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,280
That aggravates me to death.

66
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:35,660
Pew.

67
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,460
I, I, I, I know I'm getting bigger.

68
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,940
Uh, and, and, more intimacy.

69
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:41,980
Funk, funk.

70
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,860
I want you to look at this.

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,400
Um, but I want to tell you something.

72
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:44,980
Funk, funk.

73
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,000
See I don't want that.

74
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,060
You see what I'm talking about?

75
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:47,880
Because why?

76
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,060
I, I love it.

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,100
My wife's tremendous at it.

78
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,220
It's too big to be formed by one person.

79
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,900
Funk, funk.

80
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,840
I want this big.

81
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,580
Um,

82
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,300
Hey, hey.

83
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,640
You know I'm build up.

84
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,480
Built up.

85
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,120
Man I was excited, wasn't you?

86
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,100
We'll explode.

87
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,260
We'll, we'll, we'll literally blow ourselves splitter and splatter.

88
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:06,700
Hey,

89
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,520
Excuse me.

90
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,720
Uh, uh, uh, um, uh,

91
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,040
Jugglers for Jesus.

92
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,160
Clowns for Christ.

93
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,820
Entertainment.

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,220
I want to have it my way.

95
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,000
Uh, um, um, entertainment.

96
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,580
And folks I want to tell you something.

97
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,940
Who cook meatloaf?

98
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,000
And who'll take it?

99
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,680
Get it together.

100
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,340
What, what's going on?

101
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,820
Jason's got a tool to help you.

102
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,840
Eat a hot dog in the name of Jesus.

103
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,800
And if you put some chili on it, you've had a part in reaching that's soul.

104
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,280
I'm excited about it.

105
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,700
Why?

106
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,740
I'll tell you why, then look at this.

107
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,980
Hey, I have reservations, um,

108
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,320
TOO MUCH IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN NOT ENOUGH!

109
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,600
TOO MUCH ALWAYS BETTER THAN NOT ENOUGH!

110
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,200
Too Much Is Always Better!

111
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:05,820
Too much is always better Too much is always better

112
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:16,240
Too much is always better Too much is always better than not enough

113
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,920
They'll never drag me under if I go over the top

114
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,160
I'm never in cause I'm outrageous If you place some bets I'm the favourite

115
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,560
Ready, get set, take it to the next step Step this way, we're pushing boundaries in every way

116
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,780
You know you need it, come and join us as you're getting the feeling

117
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,300
You better believe it

118
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,620
Too much is always better than not enough

119
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,600
Better believe it

120
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,020
Too much is always better than not enough

121
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,960
You better believe it

122
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,300
Too much is always better than not enough

123
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,260
Believe it

124
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,240
Too much

125
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,140
Too much

126
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,940
You better believe it

127
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,580
You better believe it

128
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,200
Too much is always better

129
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,440
Too much is always better

130
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,760
Too much is always better

131
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,080
Too much is always better

132
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,240
Too much is always better than not enough

133
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,960
Go over the top

134
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,560
Too much is always better than not enough

135
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,240
Over the top, go over the top

136
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,980
Too much is always better than not enough

137
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,340
They'll never drag me under

138
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,280
Too much is always better than not enough

139
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,460
Too much

140
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,120
Reverend Max Slack did that song, friends, too much.

141
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,040
And did this episode of Hour of Slack.

142
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,520
Number 1175 is heavy on the music

143
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,480
and particularly the bittersweet kind of song

144
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,500
and especially songs by Bob Walkenhorst

145
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,860
who you may have figured out by now I kind of admire.

146
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,460
Also bittersweet are the collages by Lee Murr and Nor Elpref

147
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:17,020
and the Popeye cartoon which features the last performance of Bluto

148
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
as Valkyrie.

149
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,020
Voiced by the great Gus Wickey, the original Bluto

150
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,860
who died in 1938 just after that cartoon was produced.

151
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,680
And now Nor El.

152
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,900
This is Valk's Weekend.

153
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,100
Writing about actually doing something

154
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,660
and cultivating a garden

155
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,120
boxed, processed, and filled with unpronounceable ingredients.

156
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,200
Moving from butter to margarine, we go overboard.

157
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,960
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.

158
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,640
Perhaps sex.

159
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,380
Dick margarine. Dick margarine.

160
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,420
I can answer that one.

161
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,520
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

162
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,660
Soft and smooth.

163
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,760
Very soft.

164
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,200
Very sweet on the tongue.

165
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,160
Pleasure is this extreme softness.

166
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,220
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

167
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,980
Well, Bob.

168
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,720
Meaningless.

169
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,700
Stroke, stroke.

170
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,300
You don't want your cucumber with a stamp on it.

171
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,640
The nuts have recently, you know.

172
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,480
This morning.

173
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,820
Boost your brain.

174
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,860
Um, I saw it in milk.

175
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,140
Genius.

176
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,920
Putting the fish in your yogurt.

177
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,900
You're listening to Bob's Weekend.

178
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,860
Welcome back to Bob's Weekend.

179
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,160
Distributed by PR.

180
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,180
Don't forget there was pleasure.

181
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:17,820
Meat.

182
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,700
Does not seem to be very healthy.

183
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,660
More cancer.

184
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,040
And other kinds of cancer as well.

185
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,340
Um, you're right.

186
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,980
Um, eat the French.

187
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,780
Or the Italians.

188
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,660
Or the Japanese.

189
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,400
Or the Indians.

190
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:27,980
Or the Greeks.

191
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,000
Take your pick.

192
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,120
Eat brains for brains for brains.

193
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,700
That's right.

194
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,460
Propaganda.

195
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,080
Propaganda.

196
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,760
Bananas.

197
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,020
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

198
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,220
Distributed by PR.

199
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:36,960
X.

200
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:37,740
Ahem.

201
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:38,620
Ahem.

202
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,380
Ahem.

203
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,400
Ahem.

204
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,060
Ahem.

205
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:41,620
Ahem.

Ahem.

207
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:41,960
Ahem.

208
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,040
Blame it on God.

209
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,300
With me.

210
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,020
Do not do the things I say.

211
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,940
I'm caused to rethink.

212
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,740
Things that I previously thought.

213
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,780
This is not the right path to go.

214
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,260
And I just got into that.

215
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,040
You uncircumcised.

216
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:54,820
Hard.

217
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,060
Hard.

218
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,540
You stiff.

219
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,040
You stiff.

220
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,560
Well, you know.

221
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,420
He's got a point.

222
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,080
Pardon it.

223
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,600
Pardon it.

224
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:58,940
Word.

225
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,900
And then this guy.

226
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,340
Blah.

227
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:01,740
Blah.

228
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,200
Blah.

229
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,560
Blah.

230
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:02,720
Blah.

231
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:02,880
Blah.

232
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,900
I am fed up.

233
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,480
Do evil.

234
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,660
You have made a big mess of life.

235
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,940
I'm hard as far as I can go.

236
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,580
Hey, come on now, you fella.

237
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,420
Get up.

238
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:12,640
Mm.

239
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,840
Well, push him off.

240
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,500
I'm trying.

241
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,240
Mm.

242
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,200
Mm.

243
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:16,900
Mm.

244
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,560
Mm.

245
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,000
Mm.

246
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,020
Mm.

247
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,020


248
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,020


249
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,020


250
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:18,820
Oh.

251
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,900
Hey, get up over there, you fella.

252
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,060
Goodness.

253
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,260
He's as stubborn as a mule.

254
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:24,860
You know that, huh?

255
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,460
Oh.

256
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:25,780
Oh.

257
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,420
Oh.

258
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:26,740


259
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,100
Oh.

260
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,460
Oh.

261
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:27,720
Oh.

262
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:27,840
Oh.

263
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,040
Oh.

264
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,140
Oh.

265
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,260
Oh.

266
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:28,280
Oh.

267
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,300
Oh.

268
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,020
I think maybe I should have changed his oil or something.

269
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:30,220


270
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,180
I'll take the high road.

271
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,120
And I'll take the low road.

272
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,440
Oh.

273
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:33,800
Oh.

274
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,120
Oh.

275
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,700
Here we go.

276
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,720
Big shit.

277
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,460
I'm a lot.

278
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,020

I'm a lot.

281
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,740
I'm a lot.

282
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,180
I'm a lot.

283
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:40,720
I'm a lot.

284
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:47,740
I'm a lot.

285
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,000
Big shit.

286
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,160
Doorbell, I'm awfully sorry.

287
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:49,820
Oh.

288
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,400

Beautiful.

Oh, Ray.

Oh, just my trice, too.

How did you get that?

297
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,600
You like a nice bracelet?

298
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,340
Oh.

It fit perfect.

Oh.

Oh.

Look at him.

308
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,060
You like him?

309
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:14,700
Oh.

310
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,560
Oh, I love him.

Now, now, now let me make you a nice print.

312
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,920
This is for our big chief.

313
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,040
Oh.

314
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,460
Say you're not a bad guy.

315
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,080
Oh.

316
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:21,820
Oh.

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,800
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

Oh.

319
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,740
Oh, I think somebody's trying to make a donkey out of me or something.

320
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,500
Olive.

321
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Hey, olive oil.

322
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,560
You know, it ain't right for her to walk out and leave me holding the nag like this.

323
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,040
Whoa.

324

00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,140
Sex workers are better than priests

386
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,320
Prostitutes are better

387
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,900
Prayers, prayers

388
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,460
Prostitutes are better than priests

389
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,140
The positions of Hispanics

390
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,100
If I haven't got redução

391
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,420
Are you also looking at me?!

392
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:23,820
Where are you?

393
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:23,820


394
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:23,820


395
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,280
Is this it?

396
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,660
Yeah, that's saying yes

397
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:27,760
What is it?

398
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,560
This boy still goes on

399
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,100
This old party

400
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,100


401
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,100


402
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,100


403
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,100


404
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,460
Let it be

405
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,740
Listen to put your knees

406
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:44,540
Here, here, here

407
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,040
I'm going to go away.

408
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,180
Killing babies.

409
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,980
The ass.

410
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,340
Ass.

411
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,320
Okay.

412
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,080
Okay.

413
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,380
Born alive.

414
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,380
Born alive.

415
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,360
Born alive.

416
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,920
The abortionist.

417
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,440
We gotta kill the baby.

418
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,140
Abortion.

419
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,120
Non-viable fetus.

420
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,540
Think.

421
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,000
The woman wants an abortion.

422
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,180
Non-viable.

423
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,900
Lion.

424
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:07,940
I get it.

425
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,500
Limp and dead.

426
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,120
Lion.

427
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,180
Let's.

428
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,560
Let's.

429
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,040
Here's.

430
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,420
Let's.

431
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:11,820
Let's.

432
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,220
Here's.

433
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,320
It's abortion.

434
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,000
Abortion.

435
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,140
Abortion.

436
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,580
Abortion.

437
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,160
I.

438
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,760
I.

439
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,220
I.

440
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:16,740
I.

441
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,260
I.

442
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:17,900
I.

443
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,060
I.

444
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,320
I.

445
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,740
I don't believe for a minute.

446
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,080
I don't believe for a minute.

447
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,580
I get it.

448
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:21,960
I get it.

449
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,320
I get it.

450
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,700
I get it.

451
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,420
I blows it.

452
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,780
I'm Dr. Laura Schlesinger and I am Dr. Laura.

453
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,640
R-U-A-L-D-R-A.

454
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,640
I am really defensive and snotty.

455
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,960
So, if you're in a car, shut it off.

456
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,860
Children are eroded and weakened.

457
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,800
Therefore, I hate the family whose function is to raise children.

458
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,120
The biggest reason is this.

459
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,320
I can't wait to bury his head forward.

460
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,060
And not backward.

461
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,480
They were real.

462
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,500
Wow.

463
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,460
That is stupid.

464
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,840
That's just like a woman of your sex.

465
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,920
I guess I have to stay here and protect you.

466
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,080
Oh, uh, big cheese ugly mug.

467
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,760
Would you mind stepping over here for just a moment, please?

468
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,000
You funny cat face.

469
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,560
I'll break you in half.

470
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,440
I'll dig a hole.

471
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,040
You push my daisies.

472
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,080
Oh, very interesting.

473
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,860
I heard every word you said and this is what I'm going to do to you, young fellow.

474
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:29,600
I go.

475
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,820
Slug bug nugs.

476
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,600
Slug them out.

477
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,940
There you are.

478
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,200
You see.

479
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,140
Watch out.

480
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,340
Let's go.

481
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:40,520
I'm going to get you.

482
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,280
I'm going to get you.

483
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,540
I'm going to get you.

484
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,580
Well, I guess that's the last of the mojitoffs.

485
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:44,800
Oh.

486
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,140
Ha ha ha ha ha.

487
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,540
All right.

488
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,640
Anyway, guess who?

489
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:55,140
You may have noticed that we, uh, this year handed out, uh, flyers, uh, showing your inner

490
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,480
gorilla and your inner demon.

491
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,540
This is your confessional sheet.

492
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,880
Please pick up one of these confessionals and, uh, fill out the slips, uh, describing

493
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,640
your inner demon and or gorilla.

494
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,420
These will be useful in the coming time.

495
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,600
As, uh, we analyze these documents, uh, minutely and resolutely.

496
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,580
We may even read them in funny voices.

497
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,120
So you might not want to sign them.

498
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,160
Oh, it's an avalanche of fun we're going to have.

499
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,620
But it requires some minor participation as you pick up these documents on the desk and,

500
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:35,360
uh, make sure they are well filled out in your most readable script or printing.

501
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,060
We also have a new one where you finish, uh, nursery rhymes.

502
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,400
Now, it's true that, uh, we're going to have to do this.

503
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,540
We're going to have to write the new one, so that you can get the books and the books

504
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,540


505
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,540


506
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,540


507
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,540


508
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,540


509
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,540


510
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,540


511
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,600
fact that these documents were originally designed for kindergarten children, but we're

512
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,900
subgeniuses.

513
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,460
And decide.

514
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,480
We should be able to reach any level of intellect from the very bottom to the very

515
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:51,940
top.

516
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,260
It's also worth consideration that outside the subgenius bubble, intellectual degeneracy

517
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,160
has continued so that most people don't even know

518
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,380
the nursery rhymes to begin with or anything else.

519
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,360
The last book most people out there ever read

520
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,640
was The Cat in the Hat.

521
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,060
That was their last literary experience,

522
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,100
which they honor by making similar hats

523
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,180
as they leap up and down in the dust

524
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,940
for hours at Burning Man.

525
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,420
Miles and Chester and Dr. Root's garden

526
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,620
Stealing cabbages and corn

527
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,320
Keeping eyes out for the tractor

528
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,580
Filling up their bags with pilfered harvest

529
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,780
In the marinated morning

530
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,220
Of potential disaster

531
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,920
Miles and Chester and Dr. Root's garden

532
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,980
Miles and Chester and Dr. Root's garden

533
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,640
Got a wife and seven kids to feed

534
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,860
And with those seeds I'll plant a farm

535
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,560
He's got lots of vegetables

536
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,260
And me and Chester, do you know?

537
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:26,520
Home

538
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,600
Sue and Edna in Dr. Root's back shed

539
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,420
Carrying wings off little flies

540
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,740
Smoking fags behind the tool bench

541
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,740
Singing as they daily burn the barn down

542
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,400
Running around the town

543
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,240
Coming gigglingly outside

544
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,420
Having salvaged but a pipe wrench

545
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,840
Sue and Edna in Dr. Root's back shed

546
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,920
Sue and Edna in Dr. Root's back shed

547
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,580
We've got nothing else but two

548
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,400
A mule, a dolphin, funky lads

549
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,340
And a little wave

550
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,500
Dr. Root can buy a dozen barns

551
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,620
With all the taxes he don't pay

552
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,920
Dr. Root inside his secret chamber

553
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,040
Raising potters of disease

554
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,320
To destroy the world that you made me

555
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,380
Dr. Root inside his secret chamber

556
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:56,380


557
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,900
He can't wait to put a new scent into everyone's world

558
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,540
Dr. Root in his mind has got blame

559
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:08,760
But his workers made him feast

560
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,620
He is now prepared to blame them

561
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,140
Dr. Root inside his secret chamber

562
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,500
He is now prepared to blame them

563
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:23,500


564
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,460
Dr. Root inside his secret chamber

565
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,360
Dr. Root inside his secret chamber

566
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,200
is secret chamber.

567
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,140
Oi!

568
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,460
They've been on my back

569
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,360
for years, and now my

570
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,400
little helpers are

571
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,300
escaping.

572
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,220
Everyone

573
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,540
soon will be quite

574
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,740
sorry for the trouble

575
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,980
they've been making.

576
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,720
We're sorry, Dr. Rude!

577
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,700
We're sorry, Dr. Rude!

578
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,800
Ha ha ha!

579
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,140
Ha ha ha!

580
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:53,420
Ha ha ha!

581
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,760
Ha ha ha!

582
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:09,880
Ha ha ha!

583
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,260
Ha ha ha!

584
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,240
Ha ha ha!

585
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,860
Ha ha ha!

586
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,020
Ha ha ha!

587
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,200
Ha ha ha!

588
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,220
Ha ha ha!

589
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,220


590
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,240
Ha ha ha!

591
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,040
Ha ha ha!

592
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,160
Ha ha ha!

593
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,860
Ha ha ha!

594
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:43,440
Dr. Roots Garden by Chrysalis from 1967.

595
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,120
A quirky, weird old band.

596
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:52,900
Thanks to Reverend Baldin Kramer for that there.

597
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,860
Ellery Queen's.

598
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,380
This is Ellery Queen with a case I call The Big Mistake.

599
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,020
In this case, the charge was murder and police were holding a youthful suspect.

600
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,640
I told him, it's a good story, but you're a murderer just the same.

601
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,240
In a moment, I'll explain why.

602
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,620
In the case of The Big Mistake, most desk drawers are automatically locked by the middle drawer alone.

603
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,840
But a big one.

604
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,500
Listen again to Ellery Queen's.

605
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,920
This is the old trip, trip, trip.

606
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,840
We're coming on down there now.

607
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,840
We're looking at those, uh, studs.

608
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,080
Looking at those studs.

609
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,740
But let me tell you.

610
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,140
Let me go back, go back.

611
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:34,840
Buggy, buggy.

612
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,960
Day in and day out.

613
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,820
You know where we can get some men cutting logs somewhere in the woods?

614
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,440
Dictating.

615
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,000
Aw.

616
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,840
Fine ass.

617
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,700
Intimate knowledge and penetrating orgy.

618
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,200
Spasmodic erection.

619
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,420
Oh, and listen.

620
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,400
This is a state.

621
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,700
This is a cap, cap, cap.

622
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,680
Out of which all other things, uh, appear.

623
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,400
But listen.

624
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,360
And now.

625
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,280
And now.

626
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:55,780
And now.

627
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,340
And now.

628
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:56,340


629
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,920
I wish you'd listen.

630
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,020
Spasmodic woman.

631
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,480
They were openly.

632
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,980
Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle.

633
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,680
Ring-a-ring-a-ring.

634
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,420
Looking at, looking at, looking at.

635
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,440
Commit fornication.

636
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,980
Seduce that woman.

637
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,180
Drive home pagan idolatry.

638
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,600
Commit fornication and eat things.

639
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,940
Now, my friend, teach pagan idolatry.

640
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,460
I know homosexuality.

641
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,400
And I know that gets me hot.

642
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,780
But I tell you one thing.

643
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,500
Come here, sit down, and shut up day by day.

644
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,720
In the meantime, I assume that the question forms are circulating among you.

645
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:33,640
And if you have a question that you need to unburden yourself of, we will do the best we can.

646
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:38,640
And we're also collecting your valuable gorilla and demon forms.

647
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,220
I've been meditating on the gorillas and demons.

648
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:54,380
And I've decided that the gorilla in your life is the stupid person who calls you names

649
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,340
because he doesn't understand you.

650
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:03,480
The demon is the mean, intelligent person who calls you names because he does understand you.

651
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:09,480
In other words, the demon is the Nenslo and the gorilla is the Alcandor.

652
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,880
Or the gorilla is the brute and the demon is the malicious spirit.

653
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,420
Now, Dr. Howe, that was a nice poem that you just recited.

654
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,380
Yes. Lucifer by Starlight.

655
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,860
I have a poem I'd like to recite.

656
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,320
It's not original to me.

657
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,320


658
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,840
In fact, Dr. Dark, who brought us that farting Bob toy, originally penned this.

659
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,260
But I had to change it a little because it was too hard to read out loud.

660
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,160
Here it goes.

661
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:42,640
This is something that only alt.slack lurkers and regulars would know.

662
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:53,040
A racist alt.slack troll named Mikey hated everything Masonic or kikey.

663
00:24:53,040 --> 00:25:01,620
He'd fly into a panic, say all things were satanic, asking, why doesn't anyone like me?

664
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,300
Oh. Well, that is indeed sad.

665
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:12,680
So even our most hated enemies we honor in a certain way because, you know, as Sterno pointed out,

666
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:18,740
the conspiracy exists to give us the energy to oppose it.

667
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:44,060
But if a sense said that the power was at stake...

668
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,540
That, in light of all the standoff system, there was led to us clashing in most many ways.

669
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:44,540


670
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:44,540


671
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
So here it is.

672
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
This reading asks us about the original story of the war and the creation of the human

673
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
disease.

674
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Badunder cares not for makenh whenever doers of hell and mortals are head and shoulders

675
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,040
over الله that would dub their rights and peace.

676
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Whether it made it that they were the priests of caliphate or had some relationship with

677
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Allah or that they had or weren't, it, however, weareth a shadow of the talismano

678
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
from the Kalalcan commands.

679
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
The the people transforms by the eye and that of.

680
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
Their power and intelligence can stop a way to argue and better Раз.

681
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,700
Bucks an hour and working weekend.

682
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,580
I was ignoring the thief who was latched to the crawlers.

683
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,840
He cried, help me get this son of a bitch off.

684
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,540
I said I would if I could.

685
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,760
I can't, so I won't.

686
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,280
Well, I wouldn't want you messing your hair up so dope.

687
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,860
And I realized then that the wages of sin

688
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,400
was all the lumber you can carry.

689
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,520
All the nails you can bend.

690
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,800
The wages of sin.

691
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,200
The reward of fear.

692
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,840
It's worry and a threat every second of the year.

693
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,060
And heaven is guilt.

694
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,280
No sex and no show.

695
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,040
And I'm not sure if I really want to go.

696
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,280
I'm not sure if I really want to go.

697
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,920
The wages of sin.

698
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,000
The price that you pay.

699
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,900
It's worry and a threat every second of the day.

700
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,160
The church and the state.

701
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,600
You're God and country kind.

702
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,940
One gets your body.

703
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,280
The other gets your mind.

704
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,400
Mary, Mary Magdalene.

705
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,740
How about a date?

706
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,280
You've been wasting your time staying up so late.

707
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,280
Your boyfriend's dead.

708
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,100
The word is you're a whore.

709
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,660
Just about then I heard a knock on the door.

710
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,120
And I realized then that the wages of sin.

711
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,860
Was a bad reputation and too many friends.

712
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,120
The wages of sin.

713
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,720
The wages of sin.

714
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,280
The wages of sin.

715
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,880
The wages of sin.

716
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:12,440
So now we have come to that part where we go into some of your anxieties, fears,

717
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,400
aspirations and hopes.

718
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:21,200
All encapsulated in these invaluable gorillas and demons form sheets.

719
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,100
I don't know Ivan do you want to trade off the gorilla and demon answers?

720
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,980
Well maybe I could do the gorillas and you could do the demons.

721
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,600
That's very good.

722
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,560
Unleash your inner gorilla and I will unleash my inner demon.

723
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,540
That's very good.

724
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,960
Here our first one is and these are unsigned so it's hard to know.

725
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,160
They don't need to be signed.

726
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,680
The gorilla says to this person.

727
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:57,360
You should obsessively worry about what strangers think of you.

728
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,780
Good advice.

729
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,860
And now the demon.

730
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,740
It's not enough to do what is expected.

731
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,740
You are expected to do more than what is expected.

732
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,520
More than what is expected.

733
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,480
And that was a quote from this person's boss.

734
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,360
From my boss.

735
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,860
Oh yes the boss.

736
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,280
Mifling poo at stang.

737
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,740
That's my gorilla.

738
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,960
Well what's with the I don't know.

739
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,900
Here's the demon.

740
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,220
Mithro poo at stinang.

741
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,580
Oh stinag.

742
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,320
St nag.

743
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,480
That's been an inside joke.

744
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,960
St nag is my new name on all of Slack.

745
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,140
It's based on a typo by the racist.

746
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,080
Let's have the gorilla.

747
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:57,720
I will crush you under a bed frame and kick you in the until you decide to go home.

748
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,920
I'll tie you up with sheet if you try to run.

749
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,260
And the demon.

750
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,500
When you die I'm going to kill you.

751
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:11,500


752
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,280
I'm going to skin you, tan your flesh and use it as a carpet.

753
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,660
And you know he won't wipe his feet either.

754
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,860
I never had that kind of demon.

755
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:25,940
The gorilla.

756
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,700
Sometimes I pee when I laugh.

757
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,020
What's so unusual about that?

758
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,940
Sometimes I laugh when I pee.

759
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,520
Here's a wordy gorilla.

760
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,060
That's nothing compared to some of the wordy gorillas we've got coming.

761
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,920
I think about having violent sex with everyone I see.

762
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,960
Everyone.

763
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,280
Every time I think it's wet, it's dry.

764
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,180
And every time I think it's dry, it's wet.

765
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,620
It really rubs my skin bloody.

766
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,960
If you forget what all I told you, remember this.

767
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,320
The dog with two discs always wins.

768
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:24,220
Oh, the dog with two dicks always wins.

769
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,000
Last Christmas with my drunken uncle.

770
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,920
You know how much is too much.

771
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,080
None.

772
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,260
Wisdom there from our primate.

773
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,680
That sounds kind of Bob-ish.

774
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,480
Yes, the great apes have really got a handle on that.

775
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:55,000
You make everyone near you uncomfortable and you should go away.

776
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,360
I wish it were possible to hate someone to death.

777
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,120
Stop screaming down my throat.

778
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,360
Wow.

779
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,960
Is Nenslo here?

780
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,240
Well, it's a demonic Nenslo.

781
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,240


782
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,160
It's a Nensletic equivalent.

783
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,940
Dr. Howell at 11X Day.

784
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,660
Before that, the Rainmakers with Wages of Sin.

785
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:22,060
And before that, Noro Pref Collages and Lemurian Collages.

786
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,040
But now, the great Pope, Robert Anton Wilson.

787
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,660
The theories I find really dangerous are like anti-Semitism,

788
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,680
which led to unprecedented horrors in this century.

789
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,420
And horrors on lesser scales,

790
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,880
because they had lesser technology throughout the history of Christendom.

791
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,720
And I find a lot of feminism to be equally nefarious and implication,

792
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,740
although they haven't had enough power to do anything about it.

793
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,460
But some of the feminists, when they talk about men,

794
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,880
they sound just like Adolf Hitler talking about Jews.

795
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,900
It's really scary.

796
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,820
The parallel is so damn close.

797
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,100
And then there are these theories where all the Freemasons in the world

798
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,060
are part of one gigantic conspiracy for the Freemasons to take over everything

799
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,980
and run everything.

800
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,620
I know too many Freemasons to take that seriously.

801
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,000
Freemasons are as miscellaneous a group as the Presbyterians, the plumbers.

802
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,220
You find all sorts of people in the Freemasons,

803
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,000
and they don't all have the same ideas.

804
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,160
So the way you use the term,

805
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,960
it means a kind of absolute blanket generalization about any group?

806
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,840
It's treating a group as homogenous.

807
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,100
Homogenous would be a good synonym for fungible.

808
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,040
So you feel we can throw in the trash,

809
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,240
and put those conspiracies out just based on their fungibility?

810
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,760
On the face of it, everybody has different fingerprints.

811
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,700
There are no two brains that are alike.

812
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,840
So the idea that you can make generalizations about a large and miscellaneous group,

813
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,040
and they'll be true about every member of that group,

814
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,320
that I think is the most nefarious form of stupidity on the planet.

815
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,300
Well, what's so interesting with that particular form of conspiracy theory

816
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,060
is that it contains what you call a strange loop.

817
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,500
Oh, yeah.

818
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,980
When you say Bertrand Russell looked into the evidence

819
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:15,480
and concluded that the bankers of Europe consisted 90% of Gentiles

820
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,920
and only 10% of Jews.

821
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,100
So the Jewish bankers conspiracy is a myth,

822
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,900
and they'll come back with,

823
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,480
Bertrand Russell was Jewish himself.

824
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,580
He changed his name.

825
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,700
Then you've got to try to prove that Bertrand Russell wasn't Jewish.

826
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,880
I actually got into that argument once with somebody about Hugh Hefner.

827
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,180
They were convinced he was Jewish.

828
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,540
All pornography is created by Jews.

829
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,820
Hefner is a pornographer.

830
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,180
Therefore, Hefner is Jewish.

831
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,340
I told him he's a Presbyterian.

832
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,020
No, he changed his name.

833
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,140
Sartre is the only one who's ever commented on this,

834
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,080
the delight in being stupid.

835
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,320
If you make up your mind you're going to defend a really stupid position,

836
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,640
you can get every intelligent person in the room hopping mad.

837
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,340
No matter how rational they think they are,

838
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,240
they'll eventually get more emotional than you are

839
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,320
if you just keep repeating the same stupid thing.

840
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,660
This is in an essay he wrote

841
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,440
called The Anti-Semite and the Jew.

842
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,460
If you're not Jewish and you try to argue with an anti-Semite

843
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,880
about his prejudices,

844
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,860
the next thing you know,

845
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,460
you are yelling and shouting and acting like a fanatic

846
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,860
more than he is because he's saying so many stupid things like,

847
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,760
you must be Jewish yourself.

848
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,600
How about you?

849
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,880
Well, then your wife is Jewish and she's corrupted you.

850
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,800
No, my wife isn't Jewish either.

851
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,140
Well, then it was your grandfather.

852
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:33,600
When you get into this infinite regress like that,

853
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,640
eventually you lose your...

854
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,400
your temper and then you feel you're as dumb

855
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,600
as the guy you're arguing with.

856
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,560
Oliver Wendell Holmes called that

857
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,700
the hydrostatic principle of controversy.

858
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,100
The fools drag everybody down to their own level.

859
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,920
Sartre noticed this particularly in anti-Semites.

860
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,700
But I've noticed it in all sorts of dogmatic people

861
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,080
that hold this terrain like the flat earthers.

862
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,940
You get into an argument with a flat earther

863
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,760
and I guarantee you'll lose your temper before he loses his

864
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,660
because he's enjoying being stupid.

865
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,200
But he's enjoying making you angry just by sticking to a position

866
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,220
which he knows nobody else can believe.

867
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,600
That also gives you a feeling of belonging to the elite.

868
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,400
Everybody else is too stupid to see the truth,

869
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,980
but I belong to the small group that knows the truth.

870
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,940
After you believe that, you're ready when the leader says,

871
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,580
here's your cyanide Kool-Aid, have a drink.

872
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,440
Oh, yeah, sure.

873
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,620
And you swallow it all down.

874
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,840
Do you believe that most conspiracy theory or conspiracy theorists

875
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,640
are working from a base of belief?

876
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,880
Or is this a process of a rational and logical will

877
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,820
to determine the facts of a situation?

878
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,960
You know, is it scientific or is this completely some kind of emotional...

879
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,640
Well, it covers the gamut.

880
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,460
I like to think of things on a scale of 1 to 10.

881
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:53,620
And I would say some conspiracy theories on a scale from 1 to 10,

882
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,940
where 1 is sanity and 10 is total raving lunacy,

883
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,640
certifiably insane, as they say,

884
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,640
I would say most conspiracy theorists are somewhere around

885
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,600
4 above 5 on that scale, and a lot of them have reached 10.

886
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,320
But there are some that are pretty close to 1,

887
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,340
like Carl Oglesby and a couple of other offbeat historians,

888
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,320
Noam Chomsky, Buckminster Fuller, and me.

889
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,940
Conspiracy theories help make sense out of what otherwise seems a senseless world.

890
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,020
That's why so many people believe them, including me sometimes.

891
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,640
How much do you think our own government operates

892
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,280
on the basis of conspiracy theory?

893
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,220
Well, I think they worry about conspiracies more than most conspiracy buffs do.

894
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,660
I think the government is full of people with guilty consciences,

895
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,380
and they're constantly worried we're going to find out what they're really up to.

896
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,720
And so they hire more and more spies to spy on us

897
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,480
to find out what we're doing and saying

898
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,580
to see if we're getting to be a real menace to them.

899
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,120
And of course, that means they need more spies to spy on their spies

900
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,300
in case some of their spies are double agents,

901
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,880
which is well known in this...

902
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,700
in the whole espionage business.

903
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,880
So then they need a third order of spies to spy on the second order of spies,

904
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,220
and eventually you end up with somebody like J. Edgar Hoover,

905
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,700
who uses his power to blackmail the presidents of the United States.

906
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,220
Stalin murdered three chiefs of the secret police in a row

907
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,220
because they found out too much about his own secrets.

908
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,440
And nobody murdered J. Edgar Hoover, at least I don't think so.

909
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,040
I think he died of natural causes.

910
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,860
But he was blackmailing presidents from Roosevelt on.

911
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,140
He blackmailed every president who wanted to do something Hoover did.

912
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,040
Like Nixon said in one of the Watergate tapes,

913
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,720
well, if Hoover performed, he would have scared hell out of them.

914
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,260
He's got a file on everybody.

915
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,500
He's just sensed the envy in Nixon's...

916
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,280
He wanted a file on everybody too.

917
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,600
He was a rank amateur.

918
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,100
Hoover had been at it for 50 years by then.

919
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,500
And a lot of the files disappeared the day he died, by the way.

920
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,160
Nobody will admit they know what happened to them.

921
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,860
Somebody has those files and is still blackmailing them.

922
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,200
They're blackmailing people.

923
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,840
The government is more afraid of us than we are of them.

924
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,620
That's what I always emphasize when I'm talking to radical groups

925
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,340
who think their phones are tapped.

926
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,760
Well, of course your phone is tapped.

927
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,740
If you've done anything to annoy the government, your phone is tapped.

928
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,680
They've probably got a mail cover on you too.

929
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,400
But that just shows they're more afraid of you than you are of them.

930
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,300
The government doesn't trust the people.

931
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,080
And then they wonder why the people don't trust the government.

932
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,560
Well, the people don't trust the government

933
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,040
because they know we're being spied on all the time.

934
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,240
I heard there were over 200,000 lawyers working for the federal government.

935
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,420
You know how much harm a single lawyer can do?

936
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,460
A single lawyer can ruin your whole life, you know, just one day in court.

937
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,380
200,000 lawyers devising modifications and amendments to laws

938
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,560
and working for Congress and changing, you know.

939
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,000
The bureaucracy, the Kafkaesque world they have created

940
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,120
is so onerous, obnoxious, and unbearable

941
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,220
to most of the citizenry that everybody bitches about the government,

942
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,620
at least part of the time.

943
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,980
Ergo, the government knows they are not well loved.

944
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,200
And they're wondering how many of us are joining militias

945
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,600
or forming revolutionary communist parties like those nuts down in the South

946
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,540
or doing something else to overthrow them.

947
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,800
So they've got to keep spying on us to make sure we're not getting too ornery.

948
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,100
And the more the people discover the government is spying on them,

949
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,580
the more they distrust the government.

950
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,380
Too much is always better than not enough

951
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,260
Too much is always better

952
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,760
Too much is always better

953
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,680
It's how we're stuck

954
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,740
Too much is always better

955
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,200
Gotta join this race

956
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,060
Too much is always better

957
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:55,140
too much is always better than not enough

958
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,940
Too much over literally

959
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,340
Too much is always better than not enough

960
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,220
Too much in yards was not enough

961
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,680
Is always better

962
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,980
Accumulate

963
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,220
Too much

964
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,060
Is always better

965
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,380
Than not enough

966
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,560
Too much

967
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,440
Is always better

968
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,740
That's how we're stuck

969
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,900
Too much

970
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,780
Is always better

971
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,160
Gotta join the race

972
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,200
Too much

973
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,060
Is always better

974
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,380
Accumulate

975
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:56,540
Too much

976
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,060
Too much is always better than not enough

977
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,180
Too much

978
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,100
Too much is always better than not enough

979
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,440
You better believe it

980
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,300
Linda, wants to be alone

981
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,680
Yeah

982
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,820
Linda wants to be alone

983
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,120
Linda wants to eat alone

984
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,380
Linda wants to sleep alone

985
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,260
All into the night

986
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,880
Linda wants to be alone

987
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,220
Linda wants to eat alone

988
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,440
Linda wants to sleep alone

989
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,340
All into the night

990
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,160
Linda tells me when to sleep please

991
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,300
You know I try to get my key

992
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,620
The walls are closing in on me

993
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,380
All into the night

994
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,120
Every night I try to teach

995
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,460
Linda, she's so out of reach

996
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,860
The girls are swimming at the beach

997
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,540
All into the night

998
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,180
Linda wants to be alone

999
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,560
Linda wants to eat alone

1000
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,780
Linda wants to sleep alone

1001
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,640
All into the night

1002
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,300
Linda wants to be alone

1003
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,560
Linda wants to eat alone

1004
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,860
Linda wants to sleep alone

1005
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,680
All into the night

1006
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,420
Doctor told me what to do

1007
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,720
I gotta get away from you

1008
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,000
He told me what was real and true

1009
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,780
All into the night

1010
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,460
Every night I try to teach

1011
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,840
Linda, she's so out of reach

1012
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,220
The girls are swimming at the beach

1013
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,980
All into the night

1014
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,560
Linda wants to be alone

1015
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,820
Linda wants to be alone

1016
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,200
Linda wants to sleep alone

1017
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:58,540
All into the night

1018
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,000
All into the night

1019
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,640
Linda wants to be alone

1020
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,960
Linda wants to eat alone

1021
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,300
Linda wants to sleep alone

1022
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,140
All into the night

1023
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,320
Linda, and we were always so happy

1024
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,480
We always got together on Friday afternoon

1025
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,160
Then one day I was kissing Linda over in Berlin Park

1026
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,940
And then she told me she didn't want to see me anymore

1027
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,520
So she started sending me emails saying that everything was fine

1028
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:28,520


1029
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:28,520


1030
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:28,520


1031
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:28,520


1032
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:28,520


1033
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,500
And that it was just too much, too much, too much

1034
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,580
And she was going back to Gary

1035
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,460
So I was real sad

1036
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,380
Why'd you leave me like that, Linda?

1037
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,360
So I went to see Gary

1038
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,740
Gary Wilson and the Blind Dates

1039
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,920
I saw them in New York City

1040
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,760
Then I went to see them in SUNY Purchase

1041
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,840
And one day I'm gonna go to Endicott, New York

1042
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,540
I'm gonna find the house where Gary lives

1043
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,080
And walk the streets that Gary walks

1044
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,040
And I'm gonna take pictures of all the street signs

1045
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,720
You know, I went to see Gary last summer

1046
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,240
All the way, all the way in Escondido, California

1047
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,060
And he came and sat down with me

1048
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,360
He sat right down with me and he said

1049
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,860
What are you doing following me?

1050
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,360
What are you, some kind of sick trip fangirl or something?

1051
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,460
And I said, Gary, calm down

1052
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,120
I'm gonna buy you a drink

1053
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,080
Or maybe a nice green salad or something

1054
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,500
And he said, you know, I don't like salad

1055
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,020
I never developed a taste for that

1056
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,020
But I know what you tried to do

1057
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,120
You tried to take Linda away from me

1058
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,060
Why would you do that?

1059
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,200
Were you kissing Linda Robin?

1060
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,820
I said, Gary, you're right

1061
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,500
I want Linda for my forever lover

1062
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,600
But did I ever tell you?

1063
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,620
I wanna be your mannequin

1064
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,700
Linda wants to be alone

1065
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,020
Linda wants to eat alone

1066
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,380
Linda wants to sleep alone

1067
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,180
All into the night

1068
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,800
Linda wants to be alone

1069
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,120
Linda wants to eat alone

1070
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,420
Linda wants to sleep alone

1071
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,200
All into the night

1072
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,920
Linda wants to be alone

1073
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,220
Linda wants to eat alone

1074
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,020
Linda wants to eat alone

1075
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:05,420
Linda wants to sleep alone

1076
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,380
All into the night

1077
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,880
Linda wants to be alone

1078
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,260
Linda wants to eat alone

1079
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,500
Linda wants to sleep alone

1080
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,440
All into the night

1081
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,220
Linda wants to

1082
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:18,680
Zuora

1083
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,100
You were there

1084
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:20,100


1085
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:20,100


1086
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:20,100


1087
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:20,100


1088
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,400
What?

1089
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,360
Why, why, why?

1090
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,980
Who has written some biographical articles about him.

1091
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,920
There's more at RobinRenee.com

1092
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,680
and also at Audacious11.com

1093
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,880
with 11 spelled out

1094
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,260
if you want to hear her podcast.

1095
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,700
And now more Bob Walkenhorst live at the record bar.

1096
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:38,060
Are you looking for some answers?

1097
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:43,880
Well, you've come to the wrong place.

1098
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:49,860
You might find lines but no valentines.

1099
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,380
You might find lines but no valentines.

1100
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,840
Written all over my feelings.

1101
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:01,760
I bear no grudge and wear no brown eyes.

1102
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,820
I'm with Calisthenics.

1103
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,980
And I don't mean to bring me down.

1104
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,000
But there is no romance.

1105
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,360
I've spent too much of my life waiting.

1106
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,700
Hoping, dreaming, wishing, believing.

1107
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,480
And way too little of it in the name.

1108
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,860
Smashing it up and taking it away.

1109
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,920
I wish someone there.

1110
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,520
Worrying me why.

1111
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,960
I was still a young man.

1112
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:03,660
And save me lots of time and money.

1113
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:07,640
There is no romance.

1114
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,460
No romance.

1115
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,000


1116
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,640
No romance.

1117
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,880
No romance.

1118
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,500
No romance.

1119
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,240
No romance.

1120
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,960
No romance.

1121
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,300
No romance.

1122
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,340
No romance.

1123
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:26,700
No romance.

1124
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:27,220
No romance.

1125
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,360
No romance.

1126
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:28,360


1127
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:33,020
Save your stories for the bartender.

1128
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:38,360
And your crying for the beater.

1129
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:43,920
And your poems and for tiring pages.

1130
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:49,220
To give some time in your day.

1131
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,020
Day.

1132
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,900
Day.

1133
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:02,160
Day.

1134
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,020
Day.

1135
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,460
And maybe God's who hear your prayers

1136
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,600
And I will spend

1137
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:26,280
Men who care and your words

1138
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,140
The thing they will wait forever

1139
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:33,100
Lies the good life

1140
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,620
Movies and books

1141
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:40,440
But the sooner that you learn this

1142
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,540
The sooner you'll be your man

1143
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:51,180
To get on with things that really matter

1144
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:55,060
There is no romance

1145
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,880
No romance

1146
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,640
No romance

1147
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,960
No romance

1148
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,640
There is no romance

1149
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,280
No romance

1150
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,540
No romance

1151
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,180
There is no romance

1152
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,620
No romance

1153
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:17,060
Happy quality time

1154
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,920
One was hairy and one was smooth.

1155
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,300
I was the hairy one.

1156
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,180
And I was struck funny.

1157
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,160
One was hairy and one was smooth.

1158
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,880
Harry, compare these two boys, the hairy one and the smooth one.

1159
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,060
Why them am I this way?

1160
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,940
One who grabs, well, and yet, and then you go down.

1161
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,960
And I don't think there's much.

1162
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,580
There is a deep, deep desire.

1163
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,460
I can tell you a story, what seems to be being said.

1164
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,180
I'm one, our love, so there can be no love in the world.

1165
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:14,920
I quit.

1166
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,140
They're not coming.

1167
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,140
Medieval church, all over the place.

1168
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,100
Promiscuous, promiscuous, naughtiness.

1169
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,320
Promiscuous, freely, freely.

1170
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,580
Very, very profound.

1171
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,620
You cannot really have love.

1172
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,760
I'm the hairy one.

1173
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,260
Bad boy.

1174
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,400
Just because I'm hairy and like to hunt, I'm bad.

1175
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,120
Grabber.

1176
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,340
I, he was a dick, he was a dick con.

1177
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,080
That's nuts.

1178
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,520
When divorce court continues, violent behavior.

1179
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,160
What happened when she took a tire iron?

1180
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,240
I mean, she destroyed the taillights.

1181
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,640
I did, did come a lot.

1182
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,300
But you know that baby is your husband.

1183
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,920
I mean, I'm a lying slut like everybody thinks, you know.

1184
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,280
Yeah.

1185
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,640
He was stealing car stereos.

1186
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,220
I was on probation.

1187
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1188
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,180
You were on probation.

1189
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:04,520
Yes.

1190
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,740
If you don't...

1191
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:05,860
Anyways.

1192
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,480
What was whose what?

1193
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:08,720
Well, that's what, mmhmm.

1194
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,840
And that's what my-

1195
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,880
Just a moment.

1196
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:11,320
Yeah.

1197
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:11,900
Okay.

1198
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:12,540
Crazy.

1199
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:13,440
I was crazy.

1200
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,080
Yes.

1201
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,440
Uh, mental disability.

1202
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,860
And, and that was, and, and, you know, and, and, and, and, and.

1203
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,260
.

1204
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:22,700
.

1205
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,460
.

1206
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:23,460


1207
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:23,460


1208
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:23,460


1209
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:23,460


1210
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:23,460


1211
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:23,460


1212
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:23,460


1213
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:23,460


1214
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:23,500
.

1215
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:23,560
.

1216
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:23,860
.

1217
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:23,860


1218
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:27,620
.

1219
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:27,620


1220
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:27,680
.

1221
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:27,680


1222
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:27,740
.

1223
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:27,740


1224
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,000
I got to tell you, I'm not too bad.

1225
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,000
You know who you are.

1226
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,720
Sometimes what it takes in life is a little anger

1227
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,080
just to propel you on down the road a little bit.

1228
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:02,500
I drove a ship, heard the cybersinkin'

1229
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,520
Swam like a senator, I reached the shore

1230
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,260
On the trip, the mutiny was proven

1231
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:12,720
Now I am a puppet on the bad dream boat

1232
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,700
I'm a lord

1233
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,860
I'm in love with the old girls, singin' like it's cold

1234
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,520
I'm a man without a country

1235
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,940
I'm a boy without a home

1236
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,720
I'm a casual man without a home

1237
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:31,100
I'm guilty of the battle of the roses and the wool

1238
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,540
Of the broken home

1239
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,840
Yes, I got busted

1240
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,480
But drank while thinkin'

1241
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,680
Carrying a weapon under my coat

1242
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,620
I trusted

1243
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:57,180
The wrong

1244
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,840
I'm a man without a country

1245
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,520
I'm a boy without a home

1246
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,120
I'm a casual man without a home

1247
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,760
I'm guilty of the battle of the roses and the wool

1248
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:24,180
Of the broken home

1249
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,060
I'm guilty of the battle of the roses and the wool

1250
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:25,060


1251
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,720
Yes, I got busted

1252
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:27,720


1253
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:27,720


1254
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:27,720


1255
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:27,720


1256
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,120
I see a land of hope

1257
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,020
divided, founded, little

1258
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,620
and the sides are divided

1259
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,220
and everybody again.

1260
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,680
I see so many people

1261
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,740
lonely, lover, hate, lover.

1262
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,520
When you get split, I'm alone.

1263
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,060
I'm alone.

1264
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,620
The old world

1265
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,040
saves you like a stone.

1266
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,940
I'm a man without a country.

1267
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,860
I'm a boy without a home.

1268
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,140
I'm a casualty

1269
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,280
of the battle of the roses

1270
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,200
and the war.

1271
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,620
Of the broken home.

1272
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,540
Of the broken home.

1273
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,160
Bob Walkenhorst,

1274
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,420

And now this from Schizopolis.

1292
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,580
I'm just going to make

1293
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,420
this brief statement

1294
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,920
on behalf of ARHADL.

1295
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,560
The spreading of these erroneous

1296
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,780
and offensive descriptions

1297
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,100
has gone on for decades.

1298
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,900
And we find ourselves once again

1299
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,840
having to make a public statement.

1300
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,040
Race horses do not urinate

1301
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:46,740
more frequently

1302
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,400
or at greater length

1303
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,660
than non-racing horses.

1304
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,520
Or, for that matter,

1305
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,800
any mammal of comparable size.

1306
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,440
This organized,

1307
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,360
publicly sanctioned slander

1308
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,680
must stop.

1309
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,880
Sir, he's not...

1310
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,900
I disapprove of...

1311
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,580
But I will defend to the death

1312
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,420
your right to...

1313
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,400
It's just Bob is what it is.

1314
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:08,880
It's just...

1315
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,300
It's literally Bob.

1316
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,220
Oh, thank you.

1317
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,100
Thank you very much.

1318
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:17,540
Thank you.

1319
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,060
I licked him and how well

1320
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,680
there'll be no more powwow

1321
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,200
with Popeye the same.

1322
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,100
I love that.

1323
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:36,240
I love that.

1324
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,140
Ellery Queen's.

1325
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,360
This is Ellery Queen

1326
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,300
with the case I call

1327
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,800
The Psychological Error.

1328
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,420
Police were befuddled

1329
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,220
by the story of a man

1330
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:44,940
named Ames

1331
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,040
who said he had shot his neighbor

1332
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:46,680
in a fit of shooting.

1333
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,420
With these facts,

1334
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,260
you can determine

1335
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,600
whether it was mechanical failure,

1336
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,560
human error,

1337
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,580
or sabotage.

1338
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,280
In a moment, I'll explain.

1339
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,020
In the case of

1340
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,220
The Psychological Error,

1341
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,700
our ham operator friend

1342
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,840
didn't realize there are

1343
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,260
dozens of American Indian languages

1344
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,480
still spoken at sea.

1345
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,480
Listen again to Ellery Queen's...
