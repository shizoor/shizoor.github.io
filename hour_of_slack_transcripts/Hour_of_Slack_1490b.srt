00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,500
And good evening. You are tuned to Synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland at 9.3 FM.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,560
And many views or opinions expressed on this program will not necessarily be those of WCSB or Cleveland State University.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,640
And this is another special episode here where we have special guests here once again.

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,400
Reverend Stang and Princess Wee and Reverend Baby Bear have joined us.

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,700
Oh, we can't get home.

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,460
Oh, no.

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,060
Yeah, that's the only reason we're here.

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:32,360
We're trapped.

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,060
Why do I have to say all the funniest things when the microphones aren't on?

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,200
I know I can't prove that to you guys, but just believe me.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,060
What I was saying is hilarious.

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,900
Everyone in here was just rolling on the ground.

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,080
I'm still catching my breath.

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,360
And as soon as the microphone comes on, it's like, oh, no, it's all gone.

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,980
Well, you know, what we were talking about is this whole daylight savings time thing.

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,120
And, you know, there's an old subgenius tradition.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,560
Of?

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,240
Time control.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,480
But daylight savings time is similar to false slack.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,680
It is false time control.

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,420
Time control going out of control.

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,940
It is conspiracy time control.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,520
It's the conspiracy trying to sell us time control after they've taken it from us.

24
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,980
It's exactly like false slack that way.

25
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:16,940
Taint fair.

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,880
Yeah.

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,840
Taint fair, they should be in charge of it.

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,380
Well, there's some places that reject it.

29
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,100
They don't do it.

30
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,080
Taint fair at all.

31
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,420
Taint fair.

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,900
Well, you know, the only states that reject it out of hand are.

33
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,380
Taint fair has been nearly as.

34
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,700
Has tainted in the last few years.

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,660
I used to love going to tank fair.

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,800
The display booths were disgusting, but still, it was interesting character.

37
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,200
You know, you shouldn't taint me talking about that on the air.

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,180
We were trying to have a high minded discussion.

39
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,300
Couldn't taint.

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,140
You had to drag it down.

41
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,400
Yeah, that's my job.

42
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,620
Praise Bob.

43
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,600
So to speak, high minded.

44
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,580
But you know what?

45
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,500
The upside, apparently, you know, when this this whole false time control conspiracy time control.

46
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,740
They're thinking, though, that it might be useful to combat global warming since the sun's going down an hour earlier now.

47
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,440
Yeah, right.

48
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,100
Yeah.

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,380
Also, if you want to combat global warming, everyone should just turn their air conditioners on full blast and open their windows so you can cool the outside.

50
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,140
Wow.

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,820
That's brilliant.

52
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,460
Yeah.

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
So these are some helpful life.

54
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,380
Pro tips.

55
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:27,860
Making.

56
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,080
You know, you're going to be a terrible face.

57
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,740
This is a public service.

58
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,760
We're doing this to help people.

59
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,460
That's right.

60
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,300
And the hippie campgrounds.

61
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:50,480
They get mad if you sit in your car running the air conditioning in order to cool down because it heats up people outside of the cars even more.

62
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,100
So why don't all the hippies just get in their cars and turn on the air conditioner?

63
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,300
I didn't get it.

64
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,180
Why don't you just move to a cooler climate?

65
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,040
Cooler than northern Ohio.

66
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,780
This is the coolest place ever, man.

67
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,100
Most of the hippies I know don't have a car.

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,720
They're not real hippies if they have a car, really.

69
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,520
But you know what I'm talking about.

70
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,340
I know.

71
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,520
Maybe like a VW.

72
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,640
But our customers, that's what we're talking about.

73
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,900
They don't actually most of them don't have cars either.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,180
Oh, well, forget it.

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,140
You know who else I don't think has a car?

76
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,520
We are getting a caller here.

77
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,940
You're on the air.

78
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,880
No, no.

79
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,520
Don't.

80
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:28,560
Don't.

81
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:28,560


82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:28,560


83
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:28,640
Don't.

84
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,860
Are you?

85
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,760
You're on the air.

86
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,460
Hello, everyone.

87
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,480
Hello, No Money Mark.

88
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:34,800
Welcome to the program.

89
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,400
Do you have a car?

90
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,580
What is the make and model of your car?

91
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,040
What color is it?

92
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,200
Whatever a make and model RTA has for their buses.

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,480
Okay.

94
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,440
That is a satisfactory answer.

95
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,480
You may speak on the program now.

96
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,700
We saw No Money Mark at the big party last night.

97
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,020
Yeah.

98
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,160
The WCSB Halloween.

99
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,660
Yeah.

100
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:04,380
He was hard to miss because it was he was in some sort of an intense orange outfit.

101
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:04,800
Yes.

102
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,800
Oh, yeah.

103
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,260
See, the thing is, yeah, my brother found me this, I guess, orange hunting jacket at

104
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,420
a secondhand store and I'm using it as my winter coat now.

105
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:22,020
And everybody I meet seems to like it if they say anything about it at all.

106
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:28,400
And it is actually a good thing to have if you're walking or biking at night, which I

107
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,240
do sometimes.

108
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,300
I missed it.

109
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,480
I don't remember seeing it.

110
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,480
Well, you I can see how it would be useful in hunting and that you would not look like

111
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,280
a deer to the other hunters, no matter how drunk they were, even if it was Dick Cheney.

112
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,760
By the same token, it seems like it wouldn't be very good camouflage because that thing

113
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,440
really it was almost day glow.

114
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,280
We were up in the balcony with the projectors and I think it was it was blinding even from

115
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,720
up there.

116
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,160
How do I not remember this?

117
00:04:59,220 --> 00:04:59,900
Also, who knew?

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,040
I don't know what what you don't know what no money mark looks like.

119
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,860
Well, no, that's true.

120
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,320
But I don't remember seeing the bright orange thing that you're describing.

121
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,520
But I was going to say, I don't know what spectrum the deers deer can see in.

122
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,320
Not deers.

123
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,280
I'm educated.

124
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,960
I know these things.

125
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,600
So how do you guys get to go up in the in the projection booth?

126
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,540
Because we're the projectionists.

127
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,540
Yeah, you have to have your union card for that.

128
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,600
Did you see me leering down?

129
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,100
On the crowd in my pig mask?

130
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,240
Well, I mean, I was mostly paying attention to the band on stage.

131
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,660
Okay, fine.

132
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,760
If you looked up the ceiling, there were these there were these projections.

133
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,560
I don't care of underwater movies befitting the underwater theme of the prom.

134
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,380
The high school.

135
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,180
I did see those.

136
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,720
Yeah, that that sort of Pink Floyd type stuff.

137
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,100
Yeah.

138
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,460
Yeah.

139
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,900
Well, that's my job.

140
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,360
I put together a collage of underwater stuff.

141
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,320
Usually done by me, by somebody else already on YouTube.

142
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,240
And I said I was going to help him.

143
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,060
But instead, I just stood up there and leered at people in a pig mask.

144
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,780
And he brings the projectors and he sets them up and he takes them back.

145
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,380
But anyway, so it was great seeing the two of you there.

146
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,120
Dr. Sinister, it was not so great not seeing you there.

147
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,760
What are you talking about?

148
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,220
I saw you.

149
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,760
Well, okay.

150
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,800
So what outfit were you wearing?

151
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,200
Come on, Mark.

152
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,060
I'm really starting to get sick of this game that you keep playing with me.

153
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,480
You seem to be such a big fan, but you never recognize me anymore when we meet.

154
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,760
I'm starting to wonder if your face blindness has come back.

155
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,980
It never went away.

156
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,100
I mean, I actually went up to a guy who was wearing a trench coat like you did one year

157
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,420
because I thought maybe he was you and he looked a little like you.

158
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:53,740
But I was like, I'm not sure.

159
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:53,740


160
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:53,740


161
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:53,740


162
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:53,740


163
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:53,740


164
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:53,740


165
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:53,740


166
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:53,740


167
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:53,740


168
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:53,740


169
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:53,740


170
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,000
I mean, so, well, if you were there, why didn't you say hi to me?

171
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,040
I did, Mark.

172
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,180
You must have too many of those Schwarz beers.

173
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,340
Those were good.

174
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,900
They were strong.

175
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,100
There were actually a couple people in trench coats.

176
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,280
There were two double team costumes.

177
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,660
One was Scully and Mulder, which was great.

178
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,780
And the other one was Agent Dale Cooper and a Laura Palmer wrapped up in plastic wrap.

179
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,720
Oh, yeah.

180
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:23,720


181
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,480
I missed those.

182
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,600
You guys didn't see that?

183
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,240
Oh, it was good.

184
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,100
We're getting some more callers here.

185
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,640
You're on the air.

186
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:34,980
Hey, guys.

187
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,520
How are you doing?

188
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,360
Good, Buddha.

189
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:36,900
How are you doing?

190
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,540
Okay.

191
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,520
I got three of the best costumes that I saw there.

192
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,360
I got to mention them.

193
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,900
One was the tree.

194
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,220
Exactly.

195
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:48,780
Oh, yeah.

196
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,760
That tree was really good.

197
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,400
That was awesome.

198
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,720
I mean, you couldn't drink any beer because you didn't have any alcohol.

199
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:53,720


200
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:53,720


201
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:53,720


202
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:53,900
I was in my arms.

203
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,220
I felt bad for him.

204
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,560
It was like a walking tree.

205
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,920
She had a great knothole.

206
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,140
He didn't drink beer.

207
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,980
She couldn't tell if it was being used either.

208
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,580
Another one was inside it dressed as a barn owl or something.

209
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,440
Yeah.

210
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,340
It looked like an owl.

211
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,680
I never really quite got to see it.

212
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:12,680


213
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,620
It was hard to make out on that.

214
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,000
There was a real good odorous saliva.

215
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,640
It would be hard to make out when you're in that costume.

216
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,320
Yeah, that's true.

217
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,200
Yeah, that would be.

218
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,720
He was dressed as one of the Drugs from Clockwork Orange.

219
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,520
One of the Drugs.

220
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,800
The ghost of Odorous Urungus of Gwar was there.

221
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:31,740
Right.

222
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,260
Right.

223
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,220
Of course, it might not have been Dave Brockie because anybody can wear the suit.

224
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,820
I mean, for the last three years of Gwar's tours, that wasn't really Dave Brockie singing

225
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:41,960
it.

226
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,640
Yeah, that was a nice one, too.

227
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,500
He retired.

228
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,600
He just paid some guy to go out and sing those Gwar songs.

229
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,180
Sick of you.

230
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,180


231
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,020
I was going to say sick of Gwar.

232
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,020
I'm so sick of you.

233
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,620
Oh, oh.

234
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,840
He was so sick, so sick of Gwar.

235
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,260
Well, the subgenius of that band got sick of it.

236
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,440
He got sick of taking pratfalls and getting injured.

237
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,640
The subsecutioner was a dues-paying subgenius.

238
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,560
He was the founder of the band, actually.

239
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,140
Really?

240
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,600
But he was the first one to retire because he was the Curly.

241
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,220
And it hurt.

242
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,720
Oh, God.

243
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,480
It got hurt a lot.

244
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,960
He almost drowned on fake blood.

245
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,160
Yeah.

246
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,360
He was in the blood.

247
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,940
A couple of times.

248
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,400
More than once.

249
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,100
Yeah, when he was in the O.J.

250
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,280
Simpson suit and they cut his face off, the blood hose was turned around the wrong way

251
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,000
and he was almost drowned.

252
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:32,940
Oh, God.

253
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,320
I got to work with that band for five days before we were fired.

254
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:37,880
Wait, blood hose?

255
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,580
It wasn't real?

256
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,200
They don't really do that stuff?

257
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,240
Baby Bear, some things that you see in rock and roll shows are fake and some are real.

258
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,460
The ones you see at the subgenius shows are real.

259
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,540
They really are sewing their lips shut and cutting their eyeballs out.

260
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:02,180
The GWAR was more like the Three Stooges in stinky, real stinky costumes.

261
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,300
Can I ask why you were fired?

262
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,100
Actually, we both were fired and quit at the same time.

263
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,720
It just wasn't working out.

264
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,600
This executioner thought he wanted to bring some highfalutin spoken word to the GWAR audience

265
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,880
in the form of Church of the Subgenius, which was a noble thought.

266
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,440
But basically, heavy metal fans aren't going to sit still for a preacher, no matter how

267
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,100
good the videos are or how much cussing the preacher does.

268
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,060
They're expecting GWAR to come out and cut his face off.

269
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,120
So I very quickly had to shift gears.

270
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,360
In fact, the first show we did at Cleveland, people threw stuff at me.

271
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,820
I'll tell you, 50-cent pieces hurt when they hit you smack in the forehead.

272
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,140
I got off stage and this guy goes, I hit you right in the forehead.

273
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,900
That was cool.

274
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:58,140
So after that, I realized, okay, I need to just keep it to 10 minutes and keep them thinking

275
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,580
that I'm about to leave.

276
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,720
The whole time?

277
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,880
Right, the whole 10 minutes.

278
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,320
Every minute of the 10 minutes.

279
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,660
And kind of do this stupid jock drive time DJ that comes out and goes, I was backstage

280
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,200
with Ben.

281
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,880
Are you ready to rock?

282
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,180
All that kind of thing.

283
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,520
I had to kind of do that.

284
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,120
Eventually, after five nights, first off, me and my partner, Jesus, went to the gym.

285
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,460
We're literally physically sick.

286
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,260
I don't know how you rock stars can tour like that, baby.

287
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,960
Oh, it's hard.

288
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,020
It's hard work.

289
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,680
And it obviously just wasn't working out.

290
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,840
And Odorous, meanwhile, had realized that I was getting paid more for 10 minutes of

291
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,700
baloney than he was for an hour and a half in that sweaty suit.

292
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,040
So he came lurching up to us and goes, we got to have a talk.

293
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,860
And Jesus and I said, yeah, we're going to get off this tour.

294
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,800
It's just not working out.

295
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,240
And he goes, what?

296
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,080
I was going to fire you.

297
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,980
You're not going to sue us?

298
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,840
No, no, no.

299
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,120
It's just, you know, duh.

300
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,060
It just didn't work.

301
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,860
You should have just come out with the bloodhose.

302
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,540
Sexy was crazy.

303
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,100
And he went, wow, you guys are cool.

304
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,020
You're not going to sue us.

305
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,580
You're the first ones that haven't sued us.

306
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,160
So, you know, we parted on very good terms.

307
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:12,840
And I shot all of their shows from, I had nice balcony places I could get to because

308
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,180
I was part of the show, sort of.

309
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,320
And I shot a bunch of those.

310
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,720
And I've seen them as bootlegs.

311
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:17,780
I've seen them as bootlegs.

312
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,600
I've seen them as bootlegs.

313
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:18,600


314
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,120
I've seen them on YouTube with no credit to me.

315
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,240
Thank goodness.

316
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,280
So, yeah, some of the GWAR videos from the 90s, from the year of 1995, I think it was.

317
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,400
The Chicago one on YouTube was shot by me up in the balcony.

318
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:33,780
Oh, yeah.

319
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,020
One of the things that...

320
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,540
You guys, if you guys don't...

321
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,040
Go ahead.

322
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,660
One of the things I used to see people do, you know, the local country station is WGAR

323
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,520
and people would cut and paste the letters to turn it into a GWAR sticker.

324
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,760
GWAR.

325
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,640
Caddy. I did that on my Caddy.

326
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,340
I used to turn

327
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,480
Sound Warehouse bumper stickers

328
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,040
into Sound Whorehouse.

329
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,120
That was real easy to do.

330
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,540
And I can't even say, not even

331
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,680
after hours can I say what I used to do

332
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,060
to rock the vote

333
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,500
stickers. That was real easy

334
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,400
to change with some white out

335
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,440
and a black marker.

336
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,460
Rock can be

337
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,480
turned into another four-letter word really

338
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:13,820
easily.

339
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,240
Now remember, kids,

340
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,180
let's rock the vote.

341
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,060
Whatever that means.

342
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,140
Oh, by the way,

343
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,620
shake the ballot box

344
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,720
really hard.

345
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,600
By the way, one other thing.

346
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,440
Since reverse psychology

347
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,160
works on subgeni,

348
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,240
I would like to mention

349
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,080
that they should also not

350
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,160
donate to Radio Sound this month.

351
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,180
Oh, yeah, no kidding. Don't ever

352
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,180
donate, especially not to Hour

353
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,600
of Slack.

354
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,140
Or Synesthesia. Actually, we probably

355
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,480
don't, no matter what we say, they won't.

356
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,060
Last year was

357
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,840
atrocious for us.

358
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,900
The station as a whole did fine.

359
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,800
But our two shows, which

360
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,380
this is not traditional,

361
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,580
did punk.

362
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,460
So, I mean,

363
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,660
I don't know what's wrong with you people.

364
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,120
You listeners must not think we're

365
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,340
funny enough or

366
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,080
smart enough or

367
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,600
clearly enough or something.

368
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,900
Hey, if I'm not alienating

369
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,820
listeners, if I'm not alienating

370
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,040
listeners,

371
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,040
I'm not doing my job.

372
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,060
Kill the audience.

373
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,980
Sorry, guys.

374
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,780
It was funny.

375
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,040
To be my last show, I did pretty well.

376
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,840
And if I might do some

377
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,520
shameless self-promotion,

378
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,020
I will be back

379
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,280
doing my old slot

380
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,560
for Radio Sound.

381
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,520
Oh, you are?

382
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,980
Oh, good. You want to do my

383
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,960
slot, too? You'll probably raise

384
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,160
more money than we can.

385
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,880
We've already started

386
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,140
doing it now.

387
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,020
I just,

388
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,320
I just have to say that, to be honest,

389
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,040
Dr. Dark was not in town last year.

390
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,400
He gets the ball rolling.

391
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,000
It's like the magic thing.

392
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,700
When he makes his donation, then you just get,

393
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,280
they just start rolling in.

394
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,300
But because he was out of town...

395
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,920
Maybe we need to make up some

396
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,660
fictitious donors.

397
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,300
Maybe.

398
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,400
And start saying, okay, we got Joe from

399
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,900
Beachwood who donated.

400
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,540
I do that every year, too.

401
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,440
$200. Thanks, Joe.

402
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,900
And here's

403
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,740
Esmeralda from...

404
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,400
Maria. Thanks so much, Esmeralda.

405
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,480
But then people might think that you're doing really well

406
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,700
and be like, ah, see, they don't need it. They're doing fine.

407
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,920
But don't you want to be in on this?

408
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,800
Don't you want to be in on

409
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,420
what all the cool people are doing? And furthermore,

410
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,580
earlier in the week you donate. This is the selling point

411
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,220
I always make. Because there are some

412
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,480
gifts that we have available

413
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,500
for our donors that are only available

414
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,160
in limited quantities. So if you wait

415
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,220
all week to make your donation,

416
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,560
you might miss your chance to get those things. So that's

417
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,640
why you should donate during this program

418
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,360
or the Hour of Slack.

419
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,360
There's always some really good, bad films

420
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,460
in VHS and now, I guess,

421
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,460
in DVD form.

422
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,420
And there's only one of each

423
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,600
of those. I always read off all the titles

424
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,000
of them, and occasionally it prompts

425
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,340
a sale if the movie is bad

426
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,140
and sleazy.

427
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,560
By the way, I just read an article about how VHS

428
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,600
is coming back, at least

429
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,420
for all these low-budget

430
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,120
horror movies.

431
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,820
Right, yeah. Well, and it's like...

432
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,480
It would cost more to distribute something on VHS,

433
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,460
than by any other format that's been

434
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,640
in use in the last 20 years.

435
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,740
I have a VHS player because

436
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,400
it's really easy to find all of the

437
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,160
Disney movies for like 50 cents

438
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,400
at thrift stores, and there's no way I'm gonna

439
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
pay like $25 a disc

440
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,500
and have to wait until they come out

441
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,620
of the vault or whatever

442
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,520
stupid thing that they do.

443
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,380
I want Disney now.

444
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,200
I have to look at my VHS

445
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,660
because, you know, it's...

446
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,560
I got all these bondage flicks I still have to watch.

447
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,580
You know, so...

448
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,620
You have to.

449
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,520
That's right.

450
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,900
I want to.

451
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,020
There we go. Now we're getting

452
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,760
somewhere now.

453
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,140
The funny ones

454
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,740
are the 80s, where the girls

455
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,500
are supposed to be

456
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,460
making all this money and all that,

457
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,480
but their hair is two-toned

458
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,660
because they can't afford the hair dye.

459
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,020
Yeah, this subject is probably

460
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,560
a little out of my...

461
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,140
Sticks and stones may break my bones,

462
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,660
but whips and chains excite me.

463
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,840
I watched porn in the 80s.

464
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,260
Princess, you're kind of an 80s lady.

465
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,060
Kind of.

466
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,540
You must know something about that hairstyle.

467
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,780
You still have it.

468
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,180
Yes.

469
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,180
Old-fashioned.

470
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,100
Actually,

471
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,080
I just...

472
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,780
I actually gave it to a friend of mine,

473
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,980
a professional submissive.

474
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,160
On our Slack,

475
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,400
he did a song that was like that.

476
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,100
It was...

477
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,320
It was under...

478
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,480
These are my favorites.

479
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,000
These are my favorite things.

480
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,980
Ball gags and...

481
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,880
Dog eggs?

482
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,160
No, that might have been a...

483
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,840
Ball gags.

484
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,300
Yeah, that might have been...

485
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,720
That sounds like it might have been

486
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,180
a Phineas Narco.

487
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,960
Man, this reminds me of one of our radio buddies.

488
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,320
That does sound like Phineas.

489
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,300
Actually, I'll come back to that in the second hour.

490
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,640
The thing I was going to say.

491
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:09,800
By the way,

492
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,560
Reverend and Princess,

493
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,960
there's something I brought up on the show last week.

494
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,840
I'd like to get your reaction to it.

495
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,680
Flyer, I saw at a rapid station.

496
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,960
The one side says,

497
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,600
smile, God loves you.

498
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,880
And on the other side says,

499
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,100
but if you reject his love,

500
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,640
given a great sacrifice at Calvary,

501
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,020
it would be better for you not to have been born.

502
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,660
And then there's a bunch of Bible quotes.

503
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh, that's too deep.

504
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,140
Well, I think that people should pick up on that.

505
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:41,920
So wait, is that...

506
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,420
Jesus died for your sins.

507
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,660
Is that advocating abortion?

508
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,560
Jesus died.

509
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,600
Jesus died.

510
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,140
Jesus died on the cross

511
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,180
because he had a bit of a God complex

512
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,280
and he was just too proud to say the safe word.

513
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,600
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

514
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,440
So if you're going to...

515
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,820
And it's okay to laugh at that joke

516
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,000
because if you know what a safe word is,

517
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,120
you're probably going to hell anyway.

518
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,300
So if you waste the sacrifice,

519
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,520
you shouldn't have been born.

520
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,200
That was what the gist was, right?

521
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,120
No, it says,

522
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,940
if you reject his love,

523
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,960
it will be better for you not to have been born.

524
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,580
Right, because you're going to live forever

525
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,300
in eternal damnation,

526
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,440
which apparently hurts.

527
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,540
So then, abortion?

528
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,640
Is abortion okay?

529
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,580
If the baby's going to reject Jesus' love?

530
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,520
Now, if...

531
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
And this is the thing I don't get on.

532
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,380
I did it.

533
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,000
I went there.

534
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,220
I'm already there.

535
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:26,820
They will say,

536
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,760
free will, free will.

537
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,780
And like, okay,

538
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,040
but does that mean that you can surprise God

539
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,920
with the choices that you make?

540
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,600
God needs a lot of help.

541
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,880
He is pathetically weak

542
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,240
and he needs the help of the little old redneck ladies

543
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,920
to pick on the people that are being mean to God.

544
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,340
Like me.

545
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,720
You know, God needs people to help him

546
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,140
in his battle against evil

547
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,960
because he really can't do much of anything

548
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,420
for himself, evidently.

549
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,900
And that's why he needs all those busybodies.

550
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,720
That's kind of like what the Pope was saying

551
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,620
earlier this week.

552
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,460
You know, we don't want to paint him as a wizard

553
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,320
with a magic wand who can do anything.

554
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,860
I thought they did.

555
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,060
I thought that was the whole idea.

556
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,520
What's been happening?

557
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,980
You know, irony died a long time ago.

558
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,980
Well, yeah, I heard that the Pope came out

559
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,740
and basically said,

560
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,000
hey, you know, you creationists are nuts.

561
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,700
Come on.

562
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,600
That's old church doctrine, actually,

563
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,720
which is one of the great ironies

564
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,880
of the history of Western civilization

565
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,640
that suddenly the Catholics seem to be more reasonable

566
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,840
on a lot of issues than the Protestants.

567
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,460
What, what?

568
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,780
Who'd have thunk it?

569
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,300
Hello, you're on the air.

570
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,720
Hey, how you doing?

571
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,160
Good, how are you?

572
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm doing just fine.

573
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,920
I was just calling in.

574
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,740
I thought that was Thayton for a second.

575
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,260
So did I.

576
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,860
But there's no lisp, so it can't be Thayton.

577
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,300
You know, you're not,

578
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,640
this fake voice you're doing is not funny.

579
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,040
Sounds like Emo Phillips.

580
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,340
I can't.

581
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,600
Actually, you sound like an idiot.

582
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,520
That was, that's like,

583
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,840
that was a really pathetic,

584
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,620
yeah, really pathetic excuse for a prank call.

585
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,160
Yeah.

586
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,660
Bring back Thayton.

587
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,020
We demand Thayton.

588
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,740
I read this,

589
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,500
it's one article,

590
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,980
and it was talking about,

591
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,520
you know,

592
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,300
the birth of the nativity,

593
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,320
and, you know,

594
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,520
Jesus was visited by three wise men.

595
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,160
None of them were Jewish.

596
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,560
And so the one guy brought up,

597
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,120
so he was visited by three Alistair Crowleys then.

598
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,320
Because, you know,

599
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,480
back then wise men were,

600
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:35,700
you know,

601
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,600
basically, you know,

602
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,160
you're magicians and wizards.

603
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,700
Well, but Alistair Crowley was just a big mouth.

604
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,160
He wasn't a magician.

605
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,480
He wasn't a magician.

606
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:43,760
He wasn't a horror wizard.

607
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,460
He was just a con man.

608
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,760
I should know.

609
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,060
He knew how to kill people.

610
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,280
I should know.

611
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,780
And on top of it,

612
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,440
one of them was a Zoroastrian,

613
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,280
I think, right?

614
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,720
The guys that worship Zoro and write Gs everywhere.

615
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,100
Now, you could argue that they were the first Christians

616
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,540
because they recognized the Christ.

617
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,120
Right.

618
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,740
Yeah.

619
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,540
And they brought him Frankenstein and Myrrh.

620
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,180
Gold, Frankenstein and Myrrh.

621
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,480
I actually,

622
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,860
I also like the Rosicrucians,

623
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,640
the guys who worship roses.

624
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,080
Well, the Rosicrucians,

625
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,900
no, actually, the Rosicrucian thing,

626
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,980
not that you could get a modern Rosicrucian to admit this,

627
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,500
but it was based on some satirical pamphlets made by a couple of wise guys

628
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,840
back in the 1700s.

629
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,620
I thought it was founded by Rosencrantz.

630
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,560
Yeah, he was a made up character.

631
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,380
He was a piece of clip art.

632
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,480
That was the amazing thing.

633
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,600
The thing was, the guys,

634
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,800
towards as they got older,

635
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,600
the two, the guys,

636
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,460
I can't remember their names.

637
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,320
That had penned this sarcastic pamphlet about,

638
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,140
it was basically about the new agers of their time and the mystics.

639
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,140
It was making fun of them,

640
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,520
but it had,

641
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,060
it was done with a straight face.

642
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,040
Sound familiar?

643
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,060
Well, people,

644
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,620
all these other smart asses of the period started going,

645
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,440
well, you know,

646
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,120
I know this is supposed to be a joke,

647
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,800
but this stuff is,

648
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,580
this is for real.

649
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,420
I can just tell it rings true.

650
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,260
And, and the guys who wrote it finally started going,

651
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,360
no, no way.

652
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:12,500
They,

653
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,440
we did that a long time ago.

654
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,300
It was just a joke.

655
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,300
You're crazy if you believe this stuff.

656
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,480
And yet now the Rosicrucian is,

657
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,760
is a recognized minor fringe religion,

658
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,980
but it's been around for a long time and they take themselves real seriously.

659
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,540
There's many books done written by,

660
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,360
let's call it trance writing.

661
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,420
I know how that's done.

662
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,040
They read,

663
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,900
this all sounds,

664
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,700
it's like golden plates out of the hat,

665
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:42,980
right?

666
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:43,940
Well,

667
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,160
that was my uncle.

668
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,960
That was my uncle,

669
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,860
my great uncle,

670
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,800
Joseph Smith that did the golden plates routine.

671
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,360
There are,

672
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:58,560
it is sickening how many existing religions were started as a joke.

673
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,480
Hint,

674
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,060
hint,

675
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:00,640
hint.

676
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,180
And it's horrifying to me.

677
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,700
You got them all riled up.

678
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,340
Can you,

679
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:10,220
can you blame me for occasionally like I did at the witches ball,

680
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,520
just popping the giant balloon grossly.

681
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,680
I have my fingers crossed behind my back,

682
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,300
you know,

683
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:16,700
but I,

684
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,420
there's just people who need to be deprogrammed from the sub genius cult.

685
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,960
Now that's a sick and sorry situation.

686
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,560
Oh God.

687
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,480
Someone get the jam,

688
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,940
get the jam for his nose.

689
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,480
By the way,

690
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,220
Reverend staying a trance writing.

691
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,960
Does that have anything to do with,

692
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,480
um,

693
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,320
uh,

694
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,000
ingesting copious quantities of alcohol beforehand?

695
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,320
That has never really seemed effective.

696
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:42,620
I mean,

697
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,780
I'm not saying that it's not effective to me for that purpose,

698
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,000
but you know,

699
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,320
I asked Condor S Thompson that question.

700
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,940
It worked for him,

701
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,400
I guess.

702
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:49,780
Well,

703
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,200
well,

704
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,240
but he wouldn't recognize it.

705
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,200
Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

706
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,260
I want to say that it worked for him.

707
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:54,640
Oh,

708
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,460
I'm a coffee man.

709
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,120
My son's,

710
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,360
uh,

711
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,280
one more person has been calling in here.

712
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,460
I'm the froppet,

713
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,660
the coffee froppet.

714
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,520
I'm the profit.

715
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,640
Hello.

716
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,240
You're on the air.

717
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,160
People.

718
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,420
Yeah.

719
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:06,680
People.

720
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,040
Sure.

721
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,460
Hello.

722
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:07,820
You are on the air.

723
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,020
Speak right up there.

724
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,500
Hello.

725
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,640
Hello.

726
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:12,520


727
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:12,660
What's up,

728
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:12,860
everybody?

729
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,720
That's a full house,

730
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,040
right?

731
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,000
I'm doing pretty well.

732
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,400
I missed the gathering last night.

733
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,640
Yeah.

734
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,600
We missed you.

735
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,160
I know.

736
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,600
I didn't know what I was going to wear,

737
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,420
and I would have had to have hitched a ride.

738
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,700
You couldn't drive there yourself,

739
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:30,960
huh?

740
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,240
Well,

741
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,480
they asked to get one of those Google cars,

742
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:35,800
man.

743
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,420
You can get one of those Google self-driving cars pretty soon.

744
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,500
I didn't dress up because I was going to just wear nothing but inline pants.

745
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,420
I didn't dress up because I was going to just wear anything but inline skates and go as

746
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:43,960
a pool toy.

747
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,000
Or maybe, Bear, just so you know, our caller Keith is blind.

748
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,440
Can't you use a GPS, though?

749
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,820
Ours tells us to turn left, turn right.

750
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,040
It's never on.

751
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,100
It's always a little light, though.

752
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,600
It's always just a little off.

753
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,100
It's like we were talking about that.

754
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,900
If you were a blind person and you were following the directions of the GPS voice, we'd all

755
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,360
all be dead.

756
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,820
Because it tells you to turn when you're sitting at a light.

757
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,760
So, I mean, it doesn't know that you're

758
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,500
at a light.

759
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,980
It's only a robot.

760
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,340
It's just a little robot.

761
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,800
Actually, then I probably

762
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,920
get around better than

763
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,680
without a GPS.

764
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,980
Could be. Just randomly.

765
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,020
But no, I missed going last

766
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,180
night. Even though I had no idea what I was going

767
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,040
to wear, I was probably just maybe going to come and

768
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,360
drag.

769
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,680
Now that would have been interesting.

770
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,320
You would have been among...

771
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,040
Because on sale

772
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,020
a couple weeks ago, they had a special costume

773
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,640
by a certain

774
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,300
star

775
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,920
of a movie, which of course is my

776
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,000
favorite movie of all time.

777
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,420
The Wicked Wizard of Oz.

778
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,940
And I would have loved

779
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,680
to have worn that.

780
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,320
The Wicked Wizard?

781
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,920
No, the witch. The witch, of course.

782
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,200
Of The Wizard of Oz.

783
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,220
There were quite...

784
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,460
Quite a few characters from The Wizard of Oz.

785
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,420
Really? Oh, I would fit in.

786
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,260
Oh, yeah, there was a scarecrow and a derby.

787
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,940
And a scarecrow, yes.

788
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,240
I did not see a cowardly lion there.

789
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,000
I did not see a cowardly lion either.

790
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,800
Uh-oh. Oh, boy! And I have a fur coat!

791
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,020
There were a lot of...

792
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,240
I have to admit, there were a lot of people dressed

793
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,000
vaguely like Clark Kent.

794
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:22,920
Oh!

795
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,220
With glasses. Yes.

796
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,460
Kind of nerdy look. You know, they were...

797
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,620
What? Superhero? Me? No, no.

798
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,760
Thanks. I just figured out one.

799
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,840
That I kept seeing last night. I was trying to figure out

800
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,760
who it was. It was a Ned Flanders.

801
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,280
Yeah, there was a Ned Flanders there.

802
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,800
Yeah, there was the green sweater

803
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,860
and the purple shirt, and I was trying to figure it out.

804
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,640
And he had a mustache, and I was trying to figure... He had the glasses.

805
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,140
And I kept looking at it, and I was like, I know what that is.

806
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,060
I know what that is, and someday it's gonna come to me.

807
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,460
He actually had a sign on his... Yes!

808
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,800
For Shane Flanders.

809
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:51,620
Aw.

810
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,600
I did it. I figured it out. I won. What do I win?

811
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,000
He knows. I would have had to ask

812
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,380
everybody what they were wearing.

813
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,020
And then they would have

814
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,900
lied to you. Oh, I'm not wearing anything.

815
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,020
And then I would have to say, okay, well, let me fill you up

816
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,220
then.

817
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,120
Oh, geez.

818
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,380
Oh.

819
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,480
Well, that's amazing.

820
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,380
It's my...

821
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,700
Robot voice.

822
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,000
We are experiencing technical

823
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,680
difficulties.

824
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,300
Well, one thing

825
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,140
hasn't changed.

826
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,700
What happened?

827
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,940
That was a cool effect.

828
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,720
It was. Yeah, you know, you have to pay

829
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,920
extra for the plug-in

830
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,660
that does that on your audio program.

831
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,660
Absolutely. So who...

832
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,300
What costume won last night?

833
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,780
I blinked and

834
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,160
missed the costume contest.

835
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,980
Yeah, me too.

836
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,940
I don't remember the costume. I know they got up on stage

837
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,860
for a second, and they were talking about it,

838
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,060
and I just... I can't even

839
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,140
remember who the three finalists

840
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,140
were. I just don't remember.

841
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,120
The three didn't get on stage.

842
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,140
Aw.

843
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,120
It was a guy in some kind of inflatable suit

844
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,220
that I noticed finally deflated

845
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,020
towards the end of the evening.

846
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,220
I'm guessing that he had some kind of

847
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,020
a battery-operated pump that was

848
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,280
keeping that thing blown up.

849
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,460
Unless someone was blowing them off.

850
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,760
Depending on where he was wearing the pump

851
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,800
strapped onto him.

852
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,480
By the way, Keith, did you listen to the show over the radio?

853
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,040
Actually, yes,

854
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,040
I did.

855
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,200
And there was a lot of good

856
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,780
music.

857
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,460
What are we even doing here?

858
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,060
Yeah, I would like to do my impression

859
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,120
of X-Blank X.

860
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,180
There was quite a bit

861
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,120
of buzzing, wasn't there?

862
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,040
It's funny.

863
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
At first,

864
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,120
there was,

865
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,820
and I know several people, including

866
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,760
myself, started calling in,

867
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,040
and then it stopped.

868
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,960
And then they said, oh, oh,

869
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,700
okay, thank you. Must be interference.

870
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,820
Okay, we'll fix it.

871
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,880
The third band had a lot

872
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,560
of technical troubles. I was wondering

873
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,720
what they were doing at the station during all those

874
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:06,780
long...

875
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,700
I felt sorry for the band and

876
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,740
myself because it was a punk

877
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,860
band and their songs were only a minute and a half long,

878
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,740
but it took them two and a half to three minutes

879
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,700
between songs to solve

880
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,660
their issues.

881
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,720
At one point, I was up in the balcony and I went downstairs

882
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,600
and used the restroom and came back to the balcony

883
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,120
and they still hadn't started their next song.

884
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,740
And when they finally did, it was only one

885
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,860
minute long. And I had to stand in line at the

886
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,160
bathroom because it's a girl's bathroom.

887
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,080
But once it was fixed,

888
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,540
it sounded very good

889
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,680
and enjoyable.

890
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,180
How many people were there?

891
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,440
Um,

892
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,400
more than one,

893
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,340
more than one, less

894
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,720
than, um,

895
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,340
500.

896
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,540
You're kidding.

897
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,780
It was a lot smaller than last year.

898
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,620
I think Madonna was actually keeping

899
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,000
a tab on it.

900
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,440
And what'd they say?

901
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,780
I don't know. I left early.

902
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:00,600
Wow.

903
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,760
Trying to get on. Let's see how crazy we can get at this

904
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,220
show tonight. Hello, you're on the air.

905
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,200
You're on the air.

906
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:08,560
Hello.

907
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,120
Hello?

908
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,900
Just cut loose.

909
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:12,880
What?

910
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,000
Hey.

911
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,060
Hello?

912
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,240
Yes. Welcome to the program.

913
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:22,980
Huh?

914
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,580
What's happening, Dr. Stenister?

915
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:27,740
Not much.

916
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,460
What's happening with you?

917
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,380
Can you hear me?

918
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,200
What's going on?

919
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,580
Whatever you need to say, just yell it. Just say it.

920
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,300
Hold on one second here.

921
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,640
What am I supposed to hold on to?

922
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,840
We're all around each other.

923
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,120
Welcome to the program.

924
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,040
Yes, how are you?

925
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,200
I can't complain.

926
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,380
We're not allowed to complain.

927
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,400
How did we bash yesterday?

928
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,940
It was, uh...

929
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,800
It's what we've been talking about.

930
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,080
It was terrible.

931
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,440
Nobody came.

932
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,240
Nobody moshed.

933
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,320
I got injured horribly.

934
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,040
But the beer was really good.

935
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,300
Oh, the beer was terrible.

936
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,060
The beer made everybody sick.

937
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,160
They all went blind afterwards.

938
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,060
Oh, really? Oh, boy, then I'm not alone.

939
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,340
Good.

940
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,040
The moral of the story is you have to...

941
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,940
I had with the show last night

942
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,880
some moshy morons.

943
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,600
Ooh.

944
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,700
Oh, I was thinking that there should be,

945
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,140
like, a bunch of people.

946
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,140


947
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,640
some people who wanted to injure

948
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,880
as many people as possible.

949
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,680
No, actually, the moshers were so...

950
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:36,920
Oh, they're very polite.

951
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,260
...careful and polite that I joined them.

952
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,160
Of course, I was wearing a suit of armor.

953
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,560
Literally, I had a big metal shield with a dog hood on it.

954
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:45,600
And a sword.

955
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:45,600


956
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,900
And these kids would...

957
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,600
It was...

958
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:55,080
I made a really good target, and I kind of let them come charging at me with this shield.

959
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,120
I even got knocked down.

960
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,740
It was the first time I ever moshed.

961
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,480
I'm 61 or something years old.

962
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:01,860
I've been in the military for a long time.

963
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:01,860


964
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:01,860


965
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,140
I've never...

966
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,780
They had invented moshing when I was old enough to do it safely.

967
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,700
Even I considered doing it for a second, but...

968
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,020
And then I didn't.

969
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,340
You would have gotten stepped on.

970
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:11,880
Oh, no.

971
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,320
I've...

972
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,280
If I had...

973
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,520
If I were 10 years younger, you...

974
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,940
Oh, age is only a number, honey.

975
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,600
Baby Bear is actually a bass player in a rock and roll band.

976
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,660
Yeah, but I don't get down in the crowd and mosh.

977
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,460
Actually, I get super mad when all the punk kids show up at the metal shows and try to

978
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,400
mosh and just ruin everybody's good time.

979
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,420
I was thinking...

980
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,400
I actually thought about moshing with a cotton rinduant that I remembered.

981
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:31,840
I actually thought about moshin' with a cotton rinduant that I remembered.

982
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,900
No, I'm 55 years old.

983
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,920
This is not a good idea if I walk in the pit.

984
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,480
Oh, I'm 56 and I'm still young and kickin' it.

985
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,220
I actually had a great time down there with the mosh man.

986
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,060
I guess it was great.

987
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,440
Yeah, but Keith, if you were in the pit, you wouldn't know what you're in for,

988
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:46,720
would you?

989
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,240
I was thinking that what we need to do...

990
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,080
Like, you were talking about the mishearing.

991
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,740
You thought you were going for some nosh and thinking somebody should open a deli called

992
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,360
the nosh pit.

993
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,540
Exactly.

994
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,200
Yeah.

995
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,640
That's a true Yiddish word, noshing, of course.

996
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,100
Right.

997
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,820
Keith and I know that very well.

998
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:01,820


999
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:01,820


1000
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:01,820


1001
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:01,820


1002
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:01,820


1003
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,300
Is that where they got the phrase, he noshed his teeth?

1004
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
He was noshing his teeth.

1005
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,540
That's ganashin'.

1006
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:09,660
Yep.

1007
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:10,740
Ganesh.

1008
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,880
I'm so mad at these.

1009
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,420
Ganesh?

1010
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,520
I could nosh my teeth.

1011
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,480
Yeah, I gotta say with the mosh people...

1012
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:16,900
Morphing words.

1013
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,660
They were very polite young...

1014
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,660
Yeah, with the mosh people, maybe I'm being a little overly sensitive.

1015
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,380
It just ain't...

1016
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:22,600
Uh-oh.

1017
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,440
You are.

1018
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,240
Yeah.

1019
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:24,540
Why are you so...

1020
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,540
They were nice young ultra-violent droogs.

1021
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,020
Ooh.

1022
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,820
It's just that, I mean, I'm not a fan of the mosh people.

1023
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:31,820


1024
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:31,820


1025
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:31,820


1026
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:37,260
I mean, I just don't like being jostled like that, even if only for a moment, even if

1027
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,500
accidentally and...

1028
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:38,980
Huh.

1029
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,180
You're old.

1030
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,640
Honestly, Mark, I can relate.

1031
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,240
I never liked that either.

1032
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,820
Now it's interesting for me.

1033
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:46,940
Yeah.

1034
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,840
I mean, I don't mind if they do it.

1035
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,600
I just don't want to be part of it.

1036
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,620
So when they start, I try to be elsewhere.

1037
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,300
I used to, but now I've...

1038
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,940
As long as our hands don't wander in certain areas, I don't mind anymore.

1039
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,800
I'm gonna bring my suit of arms.

1040
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:01,800


1041
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,720
I've armored every metal show.

1042
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,260
You know, Mark, I could teach you how to deal with him.

1043
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:07,400
Yeah.

1044
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,080
I could teach you how to deal with him.

1045
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,820
What do you say?

1046
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,020
I think the worst experience I had in the pit, it was actually, it was kind of a play

1047
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,440
on words, you know, Fall Out-a-Looza.

1048
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,460
It was the Butthole Surfers did a matzo ball pizza tour.

1049
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,200
Oy!

1050
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,360
And it was Fleming Lips, Stone Temple Pilots and them.

1051
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:30,660
Yeah.

1052
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:38,220
And I actually, when I got out of the pit, basically I was pantsed.

1053
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,860
I can't believe it.

1054
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,200
Long story short.

1055
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:42,580
Yeah.

1056
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,000
And it started this fad.

1057
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:49,080
He was walking away with his pants halfway down and 10 years later, everybody's doing

1058
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,280
it.

1059
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,500
I used to have good times in the pit when I was younger.

1060
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,200
I couldn't appreciate that.

1061
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,360
I can't handle it anymore.

1062
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,660
You're old.

1063
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,260
I know.

1064
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,240
I feel old.

1065
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,260
I used to...

1066
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,420
Oh, come on.

1067
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:01,660
I used to be a little bit older.

1068
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:01,660


1069
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:01,780
I used to be a little bit older.

1070
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,900
I used to enjoy it so much.

1071
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:08,460
I would get these big, huge, tall dudes to like do, you know, put their hands together

1072
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,780
to make the little like step for, and they would, I would put my foot in it and they would

1073
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:16,280
launch me and I would do all of that crazy crap was all about it.

1074
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:16,800
That sounds fun.

1075
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,660
You crazy kids.

1076
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,400
Oh boy.

1077
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,500
I missed out on a lot of fun.

1078
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:20,880
Oh.

1079
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,020
Well, that didn't happen.

1080
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,380
I didn't...

1081
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:28,780
That's pretty tricky to do that because you're like six foot five and point four, three-fifty

1082
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:29,340


1083
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:29,480
percent.

1084
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:29,640
Yeah.

1085
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,080
Those guys must have been huge.

1086
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:31,620
Yeah.

1087
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,560
Baby Bear is...

1088
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:32,840
Ooh.

1089
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,880
That's an ironic name.

1090
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,340
She's actually really big.

1091
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:35,840
Yeah.

1092
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,900
Like the size of an actual bear.

1093
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,620
Yeah.

1094
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,200
Yeah.

1095
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,620
She's...

1096
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,120
That's where the nickname comes from.

1097
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,080
If you think how big a baby bear is, they're actually pretty large.

1098
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,120
Oh boy.

1099
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,720
I didn't know the party was going to be hands on.

1100
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,100
Ooh.

1101
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,340
Now you just...

1102
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,340
Look what you've done.

1103
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,540
You just pulled down the whole thing.

1104
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:53,540


1105
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,440
What did I miss?

1106
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,100
Oh boy.

1107
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,660
It's conversation screeching halt.

1108
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,260
Okay.

1109
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:58,640
Bye guys.

1110
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:58,960
Done.

1111
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,320
Bye.

1112
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,080
Oh boy.

1113
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,380
Have you been...

1114
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,680
Are you properly shamed?

1115
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,120
Are you...

1116
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,760
Are you done?

1117
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,420
You're going to be good now?

1118
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,100
Are you going to come out of the corner, take the dunce cap off?

1119
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,580
That was Buddha.

1120
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,540
But we got one more caller.

1121
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,740
Hello you're on the air.

1122
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,180
Hello you're on the air.

1123
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:23,520
Hello?

1124
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:24,580
Hello?

1125
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:26,920
Hello?

1126
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,000


1127
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:27,880
Yes.

1128
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,320
Oh boy.

1129
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,320


1130
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,320


1131
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,320


1132
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,320


1133
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,320


1134
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,320


1135
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,320


1136
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,320


1137
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,320


1138
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,320


1139
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,320


1140
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,320


1141
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,980
I'm back again.

1142
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:30,860
Oh, good.

1143
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,760
You're back.

1144
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,680
How are you?

1145
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,140
Yay.

1146
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,320
Anyway.

1147
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,940
And so, moving on.

1148
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,940
Yeah, he's actually getting close to the 11 o'clock hour right now, so.

1149
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
Oh, my God.

1150
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,420
I know I have to pop a pill.

1151
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:49,820
I know.

1152
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,620
Yeah, I've got another several hours of this here to go.

1153
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,320
I will be filling in for Keith tonight.

1154
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:56,880
Oh.

1155
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:57,780
Oh.

1156
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:58,740
Really?

1157
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,480
Yeah.

1158
00:37:59,480 --> 00:37:59,740
Ouch.

1159
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,260
Man.

1160
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,680
Yep, I'm doing some overtime.

1161
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,120
Hey, well, why not?

1162
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:05,880
Why not?

1163
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,520
We all enjoy the shows and.

1164
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,960
Yeah, all four of us.

1165
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,160
Absolutely.

1166
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,180
And all five of us listening in.

1167
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:17,600
Oh, yeah.

1168
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,360
No, I was including you guys.

1169
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,160
Do you get time and a half for the overtime?

1170
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,260
That's right.

1171
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:22,860
Yeah.

1172
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,380
I'm getting paid one and a half times what I usually get paid.

1173
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:25,640
Yeah.

1174
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,000
That's entertainment.

1175
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,100
Oh, yeah.

1176
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,020
Mm-hmm.

1177
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,220
Actually, we haven't checked in on the listeners at all, like, the entire time.

1178
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,440
We've got 33 online right now.

1179
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,060
We didn't hit the.

1180
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,380
We didn't check for the hour slack.

1181
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:40,800
Yeah.

1182
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:46,240
I was hoping we could exceed the goal that we set two weeks ago.

1183
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:46,720
That's all right.

1184
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,520
We just have to.

1185
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,060
Wait a second.

1186
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:48,380
Wait a second.

1187
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,860
If we have 33 listeners online, this must be a sign.

1188
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:56,440
Well, we had 40 last time Baby Bear was advertised as being online.

1189
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,100
Yeah.

1190
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,800
Because they know that she performs.

1191
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,000
She performs nude on the radio.

1192
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:00,500
Yep.

1193
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,240
Really?

1194
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,540
Really.

1195
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,520
Even though she weighs 350 pounds.

1196
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,060
Baby Bear.

1197
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:04,820
Pretty good.

1198
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,220
And the fur is not that thick.

1199
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,220
Who is trying to control their clap-on lamp?

1200
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,800
That is the sound of listeners masturbating.

1201
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,160
Oh, wait a minute.

1202
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,260
My lamp's always out.

1203
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:20,720
Oh, okay.

1204
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,140
Oh, yeah.

1205
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,120
Oh, yeah.

1206
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,460
Play sex music.

1207
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,680
Oh, yeah.

1208
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:26,860
Oh, yeah.

1209
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,140
Oh, yeah.

1210
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,320
Oh, yeah.

1211
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:28,500
Oh, yeah.

1212
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:28,760
Oh, yeah.

1213
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:28,760


1214
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:28,760


1215
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:28,760


1216
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:28,760


1217
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:28,760


1218
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:28,760


1219
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:28,760


1220
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,440
What happened to Sean?

1221
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:29,740
Oh, yeah.

1222
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,660
Oh, yeah.

1223
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,460
What ever happened to masturbating Sean?

1224
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,340
Did anyone ever...

1225
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,260
Here we go again.

1226
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,680
We're going to sit around and talk about all the people who used to call in.

1227
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,020
But he was...

1228
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,740
Just his name is funny.

1229
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,380
You know, he's worth bringing up.

1230
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,300
Remember that one guy?

1231
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,960
Yeah, I remember that one guy.

1232
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,320
He is great.

1233
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,340
Boy, do I miss that one guy.

1234
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,280
I miss him, too.

1235
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,800
He was on for that one time a few years ago.

1236
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,880
We can dream that he would call in again, maybe.

1237
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,300
Well, let's take a moment to remind everyone that this is WCSB Cleveland 89.3 FM.

00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,200

1242
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,080
Amen.

1243
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
This is WCSB...

1244
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,720
You're a little frisky tonight, Keith.

1245
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,980
I've got to say, you are much more lively than you are on some other nights.

1246
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,820
I'm in a good mood.

1247
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,800
All right.

1248
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,980
Glad to hear it.

1249
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,220
Yeah, I'm in a good mood.

1250
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
I had a good week.

1251
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,960
I'm feeling good.

1252
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,520
Good.

1253
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,320
Good for you.

1254
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,660
And we just have to be thankful for what we have.

1255
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,880
I've had a weak week.

1256
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,960
I'm feeling weak.

1257
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,860
Seven days will make one week.

1258
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,960
That's right.

1259
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,560
That's right.

1260
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,020
Bad puns.

1261
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:57,620
So let's...

1262
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,660
Let's see.

1263
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,500
Take another caller here.

1264
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,100
That's 216-687-3515.

1265
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
Hello, you're on the air.

1266
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,140
That's probably...

1267
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:07,780
Dr. Sinister.

1268
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,100
St. Bernard.

1269
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,760
Yes.

1270
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:19,160
On Halloween, I yelled in a store and I canceled everything I had planned for that evening.

1271
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:19,940
Really?

1272
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,300
Because I'm on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine.

1273
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,960
Because you are on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine.

1274
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,640
Those of you who are on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine,

1275
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,720
you could probably find out online.

1276
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,200
You could probably find out online.

1277
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,160
Thank you.

1278
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:31,740
Okay.

1279
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,600
Bernie reminds me of another, of Bernard.

1280
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,420
Oh, that was Bernie.

1281
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,860
Yeah, I thought it was for a second.

1282
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,180
Yeah, that was Bernie.

1283
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,220
I have a serial message lever.

1284
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,020
Oh.

1285
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,240
I thought I was, like, about to witness some serious, like, history in the making.

1286
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,520
I thought you were coming face-to-face with Bernie for the first time.

1287
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,540
Dr. Sinister has Bernie and I have Bernard.

1288
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,640
I used to play Bernard's calls on Hour of Slack every now and then years ago, but...

1289
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,180
It's too depressing.

1290
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:58,720
He hasn't.

1291
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:58,940
He hasn't stopped.

1292
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,980
And he's so clearly...

1293
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,580
If I was playing him, they'd be funny, but I'd be...

1294
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,240
It's not funny.

1295
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:05,840
He's sad.

1296
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,540
I would be exploiting a mentally ill person.

1297
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,700
That's why it makes me sad.

1298
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,060
Oi, why not?

1299
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,980
That's the whole purpose of this radio show.

1300
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,220
Right, yeah.

1301
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,980
Present company included.

1302
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,240
But, yeah, it's...

1303
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:28,700
Believe it or not, I have drawn a certain line where I won't exploit certain crazy people.

1304
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,940
No matter how funny they are to everybody else, because they're not trying to be funny.

1305
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:40,140
They're trying to warn you about the conspiracy, which is usually pretty personal with them.

1306
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,140
Absolutely.

1307
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:46,920
Yeah, they usually believe that the conspiracy has taken a personal interest in them.

1308
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,980
And taken over.

1309
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,580
Oh, yeah.

1310
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,240
You know what?

1311
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,460
Let me look up and see what's on the current cover of Rolling Stone.

1312
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,700
Whatever it is, it's meaningful and has something to do with...

1313
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,380
Call her Bernie.

1314
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:07,940
I love the way that Bernie did not provide a URL or any kind of information about what he was talking about.

1315
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,780
Wait, are you guys trying to say that you've been doubting this?

1316
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,960
Right, it shouldn't be self-evident.

1317
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,140
You guys sound like...

1318
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,160
I don't...

1319
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,180
I mean, it seems legit to me.

1320
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,800
What's the...

1321
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,040
You guys need to be...

1322
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,960
Stop being so suspicious.

1323
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,420
We've only been listening to Bernie for eons.

1324
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,620
Well, Princess, you're adorable.

1325
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:28,840
You're adorable.

1326
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,340
They don't even say what's on the current cover anywhere on their front page of the website.

1327
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:40,460
They want you to be surprised and buy it.

1328
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,720
No, they want to discredit Bernie.

1329
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,860
Maybe they're referring to Stephen King.

1330
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:52,640
The headline is Stephen King, the Rolling Stone interview, and that might very well be on the cover.

1331
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,860
And they've also got Paul Rubens.

1332
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,640
Oh, yeah, Pee-Wee's coming back, right?

1333
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:57,880
Yeah.

1334
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:57,960
Yeah.

1335
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:58,960
Pee-Wee's coming.

1336
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,060
He's going to do a new Pee-Wee.

1337
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,100
Will the Dobbs head still be in the Playhouse?

1338
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,000
They took that out.

1339
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,920
Yeah, that was only the first season.

1340
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,500
Season two, they took that out.

1341
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,080
Yeah, but it was for the first season of Pee-Wee's Playhouse.

1342
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,360
He had a Dobbs head on the set.

1343
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:19,320
It was put there by Gary Panter, who was mentioned an hour ago on the station.

1344
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,240
And they used it in the title.

1345
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,860
So kids saw Bob every Saturday morning.

1346
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:27,860


1347
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,640
When they tuned in to see Pee-Wee.

1348
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:34,480
And one episode, Pee-Wee had the word of the day was OK.

1349
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,700
He looked in the camera.

1350
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,940
It was a close-up of Pee-Wee.

1351
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,960
But Bob was visible prominently over his shoulder.

1352
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:49,560
So all these four-year-olds saw Pee-Wee going, OK, with Bob right behind him.

1353
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,060
OK.

1354
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:56,020
And then later, their parents said, well, Pee-Wee was arrested for masturbating in a theater.

1355
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:56,400
Oh!

1356
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,740
Gay theater.

1357
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,120
And the kids just went, so?

1358
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:08,100
But Pee-Wee, but CBS didn't say, so?

1359
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,860
They said, your career is over, buddy.

1360
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:14,960
That was a shame.

1361
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,820
I'm glad that Pee-Wee's coming back.

1362
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,180
Although, you know, he still owes us 20 bucks.

1363
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,220
He left a message on my answer machine going, this is Paul Rubin, also known as Pee-Wee Herman,

1364
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,900
would you send me one of those subgenius memberships and bill me?

1365
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,780
And I did.

1366
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,540
But he never paid up.

1367
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:40,940
So I figured that putting the Dobbs head in the minds of millions of children was worth $10 of his $20 memberships.

1368
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,920
Paul, Pee-Wee, whatever you call yourself now, you still owe us 10 bucks, buddy.

1369
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,780
Better pay up.

1370
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,020
That means he's only half-saved.

1371
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:49,860
I don't mean it that way.

1372
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,380
Oh, you're not going to include interest.

1373
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,300
You don't want to do that again.

1374
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,680
Wallet, wallet.

1375
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:56,740
Wallet.

1376
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:56,740


1377
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:56,860
Wallet.

1378
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:57,200
Wallet.

1379
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:57,200


1380
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:57,200


1381
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:57,200


1382
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:57,200


1383
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:57,200


1384
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:57,200


1385
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:57,200


1386
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:03,860
His mug shot on the cover of our scene, the stark fist, with the phrase martyr or something like that.

1387
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,420
He was in Mystery Men after that.

1388
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,640
Yes, the spleen.

1389
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:13,960
Yes, Mystery Men was one of my favorite terrible, terrible movies that happened.

1390
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,040
You know, Bob Burden, who drew the flaming carrot that that was loosely based on,

1391
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:25,020
was telling us all that this was going to be the movie that put weirdos on top.

1392
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:25,940
He was saving.

1393
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,200
Bob Burden was saving.

1394
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:37,020
He was saving us all because Mystery Men was going to be such a big hit that all of us weirdos would be famous by glint of being, you know, part of his, or by dent of being his friends.

1395
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,220
It was a really big deal to me.

1396
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,680
I saw it and I was like vindicated.

1397
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:42,220
Yeah.

1398
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,480
I thought it was a really funny movie.

1399
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:53,060
It was my favorite superhero movie for a long time because it was about what would happen if a bunch of losers thought they were superheroes.

1400
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:57,140
Now, since then, there have been dozens of movies like that.

1401
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,160
Most of which are pretty good.

1402
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,780
About people who think they're superheroes or try to be.

1403
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,680
And I don't mean the Kick-Ass series, although that was interesting.

1404
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,780
Invisible Griff is one that not many people saw, but it was really good.

1405
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,800
You know, I'm still not very good at throwing forks.

1406
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:16,420
Huh?

1407
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,200
I'm still not very good at throwing forks.

1408
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,560
I've been trying it ever since I saw the Blue Raja.

1409
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,260
You fork up?

1410
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:21,840
I can't do it.

1411
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,020
But I shovel.

1412
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,320
I shovel well.

1413
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:24,660
Yeah.

1414
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,220
Oh, me too.

1415
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:26,820
Neurodynamic.

1416
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,260
But I am great at being invisible when no one is looking.

1417
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:31,860
Yep.

1418
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,880
I can do that too.

1419
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:33,740
I can relate.

1420
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,020
All subgeniuses have some useless superpower.

1421
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,580
That's right.

1422
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,100
And you are on the air.

1423
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,440
What's your useless superpower?

1424
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,400
Go.

1425
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,040
Mine?

1426
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,440
No, the person that's on the air.

1427
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,900
Well, we did this two weeks ago.

1428
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,720
No, the caller on the air.

1429
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,300
Oh, yeah.

1430
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,840
What's your useless superpower, caller?

1431
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,060
Whip it out.

1432
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,480
Oh, yeah.

1433
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,580
You have two seconds to be funny.

1434
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,780
Two, one, go.

1435
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,000
Come on, man.

1436
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,160
The red on the air light is on.

1437
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,520
It's the unfunniest whistle ever.

1438
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,100
It's like a deer in the headlights.

1439
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,620
We made it so easy for him.

1440
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,180
Ouch.

1441
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,460
Killing the audience.

1442
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,280
I think many people are still recovering from your party.

1443
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:19,920
Hmm.

1444
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,080
Maybe.

1445
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:25,340
Princess, we and I didn't wake up until one o'clock but then later in the day, we

1446
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:25,460
found out that we were still getting a little bit of sleep.

1447
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,460


1448
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,460


1449
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,460


1450
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,460


1451
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,460


1452
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,460


1453
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,460


1454
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,460


1455
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,460


1456
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,460


1457
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,460


1458
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,460


1459
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,460


1460
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,460


1461
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:29,880
We found out that it was really, was noon because time had changed and they didn't

1462
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,140
tell us.

1463
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:30,480
Exactly.

1464
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,320
You didn't fall back.

1465
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,160
No.

1466
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,580
In fact, it's really midnight for us now.

1467
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,580
No, I don't think that you, I think that you didn't wake up until like two.

1468
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:47,140
No, we got, we were, I got out, I'm pretty sure, well, two, no, two and yeah, that's

1469
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,680
in yet another time change.

1470
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,260
I'm lost.

1471
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,440
Lost in time.

1472
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,620
What time did everybody part ways last night?

1473
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,780
Well, they kicked everybody out about one o'clock or so.

1474
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,240
Yeah.

1475
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:01,460
Oh.

1476
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:06,400
Yeah, they, they, you know, the band's in, they show, you know, everybody has to

1477
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,000
leave or clean, or help clean up.

1478
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,320
We left.

1479
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:10,740
Yeah.

1480
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,320
Then they scatter real fast.

1481
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,240
We cleaned up our, we cleaned up the balcony.

1482
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,100
We took all of our beer cups out.

1483
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:16,800
Sure did.

1484
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,860
And I threw away a bunch of beer cans and other things that were on the floor.

1485
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,380
So I.

1486
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,100
Oh, that's a nice mark.

1487
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,220
You're a good WCSB volunteer.

1488
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:27,580
Yes.

1489
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,600
A lot better than me.

1490
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:35,080
Well, I did provide the video projections and I worked for at least a half a day on

1491
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:35,260
that.

1492
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,280
All right.

1493
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,760
Let's take another caller here.

1494
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:40,360
You're on the air.

1495
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:42,600
How you doing?

1496
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,040
For some reason, I can't hear you then, but I'm going to start with this.

1497
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,840
My superpower is growing mushrooms all my own.

1498
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:51,840


1499
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:51,840


1500
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:51,840


1501
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:51,840


1502
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:51,840


1503
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:51,840


1504
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:51,840


1505
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:58,300
The reason why is because when I'm streaming it by myself, I can eat the mushrooms.

1506
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,360
Now, can I hear you?

1507
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,540
I don't know.

1508
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:01,980
Can you?

1509
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:03,620
Nope.

1510
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,920
You guys are really bad on the connection.

1511
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,140
Must be the cell phones or something.

1512
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,720
Where do you hear all the mushrooms?

1513
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,700
Now this is a.

1514
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:13,100
Do you have cell phones?

1515
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,580
What do you have?

1516
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,740
I don't know.

1517
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,300
Is she speaking English?

1518
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,520
I'll tell you what.

1519
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,840
I'd like to donate to your show because I'm a big fan of your show.

1520
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:21,840


1521
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:21,840


1522
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:21,840


1523
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:21,840


1524
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:21,840


1525
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:21,840


1526
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:22,820
I'm a big fan of your show.

1527
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:22,820


1528
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,900
You guys need some updated equipment.

1529
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,160
How do you?

1530
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,040
Sound, sound.

1531
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:28,660
That was.

1532
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,140
It's the falsetto that's insulting the station.

1533
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,300
Is the caller still there?

1534
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,080
No.

1535
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:35,180
Also, staying terrified.

1536
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,660
He can't hear.

1537
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,220
Can't hear anything.

1538
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,200
Just so you know, like if you, if, if, uh, if you're, if you're eating the mushrooms

1539
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,840
that grow on your own body, it's, it's not going to work.

1540
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:51,740
You're still losing energy because the mushroom can only grow by eating your body to begin

1541
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:51,760
with.

1542
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:51,820
And then you're just going to have to, you know, get rid of the mushrooms.

1543
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:51,820


1544
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:54,020
Yeah, but it makes you a real fun guy.

1545
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:01,020
I love mushrooms, but the ones that are growing not on me.

1546
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,000
I was going to say that I'm sorry the caller is no longer there because I was going to

1547
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,140
ask him how many in Pluto we're doing.

1548
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,780
That was only sporadically funny.

1549
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,960
I got to give you points for that one.

1550
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,520
That was clever.

1551
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,720
We need Dr. Dark.

1552
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:21,800
We need Dr. Dark.

1553
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:21,800


1554
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:22,020
Dr. Dark here.

1555
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:22,840
Ooh.

1556
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:23,960
Ooh.

1557
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,200
She's channeling Dr. Dark.

1558
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:25,920
I'm always in the dark.

1559
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:33,660
We have a friend, Dr. Dark, who is really deadly with puns.

1560
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:33,920
Yeah.

1561
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,220
He's really, really good at, that's his superpower.

1562
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,040
Right.

1563
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:37,480
He can't stop.

1564
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:42,160
I mean, was Dr. Dark, was Dr. Dark named after the villain on Defenders of the Earth?

1565
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:47,320
No, he's, he's named that because he runs a drive-in at X Day Drills.

1566
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:47,780
Ooh.

1567
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,500
Oh, cool.

1568
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,800
We have a three nights of, or two nights at least of night.

1569
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:52,440
Yeah.

1570
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:52,440


1571
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:52,440


1572
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:52,440


1573
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:52,440


1574
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,260
What was, what were the last ones he showed?

1575
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,080
Machete Kills.

1576
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,900
We've shown Big Man Japan.

1577
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,280
That was a really, really weird one.

1578
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:12,920
Oh, he had the double bill one year of Abraham Lincoln Vampire Slayer and Jesus Christ Something

1579
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,280
Slayer and FDR.

1580
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,780
Actually, I just remember one of the ones that they did this year and I don't think

1581
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:19,760
I can say it on the air.

1582
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,520
Uh oh.

1583
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:20,520


1584
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:22,700
Yeah.

1585
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:22,900
Yeah.

1586
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,500
The last one, the last one regrettably went up, but...

1587
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:42,500


1588
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:42,500


1589
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:42,500


1590
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:42,500


1591
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:42,500


1592
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,140
We gotta say, is that the first movie, what's the second one?

1593
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:43,640
Is that lançerpeak after the end?

1594
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:43,640


1595
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:43,800


1596
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:43,960
Yeah.

1597
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:43,960


1598
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:43,960


1599
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:43,960


1600
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:44,440
Well, and we talked aboutitié.

1601
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:44,960
Yeah.

1602
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,520
So, is that season three done?

1603
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:46,520


1604
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:47,740
It's not done yet.

1605
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:47,860
When are we done?

1606
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,340
We have the last two shows.

1607
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:48,820
It's New Year's Eve.

1608
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,240
What's yourbull быстрys doing now?

1609
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:50,500
Well, it's January 3rd.

1610
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,100
that they could say the title.

1611
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,140
Yep, it's a real movie.

1612
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,340
That's the only reason

1613
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,300
for it to exist.

1614
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,040
No, there's another good reason.

1615
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,420
The other good reason was to have

1616
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,440
naked ladies

1617
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:05,680
that were

1618
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:07,900
writhing on the floor

1619
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,660
because they were being eaten by ants

1620
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,900
that came out of a thing.

1621
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:13,820
That was the thing.

1622
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,700
It's a real thing that happened.

1623
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,500
It's a real thing.

1624
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,300
This certainly isn't appealing

1625
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,120
to prairie interest.

1626
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,660
You notice I didn't hit the button.

1627
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,520
They used props.

1628
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:29,220
I know.

1629
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,780
They were plastic props.

1630
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,080
It's like those Russ Meyer movies.

1631
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,540
He could get away with...

1632
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,880
The silly putty things looked really real.

1633
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,840
Russ Meyer did these series of fabulous

1634
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,500
some were comedies

1635
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,500
and some were thrillers.

1636
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,080
They were softcore porn.

1637
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,540
What made them

1638
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,220
legal was that

1639
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,900
the male genitalia that was shown

1640
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,340
was never real.

1641
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,680
They were plastic and kind of obviously

1642
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,760
made of plastic or rubber

1643
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,980
and going boing boing.

1644
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,800
The ladies

1645
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,340
were real.

1646
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,380
Because of that

1647
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,120
at that time, which I guess

1648
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,760
would be the 70s mostly,

1649
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,420
you could then show them

1650
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,900
and they wouldn't get an X rating.

1651
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,360
They'd just get an R rating.

1652
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,200
They could still be in...

1653
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,400
semi-respectable theaters.

1654
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,380
By the way, I gotta say that

1655
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,360
Ant Farm Dickhole, based on the title,

1656
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,760
that's the kind of movie I would pay

1657
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,420
a lot of good money never to see.

1658
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,640
No, man, do yourself a favor.

1659
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,240
Just watch it.

1660
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,900
Just do it, man.

1661
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:35,940
Come on.

1662
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,580
What's the matter, you're afraid?

1663
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:38,820
We had to do it.

1664
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,880
Well, you're afraid your parents,

1665
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,520
your mom and dad's gonna find out?

1666
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,620
If I had to watch it,

1667
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,820
I'm dragging all of you down with me.

1668
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:47,760
I'm not doing this alone.

1669
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,420
I'm not.

1670
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,320
I'm living with this.

1671
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,360
I'll go, but you would have to

1672
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,620
audio describe it to me.

1673
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,540
It's pretty...

1674
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,740
I wonder if it's one of those movies

1675
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:56,200
that has one of those extra audio tracks

1676
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,380
for the visually impaired audience.

1677
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,460
Yeah, you'd be really confused, I think,

1678
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,560
because you just hear a lot of screaming

1679
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,540
and a lot of jerking off noises.

1680
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,760
A line of ants are parading

1681
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,620
from the urethra.

1682
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,020
Yeah, that's basically what it's about.

1683
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,400
The ants are climbing...

1684
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,400
They're all over the woman.

1685
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,340
It's a very...

1686
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,140
It's an honestly titled movie.

1687
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,520
You know, some movies you get a...

1688
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:27,860
It's probably gonna make a good double feature

1689
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,320
with the human centipede.

1690
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,520
Actually, that's not a...

1691
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,120
That's probably what they were hoping for.

1692
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,500
I don't think I'd be able to sleep for a few days.

1693
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,540
I downloaded the human centipede

1694
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,880
and kind of skimmed through it,

1695
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,380
and I was afraid to watch it.

1696
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,520
I decided I didn't need to do...

1697
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,780
I wasn't in the room when he skimmed.

1698
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,520
I watched the South Park episode parodying it,

1699
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,120
so I decided that that was enough.

1700
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,380
I was done.

1701
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,560
No, I actually want to see it.

1702
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,240
You guys are...

1703
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,860
Don't mistake it for The Human Centipede 2,

1704
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,640
which is a completely different movie.

1705
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,120
It's about a guy who saw the first one

1706
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,480
and wants to make it happen in real life,

1707
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:12,160
and he stalks and abducts one of the stars of the first one.

1708
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,560
But, of course, that was just a movie,

1709
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,400
but this guy really tries to do it.

1710
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,480
And it's an amateur surgery.

1711
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,860
He's a surgeon, not a professional mad scientist

1712
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,200
like the guy in the first movie.

1713
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,160
You're making this up as you go on.

1714
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:23,620
No, I'm not.

1715
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:24,140
No, I'm not.

1716
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:24,920
It's for real.

1717
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:26,420
That's really the sequel.

1718
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,060
It's a real thing.

1719
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:31,420
You know what the best thing is about being part of the human centipede?

1720
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,360
I don't know.

1721
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,740
The front part, I would think.

1722
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,620
You always know where your next meal is coming from.

1723
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,900
Oh, boy.

1724
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,560
Princess Wee doesn't get that,

1725
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,400
and that's working in her favor.

1726
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,280
I'm glad.

1727
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,520
I'm glad that she's too innocent to know what we're talking about.

1728
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,760
She's cannibalizing itself?

1729
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,980
You've been reduced to fart noises on the air.

1730
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,400
Do you mean to say that the human centipede just cannibalized itself?

1731
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,260
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

1732
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,160
No, it's not a loop.

1733
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,020
You know what?

1734
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:03,320
That's it.

1735
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,440
The guy in front is...

1736
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,120
I sentence you to watching Ant Farm Dickhole.

1737
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,720
This is your punishment.

1738
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,700
Wait, where are we going today?

1739
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,160
Whoa.

1740
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:13,920
What?

1741
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:14,280
Whoa.

1742
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,060
Hey.

1743
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,060
Whoa.

1744
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:16,940
This is a good show.

1745
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,140
Oh, hey.

1746
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:18,520
Thanks.

1747
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:23,980
By the way, I understand that that movie is going to be spun off into a sitcom.

1748
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,860
The human centipede?

1749
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:26,760
No, no, no.

1750
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,300
The other one.

1751
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,340
Mm-hmm.

1752
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,720
Really, Sherman?

1753
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:34,560
You mean to tell me you've never heard of the Ant Farm Dickhole Van Dyke Show?

1754
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,700
Oh, man.

1755
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,300
Oh, girl.

1756
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,740
And on that note, I will take my leave for now.

1757
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,260
Get out.

1758
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:45,540
Get out.

1759
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:45,720
That's it.

1760
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,340
You're out.

1761
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,780
Yeah, I might call you back.

1762
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:48,200
Strike three.

1763
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,060
Have a great evening.

1764
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,440
Well, thanks.

1765
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,260
Good night, Mark.

1766
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:51,340
You too.

1767
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,040
Bye, Mark.

1768
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:52,860
Night, Mark.

1769
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,240
He made his mark.

1770
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:56,720
Yep.

1771
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:01,900
Have we found enough excuses to say the title of the movie?

1772
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:02,640
I'm not going to do it again.

1773
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,400
I'm not even doing it.

1774
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,780
I'm going to let it go.

1775
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,260
Sorry.

1776
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:05,880
Sorry.

1777
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:06,980
Drop it.

1778
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,400
I'm being Dave over here.

1779
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:09,380
I'm sorry.

1780
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,680
You're beating a dead horse.

1781
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,760
Beating off a dead horse.

1782
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,760
Hey, it's hard to do that.

1783
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:17,980
I do.

1784
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:19,860
Okay.

1785
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,220
Let's bring back one more caller here.

1786
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:23,520
Hey, guys.

1787
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:24,060
Sorry.

1788
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,280
I had to cut off on you.

1789
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,080
Aw.

1790
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,220
Well, some cowboy Dave's...

1791
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:31,020
You missed a really elevated conversation.

1792
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:31,840
... asking me if I knew where he was.

1793
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:32,620
Ooh.

1794
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,020
Yeah.

1795
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,640
Well, I was curious.

1796
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,400
You know, I was talking with Stang before, you know, everything started and all that.

1797
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:45,240
I saw Princess Wee, and I saw this very petite, short-haired woman there.

1798
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,340
I don't know who you're talking about.

1799
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,180
Oh, okay.

1800
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,240
I know who it was then.

1801
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,940
That's Baby Bear's baby.

1802
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:53,220
Damn.

1803
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,020
I'm sorry.

1804
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,880
I don't know how old you are, but it was like, do you have a lot of children in here?

1805
00:58:59,060 --> 00:58:59,420
Oh.

1806
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,700
Oh, you were cute, though.

1807
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,140
But I felt guilty looking at you.

1808
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:05,880
I was like, no.

1809
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:07,080
This is a little girl.

1810
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,180
Hey, nothing wrong with that.

1811
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:16,240
Nope.

1812
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,200
Screw you, man.

1813
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:17,320
I'm sorry.

1814
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,320


1815
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,320


1816
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,320


1817
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,320


1818
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,320


1819
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,320


1820
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,320


1821
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,320


1822
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,320


1823
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,320


1824
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,320


1825
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,320


1826
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,320


1827
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,320


1828
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,320


1829
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,140
This is the only time, you know, I'm just gonna get a little bit more into you.

1830
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:18,140


1831
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:18,140


1832
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:18,660
I'm not cool.

1833
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,220
I can't help it.

1834
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:26,540
If I go to a restaurant with my parents, sometimes they still give me a kid's menu, which I used

1835
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:30,720
to get upset about when I was like 17, but now I just take it and eat off the kid's menu.

1836
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:36,820
I got my first senior discount without asking for it.

1837
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:38,880
Just with the white beer.

1838
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,320
And I was only 55 at the time.

1839
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:41,940
Yeah.

1840
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,340
I got a coffee at McDonald's.

1841
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:45,120
It really shook him up.

1842
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:45,660
Yeah.

1843
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:46,100
No kidding.

1844
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,320
I got coffee at McDonald's.

1845
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:47,320


1846
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:47,320


1847
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,560
We were driving away.

1848
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,620
I went, it's only 75 cents.

1849
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,380
What's the senior discount?

1850
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,400
What's SR discount?

1851
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,460
What does that mean?

1852
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,160
There's nothing wrong with that.

1853
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,100
There's this one guy.

1854
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,020
I haven't been carded in years.

1855
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,320
They're supposed to card you, and every now and then they do, and it's ridiculous, you know.

1856
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,500
Well, we have to check everybody's ID.

1857
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:11,880
They carded me at the con on the cob, and I couldn't even go into the party because I didn't have my ID card.

1858
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:12,480
That's right.

1859
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,460
Yeah, because you might be under 21.

1860
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,040
I said, read the wrinkles and gray hair, sir.

1861
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,820
And he said, I'm sorry, I have to see your ID.

1862
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:20,900
Okay, I can't come in.

1863
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,620
Well, don't feel that's odd.

1864
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,520
It was about a year ago.

1865
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,860
I went out with some friends, and I wanted some wine.

1866
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:29,640
They carded me.

1867
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:35,200
It's got to be like carding the oldest man in the world.

1868
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:40,880
I've been rejected from buying beer because someone thought that my ID wasn't actually me.

1869
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,680
If I hear that, I am flattered.

1870
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,120
You're going to card me?

1871
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,280
You're right.

1872
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,500
It is a compliment.

1873
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,340
Yeah, no, I really just wanted the beer.

1874
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,020
I really didn't come in there for compliments.

1875
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:55,300
I just specifically came in there just to buy the beer.

1876
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,000
But they thought you had a fake ID.

1877
01:00:59,320 --> 01:00:59,640
Yeah.

1878
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:06,600
Because I think I was like, I was wearing, like I had glasses in the picture, and I was like a sunburn because it's my birthday in the summer.

1879
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,200
And they were like, yeah, no, this isn't you.

1880
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,660
And I'm like, no, no, really.

1881
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:12,020
Just give me some freaking beer.

1882
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,820
When they card me, I say, thank you.

1883
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:19,720
Well, that's true.

1884
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,580
It's a compliment, but I think it's a compliment.

1885
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,200
Are you serious?

1886
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:28,320
Do you get carded when you buy games at GameStop?

1887
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,020
Do they card you for the mature games?

1888
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,120
Rated M for mature?

1889
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,120
No, no, not.

1890
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,540
They don't.

1891
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,700
I had to do that when I worked there, and that was terrible.

1892
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,540
People would get awful mad at you about that.

1893
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,440
They just thought it was the.

1894
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:43,500
That was the stupidest thing.

1895
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,900
And I'm like, look, I'm sorry.

1896
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:45,540
Why?

1897
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,200
Just show me your ID.

1898
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:47,780
I don't know.

1899
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:48,360
I can't.

1900
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,520
I have to do it.

1901
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:50,420
It's not my fault.

1902
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:51,720
I didn't make the rules.

1903
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:52,200
It's my job.

1904
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:55,040
I'd sell GTA 5 to a 10-year-old.

1905
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:55,480
I don't care.

1906
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,040
There's laws.

1907
01:01:58,380 --> 01:01:58,860
Rules.

1908
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:06,040
The online version of this game is not approved by the.

1909
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:10,960
The online version is never approved by anyone because they can never tell how many.

1910
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:11,880
Yeah.

1911
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:12,100
They.

1912
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:12,180
They.

1913
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:15,020
You don't know what's going to happen once you step foot online.

1914
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:16,200
Well, I know what's going to happen.

1915
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,340
You're going to get called.

1916
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,460
I don't actually.

1917
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:19,720
I'm not.

1918
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:22,340
I don't know the rules of what I can get away with saying.

1919
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:22,780
So I.

1920
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,800
You're going to get called what?

1921
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,620
Get called a faggot by a 12-year-old.

1922
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:28,840
Oh, my.

1923
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,540
That's what will happen to you when you go online playing any game.

1924
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:34,180
And that's just the reality of the situation.

1925
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:34,980
Right.

1926
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,780
My son warned me about that.

1927
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,760
He says, Dad, you know, you're going to end up being.

1928
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,000
Getting your.

1929
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:46,780
Your ass kicked by 12-year-olds.

1930
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,220
And when you hear their voices, you're going to be really horrified.

1931
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:50,840
They're going to.

1932
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,000
They'll be cussing like a blue streak.

1933
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,160
Sounding like little girls.

1934
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:56,740
Because they're.

1935
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,260
They're mostly 12-year-old boys.

1936
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,140
Actually, because there's so many 12-year-old boys.

1937
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:06,720
When I get on the microphone on online games, they think that they do not believe that I am a girl.

1938
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,200
They believe that I am a 12-year-old boy.

1939
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:08,620
Yeah.

1940
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,360
You know, this actually.

1941
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,620
When you're talking about some of the.

1942
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:11,380
Stuff you hear in those.

1943
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,800
This kind of on a more serious note speaks to why I can't.

1944
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:17,860
I never got into the online gaming community at all because.

1945
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,800
I don't like gamer fanboys.

1946
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,860
And I don't like the idea of having to play against them.

1947
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,720
I don't like the idea of having to collaborate with them.

1948
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:29,460
And on top of that, it becomes a great big echo chamber.

1949
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,120
And there's a lot of all kinds of.

1950
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:37,080
It's the absolute lowest of the low of our of our culture that you hear.

1951
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,560
Yeah, it's it's pretty.

1952
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,540
It's pretty terrible.

1953
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:40,440
It's not fun.

1954
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:41,100
I don't know.

1955
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:41,540
We're going to get real.

1956
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:42,400
People get real.

1957
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,300
I had the.

1958
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:47,160
You really get tired of hearing tits or GTFO like pretty fast.

1959
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:47,360
Yeah.

1960
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:47,960
And I have.

1961
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:54,640
I had the misfortune of living in the same apartment building with with an avid gamer who was on some kind of Xbox.

1962
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,240
Xbox Live or something like that.

1963
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,360
And he would just be screaming all kinds of stuff all the time.

1964
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:05,620
The only person I play on live with is an eight-year-old girl.

1965
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:06,980
Oh, that's all right.

1966
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:07,580
Filers.

1967
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,340
Well, I'm new to video games.

1968
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,240
I only play one monster.

1969
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:18,260
And the only other subgenius in the whole world that plays it is Philo's daughter, age eight.

1970
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:26,700
And I actually have to watch my mouth because I start cussing a blue streak when the monsters are getting the best of me.

1971
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:30,780
And so I have to be careful with this little tender child.

1972
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:37,280
And you have to watch how you talk about how she looks because her her character in the game is a grown woman.

1973
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:37,600
Yeah.

1974
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,460
No kidding.

1975
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:40,860
Yeah.

1976
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,620
One time she had to she had to leave the room and do something.

1977
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:46,980
Her dad took over the controls.

1978
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:51,120
So her dad was the good looking hunter hunter girl.

1979
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,880
And I my hunter man walked over to where she was.

1980
01:04:55,060 --> 01:05:00,460
And I said, I'm standing uncomfortably close to inappropriately inappropriately close now.

1981
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:05,620
And if I could hear Philo's voice in the other end, he goes, I know it's making me very uncomfortable.

1982
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:09,440
And he was sitting there.

1983
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,820
There are young woman's body.

1984
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:16,680
So once his daughter came back, of course, I didn't do that anymore.

1985
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,140
That would make me feel uncomfortable.

1986
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:22,220
You got to be careful these days, you know.

1987
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,340
Oh, boy.

1988
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,720
What I miss, boy.

1989
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,660
Well, I remember the day.

1990
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:28,940
Get a copy of Monster Hunter.

1991
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:29,700
Yeah.

1992
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,020
Yeah.

1993
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,700
Just go spend hundreds of dollars on all of this stuff.

1994
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:33,380
Yeah.

1995
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:37,440
Unfortunately, you do have to have a Wii U to play that online.

1996
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,420
And it's that's a 200.

1997
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,380
A hundred bucks right there.

1998
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,800
Just just for this one day.

1999
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:47,120
A lot of on the other hand, the real addicts like me will do that.

2000
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:48,360
And we all did.

2001
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:49,560
We all did.

2002
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,360
When the new version Wii U or.

2003
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:53,120
Hmm.

2004
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:54,200
No.

2005
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,660
Was it a princess Wii U or.

2006
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:56,520
Oh.

2007
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:00,180
Cornies.

2008
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:00,720
Cornies.

2009
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,800
I couldn't help it.

2010
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:05,640
So we're getting close to the bottom of the hour here.

2011
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,620
And it looks like that's running down over there.

2012
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,000
So why don't we take a break?

2013
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,260
Here.

2014
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:14,960
And we will return for more around 1130 or so.

2015
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:18,300
We'll see what happens next.

2016
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,680
Thank you guys for your contributions.

2017
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,260
And please, if you can stop that whistle.

2018
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,520
You actually hurt my ears.

2019
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:25,940
You're welcome.

2020
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:29,020
Pregnant.

2021
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:29,460
Uncomfortable.

2022
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:29,980
Okay.

2023
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:30,760
