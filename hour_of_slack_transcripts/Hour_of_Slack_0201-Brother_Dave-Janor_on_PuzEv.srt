1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,220
No, no, no, no.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,540
Sorry.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,980
It's true.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,620
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sub-suggested.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,320
We're having operating difficulties,

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,420
which has necessitated a delay

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,880
in the beginning of our Sunday movie.

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,940
It's a wonderful life.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,480
No trouble.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:28,580
No trouble.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,140
Get set.

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:30,740
Get going.

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,380
Hey, Mom.

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,360
Cody?

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,160
No.

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,480
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,240
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,000
Bob?

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,080
Bob?

20
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,420
Ray?

21
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,160
Bob?

22
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,420
Let's begin now.

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,480
Prepare yourself.

24
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,460
You are about to be remade into a new being

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,580
through forbidden knowledge

26
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,560
previously kept secret for centuries

27
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,860
by the jealous priesthoods of many religions.

28
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,900
Follow me!

29
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,120
Ready?

30
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,460
Go!

31
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,320
The Self Genius.

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,140
Hour of Swatch.

33
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,480
We're staying up late for her, wouldn't you say?

34
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,500
Definitely.

35
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,680
Bob?

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000


37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,720
Bob?

38
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,560
Bob?

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:30,980
Bob?

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,220
Bob?

41
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:32,860
Bob?

42
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,240


43
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,580
Bob?

44
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:33,740
Bob?

45
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,000
Bob?

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,180
Bob?

47
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,200
Here's your host.

48
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,840
Oh, uh, re...

49
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,800
Ivan Stang.

50
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,000
Bob?

51
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,400
Bob?

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:40,560


53
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,460
Bob?

54
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,660
No, Ivan Stang.

55
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,260
Bob?

56
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:44,600
Bob?

57
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,120
Bob?

58
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,120


59
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,120


60
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,180
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

61
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,720
Every time you say, see, hear, or think...

62
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,400
Bob?

63
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:56,760


64
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,460
...that your key phrase is...

65
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:58,460


66
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:58,460


67
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,080
...it will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

68
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,420
We are controlling transmission.

69
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,560
...as best we can, dear friends.

70
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,540
And you can call for information on the Church of the Subgenius

71
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,740
by dialing in Dallas, Texas, 823-7490.

72
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,160
Be happy again. Keep on smiling.

73
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,260
When you're smiling, whole world will smile with you.

74
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,580
Lift up your pipe, let go the smoke.

75
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,920
This is slack, it ain't no joke.

76
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,400
Rest into Bob, lift up your chain.

77
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,760
And you will pay to know what you think.

78
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,280
But he ain't no man, he ain't no God.

79
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,660
And don't want, want the past but tried.

80
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,020
He ain't no man, he ain't no God.

81
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:03,280
I don't want to walk the past but tried.

82
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,720
Rejoice, children of light.

83
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:19,560
And all of ye who are with it, without it, transcended it, kicked it, returned to it, and thought of it, bless thee.

84
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:27,000
Everything that you have ever done in your whole lifetime in the physical vehicle on this earth,

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,220
this plane has brought you to this instant.

86
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,280
Okay.

87
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,160
I'm sorry this tape is taking so long to get to you.

88
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,080
We're surrounded here.

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,400
I still have to figure out some way to fly you out of here.

90
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,660
There goes the air support for tonight.

91
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,980
Dropped us some ammo and food.

92
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,200
The chopper's still down here.

93
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,500
I'm staying behind to try to...

94
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,760
Oh, don't do it, Doug. Just leave me.

95
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,300
Leave me here. Go on in.

96
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,380
Do your show, Doug. Do your show.

97
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,740
Get as close to it as I can here.

98
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,680
It's okay. I don't care about that band.

99
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,340
It's pretty scary. Well, Hal, what else is happening in the world today?

100
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,660
Well, the old saying that the fatter you are, the more there is to love apparently doesn't apply when it comes to adopting a baby.

101
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,940
Just ask Michael Kersplatnik and his wife Sue.

102
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:36,380
They told reporters today that the Australian government told them they each had to shed more than 50 pounds before they would be allowed to adopt a bouncing baby boy.

103
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:45,780
Sue, 39, weighs a hefty 202 pounds, and Kersplatnik, a 29-year-old boilermaker, weighs 798.

104
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,680
They were both judged to be almost 60% overweight despite perfect health.

105
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,960
We are absolutely heartbroken.

106
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,780
Get up! Shoot him!

107
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,600
Get up! There they go!

108
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,200
There they go. Catch them.

109
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,240
They can't run very fast.

110
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,200
What the devil are you men doing?

111
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
I think we got him.

112
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,800
We're lollygagging. We're lollygagging, sir.

113
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,720
All right. Over here, sir.

114
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,600
I think we got him.

115
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,420
Yes, sir. Yes.

116
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,220
Come on. They're not moving. That's just the bullets moving across the ground. Come on.

117
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,180
Look at that blubber shake.

118
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,200
All right. Hold your sound effect.

119
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,360
The destroyers of the earth.

120
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,360
Awful, gentlemen.

121
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,220
That was a sad moment.

122
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,460
I'm turning the phone.

123
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,900
Sick. Yeah.

124
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,720
Look at what's happening. They're calling us up. There's lights all over the board.

125
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,800
Let's see what Bosco has to say.

126
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,200
News of God hasn't been good since they razed Jimmy Swaggart's motel on Airline Highway.

127
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:46,620
The latest twist involves millions of dollars squeezed out of the faithful by businessmen working with the scripture.

128
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:54,540
An oil and gas company was stopped by Massachusetts and Missouri authorities from selling stock to wells drilled in accordance with instructions.

129
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,160
Suzanne Just'

130
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,300
They're racing the dollar.

131
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,300


132
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,300


133
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,300


134
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,300


135
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:12,700
Did youINK espero talked to her ?

136
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,900
No, not anymore.

137
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:22,540
What are you going to make the deal with Jackie Gaw皇?

138
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,400
See you.

139
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,700
sell. Since most of them have no money to speak of, they always come out ahead.

140
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,760
There was a time, correct me if I'm wrong, when God seemed to be against greed. I'm

141
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,680
not sure exactly when this was, since there is nothing in the history of any

142
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,800
church to prove it. It seemed to be more in the nature of a folk belief based on

143
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,160
the poverty of Jesus and his pristine hatred for the rich. That time was long

144
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,080
ago, probably in the 60s or something. In any case, anyone propounding that theory

145
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,380
today would be laughed out of the pulpit or shoved off the soapbox. Looked at

146
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,140
in another way, greed may actually be the one thing to end the schisms and

147
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,140
arguments between creeds, faiths, or religions. Instead of arguing points of

148
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,600
doctrine, the faithful could trade beliefs the way people trade systems of

149
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,520
the track to see what works. One bread and fish is miracle for a camel talking

150
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,820
in the desert. One icon for a psalm, a lamp for a goat, and so on. You can adopt

151
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,160
whatever system yields the most gain. It would be the end of foolish argument and

152
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,360
there could be the much sought after way to measure the immeasurable. Trust me, it's

153
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,360


154
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,960
a good deal. We'll trade it in my brand new church. Poet Andre Kudrescu is editor of

155
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:37,540
The Exquisite Corpse. He comes to us via member station WWNO. Now ain't that weird? Did you

156
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,940
ever get to sitting around watching a show like The Untouchables and catch yourself pulling

157
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,920
for the fudge? Probably with our luck, you know, trying to get to the moon. It'll be

158
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:54,040
a half moon, we'll miss it. Wouldn't that be weird? Of course, a lot of folks say, well,

159
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,360
what are you doing? I'm not doing anything. I'm just trying to get to the moon. I'm just

160
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,360


161
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,360


162
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,100
to get to the moon. I'm just trying to get to the moon. What do you believe in, Brother

163
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:01,420
Dave? I say, I believe in everything. You don't mean that, yes. Even that, yes. Yes,

164
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,120
yes, I do. I believe in everything that exists in this whole planet Earth. I believe in

165
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,000
every philosophy, every religion, every ideology, everything that exists. And that don't give

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,760
me no room for no argument. If the world is wrong, then right your own self. That's something

167
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,340
to think about, sure. Frankly, I believe in love and charity and goodness and kindness.

168
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,920
kindness and I believe if a man's down, kick him. That's right, if he survives it, he has

169
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:37,900
an opportunity to rise above. I've always said it's more blessed to give than to receive

170
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:43,420
and two friends get together and start giving. They're bound to receive something out of

171
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,720
it. Hallelujah. Joy to the world.

172
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:12,700
They don't even know. They don't know what happened. They'll steal the stage props.

173
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,980
Let's watch out.

174
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,220
They don't know nothing. Nothing, nowhere.

175
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,260
3215 Peralta.

176
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,140
Yeah, sure.

177
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,860
According to our machine, he is, but he has nothing with him.

178
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:42,980
Sure. They don't know nothing. They've never seen what really happens out there. Nothing.

179
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,860
Nothing. They don't know nothing.

180
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,980
They don't know nothing. They don't know nothing.

181
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,220
Well, we're in the first seat.

182
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,840
Calvary faced the raging maniac and questioned him.

183
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,100
What?

184
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,280
So they got into the truck and we go down this career-related highway.

185
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,120
And all of a sudden, dun-dun-dun, there's this curve.

186
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,820
Hey, Bill, it's been a field now.

187
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,460
And a field up to the side.

188
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,080
Well, I'm a little down the window.

189
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,600
All right, 7-0.

190
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,520
Nobody's really sure what happened that day.

191
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:32,700
All we know is the tape of the old man and Douglas Walvo's last media act.

192
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,520
Oh, no, that's okay.

193
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,760
Hey, dear friends.

194
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,460
Friends.

195
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:54,120
Yeah, that older cat talking, that was Brother Dave Gardner.

196
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,340
I grew up with my dad playing those old so-called comedy records,

197
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,900
and Reverend Shimon kind of gave me a tape of him.

198
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,360
I hadn't heard him since I was a kid,

199
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,340
and I had no idea what a beatnik the guy was.

200
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,480
God, I caught.

201
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,880
Stuff this time that I never would have as a child,

202
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,280
and it's a good thing I didn't,

203
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,920
but what the heck, you know, you will this time,

204
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,100
and we'll all be in big trouble.

205
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,200
Brother Dave, sort of the pre-Jayner device,

206
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,220
was the commercial Jayner device,

207
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,560
and tonight's show, in fact,

208
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,660
stars Brother Dave Gardner and Jayner Hyperclete

209
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:40,840
and Puzzling Evidence and the howlingly hilarious

210
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,740
.com.

211
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,400
I'm going to be playing a little bit of Dr. Howl here.

212
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,480
Heard in the background on his harmonica.

213
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,980
And because Jayner was on the KPFA subgenius show in Berkeley,

214
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,680
we'll be playing that Pacifica broadcast from many months ago, actually,

215
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,100
but boy, it kicks.

216
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,520
It's real good.

217
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,680
And won't teach you a thing about the Church of the Subgenius.

218
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,980
If you're a first-time listener, boy,

219
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,300
I feel for you.

220
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,940
I pity you.

221
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,260
Oh, how I pity you.

222
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,140
But we'll also have Papa Joe Mama

223
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,860
giving a good subgenius sermon coming up.

224
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,060
So it's kind of an interspersed bit of a thing here.

225
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,440
Oh, before I go too much farther into it and forget,

226
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,860
I should mention that next week's show

227
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,640
is going to be sort of a confusing,

228
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,160
I was going to say a special event,

229
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,900
but it'll be an even more confusing event

230
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,220
because it's going to be broadcast live

231
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,740
from CBC.

232
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
It's going to be at the Schooner's Bar

233
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,480
at Live Oak and Skillman.

234
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,680
I'm not sure why,

235
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,300
but KNON that night from 9 o'clock on

236
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,740
for American Music Party also

237
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,160
will be broadcasting from that bar.

238
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,200
Now, theoretically, I can flop tapes in there,

239
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,600
but I think we'll probably be live on the mic

240
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,900
just sort of blabbering

241
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,100
while this blues festival

242
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,760
happens,

243
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,040
which isn't mic'd.

244
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,360
So you'll just hear this music,

245
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,960
and you'll hear this music in the background.

246
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,800
Fortunately, Pope Sternodocs Keckhaver

247
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,480
of the famous band Doctors for Bob

248
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,360
will be down here from Little Rock,

249
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,160
and actually we'll all go to Austin

250
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,180
and then come back here during the show,

251
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,480
taking the club with us.

252
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,980
And so, you know, in that much time,

253
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,960
we'll be able to invent two or three new religions

254
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,280
besides the new ones that are going to be mentioned

255
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,940
on this show.

256
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,560
So it's going to be even harder to keep up with,

257
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,900
but you'll just love it.

258
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,340
If you don't,

259
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,100
let us know.

260
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,560
We'll laugh at you

261
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,420
here at 823-7490

262
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,240
in Dallas, Texas.

263
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,200
Area code 214

264
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,540
for you folks out of town.

265
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,060
Hey, wait a minute.

266
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,000
Will, what are you doing?

267
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,820
What are they doing?

268
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,160
Why aren't they charging?

269
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,400
There's no way to charge.

270
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:05,660
No!

271
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:07,920
Out of place!

272
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,760
Out of place!

273
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,360
Out of place!

274
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
Out of place!

275
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,220
Out of place!

276
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,620
Out of place!

277
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,920
Out of place!

278
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,080
Out of place!

279
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:14,460
Out of place!

280
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:14,660
Out of place!

281
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,380
Out of place!

282
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:15,380


283
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:15,480
Out of place!

284
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Well, I mean, it's good

285
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,920
because, I mean, there's a lot of things.

286
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,120
These investigating committees,

287
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,740
they're all investigating somebody

288
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,520
because they ain't got time

289
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,860
to investigate their own self.

290
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,520
That's right.

291
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,540
I mean, this is a...

292
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,120
Sitting investigating committee shows on TV

293
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,660
is just like another type quiz show.

294
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,280
Only difference is

295
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,220
if a contestant answers a question right,

296
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,540
beloved, he loses.

297
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,800
That's right.

298
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,960
But when they get through investigating everybody,

299
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,720
then you know what?

300
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,480
we ought to do and what i think we're gonna do we're gonna investigate them that's right that's

301
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,780
right find out how they can spend a hundred thousand dollars to get a little old job that

302
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:57,520
pays 22 500 a year see who they gonna get even with like them folks out in california

303
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,920
this tape has been sitting on my desk for months now so i think it's probably time to get this to

304
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:14,420
you we're here in the puzzling evidence compound on patrol i like to patrol with the men because

305
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,220
it gives them a feeling of confidence as if i know what i was doing and that i know what's going on

306
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,600
it's not a good idea for a commander to show up

307
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,140
yeah all right

308
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,960
i'm sorry mr mrs smith if you could see your son now he'd be sorry

309
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,040
maybe sorry you ever let him keep those comic books

310
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,700
that first bros paperback was your

311
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,340
mistake products should have been in the fire had a kid read science fiction there goes a whole

312
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:17,260
brain you might as well just chop off your body throw it away doby gillis on one side and arthur

313
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,060
clark and the other won't want to get a job yes

314
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,060
gratitude is riches and complaint is poverty and the worst i ever had was wonderful

315
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,200
now here's another one uh some folks though they're so vain and arrogant and ignorant

316
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,000
you know that they will go and not speak to their fellow brother and sister humans

317
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,340
that's right friends that's right and yet they carry on endless conversation with canines

318
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,880
talk to them dogs say come here boy

319
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:05,020
well the reason they love dog yeah you know why you know why they love them old dogs that's why

320
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:10,840
man's best friends because he won't tell on them. Anyhow, somebody say, well, don't you have to

321
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:17,600
watch what you say? I said, no, I just watch what I think. Somebody say, well, what is success?

322
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,040
Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.

323
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,780
And somebody said, ain't you ever heard the expression? Somebody said, well, let's do this

324
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:38,440
again. Now, how are you going to do that? Again. You can't do anything again, brother.

325
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,700
Once it's done, it's gone, man. You can do something similar.

326
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,460
Oh, there you go. Hallelujah. Listen, don't you know that a diamond ain't nothing but a piece of

327
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:58,420
coal that's stuck with it? Celestials, others,

328
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:05,040
brothers, children of light, you, you who have dwelt in other dimensions,

329
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:12,300
and you who now are in the twilight zone, the zone between the zone between the zone.

330
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,600
Now, that's weird, and that's a good place to dwell.

331
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,580
Lo, I know that every night's a Saturday night and every day's a Sunday.

332
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,540
I know I've been wrong, but I want to try it one more time.

333
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,680
Just one more time, that's all. I mean, a lot of folks,

334
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:34,540
try it one time, quit. Now then, I mean, that's good. That's good. It's better to have tried it

335
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:39,720
once and to never have it all. That's something to think about. Of course, I don't encourage

336
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:46,420
everybody to smoke. He said, by the way, he said, what's your smoke? He said, I ain't asking you

337
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:56,000
none of yours. He said, no, sir. Sir, what's your cigarette? He said, well, for your information,

338
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,540
it's a filter tip. Pick you.

339
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,020
He said, well, would you advise everyone to smoke filtered tip pick-a-yoons? And he says, yes.

340
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,880
That's where the first seeds of fanaticism are started, beloved.

341
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,600
Somebody completely hung up on a concept before they've exploited the possibilities of the others

342
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,320
having anything to offer. Way of that. I mean, there's all kinds of things you can do, though,

343
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,080
to rejoice and reach the other dimension. No, I mean, we got the cause going good. But of course,

344
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,520
I, I,

345
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:33,280
I believe in the causeless cause, see? You know, I mean the dimension of the great stroke.

346
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,620
Just like, do you think the George Washington's monument looks anything like George?

347
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,080
Well, I still say, if it wasn't for Thomas Edison, we'd all be sitting around watching

348
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:52,000
the television with candlelight. When them cavemen's are sitting in that cave beating on

349
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,180
them rocks, they said, we ain't gonna never have radio. This here is space music, and it's known

350
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,760
from another time. It's called the space music. It's a music that's been used for a long time.

351
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,780
It's a music that's been used for a long time. It's called the dimension of sound that is hung up in the round,

352
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:07,080
which is not bound. James Lewis, get away from that wheelbarrow, say? You know you doesn't know

353
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,040
nothing about machinery.

354
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:25,380
Now, friends, get ready for the first true doctor music. I, I think this album probably dates from

355
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,540
the early 60s, and, uh, I mean,

356
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,660
help me explain this guy if you can.

357
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,720
That's how you live with your attention.

358
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,340
Oh,

359
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,760
that was with you on the floor.

360
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,440
зап

361
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,140
I ever see,

362
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,920
glory,

363
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,300
in black heads.

364
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,820
has left Rub-a-loo

365
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,980
Yes, I know that you my girl

366
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,340
Do you have a date Wel?

367
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,280
You do

368
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,740
but it don't make no difference.

369
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,980
I mean, you know, if you're worried or disturbed about anything,

370
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,400
just sit down and groove and wait until the thought comes to you and pause.

371
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,660
Yes, because I mean the greatest thing in the world, really, I mean besides that.

372
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,440
The greatest thing in the world is the silence.

373
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:17,700
Yes.

374
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,660
And once you can hear that, then everything else is wild.

375
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,980
I mean, you can just pick up on sounds like you ain't never heard before.

376
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,580
But I'm a fanatic without a cause.

377
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,600
That's right, I done figured it out, man.

378
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,460
I done figured it out.

379
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:31,860
That's right.

380
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,760
I'm a fanatic without a cause, and I believe in it.

381
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,600
Don't you know this one lady, she done got up in the morning,

382
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,740
she done cleaned up her chilling, she done sent them off to school,

383
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,600
she done cleaned up the house four times,

384
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,980
she done watched Queen for a day three times,

385
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,720
she done washed everything else,

386
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,860
she done washed the cat on there with dash and the washing machine,

387
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,400
and she's washed the whole thing, got the stereo going, the TV going,

388
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,280
the high-five blasting, got the air conditioner on,

389
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,000
and now done cut the lawn four times,

390
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,260
and now...

391
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,140
And this neighbor next door ain't even got her kids off to school

392
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,120
and looks over there and said,

393
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,400
she's on dope.

394
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,980
I'm telling you, friends.

395
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,800
Hello, friends, and welcome.

396
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,700
Friends, I've been hearing a lot of murmuring of late,

397
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,480
complaints, if you will, allegations and accusations

398
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,080
that the church has been slacking,

399
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,660
slacking off a lot lately.

400
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,400
That's right, friends.

401
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,160
There are those among us now who have suggested

402
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
we've been slacking off too much.

403
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,000
Well, friends, my answer to that is quite simple.

404
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,020
I want you to look to the person to the left of you

405
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,980
and to the person to the right of you,

406
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,020
and at the end of your life,

407
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,240
I promise that one of them people's going to be dead.

408
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,120
That's right, friends, dead as a doornail.

409
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,920
And you know why, dear friends?

410
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,060
Because they were too busy working,

411
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,620
worrying about how much slack the church had

412
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,660
instead of how much slack they had.

413
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,480
It's true.

414
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,920
And you know what's even more disturbing than that, friends?

415
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,340
You won't even know what really killed them

416
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,300
because the conspiracy revisionists

417
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,300
would have already covered up the facts.

418
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,360
Not only does the conspiracy steal away your slack,

419
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,300
but they deny slack ever existed.

420
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,980
Moreover, they deny anyone ever wanted slack.

421
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,540
Ha, ha, ha.

422
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,200
Hard to believe, isn't it?

423
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,880
And yet most folks do believe

424
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,240
whatever the conspiracy revisionists force feed

425
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,540
and cram down their throats.

426
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,200
The lies, the distortions, the grand deceptions,

427
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,300
the conversion of truth into that intricate web of delusion,

428
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,120
which brings us to the topic of tonight's sermon, friends.

429
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,780
The new and improved revisionist bull

430
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,440
It all begins in their mandatory attended brain control schools

431
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,340
where they form those young impressionable minds.

432
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,660
No doubt, many here today have already fallen for one or more

433
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,220
of their revamped versions of how history really happened.

434
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,540
My favorite one is the new and improved history of the Civil War.

435
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,040
Fought over slavery, right?

436
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,520
Right.

437
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:57,800
Wrong.

438
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,240
It was fought over slack.

439
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,280
Bet you didn't know that.

440
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,240
Oh, sure, the facts are still out there.

441
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,140
If you do some of the digging, you might just happen to stumble across them

442
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,500
once in a while and maybe even understand.

443
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,920
If you're a doctoral candidate in Civil War agricultural,

444
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,120
maybe you'll notice that while the South exported cotton by the baleful,

445
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,980
it grew hemp by the ton.

446
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,100
And we all know what hemp really is, don't we?

447
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,680
Sure, it's frock.

448
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,260
But what happened to all this frock, alias hemp, friends?

449
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,220
We know the South grew it.

450
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,660
We know the South harvested it.

451
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,920
We even know the South used bales of it as shields to roll toward Yankee fortifications

452
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,940
while under fire.

453
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,120
Nice symbol, huh?

454
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,720
But do they ever tell us why the South bothered to manufacture all these tons of slack-producing

455
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,880
herbs in the first place?

456
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,480
Do they, huh?

457
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:39,880
Do they?

458
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,580
Certainly it wasn't the smoke.

459
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,700
Oh, no.

460
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,740
Remember, nobody needs slack.

461
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,160
That's only a myth, friends.

462
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,800
They grew all this hemp to, uh, uh, make rope.

463
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,640
Yeah, yeah, that's a ticket to hang all those Negro slaves.

464
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,300
Sure.

465
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:56,640
And that's really why Honest Abe invaded the South and raved pillage and destroyed the

466
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:56,640


467
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:56,640


468
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,580
other half of his constituency.

469
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,200
It wasn't, I repeat, was not to destroy the frock-producing empire of the Northern Hemisphere.

470
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,620
If they wanted to do that, they would have burned fields and carved a pathway through

471
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,480
Atlanta to the sea.

472
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,640
Right, General Sherman?

473
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,100
Right.

474
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,320
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

475
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,840
Know what I mean?

476
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,180
Sure.

477
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,420
Now, if the revisionists can make the masses believe that, which happens right here in

478
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,760
the United States, think what else they can pull the wool over on the local yokels.

479
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,520
Hell, why not try to fool the entire world?

480
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,620
We'll tell them that's why they're here.

481
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,860
Why they invaded Germany and bombed Japan to radioactive death.

482
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,700
Now, just a footnote here, friends.

483
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,960
Father Jomama is not saying the Holocaust never happened.

484
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,920
That statement is illegal, especially in Germany.

485
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,480
You can be arrested for publicizing that fact.

486
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,320
Only the conspiracy revisionists are authorized to manipulate history.

487
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,600
So I'm not saying that, friends.

488
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:50,120
What I'm saying is that the Holocaust and the nuking of Japan were Jewish and Japanese

489
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,820
attempts at mass suicide.

490
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,360
Bet you didn't know that, did you, huh?

491
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,100
Hitler was a Jew and was just carrying out orders.

492
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,140
Jews and Japs were deprived of so much slack, they finally said, screw it.

493
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,140
Either give us slack or give us death.

494
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,160
And I'll give you three guesses which option the conspiracy chose to impose.

495
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,680
Oh, you think suicide is severe, do you?

496
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,440
Well, I agree.

497
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,260
But slackness is more severe.

498
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,980
It drives people to suicide in a souped-up sedan.

499
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,060
Why do you think Reverend Jones and his flock moved to Central America and set up Jonestown?

500
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,620
It was to get closer to froth.

501
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,860
And when the conspiracy set officials down to interfere, the whole congregation snuffed

502
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,000
it.

503
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,460
Bet you didn't know that either, huh?

504
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,120
The Jonestown Massacre was really committed by desperate people in search of slack.

505
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,200
Why do you think they used Kool-Aid anyway?

506
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,240
It was a statement.

507
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,000
They needed aid in being cool.

508
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,800
And that, my friends, is where J.R. Bob Dobbs steps in.

509
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,860
Yes, friends, it was J.R. Bob Dobbs that proved to the world that although you can take slack

510
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,760
away from the subgenius, you can never take the subgenius away from slack.

511
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,840
Bob shows us how to manufacture our very own slack.

512
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,260
Sure, they can separate the church and state.

513
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,440
But they can never separate the subgenius from state of mind.

514
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,960
You don't have to have froth to have slack any more than you have to have a partner to

515
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,400
have sex.

516
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,760
It just helps, that's all.

517
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,020
Suicide's out.

518
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:06,880
Slack's in.

519
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,720
Just say no to thugs.

520
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,620
Stop sniffing those lines and start reading them between them.

521
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,440
Don't blink.

522
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:12,960
Think.

523
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,380
Quit your job for Bob.

524
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,600
Say yes to dress.

525
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,700
Hit the dirt with a skirt.

526
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,020
Do it now with a cow if she's big then dig.

527
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,560
Time you enjoy wasting, friends, isn't wasted time.

528
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,700
Words to Live By by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

529
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,300
Just imagine what a beautiful place this could have been if they'd only listened to

530
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,960
him in the first place.

531
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,520
No Civil War friends, no World War friends, and Kool-Aid would never have had to pack

532
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,560
as much punch.

533
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:38,940
Uh!

534
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,380
Praise Bob, I'm in.

535
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,980
Yeah, no kidding.

536
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,840
Uh, thank you, Papa Joe Mama.

537
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,120
Papa, Papa, Papa Joe Mama.

538
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,600
However, I should step back.

539
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:55,740
I'm going to go get some food.

540
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:55,740


541
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:55,740


542
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,800
I'm going to go get some food.

543
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:05,700
Uh, Papa Joe Mama is actually a relatively new subgenius doctor.

544
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,240
That is, uh, those who make the tapes and picture books and such like.

545
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:16,900
And, uh, he, I guess he had not been reading his pre-scriptures real close because he said

546
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:24,500
something that was doctrinally very incorrect, um, in that he was, uh, equating, uh, Habifrop

547
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,840
Zipulops, the best of the best, uh, of the best of the best, uh, of the best of the best,

548
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:25,840


549
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:25,840


550
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:32,660
uh, Marifazalupina, the, the Tibetan herb with the common hemp plant grown in this country,

551
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,080
uh, especially, uh, heavily during the Civil War.

552
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,640
And, uh, they're not the same plants.

553
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,060
Um, uh, one is actually illegal nowadays, I believe.

554
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:48,860
And the other, I forget there's some slang name for it, but, but Frop is not, uh, the

555
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,840
com, um, it doesn't grow in America at all.

556
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,760
So don't even try it.

557
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,400
Well, actually.

558
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,020
Okay.

559
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:01,440
You maybe could at the top of Mount Sha, Shasta, if you were able to get hold of some, uh,

560
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,280
Yeti or Bigfoot droppings, Sasquatch droppings.

561
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,560
That's the only thing it'll grow on.

562
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,660
That and the grave of a holy man.

563
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:15,480
So if you can find some, some old Indian medicine man's grave and the Sasquatch droppings and

564
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,980
some unsmoked Frop seeds, and you can grow your own Frop and so forth and nobody do anything

565
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,580
about it.

566
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,560
Uh, you'll never come down.

567
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,740
But that's understood.

568
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,580
I think we all understand that.

569
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,620
Well, the rest of the show friends, we'll, uh, we're going to have to pack up and get

570
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,480
out of here and go to Berkeley real quick.

571
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,560
They came from New York, New York, the big apple.

572
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,400
And they came from Berkeley.

573
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,280
Yoruba, Borinquenios, Piel Color, Cafe Oscuro.

574
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,540
You better be careful.

575
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:54,540


576
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:54,540


577
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,520
If anyone's here from New York, uh, there's a large garbage truck parked, uh, partially

578
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,640
blocking the entrance of the studio.

579
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,800
We'd appreciate it if they would move this vehicle or it will be dynamited.

580
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,800
Thank you.

581
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,560
Gosh, there's also a tow truck parked out here.

582
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Who's going to tow that?

583
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:20,580
Yeah, that horrible ugly tow in the back of it must belong to some huge, squinted giant.

584
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,860
Maybe a Yarn Man.

585
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,540
Well, that's it.

586
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,540


587
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,540


588
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,540


589
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,540


590
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,540


591
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,540


592
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,540


593
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,540


594
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,540


595
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,540


596
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,540


597
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,540


598
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,540


599
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,440
Well, this is a great evening, ladies and gentlemen.

600
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,000
The hit of bad music here early in the morning on this show.

601
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,540
Oh, and bad music is just the start of our cavalcade, our kaleidoscopic cornucopia of

602
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,480
crazy, wacky, goofy, wild subgenius fun.

603
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,440
We're ready to shovel.

604
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,400
We're trying to get us out of here, right?

605
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,200
Oh, oh, oh, yes, uh, right.

606
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:42,620
We haven't done yet.

607
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,120
They're, uh, moving the rubber dummy into place, ladies and gentlemen.

608
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,760
Talking about this show, we're just, yeah, this old show, just drive it away.

609
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,880
You drive it, you park it.

610
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,780
And guess where?

611
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,260
Ha ha.

612
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,540
Are you shocker-living-gee out of the show?

613
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:54,540


614
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,640
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, hey, easy for that.

615
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,440
I'm sorry.

616
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,720
And of course, as we've told our many rabid listeners, we actually have Jayner Hyperkleets

617
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,400
here tonight to sound the soundings of...

618
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,720
Oh, come on, you're exaggerating now, aren't you?

619
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,980
No, no, not a bit, I...

620
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,980
No, no, it's, it's real and neat and keen and all that stuff.

621
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,860
It's unbelievable.

622
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,940
I don't think he exists in the flesh.

623
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,220
I think it's just a...

624
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,200
It's a theory.

625
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:17,980
A myth.

626
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:23,860
Okay, all you kids out there, if you believe in Jayner, I want you all to clap your hands

627
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,540
and wiggle your hands.

628
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:24,540


629
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:24,540


630
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,280
We'll all be furious at the same time.

631
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,740
And then maybe, just maybe, he won't kill you.

632
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,940
You nailed the wall by enemy fascist troops arriving in your town by 5 a.m.

633
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,120
And that's past pay and core, I'm afraid, as the riot troops move in.

634
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,020
Hey, the riot troops did move in on Telegraph Avenue just a few hours ago, apparently.

635
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:53,240
There was an enormous confrontation up there that started after a movie on People's Park.

636
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:53,440
Yeah.

637
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,600
And then a cop-out?

638
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,000
A giant cop-out came down on the people's heads and made them face the 60s.

639
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,100
But apparently, it was the reverse of the 60s.

640
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,340
I just talked to somebody outside the station before coming in.

641
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,580
Yeah, they beat up the cops, right?

642
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:10,060
No, they, instead of trashing the bad stores and leaving the good, they did the reverse.

643
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,600
Well, that's, uh, peculiar.

644
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,880
Things have changed.

645
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,620
The cops are putting flowers in the guns of the hippies.

646
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,540
Yes, it's a kinder, gentler area.

647
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:19,960
Everything is backwards.

648
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,920
I don't feel so good in Berkeley no more.

649
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,540
Yeah, it feels kind of itchy and licey.

650
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:24,540


651
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,380
I don't know what's been smitten around here.

652
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,820
You know, we're just, we're trying to move the show into position here so we can, uh,

653
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,140
play the really funny parts.

654
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,900
Yeah, but those drivers just don't seem to be paying any attention.

655
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,660
They're just passing the show, and we've had our thumb out, or rather this toe that we

656
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,240
got out of the garbage truck for a long time, and nobody's even stopping.

657
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:45,220
Uh, is it, is it true that we're, that we're possibly gonna have a, uh, an episode of,

658
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,480
uh, Janer's Crack House?

659
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,120
Oh, we, we can only hope.

660
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,520
I believe so.

661
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,640
It's scheduled for later on in the programming.

662
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,320
Well, what about, uh, the Morton Downey Janer Show?

663
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:54,520
And, uh, the Morton Downey Janer Show?

664
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,600
And now the Morton Downey Janer Show.

665
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:01,920
Well, I, somebody captured that guy and, uh, they drew a backwards bob head on his face

666
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,680
and they cut off part of his mustache, uh, while he was in the bathroom, but he's still

667
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,840
gonna broadcast in the future.

668
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,720
I zip it, pal.

669
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,480
I have the Ziploc philosophy of Morbid Downer Jr.

670
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,600
And, uh, you can participate if you give us a call at 848-4425.

671
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,860
That's 848-4425.

672
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:29,780
Our topic, our topic tonight is the extermination of normalcy in 1998.

673
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,000
My, that is topical.

674
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,940
That's a pretty big goal.

675
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,380
Oh, my.

676
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:38,460
Methods, methods of torture, methods of efficiency.

677
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,220
Well, like, like what methods of torture?

678
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,280
How, how could you torture the normals in the 80s?

679
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,200
How uncool.

680
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:49,540
Now, there's, there's been a lot of, uh, of more liberal subgeniuses talking about, uh,

681
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,680
paper cutting the normals to death, right?

682
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,260
Very, very popular.

683
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:53,840
Suckin' shit.

684
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,760
They're a sport here in the city.

685
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,520
Yeah, we're gonna move on those liberals, man.

686
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,700
Of course, some of us real people would rather see them carpet burned to death.

687
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,740
Yeah, yeah.

688
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,660
Drag them around the 16th floor a couple times.

689
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,100
Yeah, especially the ones with the shag carpet, man.

690
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,320
Make them go up and down on those high-speed elevators too many times.

691
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:09,600
Yeah, yeah.

692
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,740
Make them listen to elevator music till it's coming out of their, their e-hole.

693
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,840
You know what I mean?

694
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,200
No.

695
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,900
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

696
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,680
Don't think the young ladies agree with you, Reverend Howler.

697
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,020
They seem to be happy.

698
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,460
Well, I have a large following among the dish staff set down here at the Reverend Howell

699
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,480
Outreach Ministries.

700
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:35,200
Uh, I try to reach out to the young people in the ghetto and, uh, this is a star-studded

701
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,220
Hollywood, uh, extravaganza.

702
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,260
We're gonna have Vicki Lester and Norman Maine.

703
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,980
Always stars.

704
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,720
And the great Waldo Littiker will, uh, say a few words for our studio microphone.

705
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,140
Ladies and gentlemen, the next voice you hear will be the hyper-hyper-clesian himself, Jane

706
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:50,880
Orr the Great.

707
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,480
Oh, yeah.

708
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,880
Oh, come on.

709
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,160
He, he's not really on here, is he?

710
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,300
I mean, I'm sure you would have Jane Orr hyper-cleans up here just talking to him.

711
00:35:59,300 --> 00:35:59,800
Come on, man.

712
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,760
The lights are shining and the piano is playing and the fanfare is cute.

713
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,260
I mean, if Jane Orr hyper-cleans was, if, if hyper-cleans was up here, he would have

714
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,120
said something by now.

715
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,140
I mean, he wouldn't have, he wouldn't have dared like this.

716
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,140


717
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,140


718
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,480
But listen, they don't know this is radio.

719
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,160
They can't see it.

720
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,240
Oh, damn.

721
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:11,500
All right.

722
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,840
They'd probably just be talking about something that didn't make any sense.

723
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,380
They'd just be watching Channel X thinking they could see us.

724
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,640
All right, you got it.

725
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,940
You got me over a thousand times.

726
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,260
But really, no, let's pretend, let's just pretend the guy came on the show.

727
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,160
I mean, if he were here, he'd probably just be ranting on and on, talking about Skull

728
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:33,360
Farmers and 90-inch Worm Comics number 23 and the thing that has 7-Eleven for comic.

729
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,920
Well, I guess we can't fool the public any longer.

730
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,700
For head comic.

731
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,080
It's actually Bucknick.

732
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,200
It's a boyfriend show approved by Dobbs in over 27 committee hearings.

733
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,120
But I really doubt it.

734
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:44,340


735
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,420
I'll zip it, pal.

736
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,320
Hey, who are you talking to?

737
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,160
Hey, look at the way he zips that thing.

738
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:49,800
That's pretty neat.

739
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,480
Yeah, I wish he would keep it zipped.

740
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,320
It's unsightly in the control room.

741
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,340
I know they tell these young folks to let it all hang out these days, but you got to

742
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,220
draw the line somewhere.

743
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,680
And I know just where I'd draw it.

744
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:00,880
Wow.

745
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,140
With my blue makeup pencil.

746
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,880
What a neat drawing.

747
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,680
Yeah, it's not a large area to draw in, but as you can see, this represents the onions

748
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,540
and on the other side represents the heels.

749
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,460
And this is the big battle that took place between them millions of years ago.

750
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:13,780
Oh, yeah.

751
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,280
And they all zip it, pal, forces.

752
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,020
Yeah, yeah.

753
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:20,360
And these zipper scars are not part of the drawing, but I kind of made them part of the

754
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:20,560
drawing.

755
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,600
Put a lid on it, Buster.

756
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,060
Artistic.

757
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,120
Oh, yeah.

758
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:23,940
Oh, here's the lid.

759
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,220
It's a nine inch lid, of course.

760
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,440
Throw a towel over it.

761
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,780
Oh, here's the towel.

762
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,220
Check.

763
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,880
I've got so many requests here.

764
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,280
Put a lid on the zipper, pal.

765
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,500
A lid, a towel, and a zipper.

766
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,880
How much is a lid these days, man?

767
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,760
That's about the same as a towel or a zipper.

768
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,060
Yes, it was different back in the days of Walter Parks Thatcher and Charles Foster Kane.

769
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,000
Then a dollar was a dollar and you wore a suit.

770
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,000


771
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,200
A hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat.

772
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,200


773
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,200


774
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,200


775
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,200


776
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,200


777
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,200


778
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,200


779
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,200


780
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,720
I'm a big fan of the old Riff Raff stand-up collar.

781
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,160
There were no TV sets, only Barber Shop Mortgage.

782
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,700
Old Riff Raff gets caught in his cup sometimes.

783
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,600
This younger generation, they know nothing of the agony they went through back in early

784
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,760
days of subgenius movement.

785
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,100
Then millions of prostitutes—

786
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,520
They are moving at incredible speed.

787
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,220
Spent on maintaining the subgenius image.

788
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,280
8484425.

789
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:21,760
So anyway, I said to the guy, he goes up to the Jewish guy, he goes up to the black guy, he goes up to the yellow and green guy, he goes up to the triangular guy, he goes up to the beige guy, he goes up to the striped guy.

790
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,700
Suddenly, the menorah was struck in two and rose into the sky.

791
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,320
Wow!

792
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,020
And assaulted the triangular and the green guy, but not the others.

793
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,700
Nobody knew why.

794
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,460
Did you hear the one about the comedian who got up on stage and told a joke and the audience laughed?

795
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,260
No, come on, I'm serious.

796
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,200
No, really, what happened?

797
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,100
Well, I can't remember the punchline, but I've got 20 more, just as funny.

798
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:47,000
I don't want any more punch. I've had too much bad coffee. Enough to last me an entire week.

799
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,340
Yeah, we'll just fire the 20mm right at this radio show targets right off the cross the street.

800
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,220
Here comes Bob.

801
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,000
Oh, there he went. He's very fast.

802
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,220
Especially when you've got these tracers chasing him.

803
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,560
Yeah, that's an M200R.

804
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:08,180
Did you hear the one about the three guys on the radio show talking about a bunch of stuff that didn't make any sense?

805
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,580
No, come on, I'm serious.

806
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,460
No, really.

807
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,700
No, people don't do that on the radio here.

808
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,600
That couldn't happen here in America.

809
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,880
Why, this is the third coast.

810
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,760
I shouldn't have said it.

811
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,300
Okay, well, I'll tell ya.

812
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,640
So anyway, the one guy comes up and says,

813
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,540
Yell?

814
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,620
He says, yell.

815
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,000
And then what did the other guy say?

816
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,120
So how did you find California?

817
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,480
I want to show somebody your pornographic, porny, pornographic...

818
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,780
I just went down to the couch and there it was.

819
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,180
Banner.

820
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,180
I'm Ron Kern at Albuquerque.

821
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,940
Now it's time for the major.

822
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,700
The major caller, that is.

823
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,500
Major caller.

824
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,220
Major disaster area coming in focus.

825
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:56,160
And this major caller will tell us the minor details about his extensive prevails in trying to reach the subgenius program.

826
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,540
There actually are people listening to this.

827
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:03,120
They are, as you can see by that little blinking light down there at the bottom of the caller well.

828
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,340
Did you hear the one about the guy that called the show?

829
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,300
Yeah, I heard that.

830
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,000
We will.

831
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,000
We're fixing it.

832
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,700
Here we go.

833
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,340
There's no punchline.

834
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,620
Okay, little squinty caller, what's on your mind?

835
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,720
No, don't tell them about the third coast.

836
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,520
Don't tell them about the third coast.

837
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,200
You know where the third coast is, right?

838
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:19,780
It's not here.

839
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,900
I mean, I made a bad mistake by saying that.

840
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,340
No, the third coast is in Dallas, Texas.

841
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,360
Hey, turn down those sound effects.

842
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,780
You're blistering my ear bones.

843
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,240
Jesus, clear the files.

844
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:29,740
Hang on.

845
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,500
Sorry, I'm not here for that.

846
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,080
And guess what?

847
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,100
You are our third caller.

848
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,060
You don't win two tickets to the January Hyperfeet's Comedy Show.

849
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,700
Oh, no.

850
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,400
Already.

851
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,320
Oh.

852
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:40,820
Oh.

853
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,120
Oh.

854
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,760
You're bummed out.

855
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,080
Okay, I'll hang up now.

856
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,260
Bye.

857
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,120
What's your favorite radio station, son?

858
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,400
Oh, mine?

859
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,180
Go on, speak up.

860
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,820
You're talking to the hyperflesian himself.

861
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:53,860
Oh, Jesus.

862
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,180
Not Jesus.

863
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,980
This is the one I get when I come over there.

864
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,820
That's another radio station.

865
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,060
Don't treat me differently from any other living God.

866
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:00,820
Come on, baby.

867
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,020
That's the program that comes after you can talk to Jesus on Emmett Powell's show.

868
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,020
This is the January.

869
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,540
That's right, Emmett Powell.

870
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,040
Yes, that's right.

871
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,040


872
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,040


873
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,040


874
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,040


875
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,040


876
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,820
Excuse me, I'm not saying that.

877
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,780
Deities lost and found.

878
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,560
Look, we've got bottom dollar on deities.

879
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,140
What do you want?

880
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,000
And his evil Twitter.

881
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,860
$25 down.

882
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:14,740
Dammit, Powell.

883
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,820
January Hyperfeet's words.

884
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:16,800
They're scary.

885
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,600
Sentences as funny as this one, approved by Dobbs.

886
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,360
No, I'm serious.

887
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:20,600
No.

888
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:20,720
Now, come on.

889
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,440
Now, it's my pass.

890
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,480
That's all I can think.

891
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,980
I saw Bob.

892
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,120
Well, here on this show.

893
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,080
Did you go to the January Show?

894
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,760
No, I don't think so.

895
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,280
How was it?

896
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,400
No, no, I didn't make it.

897
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,840
That was probably the best thing to do.

898
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:30,860


899
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,900
What's the matter with you?

900
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,580
What's the matter with the quality of colors we have?

901
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,760
Was it Jaina's outhouse or Jaina's crack house? I can't figure it out.

902
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,300
Huh?

903
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,740
Come on, be a little more focused on the uptake than that.

904
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,080
Uh oh. See, he thought we were kidding.

905
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,840
People always think we're joking about this serious, serious show.

906
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,120
Did you hear the one about the comedian that told a joke that started out?

907
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,140
Did you hear the one about the comedian that told a joke that started out?

908
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,820
Did you hear the one about the comedian that told, well...

909
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,780
Okay, really, what?

910
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:04,200
We're going to do that joke in just a moment on our endless comedy loop.

911
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:11,060
But first, we'll give our sleazy seminar in how to deal with difficult people.

912
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,000
And work on the job anywhere.

913
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,080
You know, how is California?

914
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,460
It must be a lot stranger out here than it is in, well, where?

915
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,360
Yeah, California's stranger in California than it is in Arkansas.

916
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,480
Yeah, that's for sure.

917
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,760
Yeah, I'm sure an Arkansas-villager

918
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,600
just couldn't possibly hack it out here in California.

919
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,620
He'd have to use a jigsaw or maybe a skill saw.

920
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,780
Well, I'm thinking about taking some back with me to see, you know, how it is in other states.

921
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,700
The Arkansas skill saw massacre.

922
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:42,780
Yeah.

923
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,760
Who will survive?

924
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,300
I was there.

925
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,700
Oh, I mean, who will survive?

926
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,400
Who will put them back together?

927
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:47,700
Who won't?

928
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,540
Or the Arkansas jigsaw massacre?

929
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,440
How about the Texas chainsaw manicure?

930
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,240
Oh, that's only for the digital ones.

931
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,020
And we did that already. And it didn't really sell.

932
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,640
You're soaking in it.

933
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,360
Oh, my God. Oh, no.

934
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,560
Is this Mr.

935
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,960
This is Phineas.

936
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,060
This is just the caller's way, okay?

937
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:06,860
This is Phineas.

938
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,560
Almost a card-carrying, subgenius narco calling.

939
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:14,480
You can tell by the darting eyes and fidgeting fingers at this caller that he's actually lying.

940
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,740
Central Arkansas redneck blood. Yes, you're soaking in it.

941
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,940
Yes, esoteric redneck humor is the name of the game.

942
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,580
It is you, yes. It looks you.

943
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,700
It's you.

944
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,740
As long as it's valid, we can do it here in the state.

945
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,300
Approved by me.

946
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:34,100
Well, it was certainly nice getting a call from Mr. Robbins, you know, other than the other way around.

947
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,900
It's usually when I usually call up you guys and bounce you out of bed in the morning.

948
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,220
Yeah, thanks.

949
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,960
Well, I had to do it because some...

950
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,700
Oh, I know. But see, they have the wrong show, see?

951
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,300
I was talking about the Hyper-Cleveon show.

952
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,600
A typical hyper-attenuated mix-up.

953
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,640
Yeah, well, how was the show anyway?

954
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,580
Well, we missed it, too.

955
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,960
I don't know. We're trying to find out right now.

956
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,240
It was marvelous.

957
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,280
Not our show, the Jayner Show.

958
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:58,760
That's right.

959
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,280
One of the greatest things that ever happened anywhere.

960
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,960
So when's it gonna happen again?

961
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,520
And you missed it. It'll never happen again.

962
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,460
Well, you'll have to go up to Seattle next Thursday night.

963
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:08,880
Oh, no.

964
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,420
That's right. If you can go up to Seattle, you can still catch it.

965
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,200
You can catch the tattered ragged...

966
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,300
Chase it all around the country.

967
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,500
...Jayner Show.

968
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:20,280
Yeah, you're just like all the other Jayner heads that just follow Jayner all over the country.

969
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,200
And I'll just replay those excerpts on the video table.

970
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,540
They buy the shirts and then they...

971
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,760
Try to concentrate upon your...

972
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,220
...fertilize the fields and it just goes on and on.

973
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,760
...and the pure bright white light of stupidity.

974
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:35,060
And maybe you will find in yourself the depth of dishonesty which made you miss the Jayner Show in the first place.

975
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,340
Well...

976
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,880
Yeah, so there.

977
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,500
It wasn't listed, you know. There's not...

978
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,940
Oh, that's true. You gotta read the pink section.

979
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,640
You gotta show it in the addresses. You gotta tell where it's going to be.

980
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,160
Well, we did tell you sometime.

981
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,580
We've been talking about it.

982
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,080
But you weren't paying me after we...

983
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,820
So did they have a lot of people show up or what?

984
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,000
Oh, it was packed.

985
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:51,620
Oh, goody.

986
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,860
Probably not any people, but we had about 70 yetis.

987
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:55,840
Oh, goody.

988
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,320
What kind of drinks did they order?

989
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,980
There was a no-host bar and a no-parasite bar on the other side.

990
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,140
Look, pal, we're not trying to say it was the ultimate.

991
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,780
We're not trying to say it was the answer to all reality.

992
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,840
We're not trying to say that it was just...

993
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,420
If you had been there, you would have just started astrally projecting and...

994
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,620
...and you would have just been surrounded by...

995
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,340
...by buckets of naked women and free money or...

996
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,520
We're not trying to say that.

997
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,500
That it would have just been the ultimate...

998
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,960
Well, what are you trying to say?

999
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:22,140
...ecstasy.

1000
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:22,700
Damn straight.

1001
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,300
We're just trying to say that...

1002
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,100
...that we're not trying to say that...

1003
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,700
...that you could have walked in bare feet with mud between your toes.

1004
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,080
We're not trying to say that...

1005
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,280
Or you could have walked in in human feet with blood.

1006
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,760
...you would have been working in an office if you hadn't been there earlier.

1007
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,420
We're not trying to say that...

1008
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:42,020
...if you had walked on your head with your ears upside down...

1009
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:46,080
...hearing the one about the comedian that told a joke that didn't make any sense.

1010
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,520
We're not trying to say that.

1011
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,540
It's too overwhelming. It's just too...

1012
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,700
Yes, the multi-signal of this show.

1013
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,400
It's still over your head, pal.

1014
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,120
Look out, Tramp.

1015
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,460
We had a good production of Jesus Christ.

1016
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,840
Why do we get stuck down here by Channel 2?

1017
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,660
...yesterday's show.

1018
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,140
We're not trying to say that we're not trying to say all this.

1019
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,640
Oh, okay. I thought they were.

1020
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,660
In fact, we're succeeding in saying that.

1021
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:09,040
Money is to put in large piles and set a fire.

1022
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:09,920
Yes.

1023
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,100
But it will be received by our infrasonic, jujitsu-trained, inner-sewer starfish, and you will be saved.

1024
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,860
I don't think the people don't care about that.

1025
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,700
They just want to see that money leave their wallet.

1026
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,940
That's what they really want to see.

1027
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,460
Once it leaves, they don't care.

1028
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,580
This tour is what I call me-aid.

1029
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,340
It's coming together of people...

1030
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,600
How many cities have you been to so far, and how many are you going to go to?

1031
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,300
Well, I just finished a tour of the Rings of Saturn.

1032
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,060
London, Paris, Rome, Vienna, Moscow.

1033
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,180
Earlier...

1034
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,040
A grand tour.

1035
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:45,360
If they could take a three-dimensional rendering of the Rings of Saturn and play it on a record player, what would it sound like?

1036
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,420
It would sound like this show, young man.

1037
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:47,860
Uh-oh.

1038
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,800
That's what you're listening to.

1039
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,360
I like the Lock and Ship XM soundtrack or something like that.

1040
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,280
You're soaking in it.

1041
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,860
Just what do you think you're listening to anyway?

1042
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,720
The Rings of Saturn?

1043
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,460
The Rings of Saturn?

1044
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,300
You're soaking in them.

1045
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,240
Welcome to Chapter 7 of the Onion Rings of Saturn.

1046
00:46:59,380 --> 00:46:59,900
No, that...

1047
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,120
A thrilling rocket junkie serial.

1048
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,340
They're actually the Seven Rings of Hell.

1049
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:07,120
Yes, and each ring is louder and larger than the one inside it.

1050
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:08,120


1051
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:16,040
No, but I believe the day before tomorrow I'm supposed to be appearing on the KPFA show, so you might want to listen to that.

1052
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:16,760
Or when is it?

1053
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,520
When it happens.

1054
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,060
What?

1055
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,660
It's the day after yesterday, I believe.

1056
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,980
It's end-wise to the Witchness of the Watchers, so you might say...

1057
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:21,980


1058
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,580
I'm not sure how this works.

1059
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,700
We'll have to plug it in and see.

1060
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,660
Or if it works.

1061
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,560
Initiate torture sequence.

1062
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,260
Okay, now we're flying high over the moon.

1063
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:37,120
And a week, week ago, three weeks before last Saturday, two days later, I think I'm

1064
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,380
supposed to be appearing...

1065
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,960
A button pushed on your little collar face.

1066
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:41,500
Somewhere in Macomb, Mississippi.

1067
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,180
Fly away from the planet backwards.

1068
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,100
And why is this?

1069
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,260
I have this IPPI.

1070
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:51,820
Jane is in the detention room going over some kind of Macomb, Georgia or Alabama or

1071
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,180
Mississippi.

1072
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:52,560
Lock D.

1073
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:52,560


1074
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:52,560


1075
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:52,560


1076
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:52,560


1077
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:52,560


1078
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:52,560


1079
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:52,560


1080
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:52,560


1081
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:52,560


1082
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:52,560


1083
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:52,560


1084
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:52,560


1085
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:52,560


1086
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:52,740
I'm going to be...

1087
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,320
A gathering that he attended once.

1088
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:00,880
Yes, and it apparently shocked the living ghee out of him, according to our roving correspondents.

1089
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,960
Rises from the grave for a man...

1090
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,820
Here's a micro sub-analysis of that ghee now.

1091
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:12,920
It seems to be composed of 28 parts lithium to 9 parts bahuri butter from the forests

1092
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,140
of northern India.

1093
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:14,420
Yum.

1094
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,860
Here comes the rock, straight for your leg.

1095
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:16,720
Now, what are you going to do?

1096
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,060
Sounds delicious.

1097
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,020
Yes, that big buzzard away from me.

1098
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:21,820
I'm going to be...

1099
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:21,820


1100
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:21,820


1101
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,060
I'm going to be...

1102
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:22,140
I'm going to be...

1103
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,940
Well, that's no buzzard.

1104
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:24,680
That was my wife.

1105
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,300
No, I'm serious.

1106
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:25,860
Come on.

1107
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,060
No, really, really.

1108
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,200
Take my life.

1109
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,100
Rockin' Robin's Rock's Nest.

1110
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,320
Take my life, please.

1111
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,100
No, come on.

1112
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:31,340
I'm serious.

1113
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:31,880
Rocket away.

1114
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:32,720
Rocket away.

1115
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,080
Rocket away.

1116
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:33,460
Rocket away.

1117
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,580
The rings of Saturn...

1118
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,820
We can't rocket no more because we've done lost that Rocket Away record.

1119
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,740
The rings of Saturn were the elusive gold, and the shuttle cargo bay was secured.

1120
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:48,040
Okay, caller, if you're so smart, what makes those rings of Saturn ring around that...

1121
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,120
You're our third caller.

1122
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,640
You've got two free tickets to the Bon Jovi concert.

1123
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,120
What's that?

1124
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:52,880
I haven't been getting little for a year.

1125
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:08,500
I can just boot Person 2 out and try to go down the 해�公ン煮 with...

1126
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,040
I don't know if he deserved a recent weld.

1127
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,040


1128
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,480
Come in there.

1129
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:13,480


1130
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:13,480


1131
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:13,480


1132
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,200
I'm not eating rice afterwards.

1133
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:16,720
Shut up.

1134
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,360
Bright red TV dice을

1135
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,580
昨 rests hereade

1136
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,640
Oh, I was so good.

1137
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,640
You're so noisy that I can't do that anymore.

1138
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:30,720
What? Oh, friends, this is lesson number three in radio professionalism.

1139
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:40,600
Get the mic down real close so they can hear as the cassette is punched out.

1140
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,740
Hear that? Sliding out of its little coffin.

1141
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:50,020
Flip it over, drop it in, shut the gate.

1142
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:53,620
And you've got a whole new life.

1143
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:59,280
Still, if life, if we can still listen more.

1144
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:07,780
Here is instruction number four in church radio repair while doing a show.

1145
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,980
Well, it's a good thing that we won't need this microphone for much of this show, dear friend,

1146
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,620
because apparently we've just about destroyed it by...

1147
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:25,460
We've sacrificed this microphone so that you, you, the listener, will know just what's going on.

1148
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,900
Does that still sound... Yeah, listen.

1149
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:35,320
Here, I'm going to give you a real solid tone and we'll all listen as I wiggle the tiny wires going into the microphone.

1150
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,880
Oh, that's neat stereo.

1151
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,140
Okay. No.

1152
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,000
Quit it!

1153
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,360
I'm hit.

1154
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,320
Hitting the mic often works.

1155
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,060
Yeah, cool sounds, baby.

1156
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:54,820
Hey.

1157
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,240
Oh, we're doctors.

1158
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:03,860
Boy, this is definitely one of the less controlled shows, obviously.

1159
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,060
We're out of any normal human control.

1160
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,560
Well, that's easily fixed by going to tape.

1161
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,660
Yeah.

1162
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,880
See that little jellyfish?

1163
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,140
This就 реально不可以 visitors.

1164
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,720
We're going to be cautious with a fitting glass for some reason.

1165
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:29,800
Of course, we've already gone in all healthy.

1166
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:36,180
빠�âl Tyre not going to give a check.

1167
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,720
How dare you need蔬菜?

1168
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:42,380
Bye, everybody.

1169
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,420
Bye, bye.

1170
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,160
Puzzle and a million

1171
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,920
Heart in your heart

1172
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,220
Heart in your heart

1173
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,160
Puzzle and a million

1174
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:07,460
Heart in your heart

1175
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,940
Another news bulletin here.

1176
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:14,600
Apparently the two sub-doctors are still reported lost

1177
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,840
in the vast trackless waste of the Joranada del Muerte desert.

1178
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:23,780
We're hoping that sheriff's deputies searching the area by helicopter

1179
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,680
and performing aerial surveillance will be able to report the location

1180
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,680
of the two missing sub-geniuses in time for the sub-genius radio broadcast.

1181
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,740
While Republicans are very stupid,

1182
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,640
even more disreputable are the insiders,

1183
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,240
the gossip-mongering networkers,

1184
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,580
the voluble populists,

1185
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,120
the opportunists,

1186
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:45,580
and socialists.

1187
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,460
We're supposed to be talking about the Jaina show.

1188
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,660
We don't give a damn about anybody but ourselves.

1189
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,860
We're talking about simple things like politics.

1190
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,720
You're talking about the inner ring.

1191
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,620
The inner ring of Saturn.

1192
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:55,880
I hope they didn't wear that to the show.

1193
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,960
That's right, the insiders.

1194
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,660
Okay, now we're hoisting the inner ring up the halyards.

1195
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,180
Look at it go!

1196
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,060
Shaving heads all in a row like foul spark plugs in an over-hated V8.

1197
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,040
You can forget about these extremists.

1198
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:07,240


1199
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,120
What do you mean he hates V8s?

1200
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:08,460
It's silly.

1201
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:14,180
The music was so loud at Jaina concert, my ears are still ring of Saturn-ing.

1202
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:14,580
I'm aware that dogs need to be taken care of.

1203
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,540
My brain is no longer the boss.

1204
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,060
Yes, that happens sometimes.

1205
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,860
Okay, now we're going to take the chainsaw here.

1206
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,780
My mind just kind of walked off.

1207
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,880
Look at that, he's bangled.

1208
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,900
He's sawing through the rings of Saturn.

1209
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,280
He's destroying one of the most beautiful sights in the universe.

1210
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,800
No, not right through my arm.

1211
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,400
No, you're not.

1212
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,120
Ah, this wasn't in the script!

1213
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,380
You clumsy fool.

1214
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,060
Then the show really began.

1215
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,340
It helped keep your finger on the script.

1216
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:37,800
Now you can hear the brain breaking.

1217
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,280
Where was I?

1218
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,360
Right here, right here.

1219
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,420
I can't remember my lines and this is improv.

1220
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,520
Right here under glanscaping and acu-

1221
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,860
beating, it's page two.

1222
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,180
Oh, this is the improv part?

1223
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,120
Is this a comma or a period? I can't read this.

1224
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,660
This is a periodic comma.

1225
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:52,620
It's got a bad mimeograph.

1226
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,120
Periodically slips into a comma.

1227
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,520
Okay, now I'm going to go get a mimeograph, a better one.

1228
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,620
Only about the size of a period on a sheet of eight and a half by eleven paper.

1229
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,800
Okay, here's the storage file.

1230
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,920
Jaina's put the Jaina show in there.

1231
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,480
Jaina outhouse. What's a toilet doing outhouse?

1232
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,340
This is a modernized automated outhouse, an up-to-date model of cleaning personal details.

1233
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,880
You almost call it an in-house outhouse.

1234
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,800
Once they're in the house, once they pay the money to see the show, then they're in the house.

1235
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,000
The in-house publication called the Journal of Top Genius Sanitary Science.

1236
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,240
Audience is in-house, they call it.

1237
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,140
If you want my mouth, you'll have to pry it.

1238
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,600
Okay, we're going to pry it from the face.

1239
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,200
Let's get that face pried out of here, huh?

1240
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,620
You don't know how to operate your mouth.

1241
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,880
Come on, Doug, I was just kidding.

1242
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,000
No, no, I'm sorry.

1243
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,140
He cut himself limb from limb.

1244
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,640
Okay, now we'll get to work on the lawnmower.

1245
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,060
We're going to start on the KPFA lawnmower.

1246
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:42,880
Very clever.

1247
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,620
Cut it out, Doug.

1248
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,800
Oh, sorry, I'll cut it out and leave it here by the road.

1249
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,220
Come on.

1250
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,060
I didn't mean that seriously.

1251
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,420
My God!

1252
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,900
Come on, it doesn't hurt that much.

1253
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,920
You got one of them chainsaws?

1254
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,640
This hurts for a minute.

1255
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,040
I won't kill you that much.

1256
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:01,980
You know what they say.

1257
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:02,920
We'll only kill you once.

1258
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,420
Organic reagent, it's boiling over.

1259
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,640
We'll only cut off four of your limbs, not five.

1260
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,540
You're having a chemical accident, ladies and gentlemen.

1261
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,080
It's just like being killed a little bit.

1262
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,840
Take a little bit off the tire.

1263
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,480
It's not really too bad.

1264
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,820
The sideburns the way they are.

1265
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,120
Okay, we'll just start in on the top here.

1266
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,140
Take a little bit off the top.

1267
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,520
The arm, I won't say up to the elbow.

1268
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,760
Okay, all right.

1269
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,180
Oh, he ran out of fuel.

1270
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,140
Don't cut the arm.

1271
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,060
I'm going to go get some gas.

1272
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,280
Don't cut the arm up to the shoulder.

1273
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,440
People will be calling him a nerd.

1274
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:34,440
The shoulder-length arms are just no longer in fashion.

1275
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,420
The elbow-length arms are kind of the hip thing.

1276
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,840
Okay, will you guys steer the show for a minute?

1277
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,140
I'm going to go get some of that rocket fuel they speak so highly of.

1278
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,060
Oh, boy, rocket fuel, wow.

1279
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,680
You know, we're not pikers here on the show.

1280
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:47,420
You hear about extremists and other cults, skinheads.

1281
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,940
Well, in the subgenius religion, we have skinheads.

1282
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,480
They don't just cut off their hair.

1283
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:56,280
They cut it right down to the skull and leave a steaming, stinking, bloody mask to show

1284
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,300
that their heart's in the right place.

1285
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,120
That's right.

1286
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,000
We've got brain heads.

1287
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:00,940
We have neck heads.

1288
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,060
We have shoulder heads.

1289
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,280
In fact, I think we even have a...

1290
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:03,560
We have butt neck heads.

1291
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,920
Isn't it true that there's even like ankle heads and even soul heads?

1292
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,460
Quit it.

1293
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,340
Keep your hands to yourself.

1294
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,940
I guess the soul heads are the most...

1295
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:12,380
They're not extreme.

1296
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,340
They're just the walking souls.

1297
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,040
Yeah, walking like a giant praying mantis over my brain.

1298
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,020
I mean, well, what if we can't think of anything to say while Doug's here?

1299
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,420
I mean, Doug was kind of carrying the whole show.

1300
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,280
I mean, there's just like this void.

1301
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,460
Oh, he went out to get some of that rocket fuel, Pappy.

1302
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,060
There's just this silence.

1303
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,320
He went out to get some of that crap away with that crappy rocket fuel.

1304
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,000
Pass the biscuits.

1305
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:34,020
So anyway, I said to the guy, did you hear the one about the comedian who couldn't think

1306
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:34,940
of anything funny to say?

1307
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,560
No, come on.

1308
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:35,940
I'm serious.

1309
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,360
Actually, I'm not by any means a member of any...

1310
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,600
Is this an audience from Mount Rushmore?

1311
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,960
No, I paid money for this stuff.

1312
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:40,500
Come on.

1313
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,300
Give me a break, baby.

1314
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:41,840
Come on.

1315
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,060
We'll provide you with an entire repertoire of hilarious, wacky, subgenius gags and jokes,

1316
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,560
if you really need it.

1317
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:55,240
For example, there's a scientific medical report that's just coming through on the wire.

1318
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,200
Let's see.

1319
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,940
This just in.

1320
00:56:59,180 --> 00:56:59,780
That's right.

1321
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,680
We're having our medical history.

1322
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:02,180
From the wire.

1323
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,640
It's important that you know your medical history.

1324
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:05,360
Let's see.

1325
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,480
This is the finding of sub-gene medical researchers studying the effects of the...

1326
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:10,480


1327
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:10,480


1328
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:10,480


1329
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:10,480


1330
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:10,480


1331
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:10,480


1332
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:10,480


1333
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:10,700
In Mexico.

1334
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,300
...injections to the gluteus muscle.

1335
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,020
In Mexico.

1336
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,100
The problem they found is that most people have too much bottom.

1337
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:16,720
Well, I take it, sir.

1338
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,340
And that unless a larger needle is used, the injection probably will not reach its target,

1339
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:20,920
the muscle beneath the fat.

1340
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:21,760
Hey, careful with that thing.

1341
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,520
The chainsaw is bad enough.

1342
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,420
Oh, we're not halfway done with you yet, pal.

1343
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,320
Oh, don't you ever sharpen that thing.

1344
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,840
It's blunt as a baseball bat.

1345
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:30,420
Zip it, pal.

1346
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,660
I think that is a baseball bat.

1347
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:36,600
The study described by Dr. Peter Cockshot...

1348
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,320
Oh, come on.

1349
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:37,560
Come on.

1350
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,460
...and described in the latest journal, the New England Journal of...

1351
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:40,460


1352
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,000
The New England Journal of Medicine.

1353
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,680
...the New England Journal of Medicine.

1354
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:46,500
...involves 213 adults whose buttocks were scrutinized by cat scans.

1355
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,120
I think you've said just about enough, young man.

1356
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,840
A sophisticated form of X-ray.

1357
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:51,340
Yes, I know.

1358
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:54,720
They had cats scan and then score the buttocks of the victims.

1359
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,240
Certainly, you're not trying to tell me that they cut his butt off or anything like that.

1360
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:58,320
Oh, no.

1361
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:03,260
I mean, they said he had to wear a dress so people couldn't tell that they cut his

1362
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,020
butt off.

1363
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,880
That's the most disgusting thing I ever heard in my whole life.

1364
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:10,440
But can you say that again?

1365
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,960
I think we can say just about anything at this time of night.

1366
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,000
You can talk about just cutting some guy's butt off.

1367
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:21,580
Well, you have, and we haven't been crashed down on through the ceiling by Ronald Wilson

1368
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,360
Reagan yet.

1369
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:22,980
At least three of his buns.

1370
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,120
Well, did you prepare the rocket pool...

1371
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,520
Family cut off two of his buns.

1372
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:32,120
...forced to lie prone while cats scanned and scratched and scored their rear ends.

1373
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:36,860
The subjects, the doctors decided to use huge...

1374
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,640
And we say to ourselves, welcome back to the show.

1375
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,860
We can see in the mirror, well, how did Jayner's outhouse tour come about anyway?

1376
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,440
And what was the originating...

1377
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,880
Well, it was tacking and yawing, and then it came about under a fair breeze and scutted

1378
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,020
away across the still surface of the entertainment...

1379
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,860
Listen, we almost scutted away across the still surface of the airwaves, dear friends.

1380
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:02,460
As the tape speeded up, the show speeded to its close, except that...

1381
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,700
Except that it hasn't.

1382
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:05,300
This...

1383
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:09,620
But this, right now, is a good time for us to get out of here.

1384
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:14,200
I'm going to give you the sacred post office box number that you can write to...

1385
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:19,520
To receive the teachings of that man...

1386
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,040
Bob.

1387
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:23,580
And...

1388
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,960
You have your pencils ready, I'm sure, by now.

1389
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:31,780
You must be used to this, week after week, sending in that postcard saying,

1390
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,260
Bob, send me free information.

1391
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:37,080
And every week getting back the same free information.

1392
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:38,920
Um...

1393
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,140
You get what you pay for, dear friends.

1394
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:44,780
That address is Bob...

1395
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:52,420
At post office box 140306...

1396
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:58,900
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1397
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,860
Once again...

1398
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,960
And we can really take our time on this...

1399
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,020
It's Bob...

1400
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:06,560
Bob...

1401
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:11,200
At box 140306...

1402
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:18,380
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1403
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:21,740
So...

1404
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:28,020

1434
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:18,880
Baby, that's what I land

1435
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:24,180
Yeah, what a gun

1436
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,860
Yeah, I'm going

1437
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:44,260
Baby, take your teeth out, you look divine

1438
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:47,800
Baby, take your teeth out, you look divine

1439
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:52,660
Baby, take your teeth out, go ahead and eat the labels

1440
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,760
Boiling water kills germs

1441
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,620
Mm-mm

1442
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,040
Yeah, told you

1443
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:03,620
Baby, take your teeth out, I will recline

1444
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:07,120
Baby, take your teeth out, I will recline

1445
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:12,100
Baby, take your teeth out, there ain't nothing left to talk about

1446
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,760
No, no, no, no

1447
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:34,580
Sorry, it's true

1448
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:36,360
What?

1449
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,180
What?

1450
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:45,260
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sub-suggested.

1451
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:51,540
We are having operating difficulties, which has necessitated a delay in the beginning of our Sunday movie.

1452
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:52,600
It's a wonderful life.

1453
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,160
No trouble.

1454
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,480
No trouble.

1455
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:57,600


1456
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:59,160
No trouble.

1457
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,040
No trouble.

1458
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,020
No trouble.

1459
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,000
No trouble.

1460
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,000


1461
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,140
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

1462
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,860
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

1463
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:07,700
Bob?

1464
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:11,760
Bob?

1465
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:13,220
Ray?

1466
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:14,760
Bob?

1467
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,080
Let's begin now.

1468
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:21,900
No.

1469
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,160
Prepare yourself.

1470
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:35,560
You are about to be remade into a new being through forbidden knowledge previously kept secret for centuries by the jealous priesthoods of many religions.

1471
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:36,600
Follow me!

1472
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:37,720
Ready?

1473
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,180
Go!

1474
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,920
The Soap Genius.

1475
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,800
Our house.

1476
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:43,680
Watch.

1477
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,180
We're staying up late for her, wouldn't you say?

1478
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,220
Definitely.

1479
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,160
Woo!

1480
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:53,780
Woo!

1481
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:54,200
Woo!

1482
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,180
Woo!

1483
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:55,180


1484
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,840
Who is your host?

1485
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,220
Caught you're just scores away from me!

1486
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:04,220


1487
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:04,220


1488
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:04,220


1489
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:04,220


1490
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:04,500
Uh, uh...

1491
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,100
You know, the show we met.

1492
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:05,100


1493
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:05,100


1494
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:05,100


1495
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:05,100


1496
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:05,100


1497
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,220
Oh, uh, Iv- Ivan Stang.

1498
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,440
Ma-ba, Ma-ba.

1499
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:14,420
No, Ivan Stang.

1500
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:15,500
Ma-ba.

1501
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:20,940
The message has now registerd in your subconscious mind.

1502
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:24,160
Every time you say, see, hear, or think that you are responsible for, you take full control

1503
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:24,560
of your health and vlog.

1504
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,160
Oh, ma-ba, ma-ba.

1505
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:24,100
You didn't expect it.

1506
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,040
Ma-ba.

1507
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:30,860
Your key phrase, it will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

1508
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:33,160
We are controlling transmission.

1509
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:38,340
Dallas as best we can, dear friends.

1510
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:44,320
And you can call for information on the Church of the Subgenius

1511
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:50,540
by dialing in Dallas, Texas, 823-7490.

1512
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:53,680
Be happy again.

1513
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,040
Keep on smiling.

1514
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,720
When you're smiling,

1515
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:00,040
oh, we'll smile with you.

1516
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,400
Let up your pipe, let go the smoke.

1517
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,760
This is slack, it ain't no joke.
