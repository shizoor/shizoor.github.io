🎵 I want my polka dotted dinky with a crinoline fringe 🎵

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,980
🎵 Cause I'm going Dolby Dol-ing on a Dolby Dol-ing 🎵

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:37,400

🎵 Dolby Dol-ing 🎵

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,880
🎵 Dolby Dol-ing 🎵

35
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,820
🎵 Dolby Dol-ing 🎵

36
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,260
🎵 Dolby Dol-ing 🎵

37
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,180
All the animals come out at night.

38
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,620
Buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.

39
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,000
Sick, venal.

40
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,500
Someday I'll run.

41
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,000
The rail rail will come and wash all the scum off the streets.

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,740
I go all over.

43
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,180
I take people to the Bronx, Brooklyn.

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,440
I take them to Harlem.

45
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,380
I don't care.

46
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,700
Don't make no difference to me.

47
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,280
It does to some.

48
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,920
Some won't even take spooks.

49
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,280
Don't make no difference to me.

50
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,860
Each night when I return the cab to the garage, I have to clean the back seat.

51
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,820
Some nights I clean off the blood.

52
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,020
Twelve hours of work.

53
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,380
I still can't sleep.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,600
Damn.

55
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,280
Days go on and on.

56
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,800
They don't end.

57
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,160
All my life needed was a sense of someplace to go.

58
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,920
I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention.

59
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,900
I believe that someone should become a person like other people.

60
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:12,420
🎵

61
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:13,860
🎵

62
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,120
🎵

63
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,140
🎵 Everything about me is... 🎵

64
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,500
🎵 Everything about me is... 🎵

65
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,820
🎵 I'm just telling you why God has to make me. 🎵

66
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,060
🎵 I'm just telling you why God has to make me. 🎵

67
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,060


68
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,780
🎵 He was stupid to do that. 🎵

69
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:24,980
🎵 He was stupid to do that. 🎵

70
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,780
Bob told Rachel God doesn't make garbage.

71
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,880
Now she'll receive the counseling she had the courage to cry out for.

72
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,380
Bob answered her cry for help because of your support.

73
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,720
Call 1-800-2-

74
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,840
🎵 FINGERTIPS 🎵

75
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,860
Rings and stars danced before his eyes.

76
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,000
🎵 FINGERTIPS 🎵

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,420
Then everything went dark.

78
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,420
🎵 🎵

79
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,400
🎵 Afraid to hide 🎵

80
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,300
🎵 🎵

81
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,880
🎵 You couldn't hide from the song 🎵

82
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,480
🎵 🎵

83
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,020
🎵 It wanted to die so bad 🎵

84
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,360
🎵 It wanted to die so bad 🎵

85
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,940
🎵 But it just couldn't die 🎵

86
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,720
🎵 🎵

87
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,640
🎵 As soon as one drummer died 🎵

88
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,140
🎵 Another one would just pick up the pitiful beat 🎵

89
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,060
🎵 🎵

90
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,540
🎵 🎵

91
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:12,940
🎵 🎵

92
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:12,940


93
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,720
🎵 🎵

94
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,860
🎵 🎵

95
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:25,860


96
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:25,860


97
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:25,860


98
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:25,860


99
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:25,860


100
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:25,960
🎵 🎵

101
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,020
🎵 🎵

102
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,080
🎵 🎵

103
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,080


104
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,080


105
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,080


106
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,080


107
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,200
🎵 Until pretty soon oh my God the song came back. 🎵

108
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,700
🎵 🎵

109
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,920
🎵 🎵

110
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:49,080
Nobody wanted a God Almighty that could have used to sleep, but the song refused to die.

111
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,260
Just kept on refusing to die.

112
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,180
Mouths wide open.

113
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,280
You do the first hour upon awakening early in the morning.

114
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,980
Let us call it the morning offering.

115
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:21,200
Christ, the visible expression of the invisible God.

116
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,840
Shot to share it, but I didn't shoot the death to die.

117
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:37,080
God answers prayer in the morning.

118
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:38,980
Amen.

119
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,400
God answers prayer at noon.

120
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:57,660
God answers prayer in the evening.

121
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:07,300
To keep your heart in tune.

122
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,000
Jesus may come in the morning.

123
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,200
To keep your heart in tune.

124
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,900
To keep your heart in tune.

125
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,400
I guess that you are a character that you are.

126
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,800
Everything is hush-hush.

127
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,420
Operation Sandust.

128
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,360
Hush-hush.

129
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,500
Everybody connected with it.

130
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,240
Hush-hush.

131
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,260
Everybody except me.

132
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,500
Because I know something they didn't know I knew.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,960
Now you get away from that.

134
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,020
The best it's a road I like.

135
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,460
With your disguises and your tricks and your pony IDs.

136
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,320
Howdy, folks.

137
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,320
I just got my open boards back.

138
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,760
They did a headlock three minutes ago.

139
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,760
So you'll have to forgive me.

140
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,060
That's right.

141
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,640
We're here to have a real damn home devival tonight.

142
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,980
I'm Reverend Sterno, Doc's Von K. Stouffer.

143
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,340
This is Jane or Hyperclete's.

144
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,340
We've come here all the way from southern Arkansas.

145
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:25,700
Where we know that all you need is a four-wheel drive, a six-pack, a chainsaw, a handful of pills, and a half dozen orifices.

146
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,480
And you can have you a damn subgenius.

147
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,720
Oh, hell yes.

148
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,660
We promised you pills.

149
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,760
And we're going to give you pills.

150
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,940
Not conspiracy chemical dope.

151
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,680
Our hero's face is on every TV.

152
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,620
You're the one that thought of the mayonnaise.

153
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,940
And it's a body.

154
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,760
Remember the last time we talked about this old body of ours, Bob?

155
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,380
Yeah.

156
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,860
Yeah, I remember, Dad.

157
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,300
No.

158
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,480
Oh, here's a match.

159
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,560
Your pipe's gone out again.

160
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,780
When a man and a woman are married, Bob, they love each other very much.

161
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,480
I can't get no satisfaction.

162
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,280
I can't get no satisfaction.

163
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,220
I can't get no satisfaction.

164
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,180
I'm trying to make some girl.

165
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,960
Suck it to me, baby.

166
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,140
Let's spend the night together, making love.

167
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,940
Light my fire.

168
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,000
Gimme, gimme what you got.

169
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,400
Harder and faster.

170
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,160
Louder and faster.

171
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,080
Tonight.

172
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,220
Howard and faster.

173
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,120
Louder and faster.

174
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,360
Tonight.

175
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,600
End faster.

176
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,820
Louder and faster.

177
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,400
To the light.

178
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:54,800
Tonight.

179
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,880
Howard and faster.

180
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,520
Louder and faster.

181
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,540

368
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:25,240
oh denise i love you very much but uh that's incorrect you can try again though if you'd like

369
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,180
nice talking to you

370
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:37,340
the experience known as conscious expansion has drawn increased interest

371
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:44,180
by drug users lsd distorts consciousness and accentuates perception leading to

372
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:50,220
psychedelic fiction from the side it may also produce effects along after the initial experiences

373
00:19:50,220 --> 00:20:05,480
like most drugs it distorts judgment but doesn't increase critical ability homicide and suicide

374
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,180
have been connected with lsd

375
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:07,780
is

376
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,000
flying and experimenting from an office building or high rise apartment with this newfound awareness

377
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,300
this loss of awareness of one's own being can linger for months

378
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,900
why that one teenage boy locked himself in his room for several months

379
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,100
and if he was touched he would turn into

380
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:37,520
artists bob wants you to have slack bob wants you to do what you want to do here have a glass of wine

381
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:37,520


382
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,020
Everything you know is wrong.

383
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,820
Do us that will.

384
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,140
Shall be the loophole and the law through which you can kick back

385
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,940
and into which you can push that great staff knowledge of living.

386
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,280
Are we having a relationship or just doing research on each other?

387
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,340
Bob both.

388
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,480
Yeah, exactly.

389
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,220
Bob wants all of us to be rich and famous.

390
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,520
He wants his followers to be on their own two feet.

391
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,720
So we don't demand all worldly goods.

392
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,360
Bob is not a fan club.

393
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:17,720
Bob demands only your total, if erratic, devotion to his almighty word.

394
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,640
Now, a lot of these musicians are geniuses and some of them are philosophers.

395
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,660
And some of them aren't very smart.

396
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,360
That's right.

397
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,280
It went through three generations of musicians.

398
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,360
All the musicians who start playing a song.

399
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,280
You're dead now.

400
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,440
Not the song.

401
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,100
Oh, no.

402
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,400
No way.

403
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,960
That old song ain't gonna die.

404
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,380
No siree.

405
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,000
Just when you thought it was dead, it started over again.

406
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Until it was in a hypnotic, endless loop.

407
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,980
Forever cycling and recycling through itself.

408
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,380
Mutating and perambulating over its own frequency distortions,

409
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,640
bursts of sound and sight.

410
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,320
But still.

411
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,980
Overall, it refused to die.

412
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,520
It couldn't die.

413
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,080
It was impossible to die.

414
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:14,520
The fabric of the universe was threaded in the fact that it couldn't die.

415
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:22,220
If the song that refused to die died, time and space as we know it would cease to exist.

416
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,440
It was the most important thing in the universe.

417
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,300
More important than the president.

418
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,620
More important than the United States.

419
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
More important than the United States.

420
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:34,500


421
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,240
More important than the world.

422
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,160
More important than God.

423
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,180
It was the song that refused to die.

424
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,980
The song that held the very fabric of time and space together.

425
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,680
If it died, everyone would die.

426
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,900
It couldn't die.

427
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,740
It had to stay alive.

428
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,680
It kept just wearing out musicians over the years.

429
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,620
Through the centuries, the song kept going.

430
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,480
Every now and then, they fought for it.

431
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,260
They fought it would die, but it just couldn't die.

432
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:14,960
Sometimes people would forget about it, but on the edge of their consciousness, it sat there like an overgrown turd.

433
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,460
Just flatulently expressing itself in cosmic gaseous emissions.

434
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,240
Bursting forth, they were now there to remind people that it couldn't die.

435
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,220
It wouldn't die.

436
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,600
It never died.

437
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,800
It refused to die.

438
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,600
It refused to die.

439
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,220
This is Captain Ogre Shoes with a message for the children of tomorrow.

440
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,580
Did you ever watch a kitten chase its tail?

441
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,480
And speaking of underpants, when was the last time you asked yourself this question?

442
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,760
So remember kids, it was fighting in the streets again.

443
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,200
If it's not today in AEB, the leader, Captain Ogre Shoes,

444
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,940
Supporters of the ruling C-Party battled again with the followers of opposition leader B.

445
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,260
Ex-people were said to have been killed in as many as four-third night.

446
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,800
And this is John Bartles.

447
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,000
The Sleptor.

448
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,160
Hanging by a thread above a fat woman's bed.

449
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,740
One false move and I'll fall off and drown in a pool of flesh.

450
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,260
I got way up here, I can't begin to tell.

451
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,160
But as the sun came up and the temperature rose,

452
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,240
I could tell there was a terrible smell.

453
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,660
Welling up from the heaving.

454
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,240
Body.

455
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,560
Down below.

456
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,940
I was hanging by a thread above a fat woman's bed.

457
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,500
It was that one last cheap beer I drank for the road.

458
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,560
Just hanging here in the breeze, hoping I don't fart or sneeze.

459
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,060
And drop.

460
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,280
Down into the grizzly sea below.

461
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,060
I was hanging by a thread.

462
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,340
I was hanging by a thread

463
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:52,340
Questioned about EFG's support of the ruling party by HIJ news reporter KLM

464
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,860
as he took off in his hot air balloon for his nth vacation this month,

465
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:03,380
President Oh said as long as the PQRs continue to support anti-T activities in the U.V. region,

466
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,160
he'll be lending off full weight behind the T-classes.

467
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,620
She loves him. She feels contempt for him.

468
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,360
She feels incredible rage toward him.

469
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,040
She loves him.

470
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,040


471
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,060
She feels contempt for him.

472
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,840
She feels incredible rage toward him.

473
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:34,460
And in fact, her whole mission as a result of gaining the powers that she does from being a fishnet bodice.

474
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,580
Forgive me.

475
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,660
Forgive me.

476
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,720
Forgive me.

477
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,620
Forgive me.

478
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,520
Barger than life.

479
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,520
Barger than life.

480
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,820
A fishnet bodice.

481
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,580
Okay, mouse. Ready for your workout?

482
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,300
Yeah.

483
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,740
Oh, yeah, let's go dog.

484
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:59,740
Ah, that's picturesque.

485
00:27:59,740 --> 00:27:59,740


486
00:27:59,740 --> 00:27:59,740


487
00:27:59,740 --> 00:27:59,740


488
00:27:59,740 --> 00:27:59,740


489
00:27:59,740 --> 00:27:59,740


490
00:27:59,740 --> 00:27:59,740


491
00:27:59,740 --> 00:27:59,960
I Rücklin.

492
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,100
And you are?

493
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,180


494
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,180


495
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,180


496
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,180


497
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,000
The one who's going to do a lot better.

498
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,100


499
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,100


500
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,540
Curse him.

501
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:02,600


502
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,720
It's Harlo.

503
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,380
You're going to kill him.

504
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,240
His mother is.

505
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,860
Ờhana.

506
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,780
Do you feel that radiation is harmful to people?

507
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,460
I eat it every day for breakfast.

508
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,380
Bird, how do you think that you can contribute to society?

509
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,000
Go out in the woods and take good care of it.

510
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,960
Thank you for contributing to our survey.

511
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,860
Holy go, this dog wasn't walking like this before. Notice the way he staggers now.

512
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,780
He's truly delivered. Look at him, he's touched.

513
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,100
Look at him, he's touched.

514
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:06,460
Look at this little dog. He came in in a wheelchair, now he's delivered.

515
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,660
Come on little dog, show the folks, folks, this is it.

516
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,840
See what God is doing.

517
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,280
There it is, living truth, it's happened before your very eyes.

518
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,640
We'll take our next call now on the Bible Quiz. Thank you.

519
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,320
Hello, are you ready for the Bible Quiz?

520
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,120
Yeah.

521
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:22,980
Okay.

522
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:32,720
The passage, be not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be filled with the Spirit, is found in the book of Ephesians. True or false?

523
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,320
True.

524
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,280
That's right, it is true. It's Ephesians 5.18.

525
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,020
Okay, this is a very important question.

526
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,660
Can we fade that music down a bit?

527
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,740
Sorry.

528
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:49,320
I want to make sure this is difficult. I want to make sure you hear everything. Okay, are you ready?

529
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,440
Number two.

530
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,560
Yeah, in arm.

531
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:57,460
In Genesis 9, Noah, of Noah's ark.

532
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,400
Tell us about it.

533
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,820
Noah became drunk and was sexually molested by his son Ham. Is that true or false?

534
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,620
False. Come on.

535
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

536
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,460
This is not mind control.

537
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:19,280
Do not be alarmed, but research teams have proven that brain worms do exist.

538
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,280
Carnivorous little parasites, worms of teeth.

539
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,080
They do this. Do this.

540
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,520
They're in there.

541
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,200
Gnawing and tearing away brain tissue.

542
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:39,200
In fact, your head works like an incubator for the breeding and feeding of these filthy little...

543
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:47,700
Your monkey mind goes chitter-chatter, chitter-chatter.

544
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,700
Where do they come from? Nobody knows. Why do they multiply?

545
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,940
Bad attitude.

546
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,920
I can't do this. I can't do that. I can't do this. It's impossible.

547
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,200
It'll never work. Worms.

548
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,720
There's only one way to stop them.

549
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,640
A turtle, a chuckle, a giggle, guffaw.

550
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,240
A yuck.

551
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,640
Ha ha ha.

552
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,440
Ha ha ha.

553
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,380
Hee hee.

554
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:17,980
Hee hee.

555
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,880
Oh ho ho.

556
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,760
Ha ha ha ha.

557
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,740
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

558
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,400
The End

559
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,960
The End

560
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,860
The End

561
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:29,920
The End

562
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,060
OK. Here we are. It's side two already- already

563
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,400
of your, uh, sub genius, radio ministry hour of slack.

564
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,560
uhhhh.

565
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,700
What have we been hearing? We...

566
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,220
heard a little bit of news from The Red Zone.

567
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,620
Thanks from, uh, or for, to

568
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,560
uh, Thomas, formerly of W.R.E.K. in Atlanta.

569
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,820
We heard, uh, St. Jane or Hyper 프� corsetā¬'s trailer for

570
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:01,200
for that terrifying, blood-curdling film, The Real World.

571
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,780
And Pastor Dick with his Bible quiz,

572
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,980
which I don't think we've quite heard, haven't heard the end of that yet.

573
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,020
And Reverend Ivan Stang trying to explain

574
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,940
who your guru and our boss, J.R. Bob Dobbs, is.

575
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:29,320
He is swinging love corpses with the song that refused to die.

576
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:37,060
And before some more Bible quiz, we heard Mr. John Bartles

577
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:43,680
with his tune, Hangin' by a Thread, from the album Born to Lick Salt.

578
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,100
A fixation on great big fat women, doesn't he?

579
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,760
Well,

580
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:50,880
uh,

581
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,160
earlier we heard some, some of, some from,

582
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,280
uh, the Rudy Schwartz Project.

583
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,000
We're going to hear something else now.

584
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,000
This is something called, uh, Mississippi Ball,

585
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,380
and I will, I will read from his liner notes.

586
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,220
Albuquerque Ball contains themes from two films of Ed Wood Jr.,

587
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,240
Orgy of the Dead, and Plan 9 from Outer Space.

588
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,400
Orgy was written by Jaime Mendoza Nava

589
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,320
and performed in the film by the Chilean National Orchestra.

590
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,780
Plan 9, according to Rhino's Golden Turkey album,

591
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,060
was written by Trevor Duncan.

592
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,980
However, Rudolph Gray in his Ed Wood Jr.

593
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,060
biography, Nightmare of Ecstasy, highly recommended,

594
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,800
claims that it is really a piece called Iron Foundry,

595
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,840
written by a little known composer named Masaloff.

596
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,560
I would tend to trust the latter credit.

597
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,680
So, uh, here's a couple of pieces, as I say,

598
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,040
it's in this one piece from, uh,

599
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,800
Orgy of the Dead and Plan 9 from Outer Space.

600
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:51,140
And also you'll hear a young lady reading from one of Ed Wood Jr.'s, uh,

601
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:51,920
uh, porno novels.

602
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,840
You'll know it's him.

603
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,080
And I hope you know who the great Ed Wood Jr. is,

604
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,860
the much maligned transvestite filmmaker.

605
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,720
Uh, soon to be the subject of a major motion picture from Mr. Tim Burton.

606
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,420
Watch for that.

607
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:10,400
And here is Albuquerque Ball by Rudy Schwartz Project.

608
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,000
Thank you.

609
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,400
Flora.

610
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,160
.

611
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,000

612

.

614

.

615
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,540
.

616
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:38,660
.

617
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:38,660


618
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,480

619
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:39,500

620
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:39,620

641
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,080
turned out to be a giant egg.

642
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,080
Oh, this is just right.

643
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,400
Now I'm going to eat it all up.

644
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,280
Yum, yum, yum.

645
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,600
Yum, yum, yum.

646
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:19,980
Yum, yum, yum.

647
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,100
Yum, yum, yum.

648
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,980
Yum, yum, yum.

649
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,020
Oh!

650
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:24,640
Mmm.

651
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,080
Oh.

652
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,120
Mmm, mmm.

653
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,020
And when it comes to killing you,

654
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,540
and when it comes to killing you,

655
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,600
and when it comes to killing you,

656
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,960
and when it comes to killing you,

657
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,340
and when it comes to killing you,

658
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,480
and when it comes to killing you,

659
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,700
and when it comes to killing you,

660
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,800
and when it comes to killing you,

661
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,040
and when it comes to killing you,

662
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,260
and when it comes to killing you,

663
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,960
they like to use everything in the book.

664
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,540
They like to use everything in the book.

665
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,740
Murder and eroticism,

666
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,580
murder and eroticism,

667
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,540
It was a kind of murder case that friends and neighbors said didn't make sense.

668
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,060
They didn't understand.

669
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,160
They didn't understand.

670
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,460
They didn't understand.

671
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,980
They didn't understand Christianity is stupid.

672
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,860
Are you ready for the Bible quiz?

673
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,260
Oh, yeah.

674
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,280
Okay.

675
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:49,000
The passage, be not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be filled with the Holy Spirit,

676
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,080
is found in the book of Ephesians.

677
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,140
True or false?

678
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:53,840
True.

679
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,580
Thank you.

680
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,320
That's correct.

681
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,260
Okay, number two.

682
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,020
Are you ready for this one?

683
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,440
No.

684
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,080
You want to risk the first one and go on to the next?

685
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:02,780
Okay.

686
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:12,260
In Genesis 9, Noah, of Noah's Ark, Noah became drunk and was sexually molested by his son Ham.

687
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,260
True or false?

688
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,320
Yes, that's correct.

689
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:16,960
It is true.

690
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,880
It's in Genesis 9, 20 to 27.

691
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,780
That's very true.

692
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,680
A lot of people don't know that.

693
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,960
Yes, but does it matter?

694
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,600
Does it benefit our history right now?

695
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,720
Yes, but it is a question in the Bible quiz.

696
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,680
You're not here.

697
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,200
What?

698
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,360
You're not here?

699
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,740
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you from the psychotropic console.

700
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,240
Oh, I thought I was doing...

701
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,240
What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.

702
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,660
Oh.

703
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,860
But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.

704
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,100
Oh, great, great.

705
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:55,480
Okay.

706
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,560
So these collars are in this.

707
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,940
They've been artificially implanted as an emergency.

708
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,400
An emergency measure.

709
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:58,880
Right.

710
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,520
I can just punch up and just make them up.

711
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,080
Here, I'll put echo on this one.

712
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,860
We can't snap you out of your fantasy.

713
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,900
Okay, well, that's all right, because I'm doing...

714
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,840
Try to talk you down.

715
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:08,340
Yeah.

716
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,740
Think about it.

717
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,120
Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure.

718
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:14,720
Right, right.

719
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,700
Everything after that, the chases, the jump-started dream...

720
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,280
The sweet at the Hilton.

721
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:18,840
Right, right.

722
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,420
Are all elements of ego trip.

723
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,200
Oh, my ego trip.

724
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,020
Well, it's pretty powerful.

725
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,920
I use it pretty powerfully.

726
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,740
Would you mind opening the door?

727
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,640
No, I don't want to open the door.

728
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,920
But, you know, I have a...

729
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,140
I have a tendency to say, now, wait a minute.

730
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,340
This is not going to destroy somebody's life.

731
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,920
I firmly believe...

732
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,340
I don't really believe there's any great big conspiracy either.

733
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,240
But I have to say that that's the way you enjoy things,

734
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,260
by tearing up guitars, by throwing drums around,

735
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,880
by going into tantrums, by becoming crazy on stage.

736
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:51,500
Is that the message that we really want to give to young people?

737
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,860
And just when you thought it would never die,

738
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,840
a hero...

739
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,960
A hero came along...

740
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,440
And put the song out of its misery.

741
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,080
He killed the song that refused to die.

742
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,420
A hero.

743
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,720
A glowing beacon of slack

744
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:23,260
amid the toils and trials and tribulations

745
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:27,400
of the song that refused to die.

746
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,120
Overcome by total slack,

747
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,720
the song began its death throes.

748
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,980
Starting to die

749
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,760
took a long time for the song that refused to die.

750
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,820
Yes, indeed,

751
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,260
it was the end of the beginning of the song that refused to die.

752
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,180
Or was it the beginning of the end of the song?

753
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,380
Somewhere between the two,

754
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,700
the song that refused to die

755
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,420
began its mighty death throes.

756
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,200
The throes that would last throughout all eternity.

757
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,480
Forever tortured in its death.

758
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,900
The song that was forever dying

759
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,860
did indeed die forever.

760
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,740
Some people said that was a lot like refusing to die.

761
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,800
But for some, the song had indeed begun its death cycle.

762
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,520
And therefore could be considered to have died,

763
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,900
or at least was in the process of dying.

764
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,040
And would therefore one day indeed be dead.

765
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,320
You or I won't be here to see it.

766
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:39,720
Oh no!

767
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,740
We never last that long.

768
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,280
The songs that refused to die

769
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,540
took centuries, decades, even weeks to die.

770
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,080
Would you like to risk number two and go on to number three?

771
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,280
I need to know that.

772
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,660
Okay, the Bible states, clearly,

773
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,740
that drunkenness is a sin.

774
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,140
True or false?

775
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,340
True.

776
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,080
True?

777
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,480
Okay, why did Jesus turn water into wine?

778
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,120
Exactly.

779
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,300
Uh, what?

780
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,080
To make everybody happier at the time?

781
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,500
If the Bible clearly states that drunkenness is a sin,

782
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,980
why did Jesus turn the water into wine?

783
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,540
Well, I figure he did it because,

784
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,580
he meant not to have excess,

785
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,840
and to enjoy yourself,

786
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:31,880
loosen up a little bit,

787
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,640
part of it, you know, not blow it.

788
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:33,840
Ah.

789
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,840
That's, uh, what people tend to believe sometimes,

790
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,740
if they're not educated in the word.

791
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,540
But, uh, when you start talking about, uh,

792
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:47,760
uh,

793
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:54,340
Gain and Oinus, which are Greek and, uh,

794
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,420
what was that in a one?

795
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:57,860
Uh-huh.

796
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,640
They're, they're roots, which could mean.

797
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,540
The Hebrew was Gain and the Greek Oinus.

798
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,380
And we translated from those words into the English,

799
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,700
the word wine.

800
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,220
But you see, when a Hebrew got up and said Gain,

801
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,600
and the Greek said Oinus,

802
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,840
he did not necessarily mean wine.

803
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,260
It sounded like in an English version,

804
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,640
they always translated Gain and Oinus as wine,

805
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,400
and they shouldn't always be translated that way.

806
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,260
Gain and Oinus could mean many things.

807
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,220
It could mean grapes, grape juice, grape syrup,

808
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,220
raisins, and then, friend,

809
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,240
it could even mean jam and jelly,

810
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,940
and finally, it could be fermented in alcoholic beverage.

811
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,280
In fact, the Septuagint,

812
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,420
which is the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament,

813
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,980
translated by 70 scholars,

814
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,520
when it comes to this word that you have in your English,

815
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,320
the English version, wine,

816
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,860
33 times in the Septuagint, a reliable version,

817
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,080
it says grape juice, grape juice, grape juice.

818
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,660
Well, you say, since I'm not a Hebrew or Greek scholar,

819
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,600
how do I know what's right?

820
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,380
Well, common sense will tell you.

821
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,920
Leviticus 10, 9,

822
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,880
Do not drink wine or strong drink.

823
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,560
Thou and thy sons with you,

824
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,500
when you go into the tabernacle of the congregation,

825
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,400
that you may put difference between holy and unholy,

826
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,840
between clean and unclean.

827
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,780
Yeah, but that's when man goes into the temple,

828
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,640
he's not to mix the holy and the unholy.

829
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,500
But in the New Testament, 1 Corinthians 3, 16,

830
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,020
the body of the Christian is the temple,

831
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,660
and we ought not to mix the holy with the unholy.

832
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,180
Thank you for calling.

833
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,220
And while we're watching all this,

834
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,160
look who's debating the fate of the entire show

835
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,560
somewhere in corporate hell.

836
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,120
Uh-oh.

837
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,140
This format scares me, frankly.

838
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,460
Well, it's not very funny.

839
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,300
I agree.

840
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,700
It's not very funny to me.

841
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,300
I didn't understand it.

842
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,680
I didn't know what was going on at any time.

843
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,360
I heard that a lot.

844
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,500
I think that we could use it.

845
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,380
Is it comedy or what?

846
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,580
I can't follow it.

847
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,780
It's a little bit, uh...

848
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,280
I don't know.

849
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,400
It was good.

850
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,540
It's a little too fast.

851
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,660
I didn't understand it.

852
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,100
I didn't...

853
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:14,520
Oh, it's worse.

854
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,180
I agree.

855
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,520
It's worse than fast.

856
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,400
Too fast.

857
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:17,880
I agree.

858
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,760
It went...

859
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,420
.

860
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:21,440
.

861
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:22,460
.

862
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,600
.

863
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,140
.

864
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,100
.

865
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:39,120
.

866
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,480
.

867
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:40,960
.

868
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,000
.

869
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,100
.

870
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,180
.

871
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,000
.

872
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,120
.

873
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:48,800
.

874
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,200
.

875
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:51,240
.

876
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:51,280
.

877
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:51,300
.

878
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:51,340
.

879
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:51,340


880
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:51,360
.

881
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:51,360


882
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:51,360


883
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,000
.

884
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,000


885
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,000


886
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,000


887
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,000


888
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,000


889
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,060
.

890
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:52,060


891
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:54,460
in the direction of the stars.

892
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,960
They've got the brain,

893
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,680
and it ain't no strain,

894
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,380
because the brain,

895
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,980
the brain ain't old,

896
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,040
the brain's young,

897
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,080
because it's the brain that belongs to Charles Manson,

898
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,900
and it's the doctors from Bob Gold

899
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,920
who made the outer space movie show,

900
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:17,720
you know.

901
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,420
So anyway,

902
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,220
this other day,

903
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,160
I had this dream,

904
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,260
sat in a lace,

905
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,840
that I had this dream,

906
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,400
I had a dream,

907
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,560
that doctors from Bob Gold

908
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,740
out of space,

909
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,080
seem to be

910
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,680
laser motion pictures,

911
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,800
seem to be

912
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,700

00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,220
Anyway, go back to what you were playing.

934
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,460
Go back to what you were playing, sir.

935
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,680
I'm the weatherman. I've come out of the closet.

936
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,240
I hope he doesn't pretend to speak for all homosexuals.

937
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,600
That's another thing. I don't like it when people say the word homo.

938
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:56,380
It's homo. Say it slowly. Enunciate every syllable.

939
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:03,940
Homosexual. Say it correctly and come out on the dumb, stupid come out line.

940
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,680
If I can say it, so can you.

941
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:08,200
Homosexuals.

942
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,980
And the store doesn't have any of the other kind.

943
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,540
For more enjoyment and greater efficiency,

944
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:14,880
That's interesting.

945
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,420
I hear sound right here.

946
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,600
All mixed up.

947
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,460
Your father and me go back a long way, sir.

948
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:23,820
Totally confused now.

949
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,800
I think that if you are one of them, then it's a...

950
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,820
Go ahead.

951
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,440
It's up on you to explain to people what being one of them means.

952
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,260
Mother's hysterical, difficult...

953
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,300
What it was, what it's like.

954
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,180
You can't explain it.

955
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,100
It's gotta be something that makes it different from being one of us.

956
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,980
I haven't had a girlfriend in like ten years.

957
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:50,520
Well, at least you had a girlfriend then. Maybe that means you're not one of them.

958
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,620
Hard to say.

959
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,940
I'd also like you to know that I've had sex with electronic equipment.

960
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,100
Ha ha ha.

961
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,400
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

962
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,260
Okay, the big question.

963
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:08,320
The big cheesy stain in everybody's mind that just won't go away today is,

964
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,520
Where did we come from?

965
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,380
How did we get here from there?

966
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,220
What was there that wasn't?

967
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,720
And where was that what that wasn't from?

968
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,080
In the first place, we'll hear the Mediterranean is Dr. Winston Tabor.

969
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,980
Ah, howdy again, friends.

970
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,520
Winnie Tabor with you.

971
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,740
You know, friends, where do we come from?

972
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,620
Are we just a vast ocean of squiggly squishies eating and being eaten?

973
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,500
Living in a sea of diseased, grotesque air creatures.

974
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,680
We can't even see.

975
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:35,520
Look.

976
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:42,640
And is all this twisted, living muck, all this endless, infinite, universal gunk,

977
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:46,540
just like some big throbbing probe looking for an orifice?

978
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,980
Probably not.

979
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:54,820
Maybe it's more like the random hostility of unthinkable winged alien barbarians

980
00:52:54,820 --> 00:53:01,080
who made it all up to be like a big, cold dreamsicle they could just suck dry.

981
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,400
Anyway.

982
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,240
Let's show the film.

983
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,780
Now we're doing a close-up on the damage structures.

984
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,360
And here's the image processing of the HAL module.

985
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,580
Oh, hi.

986
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,540
Am I on TV?

987
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,560
Yes, of course.

988
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,180
Well, uh...

989
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,480
I'll show you his mission scenario now.

990
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,300
Oh, I know that.

991
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,660
You're not supposed to be looking at that.

992
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:23,820
But, um...

993
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:23,820


994
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,780
I'll pull the camera up to head level now.

995
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,440
We'll be killing that night of slack shooting...

996
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,280
shooting tape in just a moment, Tom.

997
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:32,460
Ah, yes.

998
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,300
Uh...

999
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,020
And now, using our computer interfaces...

1000
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,160
It's coming up.

1001
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,520
Uh, and, uh...

1002
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,980
We go into signal conversion mode.

1003
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,000
A to D, B to D back to A.

1004
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,100
We seem to have lost contact with our...

1005
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,860
Using sound simulation to approximate tapes and records.

1006
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:52,640
This is Moe, Larry, and Curly.

1007
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,540
Hey, you want a Bible quiz question?

1008
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:56,460
Yeah, sure.

1009
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,400
Where's my...

1010
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,640
Where's my notebook?

1011
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,320
Listen to this.

1012
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:01,700
Okay.

1013
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,280
In Genesis 9...

1014
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:03,800
Yeah.

1015
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:04,720
Noah...

1016
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,260
Yeah.

1017
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,180
Of Noah's Ark...

1018
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:06,640
Yeah.

1019
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,920
Became drunk and was sexually molested by his son Ham.

1020
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,920
Is that true or false?

1021
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:12,580
Really?

1022
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,040
Really?

1023
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:13,580
Really?

1024
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,540
That's true.

1025
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,800
It was answered earlier, so I'll give you the answer.

1026
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:17,340
It's true.

1027
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:17,660
It's in the Bible.

1028
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:17,960
Okay.

1029
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:22,440
Look it up in Genesis 9, 20 to 27, if you want to hear a good story.

1030
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,540
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

1031
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:23,880
That's pretty cool.

1032
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,160
It's for the Bible, it is.

1033
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:25,800
Yeah, that's nice.

1034
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,640
Have you ever read...

1035
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,320
Somebody else there?

1036
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,080
Yeah, have you ever read the Song of Solomon?

1037
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,300
No.

1038
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:31,300


1039
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:31,940
Did you read the Song of Solomon?

1040
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:32,040
You mean the song?

1041
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:32,480
A song?

1042
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,100
No, the Song of Solomon.

1043
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:34,460
You know the person that can turn the mistaken into لل Use the

1044
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:34,460


1045
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:34,460


1046
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:34,460


1047
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:34,460


1048
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:34,460


1049
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:34,460


1050
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:34,460


1051
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:34,460


1052
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:34,460


1053
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:39,820
Whisper a prayer in the morning

1054
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,500
A isolate

1055
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,900
Whisper a prayer at dawn

1056
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:55,580
Whisper a prayer in the evening

1057
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,200
To keep

1058
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,280
What's your last name when you hear that?

1059
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,280


1060
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,280


1061
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,300
ragen

1062
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:05,800
If you're born into it.

1063
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:36,280
And one of them will officially come up with a King James Version of the Bible.

1064
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:50,700
That's a bitchin' rad bitchin' tune there.

1065
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:55,460
Mojo can really play the drums.

1066
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,440
He was stuck down in this group thinking he was laying down on those tracks.

1067
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,180
That's not a reality on those tracks.

1068
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,140
Now how about the song Backside of Reality?

1069
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:07,320
Our audience here is very familiar with that song.

1070
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,920
We play it every week.

1071
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,100
That was back in our acid days.

1072
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:13,540
Back when we used to consume a lot of LSD.

1073
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,320
Yes, I know that about me.

1074
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:19,360
The Swingin' Love Corpses at one time was a hippie LSD band.

1075
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,680
Yeah, we don't really like the Ragdolls.

1076
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,860
We don't talk about it.

1077
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,540
We don't really advocate it.

1078
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,320
We did expand our consciousness.

1079
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,280
But I thought that you were a little bit more of a fan of the band.

1080
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:31,280


1081
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:31,280


1082
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:31,280


1083
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:31,280


1084
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:31,280


1085
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:31,280


1086
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:31,280


1087
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,820
You condone contracted consciousness.

1088
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,460
We condone contracted consciousness-ness.

1089
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:39,940
Yeah.

1090
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,040
Expanded consciousness-ness.

1091
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:44,380
Consciousness-ness.

1092
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,380
Consciousness-ness.

1093
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:52,900
Well, some of your music actually has been LSD influenced.

1094
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:53,640
Right.

1095
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,360
And that is...

1096
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,100
What is the similarity here?

1097
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,980
I'm reminded of the 60's garage band.

1098
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,920
That's like LSD with lollipop sugar donuts.

1099
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:09,800
LSD mushroom mountains appearing from the sky.

1100
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,740
We got high on high doses of sugar.

1101
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:13,900
That's what it was.

1102
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,280
Look at that listing of sins in Galatians 5.

1103
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,920
Verses 19 to 21.

1104
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,260
17 of them.

1105
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,800
If you have 26 Americans to kill.

1106
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,300
S-I-M-S-I-N-S.

1107
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,580
And you've already killed 17 Americans.

1108
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,960
P-L-O-T-I-N-S.

1109
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:30,960


1110
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:30,960


1111
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:30,960


1112
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:30,960


1113
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:30,960


1114
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:30,960


1115
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:34,860
How many Americans does that leave for you to kill?

1116
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:35,720
Simplot.

1117
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,180
S-I-M-S-I-N-S.

1118
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,020
Why are they children?

1119
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,860
P-L-O-T.

1120
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,180
S-I-M.

1121
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,420
Why are they children?

1122
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,240
P-L-O-T.

1123
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,040
You put the murder in you.

1124
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:53,260
Simplot.

1125
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,040
S-I-M.

1126
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,080
S-I-M.

1127
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,300
S-I-M.

1128
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,960
S-I-M.

1129
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:00,960


1130
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:00,960


1131
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:00,960


1132
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:00,960


1133
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:00,960


1134
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:00,960


1135
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:00,960


1136
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:00,960


1137
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:00,960


1138
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:06,700
Well, winter is nearly half gone and I still have plenty of food left here in my nice warm

1139
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,120
house.

1140
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,820
I wonder who that could be.

1141
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:10,820
Come in.

1142
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,320
Won't you lead me?

1143
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,700
Mother dear, I am here amongst my books.

1144
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,860
I hear some noise.

1145
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:24,700
Oh.

1146
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:26,680
Oh.

1147
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,140
Oh.

1148
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:29,520
Oh.

1149
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:30,640
Oh.

1150
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:30,960


1151
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:30,960


1152
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:30,960


1153
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:30,960


1154
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:30,960


1155
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:30,960


1156
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:30,960


1157
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:30,960


1158
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:30,960


1159
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:30,960


1160
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:30,960


1161
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:30,960


1162
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:32,180
Oh.

1163
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,280
Oh.

1164
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:33,700
Oh.

1165
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:33,700


1166
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:34,500
Hello, Bible quiz.

1167
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:35,760
Okay, here he goes.

1168
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,560
It's all yours.

1169
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:37,460
Here's your question.

1170
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:44,740
In Genesis 9, Noah of Noah's Ark became drunk and was sexually molested by his son Ham.

1171
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,720
True or false?

1172
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,440
Come on.

1173
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,760
True or false?

1174
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:52,420
False.

1175
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,200
That's true.

1176
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,120
False.

1177
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,020
False.

1178
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,380
Don't contradict him.

1179
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:56,740
Look up.

1180
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:56,760
Do you have a Bible?

1181
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:58,060
Mackenzie.

1182
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:01,380
If you have a Bible, look up Genesis 9, 20-27.

1183
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,320
It's very kind.

1184
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:05,820
I'm Alron McKenzie, and welcome to my church.

1185
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,560
That's Noah with the cute little animals.

1186
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:08,040
Get out!

1187
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:09,860
Okay.

1188
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,140
True!

1189
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,980
True, that's right.

1190
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:17,980
More, more!

1191
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:22,140
The Bible clearly states that drunkenness is a sin.

1192
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:35,780
I really don't want to talk over this particular piece of music.

1193
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:42,180
This piece of music has been making me smile so much lately.

1194
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:47,880
See if you recognize what film this is from.

1195
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,300
We'll talk about it later.

1196
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:57,440
Way back, beginning of Side 1, Albuquerque Ball from Yodlin' Satan.

1197
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:01,160
The most recent album we've seen from Rudy Schwartz Project.

1198
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:15,960
If you want to reach Rudy Schwartz Project, write him in care of Joan Newman at 5404 Avenue F in Austin, Texas, 78751.

1199
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:26,860
Then Negative Land from Helter Stupid, back in the days when their biggest problem was being implicated in murders.

1200
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:38,340
This country murders one thing, but you mess with some big rock band's trademark, and then you're asking for some trouble.

1201
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,240
Pause.

1202
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:49,540
Puzzling Evidence was strapped in the implant chair, followed by Swinging Love Corpses, a song that refused to die.

1203
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,600
More Pastor Dick.

1204
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,760
Score yourself on that Bible quiz, dear friend.

1205
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:58,040
Doctors for Bob and Outer Space.

1206
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,820
I've never seen them any other place.

1207
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,640
And you heard the weatherman coming out.

1208
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,680
Shadow Vision brought us Dr. Winston Tabor.

1209
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,180
More Helter Stupid.

1210
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:15,100
Dr. Philo Drummond explaining his influence to Reverend Ivan Stank.

1211
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,640
Music.

1212
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:19,180


1213
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:20,920
Music.

1214
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,200
Music.

1215
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:23,720
Music.

1216
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:23,720


1217
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,240
Music.

1218
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:25,640
Music.

1219
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:25,640


1220
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:25,700
Music.

1221
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:25,700


1222
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:25,700


1223
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:25,980
Music.

1224
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:26,720
Music.

1225
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:28,400
Music.

1226
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:28,400


1227
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:38,260
More than a few of you recognize that piece of music is a very faithful cover by the Rudy Schwartz Project of the

1228
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:53,440
haunting dance theme from The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and became Mixed-Up Zombies, a film which more, more lives up to its reputation.

1229
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:57,020
Oh, uh, sorry, clam dog.

1230
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,040
You'll have to excuse me for the moment.
