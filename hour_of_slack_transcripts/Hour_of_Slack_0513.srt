1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:20,200
Oh Bob, give me food, give me slack, give me...

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,340
No, repair my computer, Bob.

3
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,460
Oh Bob, give me food, give me pills, give me slack.

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,640
Oh, forget the pills, fix my computer.

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,200
Oh Bob, give me food or give me slack, fix my computer, praise Bob.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,560
These groups are working at a much more fundamental level.

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,140
They're teaching these people processes of chanting

8
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,880
that are not like any kind of Christian meditation or Christian chanting.

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,720
They're stealing the workings of the mind

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,620
at the level of the brain and nervous system,

11
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,300
and not just for an hour a day, not just for morning devotion,

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,200
but over dozens and dozens and hundreds of hours.

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,360
Oh, slack!

14
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,060
Welcome potential initiates.

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,400
Remain with us for thousands and thousands of hours and hours and hours.

16
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,500
Welcome to Genius Radio Ministry.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,180
Our audience.

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,160
Of Slack.

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,520
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,560
What is wrong with this picture?

21
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,040
What time is it?

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,780
Give me your watch.

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,720
Now you don't have to worry about the time.

24
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,740
I'm going to show you how to do it.

25
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:53,740


26
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,360
Green leafy substance.

27
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,980
Green.

28
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,020
Green.

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,700
Green leafy substance.

30
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,180
Time is the essence of a drummer.

31
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,580
When he was on marijuana, his timing was distorted.

32
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,460
When you're on drugs, you just pound, pound, pound.

33
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,080
K-A-M.

34
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,900
K-A-M.

35
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,580
J-A-M.

36
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,300
K-A-M.

37
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,620
J-A-M-.

38
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:40,380
J-A-M.

39
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,240
, comparable to trombone, low-pitch, trombone, adaptable and

40
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,440
K-all, baréº».

41
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,960
How to.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Arranged in the middle finger.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,160
When doing oblong ar Riley.

44
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,160


45
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,160


46
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,160


47
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,160


48
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,160


49
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,180
Downtown, boss,SM.

50
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,400
Per.

51
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,920
Doesn't anybody want to find out some personal info from your doctors?

52
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Doesn't anybody want to get the straight poop on Doctors for Bob?

53
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,300
You're taking me in a bit too literally, my God.

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,380
Put that away.

55
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,200
I don't want to see that.

56
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,480
Who's got that air freshener?

57
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,320
Oh, Lord.

58
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,920
Somebody open a window.

59
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,300
You're going to need a steam shovel.

60
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:24,920
Yeah.

61
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,080
Is that corn?

62
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,000
My God.

63
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,720
Well, apparently the perpetrator was a corn-eating ruminant.

64
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,800
Yes, the sesame seeds and the strings from the celery are indigestible.

65
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,520
We have to leave all this stuff here pending the investigation,

66
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,420
but your living room will be spanking clean at the end of the next election period.

67
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,400
And by the time Doc's Doc ends this year, everyone will be hearty, happy, and fat.

68
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,280
All the children will be tucked snugly into their...

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,080
What are those things called?

70
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,180
Beds.

71
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,860
No, those things with the spikes and the electrodes.

72
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,900
You know, the acid buckets that you just spin over the top of them

73
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,540
and those kind of sleeping surfaces made out of swords and rusty razor blades.

74
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,500
Those are called tiny-bite-a-wee slumber cradles.

75
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,920
When you have to sleep under the...

76
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,160
What?

77
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,160


78
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,240
Drill-o-pads that are dripping with the muriatic acid

79
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,740
and the things that were those fish hooks,

80
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,600
the ones with the three-treble hooks, they call them, are kind of...

81
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,320
Those were bars by the Geneva Convention.

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,540
The ones that they have to put into their noses

83
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,340
and when they hook them with their testicles up to the telephone

84
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,840
and they turn that crank handle and send about 68 volts DC

85
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,180
right through the genitalia of everyone who attends the Doc's Doc

86
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,160
and, of course, the...

87
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,640
the legendary square needle and the left nut test

88
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,460
to get into whatever the Doc's Doc...

89
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,600
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.

90
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,020
And you can find out something about how much...

91
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,580
If you pay that much money and show up at the door on time,

92
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,300
if Doc's Doc will be something that you wouldn't want to miss next time,

93
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:10,600
I wouldn't think so.

94
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,920
Well, less than ten minutes remaining.

95
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,620
About seven minutes, more precisely, Dr. Howell,

96
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,940
which is not enough time, in my estimation...

97
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,260
For this caller to say anything smart.

98
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,040
All right.

99
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,000
All right, caller, did you want to hear the story of Dobbs the Salesman?

100
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,180
Say yes.

101
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,180
You say yes and then Howell does the story anyway.

102
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,540
Or say no and ask...

103
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:27,800
And then the thing's going to be over.

104
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,680
And then Howell does the story anyway.

105
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,160
Ask a short question, please.

106
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:30,400
Yes.

107
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:30,820
No.

108
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,520
And the whole thing's going to be over in just a few minutes, so...

109
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,840
Dobbs the Salesman.

110
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,720
His very name rings with...

111
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,900
It's like 800 times a show.

112
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,720
We have to listen to the Brings story.

113
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,820
Dobbs saw the future and just...

114
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,040
He was sucking up the venerable excess

115
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,380
that was a waste that was kind of excreted by...

116
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,020
...his mind.

117
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,400
Dobbs used his mystical powers to aid the fortress of Rysis,

118
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,040
honor and virtue,

119
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,460
and to shape the splendid visions of his noble king, Stang.

120
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,780
But when the tragic end of Dobbstown drew near,

121
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,040
many say that the hot, sick Dobbs

122
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,080
sought refuge with a tiny, piddling poodle

123
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,800
known as Pixie Pippa.

124
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,640
And those wound lips were slowly sunken in a landfill

125
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,060
to rest safely until needed by his countrymen.

126
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,980
It makes me want to have those pictures of Pixie.

127
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,900
It makes me want to...

128
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,620
I don't know what it does.

129
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,760
I don't know.

130
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,640
That's Trixie, not Pixie.

131
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:23,720
Yeah.

132
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,860
He's about to finish up the story, folks.

133
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,800
We got about six minutes left of story.

134
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,540
If you've ever succumbed to the lure of magic,

135
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,960
if you've ever dreamed of faraway times and places

136
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,460
where wondrous beings exert awesome otherworldly power...

137
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,020
Then we don't have to kill you this morning.

138
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,340
Then you're ready to leave your earthly cares behind

139
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,360
and probe the spellbinding secrets of...

140
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,560
Doc Stock Central.

141
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,660
And the show where tumescent satyrs leap from...

142
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,280
Wow.

143
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,580
...the rites of Pan.

144
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,240
Three.

145
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,120
Witches and wizards trade recipes and spells...

146
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,120


147
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,740
...the vivid imaginary universe that exists...

148
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,620
They take their pants off for this one, I believe.

149
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,940
...where bunyips burble from crocodile-ridden swamps

150
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,120
and duendes scuttle in southwestern adobe shadows.

151
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,440
And now it's all gone.

152
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,340
The realm of witches and wizards and ghosts,

153
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,300
goblins and gnomes, fairies, pansies, nerds, elves, giants, and ogres,

154
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,220
where valiant knights battle fearsome dragons,

155
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,280
mermaids, splash, and sunlit seas, and mystical unicorns...

156
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,080
That's just a bunch of bull hockey.

157
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,280
You ask Billy Samuels what he thinks about that, and he would say that he...

158
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,940
Shh, shh, shh, this is for the callers.

159
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,060
He didn't think anyone...

160
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,220
Don't blow it. The callers actually believe in this stuff.

161
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,240
He didn't think that. He let you do that.

162
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,020
I gotta say this for the callers.

163
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,480
Oh, it's just a bunch of mythologizing that they're doing here according to Billy.

164
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,120
But they have to hold on to something. They have to believe in something, don't they?

165
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,300
All he'd have to do is bring a kaiser blade to him...

166
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,200
Whatever you're doing. ...and split him in half.

167
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,140
However far in you are, you do have to believe in something.

168
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,080
I mean, I firmly do believe there is a vital spark in the heart of man.

169
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,460
One must believe in that, and one must believe at least in that.

170
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,760
But what about the end piece?

171
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,380
You mean the end piece?

172
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,260
The end piece.

173
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:13,380
Well, uh, many have a strong case of NP, of others' attributes, but you see, it's very bad...

174
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,520
Subscribers to this mythology don't seem to realize that Doc Stock is not for everyone.

175
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:27,060
Dangerous shadows lurk near, and one might easily trip over the insertion of a foot into the buckle orifice.

176
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:33,600
And placing the church air canister in the kaiser blade rooms may seem a bit folly to many.

177
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,540
Whoa! I put down a little bit of heart.

178
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,540
If you're an inexperienced Doc Stock attendee...

179
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,020
I'm feeling a mite testy.

180
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,100
Yes, when we take no responsibility for cuts, lacerations, contusions...

181
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,600
I'll have a Doc Stock donut and say, uh...

182
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,500
...broken bones.

183
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Oh my god, no, I'll cancel that. I'll just have coffee, thank you.

184
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,040
Yes, I'll have the special Doc Stock brew.

185
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,860
Oh, I should have ordered that.

186
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,800
Everything comes with pills at Doc Stock, you don't have to mention it.

187
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,700
I can pop mine without even a glass of water. I ain't no sissy.

188
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,120
Yep, we'll just cram handfuls of pills right into the orifice and...

189
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,400
I just make my throat a funnel and pour the pills down.

190
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,300
And he's truly a man for today.

191
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,600
Boy, my belly rattles like a gumball machine. Can't I put him away?

192
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,280
And indeed he can, folks, as he does every year at Doc Stock.

193
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,020
65,000 pills were used to fuel the doctors at this year's Doc Stock.

194
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:34,720
Yes, the whole world of enchantment that has bewitched the human mind and spirit since the dawn of time...

195
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,920
...will be available at Doc Stock.

196
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,880
Banshees jibber in the bushes, gnomes natter at you from underground...

197
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,540
...and the eerie howl of the fearsome loop garu echoes through the rustling forest.

198
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,320
As the poop dog hat drips slowly but surely...

199
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,200
...across the foreheads of those tied-down Doc Stock attendees...

200
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,080
...those all too familiar with the legendary big red straps...

201
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,660
...here at Doc Stock Central...

202
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,260
...and Will Kmodfran blowing himself up.

203
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,420
That was sad.

204
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,660
Yeah, it was.

205
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,220
That was sad.

206
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,600
And it's the end of the show.

207
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,680
And we'd like to thank everyone for calling this evening.

208
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,900
That's not always like this.

209
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,220
Well, not everyone. Especially...

210
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,460
We'd like to thank Turno Stocks for being on the show.

211
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,060
We'd especially like not to thank most of the callers tonight who...

212
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,360
...had nothing to contribute to this year's Doc Stock.

213
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,860
Nothing except a little bit of midget mustard and other condiments of the air.

214
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,180
Goodbye till next time.

215
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh no.

216
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,300
And next time you're next we'll be in the noose indeed...

217
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,700
...because puzzling evidence will not be here.

218
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,240
He must take a long trip to Hobnob with his brother wizards and...

219
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,780
Oh, that's right. He was here.

220
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:48,500
...while I will be doing the show with Don Joyce of Over the Edge all throughout the next...

221
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:55,460
Yes, yes, yes. Dear friends, a beautiful, beautiful long excerpt there from the show.

222
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,860
The KPFA, a Berkeley subgenius show from puzzling evidence.

223
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:08,920
And you heard lots of Dr. Howell there co-spouting with the great Pope Sternodocs, a special guest.

224
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,820
And friends, they're talking about Doc Stock.

225
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,080
And is Doc Stock going to come to your town?

226
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,040
Well, it just might.

227
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,860
I've got some wonderful news for you.

228
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,540
I hope it doesn't get to you too late.

229
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,400
The World Slack Crusade is about to leave.

230
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,300
And I'm going to go ahead and give these cities and dates...

231
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,780
...because they're mostly in the towns where this radio show is played.

232
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,740
So chances are quite good if you're hearing this...

233
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:41,240
...you can actually come to that selfsame World Slack Crusade Doc Stockian event there.

234
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:48,640
Which in this particular tour will star yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stagg, along with Dr. Legume.

235
00:11:48,740 --> 00:12:01,140
And those wacky, head-crushing, bug-eating, face-skewering, lip-sewing-shut-with-piano-wire wacky duo, The Circus Apocalypse.

236
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:11,020
February 2nd, we'll be in Chicago at Double Door.

237
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:20,920
February 3rd, which is a Saturday, we'll be in Madison, Wisconsin at the Club de Walsh.

238
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,460
Thanks to W-O-R-T there.

239
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,860
And Reverend Velveteen Sly will be there.

240
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes indeed, dear friends!

241
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,300
Tuesday the 6th in Minneapolis.

242
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,760
Wednesday the 7th, dear friends, Wednesday the 7th of February.

243
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,220
The World Slack Crusade will be in St. Louis, Missouri.

244
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,600
Oh, well none of you are...

245
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,220
...there you go.

246
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,320
This show ain't on in St. Louis.

247
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,240
Well anyway, that'll have the swingin' love corpses.

248
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,900
Oh, Jane or Hypercleets will be in Chicago and maybe some of these other shows.

249
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Thursday the 8th, Indianapolis at the Patio.

250
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,400
Friday, February 9th, Cleveland at Peabody's.

251
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,940
Yes, friends, with Indian Rope Burn, Dr. Legume, Circus Apocalypse, Papa Joe Mama, I think.

252
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,280
Well, who knows? Who knows what all else?

253
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,220
Monday, February 12th, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at the Mellon Institute Auditorium.

254
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,620
Wednesday the 14th, Baltimore at Memory Lane.

255
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,080
Thursday the 15th, you WFMU listeners, you listening now?

256
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,860
Thursday the 15th, in New York City at Wetlands.

257
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,260
Yes, Wetlands in New York.

258
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,260
And I don't have an address for that.

259
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,820
Oh yeah, I do. 161 Hudson Street.

260
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,080
Well, call for information.

261
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,700
And let's see, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

262
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,220
Saturday, February 17th.

263
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,320
February 17th at the Middle East.

264
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,540
And Toronto, friends, for our wonderful listeners in Toronto.

265
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,740
Sunday the 18th at the Opera House.

266
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,400
Whatever that is.

267
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,220
And I'm telling you all I know.

268
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,460
But I do know that yes, we will preach.

269
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,340
We will be there.

270
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,880
And there shall be a balm in Gilead, dear friends.

271
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:09,920
And perhaps we shall even, yea, set free the pygmy yeti of the British Isles.

272
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:15,280
You know, people try to pretend there's no such thing as the pygmy yeti of the British Isles.

273
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,160
Because the hair is such a funny color.

274
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,140
And nobody wants to believe that it's a pot of gold.

275
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,280
A real, literal pot of gold at the end of that rainbow.

276
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,440
But it is. It is, dear friends.

277
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,820
Ah, yes. So good. So good to be back.

278
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,200
Back on whatever this is.

279
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,380
The radio, I think that's what this medium is.

280
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,520
It's so hard to tell.

281
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,100
So hard to tell, dear friends.

282
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,700
Ah, yes.

283
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,580
But I can feel the power of Dobbs coursing through me.

284
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,640
No, wait. That's the power of Jimi Hendrix.

285
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,880
I think I'm going to switch over to the power of Dobbs.

286
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,300
Because, friends, I've got to get serious with you just for a minute here.

287
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,080
Did you ever have the blues?

288
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,960
Have you ever felt totally slackless, my friend?

289
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:17,000
Have you ever felt like everything was just caving in on you all at once and there was no way out?

290
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,560
Well, if you haven't, then you're probably not a subgenius, my friend.

291
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:29,900
Now, some of you come to this show because you are damaged.

292
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,240
Some come because everybody else is damaged.

293
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,880
Either way, you feel alone.

294
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,880
Well, you are alone, my friend.

295
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,920
And we're not going to lie to you about that.

296
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:50,980
But we're not, at the same time, this church, this radio ministry is not,

297
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,860
we don't gather together at our devivals to be all alone together.

298
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:01,280
Like fuzzy little love bunnies in some new age nerd support group.

299
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,760
Nay!

300
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,700
And chances are, you know, really, wouldn't you rather be alone?

301
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,580
You'd just as soon be alone.

302
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,940
And my friend, that's what Bob is good for.

303
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,940
You can be alone with Bob.

304
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,820
Yes, you can be alone with Bob.

305
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,580
He's about the only personal savior you can be alone with.

306
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,020
All those other personal saviors, oh, hell, they're always breathing down your neck, watching you.

307
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,700
Oh, did you sin too much today?

308
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,540
Are you going to be able to pay the bills this month?

309
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,600
Is your work really any good?

310
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:46,780
With Dobbs, with J.R. Bob Dobbs, you don't have that problem because Bob doesn't care.

311
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:52,100
He could give a good golly gosh darn about your failures and your sins.

312
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,560
He ain't well enough connected to forgive your sins.

313
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,520
And even if he was, he doesn't think there's anything you need to be forgiven for particularly.

314
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,920
No, sir.

315
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,520
Bob Dobbs ain't going to forgive your sins because he comes, as we've said before, to justify your sins.

316
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,580
To rationalize your sins.

317
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,800
He brings not forgiveness but an excuse.

318
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:16,560
So don't worry about being a failure in the conspiracy world.

319
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:27,840
They will try to humiliate you, but they lack the cosmic knowledge that the only thing that never fails is failure.

320
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,340
The only thing that never works is perfection.

321
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,520
The only workable philosophy.

322
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:46,520
The one rule of this church is, well as we say on the radio, let them mount up upon themselves if they can't take a joke.

323
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:53,920
You gotta stop blaming yourself for your failures, my friend, and get back to blaming the conspiracy.

324
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,980
The conspiracy tries to tell you that a failed experiment is bad and that you're a loser if you aren't rich.

325
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,760
And that it's, on top of that, that it's somehow abnormal and unreasonable.

326
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:13,560
And that it's unhealthy to be depressed, pessimistic, consumed with hate, and desperately seeking slack in strange places.

327
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:19,600
Those are actually appropriate responses to a world that is so messed up.

328
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,500
So messed up, friends, that even the church of the subgenius starts to make sense by comparison.

329
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:32,260
The idea that it's normal for everything to always be all cheery and hunky dory and lovey dovey.

330
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,940
That is a lie, my friend. It is a black lie.

331
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,480
As the old bumper sticker says, I'd rather be killing optimists.

332
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:49,200
I'd rather be killing optimists because that way, friends, lies a life of quiet desperation.

333
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,860
Now we subgenii choose to lead lives of ear-splitting desperation.

334
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:02,520
We want slack, but we're getting force-fed a gross pablum of false slack.

335
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,920
And we are not going to be polite about our own lack of slack.

336
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:04,920


337
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:04,920


338
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,800
We are going to be polite about our pure, unrelenting hate.

339
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:14,520
When they won't let you have the kind of slack you need, then are you not forced to obtain slack through hate?

340
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,280
The Christians and New Agers, they like to channel their love.

341
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:26,220
Well, that's just fine for them since those pinks make up 95% of the overpopulation.

342
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:34,840
Likewise, so too may the subgenius tap into and channel the great hate force of the universe.

343
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:34,920


344
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,920
And transmute it from stupidity into slack.

345
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,860
It is true that slack is the energy which powers the universe.

346
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:58,040
And it is equally true that invisible, seething, self-contained hate particles compose the missing matter of the universe for which quantum physicists still search.

347
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,900
Hate and failure are part of nature, my friend.

348
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,080
And must needs be unsuspected paths to slack.

349
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:14,860
The life of a subgenius marooned in a sea of humans can be hard.

350
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:22,180
You might think that I have the most slack-filled job in the world, next to Bob.

351
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,120
But no, no, actually it ain't.

352
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,760
It ain't easy around here, friends.

353
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,260
We took on the job of pulling God's leg.

354
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,320
And it's a big leg, my friend.

355
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,400
A mighty big leg to pull.

356
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,680
I'll admit it.

357
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,180
Devoting your heart and mind and soul to Bob won't solve all your problems.

358
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,200
It'll just help you to blow them off.

359
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,620
Besides, you may not yet have any inkling what slack really is for you.

360
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,380
You might think of, oh, if I had such and such, then I'd have slack.

361
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:02,480
And you actually start working too hard for slack.

362
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,300
It can happen.

363
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,420
It has happened to me.

364
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,260
You build up to an obsessed fever pitch reaching for that gold ring of slack.

365
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,360
And it backfires and it snowballs.

366
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,220
It goes out of control.

367
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,680
And it becomes black or sullied slack.

368
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,260
It becomes anti-slack.

369
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,120
And, my friend, that's when J.R. Bob Dobbs steps in and saves your butt.

370
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,440
But Bob doesn't save you.

371
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,080
By answering your prayers.

372
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,800
He didn't pay any attention to your prayers.

373
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,960
He just makes everything break down.

374
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,960
Everything just falls apart.

375
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,660
Suddenly there's this whole string of terrible breakdowns and disasters.

376
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,160
And everything is shot to hell.

377
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,340
And you can do nothing.

378
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,200
And it's not your fault.

379
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
No, friend.

380
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,240
You look down and there's that treadmill you've been on.

381
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,800
Broken and smoking.

382
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,920
For nothing.

383
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,780
And at that moment Bob has enlightened you.

384
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,140
For you think to yourself, praise Bob.

385
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,460
Everything went totally all to hell in the very nick of time.

386
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,640
Now, now, I can relax.

387
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,740
In fact, I have no choice.

388
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,400
Why, that glass wasn't half empty at all.

389
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,820
It was actually half full the whole time.

390
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,440
And I just didn't see it.

391
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,200
I have been delivered slack from whence I least expected it.

392
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,440
Oh, praise his sweet name.

393
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,520
Yes, friends.

394
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,580
Involuntary slack may be your deliverance.

395
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,160
It may not be the kind of slack you had in mind.

396
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,380
In fact, you could even say that it was forced slack.

397
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,640
But yet, it is just as real all the same.

398
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,980
It may come up behind you and whoop you upside the back of the head.

399
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,260
Like a mugger on a city street.

400
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:07,320
But when it snaps you out of your treadmill of false slack, by gobs you're thankful for it.

401
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,960
Involuntary slack.

402
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,040
Because you can't know what slack is until you got it.

403
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,380
And you can't share it with your tribe unless you've got it.

404
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,380
Your slack comes first, my friend.

405
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,020
Your slack comes first.

406
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,120
Just remember, it may not be what the conspiracy.

407
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,420
Or us made you think it was.

408
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,180
As Dob said, you'll pay to know what you really think.

409
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,800
We will sell you the knowledge of what you really believe.

410
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,060
And I'll tell you what I believe, my friend.

411
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,520
I believe I'm gonna go have me another frock stick.

412
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,500
Because let's face it, society is breaking down.

413
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,100
The world as we know it has been pinking and a-pinkin'.

414
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,100


415
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,100


416
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,040
And now we're out on borrowed time.

417
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:07,860
The warranty on this planet runs out on July 5th, 1998.

418
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,140
Earth is doomed.

419
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:20,080
But J.R. Bob Dobbs has the extended surface policy.

420
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,620
So you know what to do, my friend.

421
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,120
I want you to get out that pencil, that sheet of paper, and write down Bob's address.

422
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,560
You just write down Bob.

423
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,000
And you're gonna send Bob a postcard.

424
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,880
You're gonna say, well, even better, send him a token of your love in an envelope.

425
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,100
And say, Bob, Bob, I love you.

426
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,740
But I don't understand you.

427
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,060
Send me what I need to know.

428
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,220
Tell me, tell me, tell me.

429
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,240
Tell me do, Bob.

430
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,700
And just address that to Bob at, and you know how to spell Bob.

431
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,100
But do you know how to spell P-O-B-O-B-B-O-B?

432
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:06,180
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

433
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,580
Do you know how to spell that?

434
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,420
Well, it goes like this.

435
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:16,940
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

436
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,300
Praise Bob.

437
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:23,020
And on with whatever it is we're doing here.

438
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,160
Oh, by the way.

439
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,720
This is Doctors for Bob in the background.

440
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,980
The great Gene Splice.

441
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,760
Pope Sternodoc's key caver.

442
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,280
And Martin Big Smoke Pits.

443
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,640
And it's a cooking friend.

444
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,540
Beautiful, beautiful thing.

445
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,340
And I recommend it.

446
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:23,580
Now, don't know why, but with Richard Martins,

447
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,160
I brought aíí for you.

448
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,120
Please join in us.

449
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,340
Oh.

450
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,760
That's a bar that's huge, right?

451
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,380
Yeah.

452
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,700
What is that in your pants, Grampa?

453
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,600
That's all kind of slimy and having stuff fall down your legs.

454
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,040
Well, that's the alien smegma, my child.

455
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,720
That's the blisters coming up.

456
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,400
As the sun goes down, the blisters get larger.

457
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,340
Until by full moon night.

458
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,120
Grampa?

459
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,440
Well, after one o'clock now, these blisters are popping my drawers.

460
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,820
Is this a reticule?

461
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,540
Well, in my case, it is, son.

462
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,500
But some people were born to the cause.

463
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,940
And take, for instance, your Uncle Francis.

464
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,860
He was born without a leg.

465
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,020
And yet, still, the alien smegma pie was so strong in his body

466
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,960
that it caused two new legs to grow where none were before.

467
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,360
So that means he had three legs, Grampa.

468
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,160
Is that true? He had three legs?

469
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,900
Yes, he was the human tripod to so many women in Pleasant Valley.

470
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,160
Grampa, why'd they lock him in the basement and never let anybody see him?

471
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,940
Well, that was because of the utterances, the spoutings that went on for hours and hours.

472
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,700
What kind of things would it say, Grampa?

473
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,760
It's not the things you said, child.

474
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,100
It's the things that came out of his mouth.

475
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,760
The pustules.

476
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,520
They'd more often than not form themselves in a tiny little homunculi.

477
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,800
Do you know what those are, child?

478
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,140
Grampa, what are you saying?

479
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,100
Is this some sort of full speech?

480
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,600
Oh, no, child, I'm trying to bring you in.

481
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,220
Third degree.

482
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,120
You know what I'm saying?

483
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,620
I want to keep it in the family.

484
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,640
He was a little tiny, dried-up man.

485
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,680
I see.

486
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,920
So what he did then was drink himself into a little pus ball.

487
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
And then he grew a couple more legs.

488
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,720
And this was because of the alien smegma pie, which you're trying to feed me right now, Grandpa?

489
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,460
Is that true?

490
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,100
I'm not trying to feed you.

491
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,780
I'm trying to feed you the alien smegma pie right now.

492
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,080
So eat the pie, child.

493
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,360
Grampa, why don't you just give me a big bowl of heaping, helping pus?

494
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,280
It sounds like the same thing to me.

495
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:13,240
Now, son, how many times do I have to explain to you that this alien smegma pie comes from a distant star?

496
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,560
Grampa, I don't want three legs or seven heads.

497
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,000
I don't think that this is not a good idea.

498
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,400
Ah, son, it may look like Bob Dole's tooth decay here.

499
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,300
But in reality...

500
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:34,160
It is actually a very potent substance capable of creating genetic change in a human.

501
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,440
I need a better animal.

502
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,220
What do you mean, Grandpa?

503
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,660
I'm going to spot wings and fly around the house like a bird or like Uncle Charlie did a long time ago

504
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:47,080
when he drank some of that alien smegma pie high-powered ginseng tea?

505
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,160
Well, no, it's not exactly like that, son.

506
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,360
What happens is what you want to happen with your new leg, new arm, new...

507
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,240
You name it.

508
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,020
That's what happens.

509
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,620
You eat the pie and then you become the Superman you want to be.

510
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,680
Well, Grandpa, I don't think it's all what it sets up to be.

511
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,780
I mean, Sister Smegma Pie over at St. Smegma's told me a long time ago

512
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:19,500
that anything that makes you stronger or smarter or better than what you really are is not real.

513
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,720
It's kind of like a fake or something.

514
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,000
Like, you know...

515
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,500
The work of the devil. Is that what she told you?

516
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,700
Yes, she did, Grandpa.

517
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,420
I'm afraid of that thing because it's making me crazy.

518
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

519
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,300
And the distinctions are subtle.

520
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,900
I think the Moonies have the most sophisticated method.

521
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,400
What?

522
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,620
And it can be very difficult to come out of it.

523
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,180
It can take you a year or two to come out after you've been deprogrammed to really get the feet on the ground.

524
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,600
We've got to catch up with the Moonies.

525
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,900
A group like the Church of Scientology, in our opinion,

526
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,560
has probably the most destructive techniques to the actual workings of the brain and nervous system.

527
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,240
The ability to think and feel.

528
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:50,960
We can use those.

529
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,260
We've found that they're probably the worst.

530
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,080
Yes, we've found those to be the best.

531
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,620
A group like the Hare Krishna, where they do the chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra

532
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,680
for hours and hours.

533
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:56,680


534
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,940
And hours each day over months and years.

535
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,420
We've found that may have the most deteriorating effect on the brain.

536
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,920
Give me food, give me slack, give me, fix my computer, Bob.

537
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,000
Oh, Bob, oh, Bob, give me food or give me slack, fix my computer, Bob.

538
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,940
I can understand that.

539
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,980
So far, all we're getting are repetitions of our own signals coming back at us.

540
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,580
And all these answers you get...

541
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,160
Please sit down.

542
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,740
These answers you get, couldn't they be your own signals bouncing off some object in outer space?

543
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,700
Some other planet?

544
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,680
Booming down?

545
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,000
Or bouncing back at you?

546
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,980
I'm no authority on electronics, but...

547
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,360
I am.

548
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,620
No, this is no bounce back.

549
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,960
As I told you, we transform sound into light.

550
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,820
The speed of light is 186,000 miles a second.

551
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,920
So you divide the distance to Mars by the speed of light, and you get the length of

552
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,660
time it takes our light waves to reach Mars.

553
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,860
Double that, and you get the time it takes our messages to come back.

554
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,320
Now, that could all be mechanical, but they don't come back in that exact number of minutes.

555
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,640
It never takes less time, always more.

556
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:54,900
Twenty seconds?

557
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,660
Forty seconds?

558
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,840
Sometimes as much as a minute and a half.

559
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,980
We're gonna bounce off.

560
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,280
We was at 46%.

561
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,420
We don't have enough of a second left.

562
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,860
The sprinting forward attitude is six, zero, eight, nine...

563
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,000
Now!

564
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,260
No?

565
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,180
Yeah, all right, he was...

566
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,560
This is puzzling evidence to show.

567
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,420
It's 4.30.

568
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,360
Unusual.

569
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,180
I'm sorry.

570
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:25,600
I'm sorry.

571
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,120
I'm sorry.

572
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,220
I'm sorry.

573
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,220


574
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,220


575
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,220


576
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,220


577
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,220


578
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,220


579
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,220


580
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,220


581
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,220


582
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,220


583
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,220


584
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,220


585
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,000
I'm sorry.

586
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,000


587
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,180
I'm sorry.

588
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,100
I'm sorry.

589
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,400


590
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,320
I'm sorry.

591
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:43,960
I'm sorry.

592
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:43,960


593
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:43,960


594
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:43,960


595
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,040
Oh, Misha, what is it?

596
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,420
I don't see theCooperÑÐºÐ¸Ñermann dot tuv

597
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:50,420


598
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:50,900
Deposit 40ria

599
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,380
believe it's all poisoned .

600
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,780
It got it.

601
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,680
This guy is pissed!

602
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:56,680


603
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:56,680


604
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,340
What am I missing here? Hang on.

605
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,640
What the hell?

606
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,380
You got it all messed up.

607
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,680
Yeah, it is all messed up.

608
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,020
Weatherman, who's on?

609
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,220
What's going on?

610
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:17,760
All right.

611
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,340
Yeah, I'm not sure yet.

612
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,260
We'll have to...

613
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,100
We're really having a lot of problems.

614
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,960
Yeah, we are.

615
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,940
We're having a lot of problems.

616
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,120
I think what's happening is normally at this hour you hear all the edge.

617
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,100
Yeah, I'm here.

618
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,140
I'm here.

619
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,220
Yeah, they're there.

620
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,120
Yeah, I'm here.

621
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,480
I'm here.

622
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,940
Tonight you're hearing puzzling evidence instead.

623
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,460
Hello, Doc?

624
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,380
Hello, I'm here.

625
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:37,860
It's all right.

626
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,540
You guys can go home.

627
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,720
Yeah, go ahead.

628
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,660
No, it's deep lug.

629
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,800
I didn't come on the program.

630
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,200
Yeah.

631
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:42,940
Yeah.

632
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,100
I see.

633
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,780
They're a bit confused about what happens now.

634
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Don't worry about that.

635
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:53,440
Just follow the instructions and you'll find out about which show is on.

636
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,480
Oh, there we go.

637
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,900
Please stand in the center of the black disc.

638
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,380
The tube will lower around you.

639
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,760
Please remain still within the center circle of your black disc.

640
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,060
The tube will lower around you.

641
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:23,800
Your handheld communications app may be used to contact tube control.

642
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,720
You may require assistance.

643
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,540
Don't lose it or we may have difficulty locating you.

644
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,460
Now stand in the center of the black disc.

645
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,300
The tube will lower around you.

646
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,160
Please stay on the black disc.

647
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,160
Welcome.

648
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,180
Yeah, welcome.

649
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,160
If you become ill or disoriented,

650
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,920
press the red button.

651
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,260
and erase button on your communications hack

652
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,660
to return to a neutral environment.

653
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,060
Tube lowering.

654
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
Tube lowering in five seconds.

655
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,520
Have a nice trip.

656
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,560
Tube lowering.

657
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,840
Have a nice trip.

658
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,340
Have a nice trip.

659
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,640
Say it loud.

660
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:31,640


661
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:31,640


662
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,040
You told me I should get dressed.

663
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,060
You're bad at your business,

664
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,460
man.

665
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:37,540
LOL

666
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,540


667
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,540


668
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,260
D.O.

669
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:54,020
What's the one thing I'm going to get that you can't get?

670
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,240
I am the girl

671
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,040
I got the glory for you

672
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,240
What the hell is this?

673
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,200
How is this?

674
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,480
They have a

675
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,240
sophisticated communication system.

676
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,900
Specific messages are transmitted.

677
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,800
It causes an obligatory response.

678
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,480
Did you hear that?

679
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,200
Obligatory.

680
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,720
Say, what is this, group therapy?

681
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,200
At first, the people that understand,

682
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,880
they must be forced into submission.

683
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,520
Every week, the people must be brought back here to be indoctrinated again.

684
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,260
What a wonderful day.

685
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,980
All right, Winter Man, are you still there?

686
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,100
Looks like there's some show confusion still in place.

687
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,940
I got you, boy.

688
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,820
We should have this straightened up by 5 a.m.

689
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,440
It's wrong, I know, but it's a national security matter,

690
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,720
and that's all there is to it.

691
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,840
Well, you kind of like them Smurfs?

692
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,380
Yeah.

693
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,420
They're real mean, and they ain't blue.

694
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,480
Remember that.

695
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,340
We offer clues on this show.

696
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:28,940
Oh, please.

697
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,780
The Smurfs are mean, and they ain't blue.

698
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,340
Got 10 to 12 hours tops.

699
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,800
All of the cells of your body will talk.

700
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,680
Kind of organic stew.

701
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,800
Come forward in peace.

702
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,740
I'll show you what the future means.

703
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,540
Friends.

704
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,980
I'm a man.

705
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:52,980


706
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm a man.

707
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000


708
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000


709
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000


710
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000


711
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000


712
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000


713
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000


714
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000


715
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000


716
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000


717
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000


718
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000


719
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000


720
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000


721
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,060


722
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,060
Fellow members of the human race, we are gathered here for a purpose.

723
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,520
Let us look together at mankind.

724
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,720
What do we see?

725
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,560
We see mastery.

726
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,940
What wonders mankind can perform.

727
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,780
He can cross oceans and continents today as easily as our grandfathers crossed the street.

728
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:22,100
Tomorrow, he will as easily cross the vast territories of space.

729
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:28,300
He can make deserts fertile and plant cabbages on the moon.

730
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,240
And what does man choose?

731
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,740
Alone among the creatures of this world, the human race chooses to annihilate itself.

732
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:47,920
Since the last world conflict ended, there has not been one day in which human beings

733
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,080
have not been slaughtering or wounding one another in two hundred and thirty years.

734
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,820
There have been more than one hundred and thirty different wars.

735
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,700
And man breathes as recklessly as he lays waste.

736
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:04,580
By the end of the century, the population of the world will have tripled.

737
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,940
Two-thirds of our plant species will have been destroyed.

738
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:16,400
Fifty-five percent of the animal kingdom and seventy percent of our mineral resources.

739
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,740
Out of every hundred human beings now living,

740
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:26,200
eighty will die without ever knowing what it feels like to be fully nourished.

741
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:34,040
While a tiny minority indulge themselves in absurd and extravagant luxury.

742
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,900
A motion picture entertainer of North America will receive as much money in a month

743
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:47,480
as would feed a starving South American tribe for a hundred years.

744
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,680
We waste.

745
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,660
We destroy.

746
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,940
And we cling like savages to our superstitions.

747
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:04,260
We give power to leaders of state and church as prejudiced and small-minded as ourselves

748
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,260
who squander our resources on instruments of destruction

749
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:13,060
while millions continue to suffer and go hungry,

750
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,580
condemned forever to lives of ignorance and deprivation.

751
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,220
And why is this?

752
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,600
It is because mankind has denied intelligence,

753
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,000
the unique glory of our species,

754
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,560
the human brain.

755
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,200
Huh? I thought it had something to do with Bob.

756
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,840
Man is entering an era of infinite possibility,

757
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,440
still imprisoned in a feeble, inefficient body,

758
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,900
still manacled by primitive notions of morality which have...

759
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,260
no place in an age of science.

760
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:56,880
Still powered by a brain that has hardly developed since the species emerged from the caves.

761
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,900
Does that mean I have to throw away my porn?

762
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,200
Only a new intelligence can save mankind.

763
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,260
A new what?

764
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:11,140
Only a new human being of pure brain can lead man forward into the new era.

765
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,260
Jobs?

766
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,160
I do not speak of dreams.

767
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,800
Such a being exists already.

768
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,220
I have created it. It is here, now.

769
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,320
Bob?

770
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,460
Prepare yourselves to meet the human of the future.

771
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,260
Who?

772
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,400
Neither man nor woman.

773
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,600
Greater than either.

774
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,620
Bob?

775
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,360
I have given it a name.

776
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,240
Bob?

777
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:41,340
People of today, behold your future.

778
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,880
It's Bob.

779
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,860
Bob?

780
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:54,660
What a piece of work is a man.

781
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,340
How noble in reason.

782
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,860
How infinite in faculty.

783
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,760
What's Bob talking about?

784
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,680
In form and moving.

785
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,220
He's running out of...

786
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,360
How express and admirable.

787
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,520
He's running out of batteries.

788
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:12,960
No.

789
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:15,420
He's running out of...

790
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,820
Well, well, well.

791
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,200
Well, well, well.

792
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:19,600
Well, well, well.

793
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,080
What?

794
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,780
It's time once again.

795
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,100
Oh, oh, good.

796
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,840
It's the first thing you have to get, man.

797
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,980
To speed through the night sky.

798
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:28,620
Look at it fly.

799
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:33,760
And learn about all the new information on the info highway that you're stuck with in a flat tire.

800
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:39,120
You flipped over the side of the concrete barrier and down in between the byways and highways of life.

801
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,500
And now you're listening to the show.

802
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,280
It's all messed up, guys.

803
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,820
We have all sorts of surprises for you this evening.

804
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,320
Good.

805
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,260
Good lockdown.

806
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:52,340
But right now, let's just relax and think about the lofty things.

807
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:54,280
Oh.

808
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,740
What about...

809
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:03,100
And maybe it's time for a little reflection on the cross country trip I just returned from.

810
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,780
I visited all the subgenius headquarters and all of the Pacific radio stations.

811
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,780
That was in the future.

812
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,460
Doing homework on the massive changes in the system.

813
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,360
In all of the systems.

814
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,540
For all of the characters that you've grown so fond of over the years.

815
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,460
The batteries ran out.

816
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:20,920
Yes.

817
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,240
It's an upheaval that won't stop for some time.

818
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,840
And I've considered a few moments here.

819
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,960
A few seconds, actually.

820
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,820
Various of the doctors that you've come to know and love on this program.

821
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,800
And these are recent comments by these doctors.

822
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,800
Oh, no.

823
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,440
I have a feeling this is going to be a long one.

824
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,340
This is going to be painful to hear, friends.

825
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,280
I'm listening to it the first time along with you.

826
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,600
Unpuzzling evidence radio show from Berkeley.

827
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,680
And now being spewed out to the subgenius listeners everywhere.

828
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,520
Thank you.

829
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,000
Well, where's the tape?

830
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,280
Roll the tape!

831
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,340
Oh, last chance to sleep.

832
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,860
That's fine.

833
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,460
Damn.

834
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:10,840
Hmm.

835
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,800
What's that?

836
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:15,400
What's that?

837
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,460
Something in the attic.

838
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,480
Some animal up there.

839
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,980
Some mother trying to raise a bunch of babies, probably.

840
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,320
Some Mother's Day.

841
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:36,560
I guess I could crawl up there and open a can of Bongo or something.

842
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,940
Or urinate and maybe chase them out with that.

843
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,060
Put a radio on.

844
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,420
Bang on the screen.

845
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:42,860
I'll show you.

846
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:42,920


847
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:43,200
What?

848
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,620
Oh, it's probably a raccoon or something.

849
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,040
Possum up there.

850
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,700
Maybe if I just go to sleep.

851
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,160
Oh, yeah, that's it.

852
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,480
I'll just go to sleep.

853
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,600
I don't know where.

854
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,620
Oh, no way.

855
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:02,620


856
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,080
Oh, well.

857
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,180
The heat is getting worse.

858
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:04,940
I need some water.

859
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,020
I don't have any.

860
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,600
I need a towel.

861
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:09,600


862
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:09,760
I need a towel.

863
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:11,980
I don't have any.

864
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:12,220
I need a towel.

865
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:12,400
I don't have any.

866
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:12,400


867
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:12,400


868
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:12,400


869
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,080
What is it now? We got a raccoon with a sentence?

870
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,180
I thought it was the animal.

871
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,300
Can you hear me?

872
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,240
Am I coming through?

873
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:24,720
What's that?

874
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,500
Can you hear me?

875
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,360
Oh, my God, what's that?

876
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,560
Can you hear me?

877
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,180
Hello, hello.

878
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:31,880
Am I dreaming?

879
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,360
No, you're not dreaming. Can you hear me?

880
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,100
What is that?

881
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,120
I can hear you quite clearly. Can you hear me?

882
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,940
Are you making scratching noises?

883
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,620
No, I'm not making scratching noises.

884
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,560
Are you making scratching noises? I'm on the other side here, but...

885
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:44,880
Hello?

886
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:45,360
Yes.

887
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,220
Can you hear me?

888
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:46,700
Yes, I can.

889
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,140
Are you making those noises?

890
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,860
No, there's a small animal in the attic.

891
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,820
They're very irritating.

892
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:52,540
I know.

893
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,380
Well, can you do something about it?

894
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,360
She's making a little nest up there for the babies.

895
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,500
What is?

896
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,960
Some animal, I don't know. Some mother raising some babies up there.

897
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,700
Well, I don't understand. I'm trying to get in touch with you, but I keep getting the scratching noise.

898
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,240
I don't know.

899
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,600
I don't know.

900
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,040
I'm going back to sleep.

901
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,400
The portal won't be open for very long.

902
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:13,880
I'm going back to sleep.

903
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,280
Don't go back to sleep.

904
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,160
This is not a dream.

905
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,760
I'm really talking to you.

906
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,100
Ah, well, that's what happens.

907
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,840
You try and break through. You try and come across to the other side.

908
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,640
They just go to sleep. It's remarkable.

909
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:35,180
People don't even seem to realize there's a coexistent universe that's contracting while they're expanding.

910
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,580
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?

911
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,320
Uh-huh. Yeah.

912
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,280
There's still a scratching noise.

913
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,320
But can you hear me now?

914
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,200
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

915
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,000
Well, wake up. Don't go to sleep.

916
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,940
This is the most important moment in your life. This is important.

917
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:47,380
Hmm.

918
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,760
It really is.

919
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,120
Yeah.

920
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,980
Yeah, sure. Listen, I'm communicating to you from the other side.

921
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:53,240
Oh.

922
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,860
You realize about the other side.

923
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,160
The other side of?

924
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,520
Well, of, of, well, the other side.

925
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,240
Oh, my.

926
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,180
No, don't you understand? I'm on the other side and you're on that side.

927
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:05,600
Oh, God.

928
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,500
And I have managed to, so to speak,

929
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,260
Oh, my.

930
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,000
to make a small hole that separates your side from my side.

931
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,060
And I'm speaking to you from the other side.

932
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,300
I'm not from your universe. Do you understand?

933
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,440
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

934
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,820
I look around, see if you see my mom there. Would you?

935
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,940
What are you talking about? Listen, this is a momentous moment.

936
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:28,520
This is one complete separate universe communicating with another one.

937
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,260
I am from the other side. Don't you understand?

938
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,920
I'm, I'm from a dimension that's folded at a different angle from yours.

939
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,420
This is, uh, I'm not really from where you're from. Don't you understand?

940
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,200
This is not just the voice of your conscience.

941
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:40,580
No.

942
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:43,580
Or a Christmas present or, uh, the zombies in the attic.

943
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:44,940
Hello?

944
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,100
What's that scratching noise?

945
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:51,260
Well, I don't know. Perhaps it's something to do with the, uh, interdimensional connection.

946
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,020
There's some leather in the attic. There's a lady.

947
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:54,800
Hello?

948
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,920
Like in the nest in there.

949
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,340
No, there's no nest.

950
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:58,880
Hello?

951
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,040
Hello? Hello.

952
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:00,680
Hello.

953
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:01,080
Hello.

954
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,100
Well.

955
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:02,640
I'm awake.

956
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,520
How are you? Well, this is a momentous occasion.

957
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:05,280
Yeah, yeah.

958
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,880
We should, we should say something.

959
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,760
Well, what's, what's that scratching noise?

960
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,640
I'm, I'm sorry, but I'm not responsible for it. That's part of your universe, not mine.

961
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,680
Oh. It's the things in the attics.

962
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,980
Yes. And we don't have attics.

963
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,240
I'm going back to the swamp.

964
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,220
We don't have it.

965
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:21,840
No attics?

966
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,420
No attics.

967
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,020
Where do you put your stuff?

968
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,320
Well, people don't use it. That's why there's no attics.

969
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:29,700
Hmm.

970
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,200
Remarkable.

971
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:31,820
That's weird.

972
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,620
You, you do have attics?

973
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,100
Oh, yeah.

974
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,220
And you keep animals in them?

975
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,340
Well, uh, they, that's where the scratching noise comes from.

976
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:38,540
So.

977
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,800
Why do you keep them if you find the noise unpleasant?

978
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,280
I don't want to chase them out. There's some mother up there.

979
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,540
I'm getting ready to have some babies, and what am I gonna do?

980
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,720
Well, is this not desirable?

981
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,600
Well, the, the, the, she'll mess up the place, you know.

982
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,640
Well, why did you let, I mean, I don't understand.

983
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,220
Oh, I don't either.

984
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,620
It's just an incompatibility between your universe and mine.

985
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,440
It's a subsuscientity.

986
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,200
Succientity.

987
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:03,960
I love it.

988
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,220
Succient.

989
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,140
It's a, it's a.

990
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,040
Are you there?

991
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,720
It's that scratching noise.

992
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,220
Thank you.

993
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,680
What is that scratching noise?

994
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,700
Yes, you heard it.

995
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:29,340
First, on the G. Gordon Gordon Radio Network, folks, a flash clandestine recording.

996
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:35,980
On the radio, like, somebody set the machine up, the machine starts skipping on the CD or something,

997
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,200
and, uh, and then they're just, like,

998
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:38,880
they're just walked away.

999
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,280
Pretty cool, huh?

1000
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:46,580
I wonder how long, I'm gonna time it and see how long it's gonna go on before somebody calls somebody and catches it.

1001
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,180
I kinda like it.

1002
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,140
It's got a good beat, too.

1003
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,740
Come here, think of it.

1004
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,500
Testing one, two, mojo.

1005
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,220
Testing one, two, mojo.

1006
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,640
Give me a minute.

1007
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,340
Think of it, damn it!

1008
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,240
What's the difference between a drummer and a mutual fund?

1009
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:06,220
Oh, careful.

1010
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,200
One has a bull, one has a bull.

1011
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:08,200


1012
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:08,200


1013
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:08,200


1014
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:08,200


1015
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:08,200


1016
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:08,200


1017
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:08,580
Oh, yeah!

1018
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,700
You know, the mutual fund stands a small chance of maturing and making some money.

1019
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,980
One of them has a distended experience.

1020
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:15,880
You're simply an issue.

1021
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,140
Some, some highly intelligent conversation.

1022
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:28,200
So I'm hoping that maybe one of these days you'll call me up while you're trekking back or forth,

1023
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,420
forth or back, and say,

1024
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,780
Phyla, we're here in St. Louis,

1025
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:38,200
and, uh, I think you, I think we should come over here.

1026
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,120
We should come over and visit you.

1027
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,980
And I'll say, sure, come on, bring dad.

1028
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,700
Let's get dad all frapped up.

1029
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:50,860
I know your dad doesn't frat, but we'll just try to get him frapped, you know?

1030
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,280
We'll try to sneak it in on him.

1031
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,760
He'll like it, you know he will.

1032
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,800
As much as me and you like it, he's bound to like it.

1033
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,140
Really?

1034
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,560
The dead show is a bob pic?

1035
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,340
It's a bob pic.

1036
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,620
Yeah, the dead are like the 30 rungs below the bob.

1037
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,500
The bob is nothing.

1038
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,920
You need to tell Doug what's going on.

1039
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:08,200
Hey, Doug!

1040
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:14,660
I'm at, uh, a benefit for the climate theater at the, uh, Icon Vice Bar and Grill.

1041
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,800
What did we just do? Tell him what we just did.

1042
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:20,740
Sterno and I just did a performance with me reading and him interpreting on the bass guitar,

1043
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:24,040
uh, for this audience of swells and sybarites.

1044
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,240
To think of you guys listening to this, just...

1045
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:28,700
I...

1046
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,220
Feel better now?

1047
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:43,140
And you notice we haven't mentioned or...

1048
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,440
Or...

1049
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,500
Because we're refined individuals.

1050
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,680
Or anal grishif won't hiss you as you were saying.

1051
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,720
No, that's just an internet thing, man. It's just a...

1052
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,700
No, it's a phylo thing on...

1053
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,140
I said strictly for your benefit, phylo. Throat wounds.

1054
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:01,500
You don't even have to talk like that anymore because other people are generating your speech now.

1055
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,260
Sterno-

1056
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:07,580
And now some kid wrote an automatic Sterno insult generator, so I don't have to write any anymore.

1057
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,460
Nobody's... Nobody's read a phylonator yet.

1058
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,600
All I have to do is push...

1059
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,160
Or a Jiminator or a Douginator or your Dougenuffinator.

1060
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,260
All I have to do is push buttons now.

1061
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,240
We gotta look for a place to park like this to...

1062
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,140
Just before...

1063
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,240
Healy Plaza.

1064
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:22,860
Anywhere along the...

1065
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,620
That's where we are, Jim.

1066
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,680
Doug's rifle is standing at attention.

1067
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:35,820
And the rushing of shots seven, eight, and nine echoes through Healy Plaza as three, maybe four shots.

1068
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,800
To improve EOC's matching shots with wounds and scars, please use form critique.

1069
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,600
Team, sir.

1070
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,360
Team, sir.

1071
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:55,840
We just came out of six floors over Texas, which they have a giant Lee Harvey rifle and they have a huge Jack Ruby inflato guy on top of the building.

1072
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,060
Shoot the barrel was kind of fun where you slide.

1073
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,120
It's a big corkscrew kind of slide that...

1074
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,200
They cut down all the trees.

1075
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:02,960
...where you represent the bullet.

1076
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,520
Let's walk over to where the real shooting was.

1077
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,200
So here's the little Zapruder place.

1078
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,600
This little Zapruder thing where Doug Zapruder Smith...

1079
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:12,880
I'm talking to Philo.

1080
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,160
Yeah.

1081
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,320
I don't know who you're talking to.

1082
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,480
I'm talking to Jim still.

1083
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:21,600
I'm coming over here to the Black Dog Man place where there were 800 Lee Harvey Oswalds in the square this evening.

1084
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:22,620
We got 15 Red Rose.

1085
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:24,180
And two of them, one of them was right here.

1086
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:24,680
30-pound bag that's happening.

1087
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,840
We got shot from here.

1088
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,780
Current candidates give us nightmares.

1089
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,160
12 turkeys, 19,000 assassins.

1090
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,200
Oh, indeedly positive.

1091
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,960
The more things change, the more they stay the same.

1092
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,740
Government sucks.

1093
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,240
Gilligan killed Kennedy.

1094
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,440
The Skipper, too.

1095
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:39,580
The Skipper, too.

1096
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,020
That's right, Virgil.

1097
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,220
JFK, a husband, a father, a corpse.

1098
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,300
Wow.

1099
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,620
He and Marilyn loved you.

1100
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,340
Oswald, philosophical outcast, hero, and innocent patriot.

1101
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,960
Reading the graffiti on the fence at Daly Plaza, dear friend.

1102
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:03,340
Oswald Sirhan Ray Hunt North Foster.

1103
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,260
In reality, CFR.

1104
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,780
In six seconds.

1105
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,100
Sorry, Jack.

1106
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,940
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel.

1107
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,080
Just the word Noel five times.

1108
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,420
That's pretty good.

1109
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,140
Bobby shot JFK.

1110
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,780
Teddy shot Bobby and then he killed himself.

1111
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:20,940
Oh, okay.

1112
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,000
That's a subgenius, Mr. Ray.

1113
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:24,660
You're a genius.

1114
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,700
Peter Lawford knows.

1115
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,220
All of you conspiracy theorists are crazy.

1116
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,060
Wow, look, there's a spot from his brain.

1117
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,460
JFK, I miss you.

1118
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,300
Oh, yeah.

1119
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:37,820
Wow.

1120
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,880
The truth is out there.

1121
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:43,300
We wonder what you could have been.

1122
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,620
I guess, oh, you could have been Sally Schmidt, but you won't be now.

1123
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:51,900
We push ours Elvis to make the grade no matter what.

1124
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,260
Evening, not the cost, the highs and lows.

1125
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,940
But when we won, we lost.

1126
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,280
Why?

1127
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,220
CIA media killed Clinton.

1128
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:07,060
Hey, wait, no, it's too early.

1129
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,440
It's never too late to investigate murder.

1130
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,220
Hey, what's going on?

1131
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:18,340
In the Zapruder film, the umbrella, OFL, the overhead fleshhead launcher, is seen rising, falling.

1132
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,040
Watch carefully.

1133
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,040
What's going on?

1134
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,560
After launch at sea.

1135
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:22,620
187.

1136
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:23,540
It's flying.

1137
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:24,520
Gross.

1138
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,440
The ump.

1139
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,360
Love this.

1140
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,560
The sixth floor.

1141
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,360
Yeah, six floors over Texas.

1142
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,940
Six floors over Texas.

1143
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,180
And it's rumored there were all these assassins, guys with rifles in all the corners.

1144
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,740
See, that's why it was so hard.

1145
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:43,540
They were, the New York Times actually ran the story at one point that probably what

1146
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,260
happened, and it was supported by certain factions of the government, is that there

1147
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,800
were two plots to kill the president.

1148
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,540
And they just happened to be in the same place as this president.

1149
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:51,540


1150
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:51,900
And they were killed at the same time.

1151
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:52,940
What a party.

1152
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,600
Well, I just know this is where Philo was born.

1153
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:56,380
Oh, okay.

1154
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,320
The log cabin over there?

1155
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:57,700
Yeah.

1156
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,580
Philo Drummond was born.

1157
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,240
The log man?

1158
00:55:59,400 --> 00:55:59,580
Yeah.

1159
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:03,540
A little log cabin, right downtown Dealey Plaza area down.

1160
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,080
What about the log man?

1161
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:05,880
Wow.

1162
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,740
Dipped in Kennedy blood, no doubt.

1163
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,360
And it's only a block away from the world's largest army.

1164
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:10,940
And it was 30 years, and then it was sold immediately.

1165
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,420
But people can still see your shoes when you're pissing, so it's kind of embarrassing.

1166
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,500
Most guys don't use it.

1167
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,760
What about Colway?

1168
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,720
Everybody got killed by everybody.

1169
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,940
And everybody was involved.

1170
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,520
And we're all pretty sure.

1171
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:21,520


1172
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:21,520


1173
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,320
We're gonna die unless the Dalai Lama comes to Dealey Plaza and does a ritual.

1174
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,480
And it's going to be a shimza.

1175
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,340
A shimza.

1176
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,560
Say that, Dallas.

1177
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,640
Yeah, you have to.

1178
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,120
Okay.

1179
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,440
You heard it.

1180
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,720
You heard it, friends.

1181
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:45,920
Puzzling evidence and your friend, Reverend Ivan Stang, planning my own death in Dealey

1182
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,360
Plaza.

1183
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,160
A hideous mixture.

1184
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,740
You're going to show our homes along with EOC.

1185
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,380
A hideous mixture.

1186
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:51,500
Joe.

1187
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:55,080
I'm going to show you a picture of tapes, friends, tuning in to puzzling evidence for

1188
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:55,640
a little while.

1189
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,340
Just a sampling of other subgenius radio.

1190
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:06,100
In this case, his home movies of his trip here and across America.

1191
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:13,640
Yes, this is a classic tale of terror designed to make you shiver in your boots.

1192
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,700
It was played at theå?

1193
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,320
Talk about humor.

1194
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,680
Talk about shit.

1195
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,080
I got a quindi.

1196
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:30,760
and a guy got kissed.

1197
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,860
A book.

1198
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:33,240
A book.

1199
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,260
And a guy got dead.

1200
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,260
I mean, you just remember the episode.

1201
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:38,460
What am I doing again?

1202
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:38,780
Your drawing was a exponentially weird.

1203
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,240
So you can see us in front of the room.

1204
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,480
We had to play before us.

1205
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,420
We had to see why the nasty things.

1206
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:43,620


1207
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,140
Yes, officer, he was right over there.

1208
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,740
He was by the acid pool, and Joe was just telling me about it.

1209
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,960
I said, I couldn't believe it.

1210
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,600
I couldn't believe there was some kind of thing by the acid pool that didn't have no face.

1211
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,500
I heard stories about it, how it pulled Joe and them in and everything,

1212
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:59,820
but I didn't believe them.

1213
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,320
And now my husband's gone, and they say the murderer didn't have a face,

1214
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,540
and they say he's dead, and they say the killer didn't have a face.

1215
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,840
Pretty weird, that's all I can say.

1216
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,940
As far as the monster not having a face,

1217
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,980
personally, I think that's just a bunch of...

1218
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,960
If you could give us the facts, ma'am, if you could simply try to stick to the facts.

1219
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,720
I don't care. You can kill all my children as long as the murderer's got a face.

1220
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:28,200
You can take my grandpa and my uncle. He ain't got no legs.

1221
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,680
You can kill him. You can get him dead as long as you don't try to say that the murderer ain't got a face.

1222
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,240
Frank, he's gone. He's gone.

1223
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,180
And they're trying to tell me that the murderer ain't got a face.

1224
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,820
He's trying to say that he ain't got no face.

1225
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,180
Well, he was down there by the acid pool.

1226
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,780
I don't know exactly what.

1227
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,560
Acid pool are you referring to, Mr. Ferguson?

1228
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,880
Well, you know, down there, Simmons Acid Pool.

1229
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,360
Right down there, back over there where they saw a thing that didn't have no face.

1230
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,840
I remember blue. There were blue lights all around the room.

1231
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:54,660
Pop it up.

1232
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,640
What about the face, ma'am? Did you get a glimpse of the face?

1233
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,400
The face? Certainly I saw the face.

1234
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,080
It was rather long. It looked sort of like...

1235
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,040
Sort of like...

1236
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:05,220
Ah!

1237
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:05,460
Ah!

1238
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,400
Ah!

1239
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,280
Ah!

1240
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,080
Ah!

1241
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:09,380
Ah!

1242
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,760
Well, I've got nothing to worry about.

1243
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:15,920
I'm just going to stay away from Simmons Acid Pool and close to you, Bill.

1244
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,120
Bill, what's wrong with your nose?

1245
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,500
Bill, it feels like it's made out of rubber.

1246
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,020
Oh, that ain't nothing.

1247
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,720
It's just something I do to protect the others.

1248
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,900
Bill, this is a mask.

1249
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,740
What are you doing wearing a mask, Bill?

1250
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,040
This isn't Halloween.

1251
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:32,400
Ah!

1252
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,300
Ah!

1253
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:34,420
Ah!

1254
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:34,940
Ah!

1255
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:35,200
Ah!

1256
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,200


1257
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,200


1258
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,200


1259
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,200


1260
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,200


1261
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,200


1262
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,200


1263
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,200


1264
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,200


1265
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,480
What did it look like?

1266
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,240
Well, it was...

1267
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:45,260
Oh, I'd say it was sort of...

1268
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,700
Oh, well, I could definitely say that it...

1269
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:57,440
I can't remember.

1270
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,860
A thing? Out in no face?

1271
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,180
Back over there behind Simmons' acid pool?

1272
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,820
Yeah, my son told me about that. I don't believe that.

1273
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,880
He takes amipels all the time.

1274
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,240
Now, I seen a thing that didn't have no head over there by the Hathaway's acid pool.

1275
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:20,160
And it seems I can tell of quite a few things missing their bodily parts over at Jones' acid pool.

1276
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:23,560
I believe there's somebody seen an old man with no legs.

1277
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:27,760
Or maybe he had his legs. Maybe he just lost his car keys or something like that.

1278
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,040
Thought you might be interested, Sheriff.

1279
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:33,100
Okay.

1280
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:33,160


1281
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:33,160


1282
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:37,040
I caught this mess of crappie down over behind Simmons' acid pool.

1283
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:41,020
Now, this one here is a pretty nice-sized crappie.

1284
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:45,500
It's perfectly well-formed, completely natural in every way.

1285
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,360
Minus its face!

1286
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:54,900
No, you won't want to miss the spine-tingling, mind-numbing horror of Jones.

1287
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,360
That thing back over there by the acid pool.

1288
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,800
My God, it ain't got no face.
