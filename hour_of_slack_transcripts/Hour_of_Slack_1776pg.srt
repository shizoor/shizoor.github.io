1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,680
Hey! Who's that?

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,260
Bob?

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,840
Totally lacking in sympathy or imagination.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,920
The modern racketeer.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,640
Psychologists say that such character can frequently be traced back to-

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,200
The self-genius!

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,700
Power of SWAT!

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,440
Hey.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,220
Weeeeeeeeeee

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,680
Weave-a him away!

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:51,080
In the White House, the mighty White House, the liar tweets tonight.

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,060
In the West wing, the self-obsessed wing, the liar tweets tonight.

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,180
Ha, ha, ha.

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,740
Hush, you doctors. Hush, reporters.

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,500
Hush, you doctors.

16
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,340
Hush, you doctors. Hush, reporters.

17
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,960
You science nerds

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,560
Look, my ratings are through the roof

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,880
When I just say happy words

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,180
Everyone can get a test

21
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,860
It's just the flu

22
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,060
It's a hoax like all the rest

23
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,820
A left-wing coup

24
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,660
We've got lots of pee-pee

25
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,820
The cupboard's bare

26
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,700
It's Obama's fault, you see

27
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,720
The buck stops there

28
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,700
In the country, the quiet country

29
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,240
No nurses sleep tonight

30
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,880
But in the White House

31
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,820
The of shite house

32
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,020
The liar tweets tonight

33
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:18,700
Ha! Ha!

34
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,000
Believe me, believe me

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,120
Believe me, believe me

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,500
Believe me

37
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:27,960
Believe me

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,400
Believe me

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,060
Believe me

40
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,500
Pretty sure you'll believe

41
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,660
The lies of the Pope

42
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,160
Say believe me

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,540
NietzscheامNoise

44
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:42,820
Oh月

45
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,080
Space

46
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,080


47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,080


48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,080


49
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,080


50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,080


51
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,080


52
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,080


53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,340
Komm transition

54
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,380
Ha!

55
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:44,600
Ha!

56
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:44,600


57
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:44,740
Ha!

58
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,100
For

59
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,440
My

60
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,740
веч

61
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:45,820
La

62
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,180
Have factкам

63
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,780
This is the darkness

64
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,260
These are the days

65
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,720
When the shadows

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,240
hidden human hearts

67
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,340
step out of the haze

68
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,740
And stand like blots of ink

69
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,520
in the bright of the day

70
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,900
And the light

71
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,120
can't chase them away

72
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,960
This is the darkness

73
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,340
Where is the sun?

74
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,200
You've traded your god of light

75
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,880
for one with a gun

76
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,000
Empathy, justice, and mercy

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,380
only for

78
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,120
once

79
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,540
He deems to be the chosen

80
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,200
This is the darkness

81
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,360
This is the place

82
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,820
This is the lake

83
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,260
This is the embodiment

84
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,260
of all we have made

85
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,640
Greed personified

86
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,540
He'd in a suit and a tie

87
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,580
A corpse searching for

88
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,280
his bride

89
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,620
A scrolling mirror

90
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:57,620


91
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:57,620


92
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,400
But what of all these elves?

93
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:00,460


94
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,780
Heh heh heh at least

95
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,940
Got free plans

96
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,340
Yeah I won't.

97
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:24,840
will bend the truth to fit your fears and absolutes and it will leech into your soul

98
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,540
pollute your mind

99
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,320
this is the darkness where is the light

100
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:43,100
it must still be up there somewhere but you might be right

101
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,940
it might be days weeks and months of this long polar night

102
00:05:51,700 --> 00:06:01,960
but i believe there's more of us than them and prodigals return again and scales can fall from

103
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:11,240
clouded eyes and moons can set and suns can rise and swords be hammered into plows and all that

104
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,060
crap but this is now

105
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,720
this is now

106
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,840
and this is the darkness

107
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,440
this is the darkness

108
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,560
so

109
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,240
i'm alec baldwin

110
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,080

i'm alec baldwin

114
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,440
and here's

115
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,920
the thing

116
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,460
i'm alec baldwin

117
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,580
and here's

118
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,240
the thing

119
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,300
i'm alec baldwin

120
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,360
and here's

121
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,900
the thing

122
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,000
alec baldwin

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,040
and the thing

124
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,840
get back on mic anytime

125
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,420
at least

126
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:12,620
overnight

127
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,440
Oh, thanks, Dr. Falk.

128
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,560
I almost forgot.

129
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,160
That last song was Bob Walkenhorst's

130
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,380
This Is the Darkness.

131
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,560
Brand new from his Patreon page.

132
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,580
Although he said this hit was for free

133
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,260
so I can play it on the radio.

134
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,720
Pretty damn somber.

135
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,240
And old Bob is starting to sound

136
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,720
even more scratchier voiced than I am.

137
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,460
Although I like to think he's just taking advantage

138
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,980
of the high pollen count,

139
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,540
which is also affecting my voice.

140
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,300
We're only about a month apart in age.

141
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,040
But the cheery song before that,

142
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,700
The Liar Tweets Tonight,

143
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,360
was by Roy Zimmerman.

144
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,120
And on the same basic subject.

145
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,240
Uh, yeah.

146
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,440
Some of us miss our country.

147
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,320
Okay, so I'm going to do something different this episode.

148
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,940
Actually, I probably did it before, but in 1984.

149
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,440
What happened is I pulled out my CD

150
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,120
of the first two Oingo Boingo albums,

151
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,500
which were among my absolute faves in the 1980s

152
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,340
for reasons that'll soon be obvious

153
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,220
if you're unfamiliar with this band.

154
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,400
Oingo Boingo, which later turned into

155
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,240
the movie composer known as Danny Elfman.

156
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,440
Anyway, I hadn't listened to Oingo Boingo in years,

157
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,960
and I was surprised to discover

158
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,360
that I still remembered every single lyric.

159
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,020
And I was not surprised

160
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,740
when all those songs suddenly turned into

161
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,280
an immense brain worm

162
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,640
that's been tormenting me

163
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,620
and Princess We as well

164
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,860
for days.

165
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,600
And of course, like Cove Fef 19,

166
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,380
the only way to cure myself,

167
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,140
if this brain worm is to give it to you,

168
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,120
dear listener.

169
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,580
Oh, sorry, I should have covered my mouth

170
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,200
or worn my new Dobbshead face mask,

171
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,600
which we have now.

172
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,560
So anyway, I wanted to do this mostly Oingo Boingo show,

173
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,320
but the big decision was,

174
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,460
do I arrange it so it starts with the light

175
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,620
and hopeful stuff

176
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,660
and ends with the scary and dark stuff

177
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,380
or the other way around?

178
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,600
And I decided on the other way around

179
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,020
and on a positive note.

180
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,180
Let's not increase

181
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,400
the suicide statistics among subgeniuses.

182
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,440
This song, Perfect System,

183
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,480
it's about where we were heading

184
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,760
before all the crap hit the fan.

185
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,760
And society may well head that way even faster

186
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,380
once the virus kills off one type of dumbass,

187
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,680
but leaves the other type of dumbass alive.

188
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,600
The kind of dumbass that's fine

189
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,680
with perpetual mask wearing,

190
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,340
complicated rules,

191
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,040
enforced manners,

192
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,020
and isolation from the others

193
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,480
except by Facebook.

194
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,380
Forever.

195
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,560
I'm in love with you, I know.

196
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,980
And I know that you love me too.

197
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,620
I'm in love with you, I know.

198
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,100
I'm in love with everyone too.

199
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,740
We're all comrades now, you know.

200
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,320
We're all brothers under the skin.

201
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,900
We've got a few adjustments now.

202
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,240
Living in a perfect system.

203
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,500
The adjustment's simple, there's really no pain.

204
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,140
You'll hardly notice anything.

205
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,380
You'll hardly notice anything.

206
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:11,920
Nothing has changed.

207
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,220
Living in a programmed life.

208
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,580
Nothing really has ups and downs.

209
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,280
There's no need for fighting now.

210
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,940
There's no reason to worry.

211
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,980
In a perfect system,

212
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,900
there's no confrontation.

213
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,520
Unnecessary friction

214
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,680
to repeat our concentration.

215
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,980
We've simply done away with

216
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,660
unnecessary friction.

217
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,420
Unnecessary friction.

218
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,180
I live in a system.

219
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,220
I get enough nutrition.

220
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,620
I get enough nutrition.

221
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,460
By eating protein biscuits.

222
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,080
Recommended by the system.

223
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,400
It's routine regulation.

224
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,120
I had an operation.

225
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,540
And what was it above.

226
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,320
Let me give you a little taste.

227
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,340
I've already had enough.

228
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:38,860


229
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,380
I can show off my strength.

230
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,620
My finance is amazing.

231
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:40,620


232
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:40,680
To prove my stickiness,

233
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,920
Everyone too

234
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,280
I can tell by the look in your blank little eyes

235
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,880
That you agree, but you might have been surprised

236
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,860
Living in a programmed life

237
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,080
All the really house ups and the one runs

238
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,880
Don't need my fighting now

239
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,660
I believe in two-way or round one

240
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,380
I had an operation

241
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,680
With a red bush reaction

242
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,400
They tapped it with my brain some

243
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,800
It helped me see the reason

244
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,340
For living in the system

245
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,160
It helped me see the reason

246
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,660
We're all brothers in a perfect world

247
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,940
In a perfect world there's uniformity

248
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,760
We're all brothers in a perfect world

249
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,280
In a perfect world there's continuity

250
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,660
We're all brothers in a perfect world

251
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,160
There's no need for spontaneity

252
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,420
Perfect system

253
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,880
We're all brothers to the end

254
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,880
Brothers to the end

255
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,860
Brothers to the end

256
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,940
I know

257
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,080
And I know that you love me too

258
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,020
Brothers to the end

259
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,840
I know

260
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,180
I'm in love with everyone too

261
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,100
Brothers to the end

262
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,880
I know

263
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,600
We're all comrades in the buskier world

264
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,220
Brothers to the end

265
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:07,460
Brothers to the end

266
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:07,900
I know

267
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,280
Living in a perfect system

268
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,320
Brothers to the end

269
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,600
To the end. To the bitter end.

270
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,180
I kind of want that operation he's talking about.

271
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,300
Do you suppose some of these songs might be meant in,

272
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,520
I don't know, in an ironic way?

273
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,120
Boy, just thinking about that makes my head hurt.

274
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:41,420
I'm gonna go to Trump's stop and have one of those doctor prisoners give me that operation that makes me as intelligent as the president.

275
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,380
I bet I'd probably sleep better.

276
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,420
And I hear they have snacks.

277
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,280
I'm sure they wouldn't lie about that.

278
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm pretty sure that everything the government promised us is coming and it'll be just like they said it'll be.

279
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,780
There we go!

280
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:27,880
This tires me out.

281
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,260
Well then, I guess it was time for some dr주고.

282
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,340
I really am in love with his initial lead because he had so many say.

283
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,120
And I was asking that, too.

284
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,220
You're not home yet

285
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,960
What you see

286
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,700
Is what you get

287
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,240
Don't relax

288
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,240
You're not home yet

289
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,560
Put your life into my hands

290
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,280
Look around, you'll understand

291
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,680
Put your life into my hands

292
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,340
It's the 80s, idiot

293
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,400
What you see is what you get

294
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,160
It's the 80s, little fool

295
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,900
Don't forget the golden rule

296
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,620
What you see is what you get

297
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,220
What the hell do you expect?

298
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,960
Pretty red roses

299
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,980
White puppy noses

300
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,180
Man with rubber holes

301
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,780
And his is more like it

302
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,900
Ah, what you see

303
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:36,460
Is not always what you get

304
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,680
A lesson we must not forget

305
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,240
One never knows what to expect

306
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,860
So close your eyes and watch you get

307
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh

308
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,200
Is what you see

309
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,620
Is what you get

310
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,540
Open up your eyes and look around

311
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,240
Wow

312
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,740
Don't close your eyes

313
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,260
And just say wow, wow, wow

314
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,420
You've got to be thankful you're alive

315
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,860
And how much longer can you survive?

316
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,620
Underneath the mask there's something ruined

317
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,240
Underneath the ground there's something we will bang

318
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,120
And everything is gone

319
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,120


320
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,520
Put your life right into my hands

321
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,220
The man who you hate

322
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,860
Because what you bar under me

323
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,280
Is our life

324
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,440
I believe you know

325
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,500
The way you die

326
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,520
They didn't bring it

327
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:16,540
Anyway, hoje

328
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,440
You're gonna die

329
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:17,800
Be careful

330
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,280
I have some stuff on the table

331
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,920
Hold on realize

332
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,880
That you are around

333
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,100
I'm trying to find

334
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,720
omaniac

335
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,540
I burger

336
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,120
Pretty red roses

337
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,140
White puppy noses

338
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,640
Men in the thwopper hoses

339
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,860
It's what I like it

340
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,760
We're doing the streets

341
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,300
All of our friends

342
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,260
Bust you around

343
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,720
And make you like them

344
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,280
What a comforting song

345
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,160
Don't you agree?

346
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,960
Yeah, Oingo Boingo

347
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,220
Specialized in that

348
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,780
It's funny

349
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,420
It was announced that among the many musical combos

350
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,400
Danny Elfman was scheduled

351
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,520
To perform at the now cancelled

352
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:10,980
Bonnaroo

353
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,020
Or Hullabaloo

354
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,960
Or Woodstock

355
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,900
Or Coachella

356
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,120
One of those things

357
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,920
And all these kids were going

358
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,760
What's he gonna do?

359
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,080
Play the score of Batman

360
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,620
As if Oingo Boingo

361
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,600
Had never

362
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,340
Ever existed

363
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,840
Well, there you go

364
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm old

365
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,240
And tonight I'm playing oldies

366
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,560
That might have well have been recorded

367
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,380
Tomorrow

368
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,060
This upcoming song

369
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,440
Addresses the paranoia

370
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,660
That so many of us feel

371
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,500
Especially those who are cooped up

372
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,920
And surveilled

373
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,400
And feel like they're being watched all the time

374
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
I don't have to worry about that

375
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,020
Because for the last five years

376
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,720
I've been hacking and digging out escape routes

377
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,880
Through the deep woods

378
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,500
Surrounding our compound here

379
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,720
So when the black helicopters come for me

380
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,660
They'll never catch me

381
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,620
Until I get to the highway

382
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,440
Or unless they have dogs

383
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,600
Or infrared

384
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,940
Or armed sniffing drones

385
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,520
So yeah

386
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
I have nothing to worry about

387
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,880
Doing this anti-establishment show

388
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,860
From a cult compound

389
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,300
In Texas

390
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,620
Kind of near Waco

391
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,060
What, me worry?

392
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,200
But at home

393
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,340
There's nothing

394
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:36,340


395
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:36,340


396
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,300
Some are knocking on my door

397
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,120
Hard

398
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,760
Some are knocking on my door

399
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,300
I think they're looking for me

400
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,760
I think they're looking for me

401
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,340
Yeah yeah

402
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,580
But tonight ain't nobody home

403
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,780
I make a sound don't even move

404
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,200
No given nothing to see

405
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,780
I think they're looking for me

406
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,460
I think they're looking for me

407
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:02,140
I get to run, I get to run, I get to run, I get to run, I get to run

408
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,680
There's someone calling in my yard

409
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,100
There's someone creeping on my roof

410
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,560
There's someone tapping my phone

411
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,200
I feel it deep in my bones

412
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,260
They want to throw my intuition

413
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,020
They want to find out what I know

414
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,860
Why don't they leave me all around?

415
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,200
Why don't they leave me all around?

416
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,100
I get to run, I get to run, I get to run

417
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,660
Might need a catcher, but I can't show them

418
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,860
Can't be too careful, I take precautions

419
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,460
They're very clever, I get to run

420
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,420
Faceless surgeons, armed with razors

421
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,560
Cut out our impurities

422
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,360
Imagine they die

423
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,280
There's someone knocking on my door

424
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,780
There's someone knocking on my door

425
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,280
I need them looking for me

426
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,900
I need them looking for me

427
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,520
I couldn't get nobody home

428
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,920
I'll make a sound, I'll even know who

429
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,200
Don't give them nothing to see

430
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,680
I need them looking for me

431
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,780
I get to run, I get to run, I get to run

432
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,360
Might need a catcher, but I can't show them

433
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,620
Can't be too careful, I take precautions

434
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,180
They're very clever, I get to run

435
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,200
Faceless surgeons, armed with razors

436
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,960
Cut out our imaginations

437
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,540
It's a strange thing, deadly

438
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,240
It's a strange thing, deadly

439
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,320
Razor, Razors cut with such precision

440
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,360
Prodded here with eye detection

441
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,220
Razors never lie

442
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,160
It's all right

443
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,840
I'll do all

444
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,340
I think they're looking for me.

445
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,100
I think they're looking for me.

446
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,320
I think they're looking for me.

447
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,880
I think they're looking for me.

448
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,780
There's those lobotomy surgeons again mentioned in that song.

449
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,780
Back in the days of Oingo Boingo, the 80s,

450
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,220
we were worried about chemical and surgical lobotomies.

451
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,220
In the end, the invention of social media took care of all of that.

452
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,760
The prisoners are happiest when they build their own cages.

453
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,660
And seriously, do you think they're looking for you?

454
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,000
You wish. They don't consider you important.

455
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,040
And besides, you're throwing yourself at them every hour

456
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:28,380
that you work at your 24-7 non-paying database entry job for Facebook.

457
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,740
Thank you, Oman.

458
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,080
Late at night, my wife and I have been dancing frenetically to these old songs.

459
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,260
It's good exercise and it baffles the dogs,

460
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,320
but I wish y'all could see my air vocals.

461
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,320
I also do air guitar drums and keyboard when appropriate,

462
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:53,020
but I'm most proud of my air facial expressions and air vocals

463
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:59,400
with Danny Elfman's remarkably theatrical and melodramatic singing style.

464
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,740
It's great rubber face exercise.

465
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,200
I'm proud of my own clownishly overdrawn,

466
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,380
dramatic facial and bodily poses.

467
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,020
I studied under Jimi Hendrix and other masters,

468
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,000
so I realize I can't sing for hooey, but I look great faking it,

469
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,060
at least in my own mind.

470
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,940
And according to new agers, that's all that counts.

471
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,780
Now, during this strange year of the new abnormal,

472
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:34,600
a lot of my friends, the older ones, the ones who can still work at home,

473
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,200
which is a privileged bunch these days,

474
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,200


475
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,980
are finally starting to go nuts with this sheltering in thing.

476
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,200
On the other hand, some are all like,

477
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,160
hey, I could get used to this.

478
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,960
I hate people anyway and feel horribly awkward in any social situation.

479
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,800
Me, I'm an old hand at being a hermit,

480
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,280
except when I have to pretend to be a normal person

481
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,380
in order to get things done and, you know, make a living.

482
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,600
The distance, we share contexto,

483
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:35,240
and I'm all about интерplay.

484
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,880
In the hood of my old car,

485
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,640
Come and get me out of here

486
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,580
This is my private place

487
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,960
Everything is neat and clean

488
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,120
The skeletons are hidden in the closet

489
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,440
This is my private place

490
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,100
Come and get me out of here

491
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,320
This is my private life

492
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,960
This is my private life

493
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,500
This is my private life

494
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,120
Come and get me out of here

495
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,780
This is my private life

496
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,320
This is my private life

497
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,960
This is my private life

498
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,660
Come and get me

499
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,280
These are my private things

500
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,480
They're there against the wall

501
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,960
The dirty pictures, religious objects

502
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,160
These are my private things

503
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,740
Come and get them out of here

504
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,680
This is my private bed

505
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,800
This is where I lie at night

506
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:36,480
This is where I lie at night

507
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,760
Staring at a light bulb

508
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,320
Hanging on the ceiling

509
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,540
Waiting for dreams to come

510
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,140
And get me out of here

511
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,620
In my humble room at night

512
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:58,740
I often wonder what goes on out there

513
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,340
What makes them run so scared

514
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,680
I hold and stare

515
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,480
At the people I love

516
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,920
At the people passing by

517
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,960
But they can't see me through my window shades

518
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,360
Looks like I'm not even there

519
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,100
This is my private life

520
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,760
This is my private life

521
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,740
This is my private life

522
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,900
There's something dangerous I like

523
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,500
This is my private life

524
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,140
This is my private life

525
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,160
This is my private life

526
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,040
And all my problems are in trouble

527
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,580
What I really want to know

528
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,180
Has it always been this way?

529
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,660
Has it always been this way?

530
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:43,320
It is I the cause of everything

531
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,840
I am playlist of thoughts

532
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:43,840


533
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:43,840


534
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:43,840


535
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,180
This is my private life

536
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,200
The world has beenobile

537
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,440
Go get rid of the dangers

538
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,720
You've been talking all day

539
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:56,720


540
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,500
This is my private life

541
00:28:59,500 --> 00:28:59,880
That you think you could fluidily

542
00:28:59,880 --> 00:28:59,880


543
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,220
Dissensions

544
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,240
Candles, rings

545
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,240


546
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,340
Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi

547
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:01,340


548
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:01,340


549
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,260
I'm stuck in my mind

550
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,500
As I see all this

551
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:03,980
smirking

552
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:03,980


553
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:03,980


554
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:03,980


555
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,640
See you

556
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,000
This is my private life.

557
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,640
This is my private life.

558
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:12,400
This is my private life.

559
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,980
This is my private life This is my private life

560
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,540
Islands in the sea

561
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,560
Not so much like me

562
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,480
They don't doubt that change

563
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,540
No emotion, no emotion

564
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,460
Islands are the land

565
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,520
High like desert sand

566
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,060
Islands in the city

567
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,160
All alone in such a city

568
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,980
Smiles of rain

569
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,260
Just like the face of

570
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:25,540
When will it change

571
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,200
Islands in the sea

572
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,600
The world's come over me

573
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,500
We are both surrounded by water

574
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,380
And the wind is blowing

575
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,340
The water's in order

576
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,580
Keep them in sorry

577
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,160
And the fear is free

578
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,700
Anything at all

579
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,320
To break the flow of velocity

580
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,400
Smiles of rain

581
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,880
Just like the face of

582
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,960
When will it change

583
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:24,680
Oh I'm just so

584
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,340
People lips

585
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,860
I grew apart

586
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:35,600
People in my life

587
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,440
I was just broken

588
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,740
I'm in no Chap deіт

589
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,300
I can feel the sea

590
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,440
Ah, so much like me

591
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,120
Things don't ever change

592
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,460
No emotions, no emotions

593
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,140
I live on the land

594
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,260
Dry like desert sand

595
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,780
I live in the city

596
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,980
All alone in such a city

597
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,880
I live in the city

598
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,220
I live in the city

599
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,300
I live in the city

600
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,140
I live in the city

601
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,720
I live in the city

602
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,280
I live in the city

603
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,720
Forever

604
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,980
Forever

605
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,640
I live in the city

606
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,020
Forever

607
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,740
I live in the city

608
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,420
I live in the city

609
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:10,420


610
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:10,420


611
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:10,420


612
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,080
Let me

613
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,240
Run

614
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,180
Through the sea

615
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,140
Let me

616
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,920
Run

617
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:31,380
Through the sea

618
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,780
Let me

619
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,800
Run

620
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,620
Through the sea

621
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,560
Pretty grim, huh?

622
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:09,540
I'm personally not all that isolated, as I have a solid and nearby family and a large network of friends that I actually know well and like very much.

623
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:18,200
So, see, I have a safety net. Heck, I've got nothing to fear. Nothing at all.

624
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:46,860
So, I'm not alone.

625
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:46,860


626
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,220
Hey neighbor, let me give you some advice.

627
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,900
The Russians are about to pulverize us.

628
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,980
In our sleep tonight, that is if the crazy Arabs or the rights don't get us first.

629
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,260
And the fire will rain down from the sky.

630
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,180
The fire will rain down from the sky.

631
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,880
People die, people die, people die, people die.

632
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,160
But go ahead and sleep tight.

633
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,680
Then you barely remember what the wise man said

634
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,600
There's nothing to fear

635
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,320
There's nothing to fear about fear itself

636
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,320
There's nothing to fear

637
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,060
There's nothing to fear about fear itself

638
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,140
THERE'S NOTHING TO FEAR

639
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,040
THERE'S NOTHING TO FEAR

640
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,720
THERE'S NOTHING TO FEAR

641
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,600
There's nothing to fear

642
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:24,760
There's nothing to fear

643
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:24,760


644
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,380
There's nothing to talk now

645
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,240
There's nothing to talk now

646
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,700
There's nothing to keep

647
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:33,560
There's nothing to keep

648
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:33,560


649
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,420
Lol

650
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:40,420


651
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:40,420


652
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,520
Hey little girl, won't you come this way?

653
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,520
Won't you let me buy you candy?

654
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,340
Or perhaps a chocolate shake?

655
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,080
Or perhaps a nice cocaine?

656
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,020
Or perhaps a little kiss?

657
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,420
Or perhaps a ride in my big car?

658
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,000
Don't be afraid

659
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,400
Won't you make an old man happy?

660
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,400
Let me show you paradise

661
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,460
Don't ask your mother for advice

662
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,440
There's nothing to fear

663
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,080
But fair itself

664
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,180
There's nothing to fear

665
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,100
There's nothing to fear

666
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,000
But fear itself

667
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,980
There's something to fear

668
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
There's nothing to fear

669
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,260
Temperature's starting to drop now

670
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,920
Temperature's starting to drop

671
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,380
If they don't hear the end with junkie

672
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,960
Or with a zombie on the street

673
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,780
If they don't turn you into a yolkan or a grinning Jesus' spring

674
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,660
If they don't take away your brains and turn your body inside out

675
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,380
If they don't take away your passion with a color to be set

676
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,660
They will take away your heart and soul

677
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,280
Remember what the wise man said

678
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,200
There's nothing to fare

679
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,860
There's nothing to fare but fare itself

680
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,020
There's nothing to fare

681
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,620
There's nothing to fare but fare itself

682
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,640
There's nothing to fear

683
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,900
Temperature's taking a drop now

684
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,760
Temperature's taking a drop now

685
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,300
Temperature's taking a drop now

686
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,160
Temperature's taking a drop now

687
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,280
That's one of my favorite songs of all time.

688
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,760
Man, that horn section is something else.

689
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,420
Steve Bartek has apparently been the silent partner genius

690
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,140
behind the orchestration of Danny Elfman's compositions all this time.

691
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,600
And also, the guitar player.

692
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:39,000
So, okay, this one coming up is a good anthem for junior scientists in these end times.

693
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,900
Actually, you know, ends are only beginnings,

694
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,720
although that's a moot point for everyone but junior scientists.

695
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,340
For all I know, this song is really about a romantic breakup,

696
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,460
but I like to think of it as an expression of profound sadness

697
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,700
at the impending collapse of a once great ecosystem

698
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:00,600
and yet another era of the world.

699
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:00,600


700
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:05,700
Yes, at times, a few once great societies.

701
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,020
whoop whoop whoop

702
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,680
whoop whoop whoop

703
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,920
Everyone says

704
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,600
Whoop whoop whoop whoop

705
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,260
We've come such a long, long way

706
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,220
We're civilized

707
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,460
Isn't that nice?

708
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,640
We've gotten so smart

709
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,940
We know how to blow the whole world apart

710
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,520
When it comes to the simple things

711
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,540
Like living together

712
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,320
Ha!

713
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,200
Ha!

714
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,540
Why'd we have to come all this way?

715
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,440
Is anything easier to understand?

716
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,540
Why'd we have to come all this way?

717
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,980
Our life is better than written commands

718
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,280
We've been bullied enough

719
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,460
But we know better

720
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,500
Is anything we can all just say together?

721
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,620
Stop wasting all my time!

722
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,800
Why'd we come all this way?

723
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,320
Why'd we come all this way?

724
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,860
Why'd we come all this way?

725
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,620
Why'd we come all this way?

726
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,900
Why'd we have to come all this way?

727
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,220
We couldn't quit while we were way ahead

728
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,060
Why'd it have to end up like this?

729
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,360
We should've just stayed at home instead

730
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,200
The road was long and the journey was hard

731
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,120
And I even dreamed that we'd come so far

732
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,240
Oh, how time, we swung on my time

733
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,360
Why'd it come all this way?

734
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:37,580
Why'd it come all this way?

735
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,260
We should've just stayed at home instead

736
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:05,260


737
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:05,260


738
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:17,180
Why'd it have to end up like this?

739
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,840
Why'd it come all this way?

740
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,360
Why'd it come all this way?

741
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,860
Why'd it come all this way?

742
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,500
Why'd it come all this way?

743
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:58,360
Why did we come all this way?

744
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,260
Why did we come all this way?

745
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:35,600
I do really good air vocals and expressions to this one.

746
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,660
Have you seen my girlfriend?

747
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,120
She lives in a pig pen.

748
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,000
Have you seen my girlfriend?

749
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,420
I can't seem to find her.

750
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,660
Perhaps she is hiding underneath a plate of scraps.

751
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,940
Let's take the holy off.

752
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,340
Let's take the holy off.

753
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,400
Let's take the holy off.

754
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,520
Let's take the holy off.

755
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,340
Let's take the holy off.

756
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,420
Have you seen my new house?

757
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,580
Looks just like a dog house.

758
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,740
Have you seen my new house?

759
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,480
Someone saw it walking straight into the ocean.

760
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,100
Thought it was an ivory boat.

761
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,260
Let's take the holy off.

762
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,580
Let's take the holy off.

763
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,800
Let's take the holy off.

764
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:57,700
Let's take the holy off.

765
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,340
Let's take the holy off.

766
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:58,340


767
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,760
Let's take the holy off.

768
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,100
Let's take the holy off.

769
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,300
Let's take the holy off.

770
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,500
Let's take the holy off.

771
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,740
Let's take the holy off.

772
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:19,980
Maybe...

773
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,940
It's just a bad dream and a way to assume

774
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,180
I don't think I'll be so lucky.

775
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,420
Maybe...

776
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:32,860
Maybe...

777
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,900
It's just one of those strange days

778
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,940
When nothing's right.

779
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,980
No, nothing seems right at all.

780
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,020
When I threw a paper on a bathroom wall

781
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:52,100
But I can't remember who I wanted to call

782
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,180
Operator, can you help me?

783
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,180
Operator, can you help me?

784
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,320
The leftovers?

785
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:13,320


786
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,100
It's amazing how many good things

787
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:15,100


788
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:20,080
And, how was it that I fell in love together?

789
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,260
Rather hard than dying?

790
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:23,340
We said that we've just broken up?

791
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,980
Then I started to yell out my name?

792
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,560
Let's take the whole day off

793
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,840
Let's take the whole day off

794
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,200
Let's take the whole day off

795
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,240
Let's take the whole day off

796
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,340
Let's take the whole day off

797
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,240
Let's take the whole day off

798
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,500
Let's take the whole day off

799
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,780
Let's take the whole day off

800
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,560
Let's take the whole day

801
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,640
Have you seen my girlfriend?

802
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,740
Have you seen my girlfriend?

803
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,800
Have you seen my girlfriend?

804
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,960
Have you seen my girlfriend?

805
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,340
Have you seen my girlfriend?

806
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:51,780
Have you seen my girlfriend?

807
00:48:51,800 --> 00:49:21,780
Have you seen my girlfriend?

808
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:51,160
Have you seen my girlfriend?

809
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,680
Have you seen my girlfriend?

810
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,840
Have you seen my girlfriend?

811
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,540
Have you seen my girlfriend?

812
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,520
They matter

813
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,320
They matter

814
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,000
They matter

815
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,000


816
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,220
They matter

817
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,500
They matter

818
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,120
Ahh

819
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,540
They matter

820
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,780
They matter

821
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,040
Ahh

822
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:15,080
They matter

823
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,220
They matter

824
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:16,980
Ahh

825
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:17,320
Ahhh

826
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,900
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

827
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:06,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

828
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:31,220
I think you're better, better, better off

829
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,940
stuck up there without your head.

830
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,460
They say you're stupid, that you're too young to wow.

831
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,020
They say you're the swine of anything

832
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:51,780
that you can think of.

833
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,340
Hey, jump down this road.

834
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,740
If they say you're that, you don't, if they say.

835
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:57,800
You're right now.

836
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,200
You don't, if they say.

837
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,280
Turn around.

838
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,640
You don't, if they say.

839
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,800
Hit the ground.

840
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,180
You don't, if they say.

841
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,260
Fight to pick a witty.

842
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,640
You don't, if they say.

843
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,680
What's that doing?

844
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,100
You don't, if they say.

845
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,140
Then it's over, baby.

846
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,560
You don't, if they say.

847
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,420
Take your head, now.

848
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,280
There's something inside your head.

849
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:20,200
There's something inside your head.

850
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,300
All

851
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,260

Oh yes dear friends

875
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,300
before I end the show with the

876
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,700
ultimate Oingo Boingo

877
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:46,960
subgenius anthem

878
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,060
let me first explain

879
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:52,180
I'm not personal friends with Danny Elfman

880
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,060
of Oingo Boingo

881
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,960
we've never met although we have friends

882
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,460
in common and I have a picture

883
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,120
of him as the devil

884
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,300
in forbidden zone

885
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,740
personally autographed to me

886
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:04,600
personally

887
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,080
he was given a copy of Book of the

888
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,320
Subgenius by Dr. G. Gordon Gordon

889
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,980
under pleasurable

890
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,200
circumstances a long time

891
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,180
ago so he apparently remembers us

892
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,080
well so it's mutual

893
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,360
anyway this is Hour of Slack

894
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,220

898
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,440

899
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,080
have some kind of pertinent

900
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,120
numerology quip about that

901
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,500

00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,500
I'm on the outside

953
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,500
I never was a punk

954
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,020
I never shot junk

955
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,480
I never even tried

956
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,340
Counterculture passed me right by

957
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,880
Don't talk to debutantes

958
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,160
Don't eat in restaurants

959
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,920
The patrons sit and stare

960
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,320
The winners make wisecracks behind my back

961
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,180
The teachers stay in school

962
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,840
They front me by the rule

963
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,440
They said I have no motivation

964
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,560
Raise your brains and dedication

965
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,640
I just see a missile to the right

966
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,860
I'm on the outside

967
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,360
I'm on the outside

968
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,500
I'm on the outside now

969
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,460
This is where it all begins

970
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,460
On the outside looking in

971
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,180
Looking in

972
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,740
At you

973
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,560
I'm just a alien through and through

974
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,860
Trying to make believe I'm you

975
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,320
Trying to fit

976
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,240
Just a stranger on the outside looking in

977
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:25,780
At you

978
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,060
The pistol makes me sick

979
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,420
I wear the wrong collected clothes

980
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:42,980
I see the wrong things, you know I can't dance, my feet are much too wide

981
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,000
Who thinks you set the trends? You wear your head as right

982
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,520
Your girls are out of sight, your house is modern, really kitsch

983
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,440
You get so macho when you're with your bitch

984
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,920
I see them go to work, I see them go to sleep

985
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,000
I see them on TV, I see them laugh and cry

986
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,520
I'm on the outside, I'm on the outside, I'm on the outside

987
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:13,200
I'm on the outside, I'm on the outside, I'm on the outside

988
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:28,320
I'm on the outside now, this is where it all begins

989
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:33,180
I'm on the outside looking in, looking in

990
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:33,500
Looking in

991
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,420
And you, I'm just an alien through and through

992
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:42,240
Trying to make believe I'm you, trying to fix

993
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:46,940
Just a stranger on the outside looking in

994
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:56,600
I'm on the outside, I'm on the outside now

995
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:02,780
I'm on the outside, I'm on the outside now

996
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,500
I'm on the outside now

997
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,140
I'm on the outside

998
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:08,880
I'm on the outside now
