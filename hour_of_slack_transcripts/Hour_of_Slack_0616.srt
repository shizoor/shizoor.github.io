3
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:59,540
Thank you for watching.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,120
The opinions, curses, and implications of his dearest friends and bitter enemies.

5
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:12,820
In other news, child molesters were discovered to be frequenting the subgenius program.

6
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,440
Yes, child molesters were on the air.

7
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,460
When found.

8
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,140
They molested children by broadcasting their evil message into their ears.

9
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,000
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,980
which reaches the heart of every human being.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,480
From the inner mind to the subgenius.

12
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,000
Hour of Squatch.

13
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,420
In answer to your first question, can good Bob quit you a job?

14
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,740
Why, hi, only shite Bob the Dolphin.

15
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,540
Or I'll be gobs of gully gosh.

16
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,720
You better puke your pee on full-throttle pumpkin tea.

17
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,540
Elsewise, your walks will be a wagon down on Mammy's hind nanny.

18
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,620
Get a bow.

19
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,280
Get a bow.

20
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,980
Get a bow.

21
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


22
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,340
Get a bow.

24
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,740
Get a bow.

25
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:33,740


26
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:33,740


27
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,420
Big Bob.

28
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,220
Get a bow.

29
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,320
Bow bow.

30
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,020
Bow bow.

31
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,700
Get a bow.

32
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:41,700


33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,020
Get a bow.

34
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,880
Bow bow bow bob big bow.

35
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,260
Bow.

36
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,740
Bob Gibbons.

37
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:48,740


38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,420
Gob, bob.

39
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,220
Bob bobabi.

40
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,720
Big Bob.

41
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,320
Get a bow.

42
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,520
Bob bob.

43
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,120
get a bow.

44
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,580
Get a bow.

45
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,540
Bob bob ab ba bob Sure.

46
00:02:59,380 --> 00:02:59,980
Bob ba bo.

47
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,160
Man, these guys really rock out.

48
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,460
This is Cardinal Synapsis and the In Control Band.

49
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,540
The In Control Gang.

50
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,800
Yes, dear friends, welcome to yet another hour of slack.

51
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,920
And there's like a hot, hot music in the background.

52
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:38,580
There is a schoolgirl report that's actually soundtrack music from old German softcore porno films.

53
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:45,520
60s and 70s softcore German porno music background.

54
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,800
That's what we're hearing now.

55
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,780
Where am I?

56
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,860
But we must keep track of all these tapes.

57
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,780
It's getting a little bit cramped around.

58
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,320
It really is.

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,320
There's just not enough room or time to put and put and put the tapes.

60
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,240
There's so much putting to do.

61
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,460
And putting of levels there.

62
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,760
Record levels of microphone.

63
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,840
Okay, that ought to work.

64
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,260
And friends, because you see, don't you see?

65
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,700
A subgenius doesn't just look different.

66
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,380
A subgenius doesn't just act different.

67
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,580
A subgenius is different.

68
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,820
In fact, a subgenius is difference itself.

69
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,740
This was a little philosophical note sent in by Dr. Onan Canobite.

70
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,940
He says that sounds familiar and may be attributable to others.

71
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,260
And I think it is.

72
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,580
I think it is attributable to yours truly.

73
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:53,080
But you know, as Onan says, normals, meaning the normal people, the humans, present company excluded.

74
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,900
The normals mean...

75
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,120
Well, we all know that.

76
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,780
But subgeni mean well.

77
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,700
We're real good at being mean, in fact.

78
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,820
And normals just mean to be mean.

79
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,300
They intend to hate.

80
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,800
But we just plain do it.

81
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,280
They mean to be mean.

82
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,980
But we are mean.

83
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,740
As much as a subgenius is in the now here, normals remain in the nowhere.

84
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,280
See?

85
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,660
It's all a matter of emphasis.

86
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,660
We emphasize mean-ness.

87
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,460
They emphasize meaning.

88
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,000
To emphasize something.

89
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,560
Someday.

90
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:28,880
Maybe.

91
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,420
It's pathetic and sad and all that.

92
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,920
I think I'm going to stop for a coffee break, actually.

93
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,640
I need some coffee.

94
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,660
Would you like to join me?

95
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,960
I'll be right back.

96
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,480
Ah.

97
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,640
Ah.

98
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,660
Ah.

99
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,580
Ah.

100
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,060
Ah.

101
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,320
That's so much better now.

102
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:04,820
Ah.

103
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,080
Just taste that liquid false slack, dear friends.

104
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,840
Mm-mm-mm.

105
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,360
What a lovely day to do a show.

106
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,740
Yes, I actually do these usually on Wednesdays.

107
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,560
And now I'm sitting down with you.

108
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,280
And friends, I'm looking at something that makes me so happy.

109
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,120
It's the cover of the...

110
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,360
Um.

111
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,380
Um.

112
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,120
National Enquirer for January 1998.

113
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,500
And it says this wonderful headline,

114
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,200
Kirstie Out of Control.

115
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,800
Yes, and there's a photograph of Kirstie Alley,

116
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,480
that famous Scientologist celebrity,

117
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,020
all bloated up and looking kind of porky.

118
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,640
And you know, friends, I still think she's real cute.

119
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,940
And I wouldn't make fun of a woman because of her weight.

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,020
Or a man.

121
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,080
I've been a fat person myself.

122
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,360
For large chunks of my life, so to speak.

123
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,260
But man, I'd love to see a plumped up Kirstie strolling hand in hand.

124
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,440
She's so in love with her guy that she packs on the pounds

125
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,900
by binging and pining when they're apart.

126
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,360
Binging and pining when they're apart.

127
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,440
And you know, friends, I wouldn't even bring this up

128
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,520
except that she's a Scientologist.

129
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:26,100
And whenever something humiliating happens to someone who uses,

130
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:32,380
their celebrity to advance the cause of that self-same mind control cult

131
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,980
designed for dumbasses who like to think they're smart.

132
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,120
Of course, that does describe the Church of the Subgenius as well, just perfectly.

133
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,880
But you know, friends, at least we spell it out right there, right up front.

134
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,400
Church of the Subgenius.

135
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,620
Subgenius.

136
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,240
Get that, okay?

137
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:50,880
Alright?

138
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,480
Alright.

139
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,100
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

140
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,080
They are two different things.

141
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,940
You think about Bob with your mind, you're gonna go crazy.

142
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,740
You're gonna lose your fuck, what little brains you have, what you're gonna lose.

143
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,020
Don't think about Bob. Feel Bob.

144
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,660
You gotta feel Bob in your heart and in your soul gland.

145
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,800
In your wallet.

146
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:18,020
You gotta feel him in your most important, longest, thickest organ of your body.

147
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,660
Your wallet.

148
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,100
I'm feeling him in my flared.

149
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,560
It's my favorite one, baby.

150
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,660
I'm feeling him in my bladder and he wants out.

151
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,640
Bob can hide in your bladder.

152
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,600
Bob may be in your bladder right now.

153
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,280
Bob may be, he may go down to those red painted restrooms down there

154
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:47,900
and listen to the fwish of Bob as he hits that porcelain, as he hits that white porcelain bowl.

155
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,280
And doesn't it feel good to get Bob out?

156
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,900
It felt good to get him in, praise Bob.

157
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,080
And it felt even better.

158
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,400
Even better to get him out.

159
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,400
It's that mighty time, that time of pain.

160
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,540
Sterno and I, my friend Pope Sterno Docs, actually Sterno was supposed to be here to preach.

161
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,900
You know why Sterno, Pope Sterno Docs of Dr. Straboff didn't come to Austin?

162
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,200
You know why Pope Sterno Docs, the lead bass player and singer of Dr. Straboff, original Dr. band,

163
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,600
you know why he didn't get in his car and drive from Little Rock to Austin tonight?

164
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,620
You know what he thought was more important than Bob Dobbs?

165
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,620
Pussy.

166
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:40,180
If Sterno was a girl, I might be substituting the word dick.

167
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,100
Maybe it is, I don't even know.

168
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,540
Pope Sterno Docs, the greatest subgenius preacher ever just about,

169
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,800
thought that getting him some poon pay

170
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,300
was more important than preaching the word of Bob.

171
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:04,560
He thought that getting him some was more important than sharing slack and the message of Bob with you people.

172
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:17,500
Can you believe that a subgenius would consider getting himself laid more important than preaching the word of Bob?

173
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,220
Can you believe that?

174
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,340
That's why Pope Sterno Docs is a pope!

175
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,500
That's why Pope Sterno Docs didn't have to spend his thirty dollars.

176
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,000
But he did anyway.

177
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,700
Ten years ago when it was ten dollars.

178
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Like the little pamphlet says,

179
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:45,300
get in on the ground floor of a lucrative new cult now while rates are low.

180
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,140
Do you think it's always going to be thirty dollars?

181
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,540
For the next six months?

182
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,820
Or do you possibly think that the richest man in the world,

183
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,000
the Ross Perot's, the Sultan of Brunei himself,

184
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,200
praise the Sultan,

185
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:07,160
they'll be climbing over each other's backs trying to purchase a membership in the Church of the Subgenius on July 4th, 1998,

186
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,020
at any price!

187
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,700
Any price!

188
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,400
The Sultan will sell Miss America back to America

189
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,120
to get himself on the escape route.

190
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,580
And that's the justice of the sex drive.

191
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,720
The...

192
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,900
Are you ready?

193
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,880
We'll buy her back.

194
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,300
We'll take her.

195
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,780
Use damaged goods.

196
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,120
Sure.

197
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,900
I've been here a month late.

198
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,340
Give me, get my pants wet.

199
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,960
Well, I'm exhausted.

200
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,140
And we probably ought to just dance and have music or something for a while.

201
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,680
What's that?

202
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,780
I'm going to mourn the loss of my tapes for a while.

203
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,540
Oh.

204
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,820
And y'all can...

205
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,860
God, I don't care.

206
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,080
Just do whatever you want.

207
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,980
Just do it.

208
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,780
As a matter of fact, by the power infested in me by Bob Dobbs and all the other gods in the world,

209
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,140
you may now, as of this moment, do anything you want.

210
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,740
Praise Bob.

211
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,720
For what you'd want.

212
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,020
For you don't have to work all day from dusk to dawn.

213
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,040
The only problem is, you're small, or just a fastest bullet with little to nothing in it.

214
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,040


215
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,040


216
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:46,440
to see what & when that person's working.

217
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,520
Unless that person wasulo sad without giving

218
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,760
Well, I'm just waiting for the darkness to see me.

219
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,260
The world's wandering in heavenly grace.

220
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,620
Well, don't you see that you can't hide your face?

221
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,040
Well, time will pass on and on the way.

222
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,100
Well, I know I always have my way.

223
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:42,380
Pull that old porno music off and we'll put on something more familiar for me.

224
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,120
It's easy for me to deal with, friends, because I do have a little bit of...

225
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,500
Now...

226
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,620
Here's another thing about this show and computers.

227
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,300
I'm going to do two versions of this show.

228
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Side one will be the same for radio broadcasters and for the internet and the pirate broadcasters.

229
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,720
But side two...

230
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,220
Friends, if you're listening in the United States of America on a plain radio station,

231
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,080
you will hear a side two that I guess will just be a rerun of some older show.

232
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,800
People listening on the internet and on the five pirate stations and in Canada,

233
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,060
the two Canadian stations,

234
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,120
will hear the complete...

235
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,000
cuss-filled ranting from Austin by Dr. Leguim,

236
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,040
which I cannot take the time to edit the cuss words out of for the rest of y'all.

237
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,800
That's just the way it's going to be.

238
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,820
It's going to have to be that way.

239
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,080
Now, things...

240
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,200
Friends, I need to prophesy here for a second,

241
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,660
and then we'll go on deeper into funnier stuff.

242
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,200
But...

243
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,200
People often ask,

244
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,840
well, Reverend Stang, what will this or that be like after X day?

245
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,500
I know for us subgenius,

246
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,580
subgeniuses who own subgenius ministers' cards,

247
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,540
we don't have anything to worry about.

248
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,520
We can do anything we want within our own imaginations and then some.

249
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,900
We can even have our imagination boosted after X day.

250
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,300
But what about those who are left behind?

251
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,860
Those who never got around to sending in that $30?

252
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,480
Those who never heard of Bob?

253
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,780
And what about the pink?

254
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,420
You know, what will things be like for them?

255
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,020
Well, after the initial destruction and the...

256
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,440
And, you know, when the normals are...

257
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,060
rounded up and whatever y'all do with them,

258
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,860
I don't really care.

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,200
If I were you, I'd just, you know, train them, use them.

260
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,280
Don't waste them.

261
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,620
Some people want to waste them.

262
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,040
I don't know.

263
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,520
I'm going to call me an evangelical instead of a holocaustal,

264
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,460
but that's the way it is.

265
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,180
But here are some prophecies.

266
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,700
Actually, this was...

267
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,000
This is sort of cribbed from something else,

268
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,240
and you'll be able to figure it out.

269
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,960
But this is what it will be like after X day.

270
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,600
After X day, friends,

271
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,260
if you're being chased through town,

272
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,180
you'll always be able to take cover

273
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,700
in a passing St. Patrick's Day parade

274
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,620
at any time of year when you're being chased.

275
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,980
There will always be a St. Patrick's Day parade

276
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,000
that you can hide in, take cover in.

277
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,720
After X day, all beds will have special...

278
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,380
Beds, okay, will have special L-shaped cover sheets

279
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,380
which reach up to the armpit level on a woman,

280
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,360
but only to the waist level on a man lying beside her.

281
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,060
It will always be easy for anyone to land a plane,

282
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,040
providing there's someone at the control tower

283
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,080
to talk you down.

284
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,880
Once applied, after X day,

285
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,760
lipstick will never rub off,

286
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,160
even while you're scuba diving.

287
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,440
After X day, the ventilation system of any building

288
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,280
will be the perfect hiding place

289
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,680
because you'll be chased a lot,

290
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,720
but no one will ever think of looking for you

291
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,700
in the ventilation system,

292
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,980
and you can travel to any other part of the building you want

293
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,500
without difficulty.

294
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,300
If you need to reload your gun after X day,

295
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,260
you will always have more ammunition.

296
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,160
You will be very likely to survive any battle

297
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,280
in any war after X day

298
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,760
unless you make the mistake of showing someone

299
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,740
a picture of your sweetheart back home.

300
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,640
If you wish to pass yourself off as a German officer

301
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,320
in a war after X day,

302
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,480
it will not be necessary.

303
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:16,660
If you wish to pass yourself off as a German officer

304
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:16,660


305
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:16,660


306
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,360
A German accent will do.

307
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,420
After X day, the Eiffel Tower will be able to be seen

308
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,420
from any window in Paris.

309
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,280
After X day, a man will show no pain

310
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,120
while taking the most ferocious beating,

311
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,020
but will still wince

312
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,480
when a woman tries to clean his wounds.

313
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,120
After X day, if a large pane of glass is visible,

314
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,820
someone will be thrown through it before long.

315
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,300
After X day, the chief of police will always be black.

316
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,220
After X day, interbreeding will be genetically possible

317
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,980
with any creature from elsewhere in the universe.

318
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,480
If a woman is staying in a haunted house after X day,

319
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,760
they should always investigate any strange noises

320
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,260
while wearing their most revealing underwear.

321
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,480
Cars that crash will almost always burst into flames.

322
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,640
After X day, a single match will always be sufficient

323
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,620
to light up a room the size of Yankee Stadium.

324
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,660
After X day, even when driving down a perfectly straight road,

325
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,820
it will be necessary to turn the steering wheel vigorously

326
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,680
from left to right every few moments.

327
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,580
We will make sure after X day that all bombs are fitted

328
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,200
with electronic timing devices with large red readouts

329
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,480
so that you'll know exactly when the bombs are going to be fired.

330
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,300
It will always be possible to park directly outside

331
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,820
of any building you are visiting after X day.

332
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,340
After X day, if you decide to start dancing in the street,

333
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,640
everyone you bump into will know all the steps.

334
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,080
And after X day, it will not matter if you are heavily outnumbered

335
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,820
in a fight involving martial arts,

336
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,380
because your enemies will wait patiently to attack you one by one

337
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,620
by dancing around in a threatening manner

338
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,160
until you have knocked out all their predecessors.

339
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,160
Now, when you are knocked unconscious by a blow to the head

340
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,280
after X day, you will never suffer concussion or brain damage.

341
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:28,080
And no one who is involved in a car chase, hijacking, explosion,

342
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,720
volcanic eruption, or alien invasion will ever go into shock after X day.

343
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,660
It's just too boring.

344
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,540
After X day, when they are alone, all foreigners will prefer

345
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,340
to speak English to each other.

346
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,360
After X day, any lock will be able to be picked,

347
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,160
easily by a credit card or a paperclip, in seconds.

348
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,020
Unless it's the door to a burning building with a child trapped inside.

349
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,800
Those are much... those doors will be harder to open.

350
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,040
And...

351
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,780
After X day, all television and radio news bulletins

352
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,400
will contain a story that affects you personally

353
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,080
at that precise moment.

354
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,720
And that is exactly what is happening right now.

355
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,120
The news I just read to you affects you personally

356
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,460
at this precise moment.

357
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,660
Now, what else was there here for...

358
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,640
I guess that's about it.

359
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:26,560
I wanted you to know how convenient and sort of dramatic

360
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,580
life will be after X day.

361
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,460
The Church of the Subgenius,

362
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,380
Nipuri Lui,

363
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,700
Il Reverendo Ivan Stang,

364
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,940
Originale Idiatori

365
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:44,160
I Somo Coordinatori della Inverosimili Chiesa del Subgenio,

366
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,540
Sagace Par...

367
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,300
Friends, I don't understand Italian.

368
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,420
I just don't get it.

369
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,640
I try to read that stuff...

370
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,380
Well, anyway...

371
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,960
Okay, I've used up enough show.

372
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,280
Let's move ahead.

373
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,460
Let's move on.

374
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,560
I don't know where we're going to...

375
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,100
But we're going to do it.

376
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,880
John is in the basement mixing up the medicine

377
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,340
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government

378
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,080
The man in the trench coat's badge I've laid off

379
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,840
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off

380
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,960
Look out kid, it's something you did

381
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,620
God knows when, but you're doing it again

382
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,300
You better duck down the alleyway

383
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,540
Looking for a new friend

384
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,860
The man in the coon skin cap and a pig pen

385
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,140
Wants eleven dollar bills

386
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,680
You only got ten

387
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,720
Maggie comes, bleeped foot, face full of black soot

388
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,000
Talking at your heat, put plants in the bed

389
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,420
But the phone's tapped anyway

390
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,200
Maggie says the man in the city must bust an early man

391
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,320
Orders from the DA

392
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,720
Look out kid, don't matter what you did

393
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,760
Walk on your tiptoes, don't tie no bows

394
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,460
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose

395
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,920
Keep a clean nose, wash a clean clothes

396
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,680
You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows

397
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,080
Oh, get sick, get wet

398
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,420
Hang around the ink well

399
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,280
Hang the bell

400
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,160
Hard to tell if anything is gonna sell

401
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,520
Try hard, get boxed

402
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,800
Get back, ride the rail

403
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,940
Get jailed, jump bail

404
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,480
Join the army, hit the rail

405
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,580
Look out kid, you're gonna get hit

406
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,340
By losers, cheaters, six-time users

407
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,720
Hanging round the theaters

408
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,460
Grilled by the whirlpools

409
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,440
Looking for a new fool

410
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,640
Don't follow leaders

411
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,040
Watch your parking meters

412
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,540
Oh, get born

413
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,660
Keep warm, short pants

414
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,140
Roll back the door

415
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,220
Learn to dance

416
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,340
Get dressed, get blessed

417
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,580
Try to be a success

418
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,960
Please her, please him

419
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,000
Buy gifts, don't steal, don't list

420
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,700
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift

421
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,920
Look out kid, they keep it all hid

422
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,680
Better jump down the manhole

423
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,820
Lock yourself a candle

424
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,180
Don't wear sandals

425
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,300
Try to force a scandal

426
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,200
Don't wanna be a bum

427
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,160
You better chew gum

428
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,300
The pump don't work

429
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,860
Cause the vandal's took the handle

430
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,700
activity

431
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,780

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:30,780

Got a dog, stay at ourdetail

434
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:31,380


435
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:31,380


436
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:31,400
Even if we catch him

437
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:31,400


438
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:31,400


439
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:31,400


440
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:31,400


441
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,820
Before the honour

442
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:32,820


443
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:32,820


444
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:32,820


445
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:32,820


446
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:32,820


447
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:32,820


448
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:42,980
Being above the hanging

449
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:42,980


450
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:42,980


451
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,160
As down

452
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,700
I got a new way to make you dream

453
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,960
I'll hook you up to a pill machine

454
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,620
The ticking of clocks, the breathing of mice

455
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,080
Nothing but secrets the internet finds

456
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,280
The internet finds

457
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:14,060
Now I lay me down to dream

458
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,360
Hook me up to the pill machine

459
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,480
The pill machine

460
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:34,160
The pill machine

461
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,360
The pill machine

462
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,080
The pill machine

463
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,600
The pill machine

464
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,320
I'll say goodnight

465
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,220
In this world of my mind

466
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,000
A soulful song

467
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,160
A young advice

468
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,900
I'll limit the time

469
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,560
That I don't cheat

470
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,260
To the limit of time

471
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,620
A million jumping

472
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,880
I can't fucking sleep

473
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,380
Because I can't sleep

474
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,940
Now I lay me down to dream

475
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,360
Hook me up to the pill machine

476
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,120
The pill machine

477
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,080
The pill machine

478
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,540
The pill machine

479
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:40,840
The pill machine

480
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,200
The pill machine

481
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,080
The pill machine

482
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,600
The pill machine

483
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:51,640
I show you the real reason

484
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:51,640


485
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,580
Over time

486
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,100
S FX

487
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,820
Now I lay me down to dream

488
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:20,280
Put me up to the film machine

489
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,180
The film machine

490
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:33,840
The film machine

491
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,180
The film machine

492
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,060
The film machine

493
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,360
The film machine

494
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:12,460
And dear friends, that's a band called Boneback

496
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,560
in this...

497
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,300
band, this is on a CD, sort of a small CD from Coffee Records

498
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,400
Boneback, Starsky Solo Project

499
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,340

502
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,780

Friends

506
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,360
I think I have changed my mind about what I'm going to do

507
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,520
with the cuss-worthy rants from the Austin show

508
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,720
that I was going to have an alternate side to

509
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,140
I think what we're going to do is

510
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,560
on the internet and the pirate stations

511
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,760
it doesn't matter if it's an hour of slack

512
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,220
or an hour and a half of slack

513
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,960
So I'll just...

514
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,220
That'll be the part that the rest of you don't hear

515
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,540
that much.

516
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,720

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,600

This is Back and To the Left Productions.

584
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,240
The third eyelash to the right.

585
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,600
I sold out to myself years ago.

586
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,420
It was worth it.

587
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,760
Did you sign yourself up for lots of bugs?

588
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,480
And then yell at yourself as you drove down the street in your free new car that KCRB bought you?

589
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,860
And this music played in the background, which you can't hear, but all the people outside your car can.

590
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,960
People are just driving down the road.

591
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,080
Laughing and throwing confetti.

592
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,140
What the hell is this crap?

593
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,180
And saying, Phineas Narco, it was all his idea.

594
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,540
This is like the morning zoo on acid.

595
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,740
And so, this is really good acid though, Phineas.

596
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,280
I signed myself an island record.

597
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,060
It sort of became sellout.

598
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,240
Paid for by this station.

599
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,040
Yes, we've snorted all the acid.

600
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,840
Yeah, I had my own label and I was the only person on the label.

601
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,100
And I sold out to myself.

602
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,720
And I refused.

603
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,740
So you were your own groupie?

604
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,360
I owed myself.

605
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,000
And then I sued myself.

606
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,460
Like totally.

607
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,960
So why can't you please your proper squeeze?

608
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,400
When the gush isn't going all normal and anti-right-line?

609
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,860
Crushing no gaseous sense in your sneezing chamber?

610
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,880
Tasting an empty platter in your beanbag, boy?

611
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,240
Where's your rollerball then?

612
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,100
I can't drop me no love, bro.

613
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,980
Want me to loot you, loot you, logo man?

614
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,100
I mean, here we are like in San Francisco.

615
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,040
I mean, are you like a hippie?

616
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,700
I mean, did we like shoot some acid?

617
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,660
I mean, are you really a hippie?

618
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,640
Can I take your picture?

619
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,820
Oh, you're a 57-year-old businessman.

620
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,180
I mean, I thought you were like a hippie.

621
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,620
Yeah, they're hard to tell apart.

622
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,720
Because the new San Francisco, everybody looks the same.

623
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,460
They're playing some music now.

624
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,160
Eric, see?

625
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:09,740
It's groovy.

626
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,480
It's groovy, Kevin.

627
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,120
The liquid slacks poured all over the floor.

628
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,700
The wild, crazy, dizzy.

629
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:13,840
It's groovy.

630
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:13,840


631
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,880
It's a crazy scene, man.

632
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,060
And we're going to have a few.

633
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,660
It makes it wiggy.

634
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,960
Butter-rum martinis now.

635
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,280
And enjoy ourselves here on the air.

636
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,060
It's a freakout.

637
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,640
Here we go.

638
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:22,940
It's the total, ultimate freakout.

639
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,220
We just add a little bit of high voltage and do the robot dance.

640
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,000
And she like, she took two and she like had a, she sort of got crazy with a hatchet.

641
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,720
I mean, it was like the ultimate freakout.

642
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,580
It's just a small problem.

643
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,500
It was like totally, I mean, there was blood everywhere.

644
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,020
I mean, it was really groovy.

645
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,780
Yeah, but it was cool though, in a way.

646
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,580
Totally.

647
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,440
Like totally.

648
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,520
The ultimate freakout.

649
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,400
Yeah.

650
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,460
New film from Subgenius Film Studios.

651
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,020
The ultimate freakout.

652
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,380
You won't want to miss the ultimate freakout.

653
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,800
Who said, who said, who just said it and it became true.

654
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:09,840
He said, I believe that before this decade is out, that America should land a man on the moon

655
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,960
and bring him home safely.

656
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,760
Now, before he says,

657
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:13,780


658
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:13,940
And he said that.

659
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,680
We had never heard of free return trajectories.

660
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,700
We had never heard of deep space networks for radio.

661
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,700
We never heard of leaving the planet.

662
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,380
We never thought about leaving the planet.

663
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,180
We never thought about going to the moon.

664
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:31,940
And then he said it and all of a sudden, boom, there we were nine years later on the moon.

665
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,060
And you know what's even weirder than that?

666
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,160
Have you ever heard that there reversed language thing?

667
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:37,780
Well.

668
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,260
Where they think that, that when you're a baby, right?

669
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,180
You actually understand all the sounds and make words.

670
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,060
You understand words like that, but you just can't talk and do them through the left hemisphere.

671
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,800
You know what I'm saying?

672
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,020
Yeah.

673
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,060
Well, when you, when you're born,

674
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,460
So they took that one giant step for man, whatever that famous statement was.

675
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:52,840
Yeah.

676
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,060
And it's not one giant step for a man.

677
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,320
He said one giant step for man.

678
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,300
I'm not arguing about how.

679
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,580
No, I'm not yelling at you.

680
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,620
I'm, I'm yelling at the world.

681
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,900
You were pointing at me and you were drooling.

682
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,360
You bastard.

683
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,120
That gets me going.

684
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,800
But anyway, that statement, which I really couldn't state, and you would probably start

685
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,440
drooling and pointing at me if I tried it.

686
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:09,640
Yeah.

687
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,240
Yeah.

688
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:10,240


689
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:10,240


690
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:10,240


691
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:10,240


692
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,720
That statement, supposedly I heard on this reverse thing.

693
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,340
Yeah.

694
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,420
Actually, when you play it backwards, like, you know, the walrus ate Paul or something

695
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:17,820
like that.

696
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:23,040
You play it backwards and it says, we shall again walk in space or something like that.

697
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,680
And I heard it.

698
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,140
It sounded like we shall again walk in space.

699
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,100
But they say that.

700
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,740
What recording is it?

701
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,100
Well, it's that reverse, that reverse language guy who believes that when you're a baby and

702
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,920
you just come popping out of the womb, you not only smell bad, but you can also immediately

703
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,100
start to understand.

704
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,220
Yeah.

705
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:40,920
Remember yourself.

706
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,760
Well, you start processing your words because your right brain is such a damn smart thing.

707
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,440
It starts going faster.

708
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,600
But your left brain that makes all this stuff come out and is connected with you speaking

709
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,160
words.

710
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,980
See, he even went so far as to get his little baby going, you did be a go, go, go, go, go.

711
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,140
And he did it backwards.

712
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,240
And it really came out.

713
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,540
Daddy, please put me down.

714
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,800
Daddy, please put me down.

715
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,240
When it should have been saying, Daddy, the orbital velocity of a.

716
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:09,620
Get your hand out of there.

717
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:09,620


718
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:09,860
Yeah.

719
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,180
Yeah.

720
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:10,440
Yeah.

721
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:10,640
Yeah.

722
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,520
Orbital velocity of an asteroid traveling around a mid-sized sun when it's on its outer

723
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,060
lap will equal.

724
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,780
Daddy, get your hand out.

725
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:19,940
Yeah.

726
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,140
Right.

727
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,400
Yeah.

728
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,000
Will equal.

729
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,020
Daddy, get your hand out of there.

730
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,800
But, but no, you lose that because the conspiracy starts stealing it away.

731
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,700
The minute you're born, they start sucking on, you know, you're like when you're born,

732
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,780
you know that math and sex are exactly the same.

733
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,620
Being born is sort of like being a chunk of wax, a little piece of wax in the lava lamp.

734
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,160
Because when you're at the bottom, you're in this big glass.

735
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,380
You're in this big glob of wax, right?

736
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,580
And you, you share all the knowledge of the universe when you're in the bottom glob of

737
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:45,980
wax.

738
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:52,360
But then it heats up and a bubble pops up and there's you in the middle of the liquid

739
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,920
up away from the blob.

740
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,220
And now you're born and now you're not part of the blob anymore.

741
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,700
I didn't know you was a mannequin.

742
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,160
Yeah.

743
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,260
So, so look at the lava lamp like that from now on.

744
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,220
Christ, yeah.

745
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,280
And then, and then you die.

746
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,240
That's when you go back down to the bottom and hit that little steel thing and boom,

747
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:08,840
boom, boom, boom, boom.

748
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,380
You're back into the blob.

749
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,580
So what'd you bring with you back into the blob?

750
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,000
You know, I think that's important lesson.

751
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:14,880
.

752
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,000
.

753
00:36:38,240 --> 00:37:08,240


754
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:38,240


755
00:37:38,240 --> 00:38:08,240


756
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:38,240


757
00:38:38,240 --> 00:39:08,240


758
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:38,240


759
00:39:38,240 --> 00:40:08,240


760
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:38,240


761
00:40:38,240 --> 00:41:08,240


762
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:38,240


763
00:41:38,240 --> 00:42:08,240


764
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:38,240


765
00:42:38,240 --> 00:43:08,240


766
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:38,240


767
00:43:38,240 --> 00:44:08,240


768
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:08,520
.

769
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,420
.

770
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:26,980
.

771
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:35,880
I'm going to go check your T. I started to drizzle when I heard that one.

772
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,720
I could come in there and, and disjoint you feet leg a little, and stuff.

773
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:37,820
. She's gonna have some pressure, and, and the fatness and muscle, yes, she's gonna have

774
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:37,920
some lazy sureness.

775
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,900
Okay, I'll put this down and play this, and we'll both go in there and act screwy.

776
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,880
Let's go like girls going to the bathroom.

777
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,160
Sorry, we're going to lead you in prayer now.

778
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,620
We're going to check Dave's tape together.

779
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,240
We've got to go change the tape.

780
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,420
Here, just pray along, okay?

781
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,460
Bob Dobbs is here to help.

782
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,860
Is Bob Dobbs here to pick the lock on those shackles?

783
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,120
Hell no.

784
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,680
Bob Dobbs is here to break the locks on those shackles

785
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,660
and set you free, brothers and sisters.

786
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,780
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.

787
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,460
I see you out there.

788
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,120
I see when I look out at your massive multitude.

789
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,060
I see myself as I once was.

790
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,340
Oh.

791
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:44,020
Yes, I see myself as I once was.

792
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,680
I see people out there who've been stomped down

793
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,540
by the conspiracy and normalcy, brothers and sisters.

794
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,940
Oh, yes.

795
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,960
I see people who've been stomped down

796
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,480
by the conspiracy and normalcy.

797
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:00,160
Oh, and a lot of you can sit down and say,

798
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,760
well, they really fucked me, and I'm not satisfied.

799
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,840
That's right, the conspiracy will get on you and fuck you,

800
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,740
and when it's done having its way,

801
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,520
it will roll off of you, smoke a cigarette, grunt, fart, and go to sleep.

802
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,440
That's right.

803
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,540
And tomorrow night, the same thing again.

804
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,300
Yes, because that's what the con does.

805
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,500
It keeps you down.

806
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,280
It stomps you.

807
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,660
It breaks your spirit, brothers and sisters.

808
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,180
It makes you want to give up.

809
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,240
It makes you want to go to work every Monday morning,

810
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,300
even though you wake up in the morning and then you say,

811
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,080
fuck, I don't want to go to work.

812
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,280
And yet you still do

813
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,900
because the conspiracy wants to make you go to work.

814
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,120
So that you can make just enough money

815
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,620
that you don't die before next pay week starts.

816
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:49,000
Oh, but you can sit back and say,

817
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,100
there's nothing I can do about it.

818
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,780
There's nothing I can do about it.

819
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,160
It's just the way things are.

820
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,800
Well, brothers and sisters,

821
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,240
there is something that you can do.

822
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,220
You can get right with Bob tonight, brothers and sisters.

823
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,520
The slack, the slack keeps on you, brothers and sisters.

824
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,200
It gets on you like a leech.

825
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,260
Yes, brothers and sisters, but it doesn't suck your blood dry like other leeches.

826
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,800
It feeds you.

827
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,460
It gives you the spirit of the slack leech.

828
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,020
And it allows you to go and attach yourself like a leech to the conspiracy

829
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:32,640
and suck your own slack back from it.

830
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,700
Oh, yes.

831
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,640
Because the conspiracy's like a bitch.

832
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,420
It's a slack vampire.

833
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,260
Well, this is one slack vampire in the conspiracy

834
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,860
that is going to get nailed to its own cross.

835
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:56,320
Brothers and sisters, they all heard those church bells

836
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,220
and they thought, wow, they're ringing in the new year.

837
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,680
They didn't realize they were ringing in the last year.

838
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:07,600
And those bells were not church bells so much as they were funeral bells.

839
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,500
Yes, funeral bells for the conspiracy.

840
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,120
Yes, those bells will be ringing again.

841
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,900
Yes, that's the word again.

842
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,120
Yes, they'll be ringing.

843
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,520
They'll be ringing for Jimmy Swagger.

844
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,320
They'll be ringing for George Bush.

845
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,740
They'll be ringing for Barney the fucking dinosaur.

846
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,480
They'll be ringing for Bill Clinton.

847
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:32,220
They'll be ringing for Regis and Cassie Lee.

848
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,900
And praise Bob, brothers and sisters,

849
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,400
they will be ringing for God himself.

850
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,500
Yes, God himself.

851
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,060
The bells of his funeral are ringing.

852
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,180
Oh, yes.

853
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,300
Oh, yes, God, ask not for whom the bell tolls,

854
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,920
for it truly, it truly tolls for thee, God.

855
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,060
Yes, for this is the final judgment.

856
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,460
And he will be the one who is judged.

857
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,080
And who will he be judged by?

858
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,580
All of the freaks and weirdos down here on earth.

859
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:10,240
All of those who are smart enough to get their salvation from the church of genius.

860
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,780
The only laughing you're going to hear on X-Day is the laughing from us.

861
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,880
As we go charging into your homes, charging into your life, charging into your bedrooms.

862
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,580
And we'll be dragging you out into the street where we shall weigh your sins against you.

863
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,000
Oh, yes, and if you haven't sinned enough,

864
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,060
if you haven't committed that one sin,

865
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,280
that greatest sin you could commit,

866
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:49,240
that sin of blasphemy against the status quo pink conspiracy dukes,

867
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:52,460
oh, yes, then you too shall be judged.

868
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,800
And you too shall see Bob's smiling face in the sky,

869
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,340
looking down at you.

870
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,700
And he won't be very funny next time.

871
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,120
Oh, yes, I will, I will.

872
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,680
So sad.

873
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,040
So fresh.

874
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,500
This show stood on the wall.

875
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:18,220
I didn't even hear it but it's still one of the saddest.

876
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,380
This whole show is one of the saddest things I've ever heard.

877
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,160
This is the happiest moment of your life, Jader Hartman.

878
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,720
This show is for you.

879
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,280
Brethren and sisters.

880
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,000
You may kiss.

881
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,020
Turn to page 237 in your hymnal.

882
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,560
And before all, to sanctify this world.

883
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,220
Reverend Hartman.

884
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,900
With a urinal toward destruction.

885
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,980
You're in a lot of trouble now.

886
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,800
Let us jump over the quiver of compromise

887
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,280
and fall from the jagged rocks of the island.

888
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,160
And Aunt Bertha will now give Jader away.

889
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,060
Come forward, Jader.

890
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,640
I don't want to be given away.

891
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,880
It's time for you to medicate.

892
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,840
She's going to carry you.

893
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,420
You've got to do it.

894
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,020
She'll carry you.

895
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,780
Yes, we shall apply to our vows

896
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,320
and the purity of Aunt Bertha

897
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:08,180
and overcome the evil and sin of poor Jader.

898
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,020
Timmy, let's blow this hot dog stand.

899
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,000
Go get some crack.

900
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,000
No, I wouldn't miss this for anything.

901
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,800
Aunt Bertha's going to marry that guy.

902
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,100
And then, you know what we're going to put in that bin?

903
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,680
And how can I marry a fictitious character?

904
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,900
Stop talking and give me the ring.

905
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,920
Ah, with this ring, I'm me wed.

906
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,300
It won't go on my heart.

907
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,060
I'll have to give it another push.

908
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,600
Well, how can I have sex with a fantasy woman?

909
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,040
Of course, I do it every night.

910
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:41,180
She looks stupid.

911
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,240
Just do what comes naturally.

912
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,220
And now, they're going to throw rice at us

913
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,940
in 60-pound bags.

914
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,120
Put these pebbles in with the rice, Jader.

915
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,880
Put these little rocks in with them.

916
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,300
Look, hi-hi-hi, I'm throwing...

917
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,660
Hi-hi-hi.

918
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,020
Goodbye now.

919
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:00,960
Goodbye.

920
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:01,980
Bye.

921
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:05,920
The police...

922
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,500
The police and the SWAT team,

923
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,440
they're all coming down your street.

924
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,680
They're looking for you because they know what you've been thinking.

925
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,120
And they know what you've been doing, they don't like it.

926
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,100
The front of your house is on fire.

927
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,500
There's mad dogs at your back door.

928
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,520
The water's poisoned.

929
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,400
The rain is acid.

930
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,800
Sex can kill ya!

931
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,240
And, uh...

932
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:37,320
Brothers and sisters, the river's rising, and we're all going to drown.

933
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:45,920
Tonight, brothers and sisters, we are offering you a personal flimitation device.

934
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,880
In the form of this band, J.R.R. Dodds.

935
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,940
And you've heard Bob talking about this thing called slack.

936
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:12,760
Oh yeah, slack.

937
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:19,580
Now, many people think, well, now, Reverend Stang, is money and slack, are those related?

938
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,720
Yeah, sure they're related. Of course they're related.

939
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:27,640
Money and slack are very interrelated. Money and, uh, sex and slack are related.

940
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:32,340
Bob is sex! Bob is money! Bob is the embodiment of slack!

941
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:35,940
And, my friends, I want you to look around this town, this world.

942
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,060
Do you see enough subgeniuses? No!

943
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,640
Do you know what that means?

944
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:44,520
Do you know what it means when you see not enough subgeniuses?

945
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,360
That means you have to fuck more!

946
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:53,120
You have to fuck and fuck and fuck until this world is filled with subgeniuses!

947
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:58,180
You think the pigs have been bad about destroying the ecology of this planet.

948
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,320
Let's fill it up with subgeniuses and show these dipshit...

949
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,320
how to trash a planet!

950
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,520
Earth first! Then we'll move on to the other one!

951
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,600
Now, we're not trying to sell you on this drunk, dead personal savior, Bob Dobbs,

952
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:18,980
as your ultimate, long-term personal savior.

953
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,580
He is a short-duration personal savior.

954
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,480
This is a consumer culture.

955
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:29,020
They make shit to break down as soon as you buy it, and we make messiahs the same way.

956
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,320
You get tired of Bob, move on to the next Dobson.

957
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:32,320


958
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,280
You're not a goddamn personal savior.

959
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,860
Maybe it's Jesus. Maybe it's Arnold Palmer.

960
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,160
Tony Robbins!

961
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,260
Whoever that is, I don't care.

962
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:40,720
Personal power!

963
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,420
You know, it may be...

964
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:49,820
Your personal savior might merely be a brick that barely misses crushing your skull

965
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:53,040
as it falls from the cornice of a rotting building.

966
00:54:53,320 --> 00:55:01,420
Your short-duration savior might be some absurd replica of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer!

967
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:08,860
This is a real replica of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer!

968
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:13,080
And I say, you think we're just standing there looking at him?

969
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,020
Watch him! Watch him!

970
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:20,720
Take a good look at this head, friends.

971
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,940
They did just cut his head off.

972
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:30,320
I don't think that they just cut his head off, friends.

973
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:37,780
I think there was something else going on besides just a little bit of World Cup golfer decapitation, maybe.

974
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:45,320
The hole in this neck stump wasn't always this big around, I don't think.

975
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,640
Was it, Dr. Legue?

976
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:53,820
I don't think the hole in this nasal passage where the nose has been bitten off

977
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,320
had been cored out quite that widely before this show.

978
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,200
Was it Angus? Pope Angus?

979
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,500
I think they did something besides just cut his head off.

980
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:06,160
What do you think?

981
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:13,340
I don't think they stopped at just decapitating this particular world-class golfing champion!

982
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:19,260
Since you know that there's only six months left of existence for this planet,

983
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:27,020
July 4th, 1998, Pope Angus, Dr. Dinosaur, Dr. Legue, all these beautiful women,

984
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,820
and several of these ugly men,

985
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,020
will be not in Dallas, Texas for X-Day,

986
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:39,480
but at a nudist campground in upstate New York

987
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:46,000
called Brushwood, where we go for our X-Day drills and major head-lunches,

988
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:51,760
because in New York, women can take their shirts off without going to jail,

989
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,780
just like men can.

990
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,700
That's why we...

991
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:59,900
And also, the weather is a lot better in the middle of July.

992
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:06,240
And also, the campgrounds here charge too much.

993
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:14,220
But, on that day, July 4th, 1998, this year, 186 days from now,

994
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:21,120
this head will not merely be launched with a sacred nine iron like we are about to do in a few seconds.

995
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:26,920
This head will be launched using an amateur rocket and a shipload of dynamite.

996
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,860
We are going to blow the bleeding head of life.

997
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:33,000
We will blow the blood of a total bomber to the atmosphere, to the stratosphere.

998
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,560
We will blow it to the moon.

999
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,340
It will be the first act in our war against God and the universe.

1000
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,200
Praise God.

1001
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,420
We need a good tea.

1002
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,540
There must be a tea of some kind.

1003
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:51,400
Um, let's see. Oh, Steve Jackson of Steve Jackson Games, I see.

1004
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:58,080
That is the same beer bottle that was shoved up the spammer's ass last year and kicked until broken.

1005
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,120
First sight.

1006
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,600
And it's a little bit of a

1007
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,280
What's that?

1008
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,180
A little wild.

1009
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,760
How many of you people here pee?

1010
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,160
I don't know.

1011
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,280
Some.

1012
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,620
How many people here urinate, pee?

1013
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,060
How many here actually go to the bathroom?

1014
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:51,720
Raise your hand.

1015
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,520
I don't know!

1016
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,440
Okay.

1017
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:59,660
About half of the people here, about half of the people here use the bathroom or urinate, pee.

1018
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:00,040
Whatever.

1019
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,340
You are the people I'm talking to.

1020
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:08,860
If you pee, you are sure to be interested in what I have to tell you tonight.

1021
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:16,700
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready?

1022
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:23,000
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1023
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:28,660
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1024
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,840
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1025
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,740
I'm going to ask you one other question.

1026
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:52,500
Now that we've ascertained that about half, about half the people in this room either urinate or have the energy to answer a question by raising their hand.

1027
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:59,140
What brand, you smarty pants, what brand did Jesus Christ smoke?

1028
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:00,840
Chesterfields.

1029
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:01,440
Chesterfields.

1030
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,260
There's a man who's been reading his prescriptions.

1031
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,020
Jesus Christ smoked Chesterfields.

1032
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:06,880
That's right.

1033
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,420
He's been reading his prescriptions.

1034
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,120
He did not smoke Marlboro's.

1035
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,720
He did not smoke Merit Ultralights.

1036
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,820
Jesus Christ smoked Chesterfields.

1037
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:20,420
And yet, Chesterfields as a brand did not exist 2,000 years ago.

1038
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:22,840
It's a miracle.

1039
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:23,840
It's a miracle.

1040
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,240
How do you answer that?

1041
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,660
How do you even think about it?

1042
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,320
How do you approach such a thing logically?

1043
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,600
Answer, you dumb.

1044
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:29,640
Answer, you dumb.

1045
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:33,020
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

1046
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,020
They are two different things.

1047
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,900
You think about, you think about Bob with your mind, you're gonna go crazy.

1048
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,740
You're gonna lose your fuck what little.
