1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,380
Yes, and praise Bob.

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,080
Time for show. Live show for you now.

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,500
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,260
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,720
How come always scary on show, says Doug Smith.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,860
Of Dallas, Texas?

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,900
Well, it's actually been some time since Gary has been on the show.

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,420
Strap in. Show's about to take off.

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,080
Oh my God, the pilot's dead.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,980
He's been dead for over ten years.

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,720
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.

12
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,420
Power of Slang.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,740
Sponsored by the church.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,860
Of the subgenius.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,640
Wow.

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,800
Wow.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,260
Slang.

18
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,120
Praise.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,460
Praise.

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,760
Praise.

21
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,040
Ah, yes, it's scary on the show again tonight.

22
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,560
Because, as it says in Isaiah 28, 7, 8,

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,380
the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink.

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,600
They are swallowed up with wine.

25
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,720
They're out of the way through strong drink.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,360
They err in vision.

27
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,140
They stumble in judgment.

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,960
For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness.

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,180
And there is no place clean.

30
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,200
Yes.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,120
We're paying over.

32
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,240
Shut that baby up in there.

33
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,820
God, these babies, they get into all the subgenius shows.

34
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,620
Not just in Texas.

35
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,800
My equilibrium.

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,360
Distabilized.

37
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,320
Roar.

38
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,240
Yes, dear friends.

39
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,220
Welcome to Hour of Slang number 789.

40
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,980
The, uh, uh, continuation of the episode, the show, the show we're talking about.

41
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:36,580
The continuation of Hour of Slack number 51 from 1986 and number 52.

42
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:45,440
51 was the anti-drug subgenius special and 52 is the pro-frop subgenius special.

43
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,080
So slam those headphones on and be prepared, my dear, dear friends.

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:07,340
The official church position on drugs, friends, is that they don't show you a real world.

45
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,500
They don't expand your mind.

46
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,460
They only get you high.

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:21,680
And if you think you experienced a mystical state on, say, OLSD, you were wrong.

48
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,160
You were merely drunk as a lord.

49
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,960
So we're doing everything in our power to put a stop to the recent false subgenius show.

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:29,960


51
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,540
We're looking at every trip and break.

52
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:45,380
We're buttoning these and putting them in order.

53
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:59,960
We're looking at the

54
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,320
to that in the background that was the latest doc stock it's the doctors preparing the prescriptions

55
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,700
there's only one of these mind relinquishing substances that you should even consider

56
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:19,600
putting the gobble on and that's the sacred tibetan herb which is not a drug now you know if

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,680
you don't have to take the frock you can quit if you want to go sane if you want to keep your

58
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:33,140
so-called senses but how can we know the goddess of heaven seen on the slide lest we have for

59
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:40,760
comparison vomited into the porcelain bowls of hell for although the great inebriant of tibet

60
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:47,600
provides only an illusory vision of time control yet such a glimpse fortifies the subgenius

61
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,400
and he follows the taste of that artificial slack drooling like a dog in a rut he is a dauntless

62
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,660
experience of his life and the fact that he has a brain of his own has made him a real man and his

63
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,100
explorer of fake horizons.

64
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,800
For, of all the sacraments,

65
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,060
Frop does not wear off.

66
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,760
What's wrong with you?

67
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,660
We like you and should ignore you.

68
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,860
But instead...

69
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,680
Well, I went on down to my girlfriend's shack

70
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,460
to see how they did hang.

71
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,180
When I got there, her cupboard was bare.

72
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,940
I couldn't ignite a thing.

73
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,860
There was no shard, no bone, no twig.

74
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,820
I brought my comic book collection.

75
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,880
What's about this big, yeah?

76
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,600
Frop without slack is like slack without frop.

77
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,320
But where the hell else am I going to top?

78
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,500
I found my dog food collection

79
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,320
about five bucks.

80
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:01,860
I thought I'd call that rip-off schmuck.

81
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,700
Forgot he was in jail.

82
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,560
Ended up killing a porcupine

83
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,280
just to see if I could smoke his rind.

84
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,080
Oh, frop without slack is like slack without frop.

85
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,800
But where the hell else am I going to top?

86
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,660
Yeah, frop without slack is like slack without frop.

87
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,380
But where the hell else am I going to top?

88
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,160
I don't know what I am going to do,

89
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,040
I just know, that this here trip ain't through.

90
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,380
I just know, that this here trip ain't through.

91
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:36,720
Oh...

92
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,980
Oh, frop without slack is like slack without frop.

93
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,780
But where the hell else am I going to top?

94
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,660
Frop without slack is like slack without frop.

95
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,380
where the hell else am I going to top?

96
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:51,940
Yeah...

00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,660

131
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:17,620
are you experienced

132
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,480
You know, I was walking down the beach

133
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,420
Trying to get to my woody

134
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,880
Well, I had my suds cold and my buds was gold

135
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,820
I was gonna get high and get real drunk

136
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,540
Lay in the sand

137
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,440
With my beach buddy

138
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,240
With my beach buddy

139
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,540
But out of the side of my eye

140
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,480
I saw the ultimate wave

141
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,040
The super wave

142
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,720
It was the most stoked out stud wave in all reality

143
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,800
It was 900 feet tall

144
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,200
And on the back side of reality too

145
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,740
I saw a black hole right in the middle of it

146
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,980
A vortex

147
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,460
A vortex

148
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,220
A vortex

149
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,920
I was ready to shoot through that black hole

150
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,060
Had my molecules rearranged

151
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,580
I'm gonna hang five as I shoot through the black hole

152
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,000
Of the vortex of the super wave

153
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,280
The most god awful wave in reality

154
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,560
On the back side of reality

155
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,320
The front side and the left and the right side

156
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,460
Whoo!

157
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,100
That was tubing

158
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,760
Whoo!

159
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:52,660
Whoo!

160
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,440
I was fixin' to cut out

161
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,120
Whoo!

162
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,360
Whoo!

163
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:01,660


164
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:01,940
Whoo!

165
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,760
And then

166
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,440
Whoo!

167
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,060
And then

168
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,960
a giant

169
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,160
Roaches McFallan

170
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,160


171
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,440
A giant

172
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,200
Shooting McFallan

173
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,400
It's one of those watch-a-ma-couches

174
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,740
that open up right out of the sea.

175
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,560
Big old giant one that starts sucking me down.

176
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,580
It's like a vortex funnel

177
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,320
sucking me down to the bottom of the ocean.

178
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,380
I was getting sucked down.

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,480
And you know, as much as I hate to admit it,

180
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,160
it felt pretty good.

181
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,700
It felt pretty good getting sucked down

182
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,980
in that vortex wave all the way down to the bottom of the ocean.

183
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,000
But God, I hate to admit it.

184
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,160
But God, I hate to admit it.

185
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,940
It felt pretty good.

186
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,820
But I hate to admit it.

187
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,820
Moving on down on the backside of reality.

188
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,560
My bad, I'm doing it from the side.

189
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,420
Riding away and stoking on my five things.

190
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,480
Moving on down to the backside of reality.

191
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,800
Riding on my five, we're stoking on my five things.

192
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,360
Huh.

193
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,640
Huh.

194
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,980
Mojo can really play the drums.

195
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,980
He was stuck down in this group thing.

196
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,340
He was laying down on the backside of reality on those tracks.

197
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,080
Now how about the song Backside of Reality?

198
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,080
Our audience here is very familiar with that song.

199
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,600
We play it every week.

200
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,720
It was back in our acid days.

201
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,960
Back when we used to consume a lot of LSD.

202
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,740
Yes, I know that might be...

203
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:10,940
You...

204
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,140
You...

205
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,520
The Swingin' Love Courses at one time was a hippie LSD band.

206
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,220
Yeah, we don't really like to brag.

207
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,820
We don't talk about it.

208
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,320
We don't really advocate it.

209
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,960
We did expand our consciousness.

210
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,780
But I thought that you...

211
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,140
You condoned contracted consciousness.

212
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,840
We condone contracted consciousness.

213
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,000
Yeah.

214
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,760
And expanded consciousness.

215
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,180
Consciousness.

216
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,640
Yes.

217
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:37,940
Consciousness.

218
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,440
Ness, ness, ness.

219
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,100
Ness, ness, ness.

220
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,400
Uh, well...

221
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,200
So some of your music has actually has been LSD influenced.

222
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,420
Uh...

223
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:47,820
Right, that...

224
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,540
And that is...

225
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,240
Like, what is the similarity here?

226
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,880
I'm reminded of the 60's garage bands.

227
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,960
That's like LSD.

228
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,620
Lollipop sugar donuts.

229
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,480
LSD lollipop.

230
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,240
Lollipop mountains appearing from the sky.

231
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,000
We got high on high doses of sugar.

232
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,120
That's what it was.

233
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,740
Why did you...

234
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:06,940
We got high on sugar.

235
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,820
And, uh...

236
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,880
And we called it LSD just to cut a joke.

237
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,920
And you would have visions and get into the back side of reality.

238
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,540
You would actually drive the curl into the back, into the vortex.

239
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,680
Right, it's like the molecules...

240
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,440
Oh, this is my favorite, uh...

241
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,260
This is beautiful.

242
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,420
These vicious junkies and...

243
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,800
...the unknown.

244
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:57,640
Perhaps the stew bums understand the sacrament of the wine best.

245
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,640
Or, it's...

246
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,580
It's outside the church in the street that one truly feels the touch.

247
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
So, it's...

248
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:06,720


249
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:06,720


250
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:06,720


251
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:06,720


252
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,680
They're drinking the real blood of Jesus, friends, or the blood of Bob or whoever,

253
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,460
out of those green Thunderbird bottles.

254
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,800
Bob was not beaten up in vain.

255
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,360
His blood became the muscatel, the mad dog, the night train that those boys ride.

256
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,700
It does what religion is supposed to do.

257
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,780
It makes them feel so good.

258
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,400
Ah, yes.

259
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:52,580
It is the pink, suburban, respectable alcoholic who has no excuse and, verily, no hope.

260
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,460
Well, perhaps there is one thing that can bring them from their closet of opiated, self-hating secrecy.

261
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,760
Perhaps, if they turned to the frop lords of Tibet.

262
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,660
Yes, we must.

263
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:15,120
The most pious arch-popes condone, violently, the most frequent possible indulgence unto intoxication and beyond

264
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,280
of the revered and despised grief-easer of the mountains,

265
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,880
the warrior against pain, the healing herb, habifrop zipulops.

266
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,180
Whether taken as smoke, liquid food, or as Bob's pills, trademark,

267
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,400
it, above all the other medicinal substances, spells relief.

268
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:43,740
From the hearty young stalks protruding from the Himalayan snow to the white frop dust that settles on the rim of Bob's pipe.

269
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,940
It's the closest thing to the untainted essence of Odin on earth.

270
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:56,060
How else can we regard that which produces in the devoted user such superhuman clarity of insight?

271
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,360
Such sensory hyper-anesthesia?

272
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,180
Such total loss of judgment which yet is profound wisdom?

273
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,640
Such placid ecstasy?

274
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,800
Ecstasy and blessed repose, which in short, is the only shortcut to the realization of the Dobbs state.

275
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:21,980
The Exists planted our beloved frop on earth near the close of the age of dinosaurs.

276
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:28,840
Bob tells us it may well be Jehovah One's main instrument for evolution on this planet,

277
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:36,200
having very possibly been the device which brought down the great reptiles, allowing us mammals to take their place as large destroyers.

278
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,060
And yet, also, frop is that which will, with Bob's guidance,

279
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,180
likewise complete the usurpation as dominant species of the humans by the subgenius hordes.

280
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:55,280
Frop's detractors, mostly alcoholics and potheads, scream that it is a physically addictive vampire root

281
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,960
from whose siren embrace no man can tug free.

282
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,940
We shout, hallelujah!

283
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,640
Praise Bob, of course it is!

284
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,620
And is the Lord himself one bit less?

285
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,500
Less habit-forming?

286
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,400
Habit-frop-zipulops teaches us, ultimately, that all is one, that up is down.

287
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:19,420
It allows us to converse with trees, and to see prophetic and accurate visions of the future in our shoes,

288
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,800
our album covers, in the strange reflections on our toasters.

289
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:32,400
An ascetic frop master in Tibet or Dobbs Town can, with diligent consumption, finally lose all interest in everything,

290
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,600
achieving the paranervanic state closest to Bob's.

291
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,340
And so, in the end, Bob himself.

292
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,820
The

293
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:38,900
The

294
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,220
The

295
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,720
The

296
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,740
The

297
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,060
The

298
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,140
The

299
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,560
The

300
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:41,840
The

301
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:41,840


302
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,320
The

303
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,400
The The Thoughborn

304
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:22,400


305
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,040
Gothaughton High College, Indico, Texas

306
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,220
The waitigallot

307
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,620
In heaven, everything is fine

308
00:19:53,220 --> 00:20:01,040
You got your good things and you got mine

309
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,780
My equilibrium destabilized

310
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:13,480
As a young man, I was full of life and imagination and ideas

311
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,220
Now I know it's all just an illusion

312
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,800
And you, you think your mission is so very important

313
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,540
To me, it means nothing

314
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,120
I really don't care if you win or lose

315
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,020
It's what our free society is bound for

316
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,760
Do you think they give a damn about their bills in Russia?

317
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,200
I said do you think they give a damn about their bills in Russia?

318
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,200
They don't pay bills in Russia, it's all free

319
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,520
Huh?

320
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,860
I ain't no commie

321
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,000
You better not be, I don't want no commies in my car

322
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,500
No Christians either

323
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,720
A lot of people don't realize what's really going on

324
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,700
They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidents and things

325
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,440
They don't realize that theirs is like

326
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,020
A ladder to heaven

327
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,940
It's just a coincidence that lays on top of everything

328
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,760
Give me an example, I'll show you what I mean

329
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,820
Suppose you're thinking about a plate of shrimp

330
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,120
Suddenly somebody will say like plate or shrimp or plate or shrimp

331
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,320
Out of the blue, no explanation

332
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,900
No point in looking for one either

333
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,760
It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness

334
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,100
You eat a lot of acid, Miller, back in the hippie days?

335
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,080
I'll give you another instance

336
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,020
You know what, what's your name, Pep?

337
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,020


338
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,860
You know the way everybody's into weirdness right now?

339
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,020
Books in all the supermarkets about commuter triangles,

340
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,880
UFOs, how the Mayans invented television,

341
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,160
that kind of thing?

342
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,520
I don't read them books.

343
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,720
Well, the way I see it, it's exactly the same.

344
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,800
There ain't no difference between a flying saucer

345
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,020
and a time machine.

346
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,340
People get so hung up on specifics,

347
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,460
they miss out on seeing the whole thing.

348
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,000
Take South America, for example.

349
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,340
In South America, thousands of people go missing every year.

350
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,080
Nobody knows where they go.

351
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,480
Just like disappear.

352
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,480
But if you think about it for a minute,

353
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,600
you realize something.

354
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,180
There had to be a time when there was no people, right?

355
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,740
Yeah, I guess.

356
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,960
Well, where did all these people come from?

357
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,440
I don't know.

358
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:27,740
Hmm?

359
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,820
I'll tell you where.

360
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,440
The future.

361
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,220
Where'd all these people disappear to?

362
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:35,640
Hmm?

363
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,960
The past.

364
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,740
That's right.

365
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,320
And how'd they get there?

366
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,900
Flying saucers.

367
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,020
Which are really...

368
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,220
Yeah, you got it.

369
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,860
Time machines.

370
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,500
I think a lot about this kind of stuff.

371
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,740
I do my best thinking on the bus.

372
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,120
That's how come I don't drive, see?

373
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,560
You don't even know how to drive.

374
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,060
I don't want to know how.

375
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,300
I don't want to learn, see?

376
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,820
The more you drive, the less intelligent you are.

377
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:24,620
Oh, not necessarily beautiful, but mutated.

378
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

379
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,860
No, no, no, no, no.

380
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:29,940
That's right.

381
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:29,940


382
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:29,940


383
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,200
I got a letter from a prisoner.

384
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,120
Prisoner?

385
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,100
A prisoner in Atlanta, or near to Atlanta.

386
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,060
Actually, his prison address here is in Delaware.

387
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,660
Well, what's he in prison for?

388
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,500
What do we have here?

389
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,080
Listen to this letter.

390
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,260
It'll assist you to communicate.

391
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,720
I mean, communicate.

392
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,080
This was sent to us here in Cleveland, not to the Dallas headquarters.

393
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:57,260
He goes, almighty holy messenger, my name is Noah Hughes, aka Pope Nasty.

394
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:57,440
I don't know what's up.

395
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,360
no account. I'm a devout

396
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,900
subgenius whose rights

397
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,380
to slack are being withheld through

398
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,080
a local department of corrections.

399
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,200
I'm currently being held in

400
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,120
Gander Hill Prison,

401
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,520
located in Wilmington, Delaware, on charges

402
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,100
of

403
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,000
possession.

404
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,440
I'm looking at about

405
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,040
three more years, and

406
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,080
they repeatedly had

407
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,140
church material refused

408
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,280
for no other reason than

409
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,800
it's the conspiracy.

410
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,400
I'm asking you to please send

411
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,580
any church information or prayer

412
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,720
material. Prisoners always want it free.

413
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,380
As well as documentation

414
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,500
of any kind to show

415
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,420
that our glorious church is recognized

416
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,600
by the government as an actual

417
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,460
religion. Well, it's not.

418
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,660
Which is too

419
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,080
bad for all those people I've married.

420
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,660
I'm working on building

421
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,360
a case against the prison

422
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,540
for isolation of my

423
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,160
First Amendment rights.

424
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,160
A violation of them. So please,

425
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,440
please,

426
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,380
feel free to forward any and all

427
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,480
information pertaining to these

428
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,120
hate topics and requests.

429
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,240
My body is totally

430
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,440
slack-free.

431
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,380
And I'm hurting for some of your

432
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,320
old-time religion.

433
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,380
Also, please use the church name on the return

434
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,040
address so I can receive said slack.

435
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,080
God bless you, my fine friend. Give me slack.

436
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,160
Praise Bob.

437
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,080
Oh, that poor man. Now to discuss

438
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,240
his actual agonizing condition.

439
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,420
Just think of what he must go

440
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,040
through every day. He

441
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,760
bangs a tin cup against the

442
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,040
cell door. A guy with one of those

443
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,000
1930s King Kong hats comes

444
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
by and pulls out his old

445
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,040
billy stick and starts clubbing him

446
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,060
ferociously until the guy next

447
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,740
door, who is

448
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,300
somewhere near 455

449
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,060
pounds of solid muscle with a shaved

450
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,160
head, has barbecue shavings

451
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,680
with him.

452
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
That is so disgusting.

453
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,140
And for what? What did this man do

454
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,700
to deserve this?

455
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,280
All this man did

456
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,220
was lick a black hole. That's all

457
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,040
he did. And did that hurt anybody

458
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,140
else? No. Well, no, my friend,

459
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,280
you don't understand. The reason why

460
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,220
we are against drugs is

461
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,080
because they are against us. Don't you

462
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,040
understand what it is saying? But yet

463
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,840
you can buy heroin down at the supermarket.

464
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,020
I mean, beer. You can buy false hair

465
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,060
anywhere, pal. That doesn't mean you're not going to

466
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,100
stay bald. You can get crack down at the liquor store. I mean, whiskey.

467
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,980
You know, I mean, you can get

468
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,040
you can get narcotics

469
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,020
anywhere. You could be a narcotic.

470
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,060
All this man did was have

471
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,040
some frock. He should have told the judge.

472
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,540
He should have told the judge.

473
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,960
I am drugs.

474
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,080
He's probably got three more years of looking

475
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,840
in the black hole.

476
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,980
I guess I better put

477
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,020
God in prison

478
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,320
for growing frock.

479
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,800
The last time I heard, Mr. God

480
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,200
was growing marijuana and frock.

481
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,460
Both. By the roadside,

482
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,080
my friend, all over this country

483
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,040
and many others. I guess I better

484
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,540
put God in that.

485
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,200
Sander Hill prison.

486
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,980
That God is in jail right now.

487
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,300
Well, that's kind of one of the main

488
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,400
problems or why we are having so many

489
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,240
problems right now.

490
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,240
They're lowering the coffin of God into the ground.

491
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,900
God is dead.

492
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,980
God is not dead.

493
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,600
He's doing 15 to 25

494
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,420
at a minimum. Well, not really a minimum.

495
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,620
There is barbed wire, but

496
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,180
he can't get out. For possession. For growing.

497
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,340
Well, no. Actually, just for

498
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,340
consorting with an angular

499
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:25,940
object.

500
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
I think there were even more

501
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,340
of a curse than that.

502
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,600
I think they're working on throwing the sun

503
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,040
in the hoosegall, too.

504
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,020
I thought God was arrested by the

505
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,660
four-dimensional sheriff.

506
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,380
Four-dimensional sheriff.

507
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,740
For trying to break into the fifth dimension.

508
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,700
Yeah, because we've got only a

509
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,760
three-dimensional God.

510
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,520
He was getting so bad for his brick.

511
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,880
Well, actually, maybe

512
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,520
God's just a four-dimensional critter

513
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,540
and every now and then you just see a wavering light

514
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,140
in the air and you hear a voice.

515
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,960
So everybody goes,

516
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:58,800
God!

517
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,120
So maybe you're saying God got thrown in jail

518
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,060
for doing... No, God, he's just an

519
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,500
adventurer. He's like a guy who

520
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,780
lives in the four-dimensional world.

521
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,100
It lives in the four-dimensional land.

522
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,400
But, uh,

523
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,100
he's just out tooling around one day

524
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,060
and stuck his head in on Earth, you know?

525
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,600
Oh, man. What a mistake.

526
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,160
It's like us looking through a microscope at a bunch

527
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,840
of microbes.

528
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,140
He looked around at the people and he was just like,

529
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,240
you know, dudes, like, you shouldn't kill.

530
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,000
Like, don't do that.

531
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,980
And he kind of stuck his finger out when he said that.

532
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,720
But, you know, that's what came through

533
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,460
to three dimensions.

534
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,500
When he stuck his finger out, he kind of, like, passed through

535
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,160
and they said...

536
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,980
And he said, do not kill him.

537
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,060
They wrote it on a stone.

538
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,120
They all said, kill him! Kill him!

539
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,400
And then they realized every time they killed him,

540
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,940
he kept on coming back every Easter,

541
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,260
so they put his ass in jail and they're not letting him out.

542
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,060
Aren't you mixing up God with Jesus, Dave?

543
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:52,900
Oh.

544
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,200
His son. That's his little boy.

545
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:56,940
God Jesus.

546
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,220
I beg to differ with myself.

547
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,060
God is not only his only purified self,

548
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,720
but he's also an alien vestigal.

549
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,020
He's three in one. Three great candies in one.

550
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,080
May he rest in peace.

551
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,060
Yeah, or may he get some slack time in the yards,

552
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,240
you know, without...

553
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,760
Yeah, because not only did he grow the frog,

554
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,680
but he grew the humans

555
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,500
and gave them these brains

556
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,720
whereby they would figure out

557
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,100
that if they chewed on the frog

558
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,460
and packed it up their eggs, it would have felt kind of good.

559
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,200
And so they did it

560
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,020
because they could.

561
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,920
Now, I think God should be thrown in jail for that.

562
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:37,320
I think jail should probably be his most divine wish.

563
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,120
Because somewhere there's a 15-year-old smoking pot

564
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,960
and God's God's responsibility.

565
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,340
He brought it around.

566
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,440
He's that kid's father.

567
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,580
We're all children of God.

568
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,380
Wild wood weed.

569
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,700
What if God actually did look like divine, though?

570
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,140
I mean, wouldn't that be a stunning surprise

571
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,920
to walk into the heavenly gates

572
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,000
and there's St. Peter and he's all bespectacled.

573
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,040
And he looks like he's got, you know,

574
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,640
like a foreskin around his neck.

575
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,060
Now, that's how God will look to Jesse Helms.

576
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,640
With a foreskin around his neck, right,

577
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,380
and a biting, angry, one-eyed head.

578
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,660
That's the way Jesse Helms will die.

579
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,860
God will look like the young kitten

580
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,140
Nativi Dodd

581
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,540
in an early Russ Meyer film.

582
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,060
Kitten Nativi Dodd.

583
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,740
God's boy's in the White House now,

584
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,200
so we should be seeing a lot more of this.

585
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,000
Bob's boy?

586
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,420
Well, that's the two-dimensional God

587
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,380
I think you're talking about.

588
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,960
This morning they, uh, uh, yeah.

589
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,520
This morning they found the Bush daughters

590
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,480
passed out in their own puke

591
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,580
on the front lawn of the White House.

592
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,860
That could be a well,

593
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,700
that could be true, couldn't it?

594
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,960
It is.

595
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,660
It is.

596
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
It is a true thing?

597
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,060
Yeah.

598
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,140
You know how you can lie to me

599
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,900
in their own puke.

600
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,980
That was when I quit.

601
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,360
That was my last drink.

602
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:50,800
That was the problem.

603
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,600
I woke up on the White House lawn

604
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,580
in a puddle of my own puke.

605
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,820
Wearing that duck suit and a brassiere.

606
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,740
I scratched deep gouges in the door

607
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,600
with my fingernail the night before.

608
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,640
And you realized one tooth was missing

609
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,240
and they were like,

610
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,580
you were wearing lipstick.

611
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,840
I was, I realized that I better quit drinking.

612
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,400
But you know, those Secret Service guys

613
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,340
never did quit,

614
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,900
because there's still guys scratching at the door.

615
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,520
Those guys don't buy liquor for young broads.

616
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,540
Everybody's drinking on the job.

617
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,540
And so did you.

618
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,300
But to bring downpaper driJordan

619
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,220
Frop without slack dear friends.

620
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:50,980
Mhmm.

621
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,740
The users of drugs,

622
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,060
drugs dear friends on the other hand,

623
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,820
are placing themselves

624
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:02,880
in grave danger, they can never get as truly fried as they want to be.

625
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,680
They've got to take one on top of the other.

626
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:10,420
Sometimes they take so many that when they forget one or two, they later get mad at themselves

627
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,140
for it.

628
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,260
So to keep mentally levitating, they always need more.

629
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,020
Sooner or later, they burn out and become too slacked to react.

630
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:26,120
As they say, the brain tunnels through which they once excavated and blasted with such

631
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,600
drunken zeal begin to cave in.

632
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,180
The abuser wakes up one day impaired.

633
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,140
His muscles feel ravaged, his nerves nullified.

634
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,780
There's a hollowness inside, but a hot hollowness.

635
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,920
And discomfort mounts to panic as he realizes he's annihilated one brain cell too many.

636
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:55,060
His teeth grind, his cells shrivel, yet seem to scream for more when there is none.

637
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:55,440
None.

638
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:55,500
None.

639
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,100
None.

640
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,980
His skin exudes bitter greases from every pore as if he were getting a long overdue oil change.

641
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,820
Everything's clammy and numb to the touch.

642
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:11,860
His eternal itch gasps and convulses with the amputation nausea of something missing.

643
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,220
The electric glue of his brain becomes tacky and stiffens.

644
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,560
The snot-like shock fluid in which the brain once cozily floated has drained away and the

645
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,780
dried husk of gray matter slams against the rough,

646
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,840
soft cranial walls with every movement of the head.

647
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,420
The gyroscopes inside the ears' balance tubes wobble crazily,

648
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,300
and the world is no end up.

649
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:41,580
The floor lurches and shifts its steepness and changes its slant right under his feet.

650
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,060
If he lays down, he suffers the slow ovals,

651
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,260
the bed seeming to spin very slowly end over end through space.

652
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,160
He goes to the bathroom to expel the bad water,

653
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:58,140
but his urine smells burnt and leaks out in a weak radioactive dribble.

654
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,960
He looks in the mirror.

655
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,240
His skin is Krishna blue in pallor,

656
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,960
and he worries that the quiet interior shattering noises he hears

657
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,080
are the sounds of his blood crystallizing.

658
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:14,040
His heart starts to dry hump the back of his throat in hysteria,

659
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,180
for he knows that to die on drugs is to doom his soul

660
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:21,780
to eternal earthbound wandering in a purgatory

661
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,080
where the liquor store.

662
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,360
The doors are all closed.

663
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,920
If the nental eye is intoxicated,

664
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,660
the very soul is intoxicated when the body dies,

665
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,380
it doesn't know it's dead and so never heads for heaven.

666
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,400
Laying on the floor,

667
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,700
glowing feebly in the dark,

668
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,900
the wretch moans out the drug user's lament.

669
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,940
I can't decipher anything.

670
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,640
Put me where you want me.

671
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,820
Give me rubber blankets.

672
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,280
Eventually, his cohorts,

673
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,140
his friends,

674
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:53,140


675
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,860
show up and give him succor in the form of more,

676
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,940
and the wheel starts rolling again.

677
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,200
The conspiracy encourages, blatantly,

678
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,960
a useless, empty pattern of social drug abuse in its slaves.

679
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:19,180
The anti-reality sleep drugs like alcohol and downers are legal pretty much,

680
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,920
while the wake-up drugs are only available.

681
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,600
You can tell which ones they'd rather you take.

682
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,280
The end.

683
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:27,780
The end.

684
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,260
The end.

685
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,880
The end.

686
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,620
Uh, hey guys?

687
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,420
Yeah, yeah, over there.

688
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,560
Yeah, yeah, I just got a question for ya.

689
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,520
I saw you smokin' and I was just wonderin', uh,

690
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,900
that ain't F.R.O.P. now, is it? Uh, I don't know.

691
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,120
Uh, it is?

692
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,420
Oh!

693
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,700
Oh, hot damn!

694
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,380
Man, uh, man, this is some...

695
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,620
I've never seen F.R.O.P. before.

696
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,320
I mean, never tried it or anything, you know.

697
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,720
Of course, I'd really like to try it, you know.

698
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,760
Um, you know, just a little bit, just to see what it's like, you know.

699
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,200
Maybe compare it to some like, uh, you know, marijuana or, um,

700
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,800
or tobacco or banana peels, you know, whatever, you know.

701
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,560
Um, but, you know, just, just, you know, a little, just take a little bit, you know.

702
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,260
Not, not a whole lot or anything like that, you know.

703
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,720
Just enough to give me a hit, you know.

704
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,100
You know, not enough to fill up my lungs or anything, you know.

705
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:49,700
Just, uh, for me? I can try it? Really?

706
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,060
Oh, well, man, that's, uh, that's really generous of you, man.

707
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,360
Uh, uh, I think I will. Thank you.

708
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,800
Um, okay. Alright, I'm gonna do it.

709
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,260
I'm gonna do it.

710
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:14,920
Oh, man, I'm just really nervous here, you know.

711
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,680
I've never tried F.R.O.P. before, you know.

712
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,180
I don't know what it's gonna do.

713
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,840
Or anything, you know.

714
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,640
You know, okay.

715
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:25,780
Alright.

716
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,200
I'm really gonna try it now.

717
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,360
Um, um, um, it's not lit.

718
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,720
Oh, oh, it makes its own fumes.

719
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,540
Okay, alright.

720
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,960
You know, you don't have to light it for anything?

721
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,060
No? You just, you just suck on it.

722
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,480
Alright, alright. Okay.

723
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,660
We'll give this one a try then.

724
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:49,780
Alright.

725
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
Here goes nothing.

726
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,800
Alright.

727
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,660
I'm gonna do it.

728
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,980
...

729
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,340
...

730
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,820
...

731
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,820
...

732
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,540
...

733
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,420
...

734
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,640
...

735
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,460
...

736
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,220
...

737
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:16,220


738
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:16,220


739
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,220
... ...

740
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,420
...

741
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,700
..

742
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:28,720
...

743
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,520
I love you.

744
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,100
I love you.

745
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,060
Damn, that stuff got on top of me.

746
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,160
It got right on top of me, man.

747
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,900
Can I have some more?

748
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,480
You know, just a little bit, you know.

749
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,200
Not anything really major or anything.

750
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:42,620
With Frop, Bob gives his most insanely courageous warriors,

751
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,520
the Brotherhood of Bob, brief glimpses of the before life,

752
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,800
the pleasure dimension foretold by the prophet Janer.

753
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,620
And it fortifies them in their acts of terminal mercy.

754
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,140
It steals the nerves and frees the wills

755
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,700
of his children.

756
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:58,960
It is the most important thing

757
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,460
for the chosen instruments of death and eternal slack.

758
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,200
Slack Squad missionary Poonflang Dammerung

759
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,180
spoke lovingly of it in Economicon 714

760
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,480
before his immortal last mission

761
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,720
in a testimonial to his Lord Bob's ways.

762
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,940
Yes, Poonflang said, Bob shares of his own pipe with us

763
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,580
before each foray into the belly of the beast.

764
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,920
It gives us the knowledge of our true will

765
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,640
and how it is juxtaposed with Bob's.

766
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,280
We all grip each other by the shoulders

767
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,280
and sidle together in a great circle

768
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,280
as we chant together between the holy dosages.

769
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,740
The dizzying Frop fumes combine with the endless

770
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:44,380
rhythmical repetitions to create a living vortex power

771
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,320
of unspeakable ecstasy.

772
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,040
Kill, kill for the love of killing.

773
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,560
Kill for the love of Kali.

774
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,800
Kill, kill for fun.

775
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,660
Kill to be free.

776
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,680
Kill like a man to make America great.

777
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,000
While alcohol wantonly destroys brain tissue,

778
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,240
sloughing it off to be passed in the morning

779
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,780
as the wasted dead ravages of wine,

780
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,580
Frop does not kill brain cells, nay nay,

781
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:13,480
but mutates them, causes them to multiply faster.

782
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,200
Each succeeding generation is, of course,

783
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,180
stronger than those before it.

784
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,360
Man made booze.

785
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,880
Bob made Frop.

786
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,260
Who do you trust?

787
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,320
Frop enables one to see with the eyes closed.

788
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,760
This is known as the unblinking stare of the over-lid.

789
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,800
Through it, one may pass through the gates of the Frop Lord

790
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,540
into the Frop City of the soul.

791
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,520
Once the seeker has reached bardo 18 of the 18th hole

792
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,580
of hanger 18 of Zombo Fropland,

793
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,000
he may think the same thought over and over and over and over and over

794
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,540
and yet never care, never feel boredom.

795
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,900
The Frop entered through the forehead and exited through the eyes

796
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,920
of the upper back of the neck.

797
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,380
The possessing demon was exorcised instantly

798
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,440
and the president, if not his brain or the governor's, was saved.

799
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,400
This, my friends, is Frop.

800
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,080
But whether you're a Frop head or not,

801
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,900
the true subgenius forces the body to stand upright

802
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,180
where it can see further.

803
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:20,360
He shows authority over the drug fiend which houses the brain.

804
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,940
Our rightful place has been usurped by our own bodies,

805
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,720
and we want to see the man in charge.

806
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,620
And it's Bob!

807
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,180
Bob is the true mind storm, my friends,

808
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,880
the godly lobe explosion in your skull.

809
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,520
Who needs dope?

810
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:42,460
You never come down from the high of Bob.

811
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,460
Bob is the drug, friends.

812
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,920
The conspiracy is the real drug that drugs you,

813
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,860
that makes you want to go to sleep or to kick ass for no reason.

814
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,340
Bob is the drug that...

815
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,380
makes you kick ass where it counts.

816
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,820
The drug of remembering who you are,

817
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,220
the drug that wakes you up,

818
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,260
the drug that makes you see or leaves you be!

819
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,400
Praise Bob!

820
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,200
It's ho for horse or meth or dream to start the swinging mood.

821
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,960
While rats run up my trouser legs,

822
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,680
roaches share my food.

823
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,100
Rats and roaches nuzzle me when it's dark and hot.

824
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,480
Love, love, it's all the same, mixing speed and part.

825
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:46,800
First a rat and then a roach are both as like as not.

826
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:51,380
If I can't find a fix tonight, my marrow bones will rot.

827
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,320
Goodbye, transcendent dominos.

828
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,600
Walking square, I haven't long to stay.

829
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,100
A double jolt of heroin and I'll be on my way.

830
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:10,620
Getting stoned on sunshine, getting high on air.

831
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:17,500
Getting to it naturally, really getting there.

832
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,060
Getting such a high on it,

833
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,740
loving what I do.

834
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,560
I'm so full of happiness,

835
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,700
hooked on something new.

836
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,060
Life is such a trippy thing.

837
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:38,640
Hello birdies, hello spring.

838
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:44,380
Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering.

839
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,440
And I mean just what I say.

840
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,960
Life is such a joy.

841
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,160
I'm a groovy thing.

842
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,720
Don't pity me.

843
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,140
I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling.

844
00:45:59,340 --> 00:45:59,940
Ding-a-ling.

845
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,480
What bird in the world are you?

846
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,960
Are you an experience?

847
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,420
Well, have you ever been an experience?

848
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,000
Well, I have.

849
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,840
I have.

850
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,480
I've had a접esia before.

851
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,700
Not necessarily stoning a dikkle bird,

852
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,440
but a beautiful Ditchfeldt bird.

853
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,240
Me too.

854
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:30,820
I've been a learner.

855
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,240
Nah, I'm lucky.

856
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:32,820
Yeah, I'm lucky.

857
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,880
Yeah, I'm lucky.

858
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,140
From the titanic Hundwijk eliminated

859
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:38,140


860
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,420
Outnant bal castle Abruzzo!

861
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:43,820
An out-of-港ל!

862
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,240
It'll be a blast!

863
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,440
God, these normal souls are amazing.

864
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,660
You can drink them, you can smoke them, you can eat them.

865
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,660
I don't know, who knows what you can do with them.

866
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,580
You can even snort them.

867
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,980
I'm rubbing one up under my gums.

868
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,640
I'm going to try a line of this human soul here, if you'll excuse me.

869
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,860
Now that's what I call soul.

870
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,640
That must have been a fairly intelligent normal.

871
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,680
Oh no, that wasn't a normal.

872
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,920
I think I got some of his memories off of that.

873
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,440
How?

874
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,960
Yeah, I'm seeing this little woman.

875
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,200
In the 40s, just for a second.

876
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,740
That's probably the guy's mom.

877
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:51,700
Yeah.

878
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:57,440
God, you can snort their souls and these little primal memories.

879
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,560
You've just got to give them final unction and dry them out first.

880
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,740
God, how long have you guys known about this?

881
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,060
I mean, was this something the Indians had down there?

882
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:06,600
Yeah, yeah.

883
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:11,960
It's too rainy to light a fire to smoke a soul a lot of times,

884
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,620
so they just dry it and keep it with volcanic ash.

885
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,880
Rock as an absorbent.

886
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:22,260
And they just grind it up and snort it through huge, huge caves.

887
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,620
But they didn't have the technology to extract souls.

888
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,480
I mean, how'd they get them under pressure?

889
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,840
How'd they get them into the canisters?

890
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,700
They don't do it that way.

891
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,240
They just feed them the right amount of herbs and plants

892
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,380
and the soul just drips out of the nasal and anal.

893
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:35,880
You're kidding.

894
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:36,360
No.

895
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,720
Why can't we do that?

896
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,340
We can if we've got the right pills.

897
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,920
It's kind of, you know, it's all organic.

898
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,400
I mean, you know, there's two ways you can extract.

899
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,460
You can go high technology,

900
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,780
or you can go with just kerosene and a couple of guys with a pair.

901
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,520
Why did Bob set up these extraction machines?

902
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,540
I mean, what's this?

903
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,300
All you've got to do is you dig a little pit.

904
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,140
You dig a little pit in the ground,

905
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,800
you line it with plastic, peg down with wood,

906
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,720
and then you put the body in.

907
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:03,800
A normal, right?

908
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,140
Yeah.

909
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,140
Any normal?

910
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:05,620
Any normal.

911
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,160
Any normal that isn't dead yet.

912
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,520
The stole is still in him, right?

913
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:09,920
Uh-huh.

914
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,700
Okay, then you cover him with kerosene and acetone,

915
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,900
and then you just jump up and down on him

916
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,520
until it turns.

917
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,780
It's kind of green and thick.

918
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,440
Then you remove him, strain the liquid,

919
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,080
then you boil it, and you add sulfuric acid.

920
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,340
But then there's some kind of ritualistic...

921
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,880
I mean, what actually causes the transmutation?

922
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,120
Well, there's a group of people around the pit

923
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,980
adding a psychic element of the alchemy, you see.

924
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,540
They concentrate.

925
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:42,000
Oh, yeah, because they don't have the soul amplifier.

926
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,400
Right, so it's done with psychic methods.

927
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,240
God, it probably doesn't cost them.

928
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,780
You know, it costs them a couple of necklaces or a taper.

929
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,260
Well, they don't need electricity to do it.

930
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,120
Their pet taper.

931
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,300
The most expense they've got.

932
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,740
And it costs us a hundred grand a year

933
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,000
to keep these things pumping.

934
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,220
Well, you see, we use a lot of...

935
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,540
And not to mention the bodies and the souls

936
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:05,080
and getting rid of them and storing them.

937
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,460
The body dissolves in the solution completely.

938
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,000
Well, do you do up the body, too?

939
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,520
No, they just strain it out with a solid waste.

940
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,300
What do they do with that?

941
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:14,600
With that?

942
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,520
They press it into little cakes,

943
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,480
and burn it, like for fires and stuff like that.

944
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,900
They usually give it back to the guy's family.

945
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:30,740
How come the Western civilization didn't discover that?

946
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,160
Well, you see, it's because...

947
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,280
How come they haven't been ripped off yet?

948
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,400
How come we didn't rip them off?

949
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,240
Well, because we can pay for soul

950
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,560
and get it a lot cheaper from them than doing it up here,

951
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,440
because, you know, like down there,

952
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,400
nobody complains if you go through four or five hundred

953
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,740
bodies in one night, you know?

954
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,780
You can sit around and smoke all the soul you want.

955
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,560
I guess it would be kind of questionable

956
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,840
to be digging pits in your backyard

957
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,840
and throwing normal bodies in there.

958
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,020
Well, it's just little pressed cakes.

959
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,580
Noisy, if nothing else.

960
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,620
It's just little pressed cakes.

961
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,480
Most people barbecue on them later, you know?

962
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,460
You see?

963
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,140
And we've got to give half of them away

964
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:13,140
to wherever they're taken on Jupiter.

965
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,500
Well, of course, the thing about...

966
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,420
That weirds me out.

967
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:16,500
That's a good point.

968
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,660
A lot of things weird me out.

969
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,720
The fact is that you can't get any good soul

970
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,900
here in the States, dry or liquid.

971
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,620
It's always been cut with something.

972
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,740
And I like my soul unstepped on myself, you know?

973
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:29,700
Oh, yeah.

974
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,960
They'll use monkey souls, chimpanzee souls.

975
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,800
Hell, they just take up crystallized...

976
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,960
It's probably two-thirds...

977
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,200
They just take crystallized emotions

978
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,920
and mix them in, for God's sake.

979
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,580
I mean, you get a bad blast of rage

980
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,740
mixed in with your soul,

981
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,200
and the next thing you know, man, you...

982
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,280
That's probably what happened to me last.

983
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:46,980
Last week.

984
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,060
They put a lot of anguish in it, too, you know?

985
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:52,860
It just makes you depressed.

986
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,160
Whereas pure soul is nothing more than a psychic

987
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,840
and, you know, almanac amplifier.

988
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,100
And, you know, if your soul's in good shape

989
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,300
when you do pure soul,

990
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,180
I mean, it's even better.

991
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,960
But, you know, like, you put...

992
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,040
The stuff that's been stepped on

993
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,280
and mixed with monkey soul or alligator...

994
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,100
Yeah, next thing you know, your soul is...

995
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,180
It's tainted.

996
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,320
It's very tainted.

997
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,920
Got holes eating through it, you know?

998
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,040
Running up demagnetized soul,

999
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,160
bad golfer souls.

1000
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:24,960
Yeah.

1001
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:25,980
Can you imagine?

1002
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1003
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1004
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,680
Been a useless banana head all of my days.

1005
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,180
Spent my life in a drug and beauty.

1006
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,700
Pick my head and eat all the bugs.

1007
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,100
Why must I be a teenager on drugs?

1008
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:59,060
I went out last night and got the drug.

1009
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:05,480
I crashed my father's pickup truck.

1010
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,620
And I went home and I puked on the rug.

1011
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,760
Why must I be a teenager on drugs?

1012
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:30,940
If I don't cut the shit, it's black to see.

1013
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:36,120
I'm gonna spend my life doing PCP.

1014
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:41,680
Each night I hang around with a bunch of cucks.

1015
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,480
Why must I be a teenager on drugs?

1016
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:46,480


1017
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:46,480


1018
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:46,480


1019
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:46,480


1020
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:46,480


1021
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:46,480


1022
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:46,480


1023
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:46,480


1024
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:46,480


1025
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:46,480


1026
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:46,480


1027
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:46,480


1028
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:02,080
My boss says next time I get thrown in jail

1029
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:07,120
I love my daddy kinda, throw no clown

1030
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:12,080
Each night I ask the stars up above

1031
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,660
Why must I be a tinny drunkard?

1032
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,280
Work in the body shop can't wait to get paid

1033
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,940
Wanna get wasted I wanna get laid

1034
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,460
Get all my gold I'll drive to the Cape

1035
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,280
Don't get no results I'm gonna go ape

1036
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:51,700
Hey, let me tell you about my new coat, X9, mate.

1037
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,200
Pay me two bucks.

1038
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:03,240
My pot is filled with flowers

1039
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,820
My grass is bright and green

1040
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:11,200
My tea is brewing in my cup

1041
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,060
And my coffee is in my cup

1042
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,940
And still I make the scene

1043
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,960
So just don't try to change me

1044
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,340
I love the world I've found

1045
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,680
I've got to fly my own sweet way

1046
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,500
Don't you shoot me down

1047
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,840
Life is such a trippy thing

1048
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,360
Hello, birdies, hello, spring

1049
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:41,220
Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering

1050
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,340
And I mean just what I see

1051
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:50,020
Life is such a groovy thing

1052
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,540
Don't pity me, I'm glad to be

1053
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,000
A ding-a-ling

1054
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,920
Don't pity me, I'm glad to be

1055
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,600
A ding-a-ling

1056
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,440
A ding-a-ling

1057
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,240
Don't pity me

1058
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,840
Don't judge me

1059
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,920
That you don't know watched that movie

1060
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:19,920


1061
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,920
Instead, you're only in the silent

1062
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:22,920


1063
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:22,920


1064
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:41,660
All the moods in your head

1065
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:41,860
Floyd cleanse your уже

1066
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:52,800
Well, this is Reverend Ivan Stang with the Church of the Subgenius.

1067
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:59,420
Those of you who want to know more about the church can write to Bob.

1068
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,680
That's right, Bob at P.O. Box.

1069
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,300
Get that pencil out now, friends.

1070
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:11,240
P.O. Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1071
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,020
44118.

1072
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:19,360
We're just writing for information, but you won't believe what you get.

1073
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,440
Because you don't know about our books.

1074
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,220
Well, we don't know any of that.

1075
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:31,000
That's P.O. Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1076
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,240
44118.

1077
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:38,420
You want to know just what we're playing and what we're doing here.

1078
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:40,720

And of course, friends, we heard God in Prison.

1094
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:48,000
Subscribed by Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Chaz, and me on ESO Swamp Radio and WCSB just recently.

1104
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,380
Praise Bob.

1105
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,580
When you leave this room...

1106
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,420
My back will continue.

1107
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,060
Inside of your own mind.

1108
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:50,060
Inside of your own skull.

1109
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,280
Go, go, go.

1110
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:12,920
Take my word.

1111
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,580
Tell me somebody.

Take my word.

1114
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,180
Go, go, go.

1115
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:19,800
Go, go, go.

1116
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,560
Tell me.

1117
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:21,560


1118
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,420
Go, go, go.

1119
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:26,820
Bob Lunting.

1120
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,080
Bob Lunting.

1121
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,300
Bob Lunting.

1122
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:30,560
Bob Lunting.

1123
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:31,800
Bob Lunting.

1124
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:34,280
Bob Lunting.

1125
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,520
Bob Lunting.

1126
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,340
Beep, beep.

1127
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:47,100
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1128
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:53,360
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1129
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:58,400
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1130
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:05,480
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that Slackback to rebound to you,

1131
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:11,860
you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog,

1132
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:18,800
store pages and help out financially as best you can. Now we know what it's like

1133
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,940
to be on the brink of total poverty and we don't want any subgeniuses to make

1134
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:29,260
their own situations worse. But some of you still have jobs. Even five bucks

1135
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:35,040
makes a big difference even if it's only once a month from enough of you. Fifty

1136
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:41,880
bucks makes an even bigger difference. All we're saying is that blow jobs could

1137
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:48,300
go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs. We also take checks and money

1138
01:01:48,300 --> 01:02:03,320
orders to Subgenius Foundation P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights Ohio 44118

1139
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:08,500
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
