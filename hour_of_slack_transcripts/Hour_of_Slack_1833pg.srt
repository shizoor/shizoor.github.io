1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
This is your last chance.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,920
After this, there is no turning back.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,900
You take the blue pill.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,540
The story ends.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,960
You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,700
You take the red pill.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,320
You stay in Wonderland.

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,880
And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,520
Remember,

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,440
all I'm offering is the truth.

11
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,220
Nothing more.

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,740
Time for show.

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,280
Live show for you now.

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,700
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,500
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,920
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,440
Hour of Slap.

18
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,060
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

19
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,200
I love you.

20
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,680
Text to Uncle Dan, meeting with the Ku Klux Klan.

21
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,180
Tell him there's a change of plans, the South won't rise again.

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,060
Yammering with the Southern drawl.

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,920
Bless your heart.

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,860
Howdy y'all.

25
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,380
President Trump won't build that wall and the South won't rise again.

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,200
General Sherman came to town riding on a horsey.

27
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,180
Stuck his boot inside your ass and burned your town of carsey.

28
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,420
Corpulent, seditious scum pining for a donkey's bum.

29
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,920
Yodel, stomping, clapping, strum, but the South won't rise again.

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,940
Let's see what's going on in the cornfield.

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,040
Hey, Clarabelle, where'd you get that pretty Q-9 baseball cap?

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,080
Oh, Rufus gave it to me.

33
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,400
He got it at that riot up in Washington, D.C.

34
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,880
Well, as pretty as you are, Clarabelle, I bet he gives you lots of nice gifts.

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,340
Well, he ain't given me nothing since he went to prison.

36
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,880
Hey!

37
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,320
Jimmy Bob, what's the difference between President Trump and President Obama?

38
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,560
I don't know, Clem, you tell me.

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,940
What's the difference between President Trump and President Obama?

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,620
Well, I want President Trump to f**k my dog.

41
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,680
Football watchin' tubs of lard

42
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,560
Blacks for General Beauregard

43
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,620
Arithmetic is pretty hard

44
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,260
And the South will rise again

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,880
Nazi thugs with rebel flags

46
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,000
From our bumpers we will drag

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,900
Ship them home in body bags

48
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,400
But the South won't rise again

49
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,560
Racist fucks in Alabama

50
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,260
Bombed a church in Birmingham

51
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,580
Then they rotted in the slammer

52
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,440
When you fuck your next of kin

53
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,640
Go and tell your white trash friends

54
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,580
You lost before and you'll lose again

55
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,240
The South won't ever win

56
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,860
The South won't rise

57
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,920
The South won't rise

58
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,860
The South won't rise

59
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,840
The South won't rise again

60
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,460
The South won't rise again

61
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,740
Is from that one

62
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,760
We'll be hearing more of those

63
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,440
Later on in the show

64
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,020
The other album is called

65
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,360
Frop Music

66
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,860
And it's all instrumentals

67
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,120
The one in the background

68
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,000
Right now is called

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,320
Devil Horns

70
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,920
On the Forehead of Broderick Crawford

71
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,080
Ahead

72
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,340
We'll also be listening to some

73
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:48,580
Uh

74
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,720
Uh

75
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,000
Old synesthesia radio

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,140
With Dr. Hal

77
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,160
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave

78
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,600
And some puzzling evidence

79
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,720
Show from KPFA Berkeley

80
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,140
From the old days

81
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,820
The synesthesia show is from

82
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,840
WCSB

83
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,460
Cleveland

84
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,680
And uh

85
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,880
And some ancient fire sign theater

86
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,640
But now this

87
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,140
If only we could bring this

88
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,420
Uh

89
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:19,840
Special

90
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:19,840


91
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,600
Special understanding

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,300
To so many of our citizens

93
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,740
Who unknowing

94
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,220
Are searching in the dark

95
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,560
And thirsting for it

96
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,600
But these early days

97
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,080
Stang

98
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,360
Is staying counseled

99
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,740
For us

100
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,440
As you used it

101
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:30,960
To bring them

102
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,620
The message

103
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,020
I don't know

104
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,800
If this is still valid

105
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,740
In today's world

106
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,540
Of modern times

107
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,300
Well the first

108
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,820
Stangian orthodox

109
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,080
Fist temple

110
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,440
Of whatever it is

111
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,400
Is standing by

112
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,080
To leech away

113
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,440
Your vital essence

114
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,360
And turn it into

115
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,660
Solid blocks

116
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,540
Of subgenius understanding

117
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,140
Slack

118
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,780
Come on

119
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,900
From the barrel

120
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,640
Of a gun

121
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,200
Dave

122
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,480
The slack gun

123
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,960
Looks like one of these

124
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,680
I bet you wish

125
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,240
You had one of these

126
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,160
Slack guns

127
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,700
Like this one

128
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:57,900
See

129
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,740
Yeah

130
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,520
Pretty sharp huh

131
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,000
I can smell your guys

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,640
Pineal glands

133
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,680
All the way from out here

134
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,700
Fifty miles away

135
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,180
Oh I guess that's me

136
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm sorry

137
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,740
I'm slightly embarrassed

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,680
I'm not

139
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,040
I'm just in such an on

140
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,360
Cause I wanted you guys

141
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,500
To explain Dobbs town

142
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,720
And the good works

143
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,840
And cause it faded out

144
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,760
As I began to

145
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,060
Transflux

146
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,820
Well you're right

147
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,420
You know we practice

148
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,260
Accu-beating

149
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,580
And opening of the

150
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,380
Third nostril

151
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,060
To all inductees

152
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,620
But that's just

153
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,280
At the first few weeks

154
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,640
Of big boot camp

155
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,440
Afterwards comes

156
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,560
Hell month

157
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,800
Now the

158
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,180
The legends and rumors

159
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,160
About the balls

160
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,020
And vice grips

161
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,800
And the hazings

162
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,080
That's a bunch of

163
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,060
Propaganda for me

164
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,540
That's right

165
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,740
It's not nearly so hard

166
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,680
Benny enjoy it

167
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,340
And they come back

168
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,020
Again and again

169
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,300
To retake our

170
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,080
Slinky subgenius seminars

171
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,360
Well sadly

172
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,820
Some of us

173
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,300
Some of the propaganda

174
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,740
Is being recirculated

175
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,060
By various sectors

176
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,840
Of the church

177
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,860
Of the subgenius itself

178
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,200
But I wouldn't ask

179
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,100
You to direct yourself

180
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,660
To that

181
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,680
They're in the pockets

182
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,100
Of Time Warner

183
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,900
Clear Channel

184
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,680
And the Saturday

185
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,480
Evening Post

186
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,140
They're everywhere

187
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,300
They're everywhere

188
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:05,880
That's right

189
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,160
Just like the carpet

190
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,840
Under your feet

191
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,080
Or the nails

192
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,180
At the end of your fingers

193
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,940
Your little tin foil helmet

194
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,400
Ain't gonna keep them out

195
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,360
Yes pyramids won't do it

196
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,440
But my tin foil helmet

197
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,880
Has worked for an awful lot

198
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,820
Of the evil people

199
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,800
Things you've tried to do

200
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,020
You know playing with my mind

201
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,300
And stuff

202
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,020
It has helped

203
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,800
You have to remember

204
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,040
That

205
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,080
It doesn't have a self-destruct button

206
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,520
Like our helmets do

207
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,420
Well

208
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,900
That's another thing

209
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,460
In the hierarchy

210
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,380
How come you guys

211
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,840
Got better technology

212
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,680
Than the rest of us

213
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,940
Well we were there

214
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,920
When they passed out

215
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,380
The beans

216
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,460
Hmm

217
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,560
The

218
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,160
What

219
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,640
You mean

220
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,040
The multicolored beans

221
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,380
Well you plant them

222
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,280
In the backyard

223
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,060
At the full of the moon

224
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,420
Should we be giving away

225
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:45,920
This information

226
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,080
I think

227
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,780
Nobody's listening

228
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,300
Alright

229
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,280
Well it doesn't matter

230
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,080
You cast your beans

231
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,480
On the fertile earth

232
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,440
And the next day

233
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,920
There's a

234
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,260
Humongous big

235
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,380
Piece of crabgrass

236
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:56,860
Out there

237
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,740
With your name on it

238
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,040
Now um

239
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,620
I

240
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,160
Wouldn't give these

241
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,320
Special things

242
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,480
Go see my new movie

243
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,320
Terminator 3

244
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,880
And please go

245
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,480
Vote for me

246
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:05,800
Please

247
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,060
Now we see here

248
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,540
Listener censored radio

249
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,660
And still being interrupted

250
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,880
By public

251
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,500
Service

252
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,700
Announcements

253
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,220
That was

254
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,740
A local NPR affiliate

255
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,960
Well this

256
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,820
That's very annoying

257
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,020
That etches out

258
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,020
The inside of your ears

259
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,260
Yeah

260
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,080
I think it's

261
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,860
A form of cosmic relief

262
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,700
For the whole rest

263
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,440
Of the evacuation

264
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,220
You know

265
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,680
Mitigin

266
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,260
You guys have been

267
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,840
Sputing out

268
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,700
I mean some of it's

269
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,580
Right on the money

270
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,380
But the rest of it

271
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:30,860
Is just

272
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,200
To take your money

273
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,600
Well you know

274
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,280
You can't make an omelet

275
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,740
Without breaking a few eggs

276
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,400
Well you're like

277
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:37,720
Cracking skulls buddy

278
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:37,980
You can't control

279
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,180
Every aspect of

280
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,180
The way this is

281
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,020
Developed and

282
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,320
Promulgated

283
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,580
I'm with you

284
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,280
One hundred percent

285
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,060
It's just that

286
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,340
You know

287
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,540
I have the eyes

288
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,460
To see and the ears

289
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,080
To hear it

290
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,420
You know like

291
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,040
They used to say

292
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,480
In the old

293
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,420
And now you're

294
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,480
Looking through a glass

295
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,020
Darkly

296
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,540
Get some Windex

297
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,020
And get a better view

298
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,920
I've got 360 vision man

299
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,680
That's the best part

300
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,240
Of these helmets

301
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,920
I mean I'm not saying

302
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,460
It's keeping out

303
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,120
All the bad vibes

304
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,860
You guys are sending

305
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,520
Right now or anything

306
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,360
But I can still see

307
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,500
Behind my head

308
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,400
And you can see

309
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,900
In the dark

310
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,760
Without searching

311
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,080
Blindly in the dark

312
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,680
That's correct

313
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,880
And it's been

314
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,940
Very very valuable

315
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,080
For so many members

316
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,680
Of my family

317
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,660
Who keep losing me

318
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:16,920
Daily

319
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,280
Especially you know

320
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,820
After the sun

321
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,320
Goes down

322
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,160
They should let

323
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,720
Their fingers

324
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,520
Do the walking

325
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,020
Up your spine

326
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,840
Yeah I knew

327
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,160
You were going to

328
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,780
Talk about doing

329
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,740
That stuff to my spine

330
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:25,980
Again

331
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,260
Don't you know

332
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:27,580
Don't

333
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,600
I'm not going to

334
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,000
Forget it

335
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,560
Let's just put it

336
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:29,720
That way

337
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:29,980
You've got to release

338
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,160
The Kundalini energy

339
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,420
See there's

340
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,100
33 little bumps here

341
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,220
And after each one

342
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,920
Is tweaked

343
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,760
You'll feel like

344
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,900
A new being

345
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:39,700
Yeah

346
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,160
I have felt

347
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,900
Like a new being

348
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,280
Before

349
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,680
It hasn't done

350
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,180
Me any good

351
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,080
Well

352
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,140
You just don't

353
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,540
Have faith

354
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,300
You've got to have faith

355
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,020
And faith will move

356
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,400
Mountains

357
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,860
And molehills too

358
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,160
Every day

359
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,000
A new personality

360
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,500
Every time I wake up

361
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,280
A completely new

362
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,100
Different history

363
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,300
I'm getting really

364
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:56,640
Really

365
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,400
You know

366
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,860
Your name is Legion

367
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,260
You have a hundred

368
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:00,900
Zip codes

369
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,120
Have faith

370
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,480
And eat more prunes

371
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,000
Dave

372
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,600
Well

373
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,080
I'll give that a try

374
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,100
But no more

375
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,440
The Satanist hobo stuff

376
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,860
You know

377
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,740
My name is Legion

378
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,200
And everything

379
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,320
My name's not Legion

380
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,920
That sounds

381
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,340
You know

382
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,360
Well not most of the time

383
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:15,920
Let's take that

384
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,820
Other call there

385
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,680
Oh

386
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,260
The L stands for

387
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,020
Lumbar

388
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:22,980
Or

389
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,060
Converterbration

390
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,820
Hey uh

391
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,980
Dan, Jack and Jim

392
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,820
Go over to see Tim

393
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,720
Dan, Jack and Jim

394
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,000
Go on

395
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,700
Can I go

396
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,720
Can I borrow a toothbrush

397
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,660
To clean my shoes

398
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,180
You know

399
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,900
Once you guys

400
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,340
Like to buy

401
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,060
A bottle of long water

402
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,200
This isn't a lending library

403
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:37,700
Hello

404
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,360
No

405
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,260
Why do they all want

406
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,240
Special privileges

407
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,180
They all do

408
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,040
You know

409
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,300
And after all the years

410
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,780
That I've been

411
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,740
Sucking up to you guys

412
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,140
And stuff

413
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,060
How many have I got

414
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,340
Three

415
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,400
Well you see

416
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,500
Those who do

417
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,340
Don't receive

418
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,080
The benefits

419
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,920
And this is very

420
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,500
Ironic of those

421
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:55,980
Who simply

422
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,080
Lap up the cream

423
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,680
See back to

424
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,760
Perplexation again

425
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,280
This Buddhist type stuff

426
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,180
If I seek it

427
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,080
I will not find

428
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,160
If I sit down

429
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,040
I take a nap

430
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,080
Maybe it'll happen

431
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,800
And et cetera

432
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,180
You know

433
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,580
I don't know

434
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,020
I do lose my faith

435
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,700
Once in a while

436
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,780
Just gotta sit under

437
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,540
That fig tree

438
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,220
And uh

439
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,800
Concentrate

440
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,100
On the eternal

441
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,620
Infinite

442
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,620
Okay

443
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,140
But what does that

444
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,700
Really mean

445
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,140
Well it means

446
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,020
That there is

447
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,440
A universe of emptiness

448
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,600
Inside you

449
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,580
Oh man

450
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
Now that's not

451
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,220
What I feel

452
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,780
When I'm sticking

453
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,720
My hand down there

454
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,600
I mean

455
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,620
You got an amusement park

456
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,120
Inside

457
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,780
What

458
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,200
No but I have

459
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,220
A lot of misdirected

460
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,620
Hairs

461
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,440
And calloused

462
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,580
Calloused parts

463
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,620
College radio

464
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,820
And my name is

465
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,740
Actually Legion

466
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,560
Not Legion

467
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,260
I got scars

468
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,140
The size of

469
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,000
The same

470
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,120
And you put a bandaid

471
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,860
On that sucker

472
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,940
That's unsightly

473
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,780
Our listeners

474
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,460
Aren't interested

475
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,660
In your wounds

476
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,260
And uh

477
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,020
Oh my gosh

478
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,200
Lots and lots

479
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,020
And lots of

480
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,280
I've suffered these wounds

481
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,400
For Bob Dobbs

482
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,680
Much in the same way

483
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,920
To heal the inside of you

484
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,500
You know

485
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,640
I'll tell you one thing Dave

486
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,860
As long as we're talking here

487
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,320
Man to man

488
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,800
Chicks dig scars

489
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,420
You know what I'm talking about

490
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:06,880
Yeah

491
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,720
So those

492
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,760
Lumps and

493
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,500
Wounds

494
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,040
Lesions

495
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,120
Things that you're talking about

496
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,360
They

497
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,920
They help you along

498
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,980
They're chick magnets

499
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,620
Yeah

500
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,200
Exactly

501
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,880
I don't know that

502
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,160
I understand

503
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,420
On your refrigerator

504
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,100
So uh

505
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,720
Buck up

506
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,260
And uh

507
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,140
Pull yourself together

508
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:21,480
Uh

509
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,640
Things aren't as

510
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,840
Bad as they seem

511
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,240
And it's

512
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,460
Always darkest

513
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,500
Just before it goes

514
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,220
Completely

515
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,260
Pitch black

516
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,780
Oh yes dear friends

517
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,760
It seems like it was

518
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,800
Somehow easier

519
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,580
To do shows

520
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,780
Back when we had a

521
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,640
Radio station

522
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,680
To do them in

523
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,720
Uh

524
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,140
That's from

525
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,340
Dr. Sinister's show

526
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,620
On WCSB Cleveland

527
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,780
That still follows

528
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,640
The Hour of Slack

529
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,240
After like

530
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,020
Twenty years

531
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,640
I should call

532
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,220
That show

533
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,340
It's just that

534
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,300
I'm usually asleep

535
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,920
Or half asleep

536
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,560
By then

537
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,460
On Sundays

538
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,140
I've been doing

539
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,340
This weekly show

540
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,160
For thirty-six

541
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,220
Years friends

542
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,880
Almost two thousand

543
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,640
Episodes

544
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,380
And I was about

545
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,460
To write up a report

546
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,440
On how I've been

547
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,300
Slowing down

548
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,460
Because I have

549
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,260
The malaise

550
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,980
From my

551
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,520
Advancing arthritis

552
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,460
And declining

553
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,560
Motivation

554
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,540
And this

555
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,280
Dang chest

556
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,620
Concussion

557
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:15,920
And this

558
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:15,920


559
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,400
Which you may be

560
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:17,800
Able to hear

561
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,420
In my voice

562
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:19,960
It's been

563
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,840
Clinging on

564
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,420
Uh

565
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,520
But then I looked

566
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,120
At my email

567
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,840
And there was

568
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,720
The weekly

569
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Flat out

570
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,280
Donation

571
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,760
From

572
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,860
Listener

573
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,360
Reverend

574
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,480
John Flanagan

575
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,680
With the phrase

576
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,300
Thanks for

577
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,060
Hour of Slack

578
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,120
Pray Bob

579
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,800
And it's

580
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,400
Things like that

581
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,220
That motivate me

582
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,680
To go ahead

583
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,160
And try to

584
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,580
Throw together

585
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,480
A new show

586
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,280
Even if it's

587
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,980
Made of old

588
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,620
Parts

589
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,200
Largely

590
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,560
Instead of

591
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,020
Sitting on

592
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,560
The

593
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,180
Bed

594
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,060
Staring into

595
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,420
Space

596
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,280
Which has been

597
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,940
Getting easier

598
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,520
And easier

599
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,040
To do

600
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,840
There's another

601
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,680
Guy that sends

602
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,740
$130.13

603
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,420
Every month

604
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,980
And another

605
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,040
Guy that sends

606
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,440
$50 every month

607
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:00,820
And about

608
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,640
10 subscribers

609
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,500
Who actually

610
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,440
Pay five bucks

611
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:03,900
An episode

612
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,840
For each show

613
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,060
Otherwise

614
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,980
I think

615
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,560
I might be

616
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,200
Too tired

617
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,560
Of this

618
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,280
To even bother

619
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:09,800
To put out

620
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,500
A rerun

621
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,580
But knowing

622
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,040
There are

623
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,720
At least

624
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,880
20 listeners

625
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,060
That care that much

626
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,620
I'm not

627
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,260
Well now

628
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:16,860
I'd be a real

629
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,600
Woosh to quit

630
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,820
Now

631
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,740
Plus

632
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,640
X day

633
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,360
Is in a month

634
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,960
And after that

635
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,540
I won't have to

636
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,000
Worry about

637
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,620
Anything right

638
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,380
I'm gonna go

639
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:24,820
To Reverend

640
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,480
Zanthea's

641
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,060
Campground

642
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,580
In Florida

643
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,660
Land of

644
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:28,840
Lakes

645
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,240
Florida

646
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,860
And see

647
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,380
Lots of

648
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:30,740
Buddies

649
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,000
And that'll

650
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,320
Be my

651
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,920
First trip

652
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,380
Past

653
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:33,980
Granbury

654
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,420

655
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,020
In over

656
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,540
A year

657
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,080
Granbury's

658
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,560
Only 20

659
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,200
Miles away

660
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,260
But they

661
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,840
Have doctors

662
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,320
And box

663
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,740
Stores

664
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,100
And even

665
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,460
A movie

666
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:41,840
Theater

667
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,260
There

668
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,240
Heck

669
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,620
They even

670
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:43,940
Have an

671
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,280
Opry

672
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:44,620
House

673
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,860
Where I

674
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,120
Live

675
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,520
In Glen

676
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:47,880
Rose

677
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
There are

678
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,520
Two grocery

679
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:49,980
Stores

680
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,040
Two drug

681
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,600
Stores

682
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,260
Three banks

683
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,040
A dollar

684
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,400
Store

685
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,260
And about

686
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:54,740
A hundred

687
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,560
Churches

688
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,580
However

689
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,360
I like

690
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:58,820
It here

691
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,560
Cause there's

692
00:14:59,560 --> 00:14:59,960
A half

693
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,500
Mile of

694
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,260
Unspoiled

695
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,640
Woods

696
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,380
And creeks

697
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:02,900
Around my

698
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,180
House

699
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,620
In every

700
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,140
Direction

701
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,100
And a few

702
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,440
Houses

703
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,040
Occupied

704
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,400
By my

705
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,900
Siblings

706
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,720
And nephews

707
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,220
And a

708
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,940
Big herd

709
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,420
Of goats

710
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,120
But I

711
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,400
Think

712
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:12,780
During the

713
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,180
Last year

714
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,580
And a half

715
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:13,960
We've had

716
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,320
A grand

717
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,880
Total of

718
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,080
Five visitors

719
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,140
Luckily

720
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,060
Almost all

721
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,360
Of them

722
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,180
Were beautiful

723
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,080
Ladies

724
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,840
So there's

725
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,000
That

726
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,620
Also we've

727
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:23,980
Been seeing

728
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,920
Subgenius

729
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,560

Every Saturday

740
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,460
And ask

741
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:34,740
Dr.

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,060

And Puzlo

753
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,340
Evado

754
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,980
Via a

755
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,420

757
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,580
Now Onan's

758
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:48,980
Helping me

Old books

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,520
Out

763
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,940
Now nobody

764
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,880
In Glenrose

765
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,400
Texas

766
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,220
Knows who

767
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,920
Bob is

768
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,540
Except for

769
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,640
One subgenius

770
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,100
Who isn't

771
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,720
Related to

772
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:58,880
Me

773
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,560
And she's

774
00:15:59,560 --> 00:15:59,960
One of the

775
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,380
Beautiful

776
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:00,840
Ladies

777
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,500
That visits

778
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,120
Because I

779
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,700
Don't wear

780
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,280
Bob shirts

781
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,820
Around

782
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,540
My car

783
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:05,980

786
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,560
I don't

787
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:07,840
Want to

788
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,220
Get into

789
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,020
That conversation

790
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,580
Nobody

791
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,240
Knows about

792
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,760
The movie

793
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,280
Which

794
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,880
Reminds me

795
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,800
I haven't

796
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,160
Played the

797
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,560
Rest of

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,040
The soundtrack

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,860
Documentary

804
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,360
About us

807
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,180
Yet

808
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,520
So I'm

00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,020
About to

00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,380
Incidentally

811
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,760
It's no

812
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,440

818
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,160
But it's

822
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,260
Think

A whole

826
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,460
Bunch of

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:40,860
Other ones

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,840
Look at

833
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,780
Explains all

834
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,360
Of that

835
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,700

836
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,380

840
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,240
Not too

841
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,840
Dated

842
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,680

845
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,560

856
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,260
Never did

857
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:04,820
Know about

858
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,340
Church of

859
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,120
The subgenius

860
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,420
We

861
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,980
Never were

862
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,360
That big

863
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,140
It is

864
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,520
Kind of

865
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:11,940
Obscure

866
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,520
That keeps

867
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,020
It special

868
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,000
If everybody

869
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,620
Knew about

870
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:14,860
It

871
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,680
It would

872
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,280
Be normal

873
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,360
We were

874
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:18,800
Just too

875
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,280
Lazy

876
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:19,760
We didn't

877
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,160
Want to be

878
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,940
Responsible

879
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,400

Members

882
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,440
We just

883
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,040
Wanted to

884
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,960
Tap them

885
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,240
On the

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,780
Forehead

887
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,280
And say

00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,020
Wake up

889
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,160
And of

890
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,480
Course

891
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,640
Some people

892
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:30,980
You have

893
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,240
To hit

894
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,520
With a

895
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,140
Sledge hammer

896
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,340
And even

897
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:33,780
Then that

898
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,180
Doesn't

899
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,800
Do the

900
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,100
Trick

901
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,380
Or you

902
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:36,960
Can get

903
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,200
Them to

904
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,580
Wake for

905
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,120
A second

906
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,560
Or two

907
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,020
And then

908
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,960
They doze

909
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,600
Off again

910
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,460
As soon as

911
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:42,740

912
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,000

1022
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,560
We've

1023
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:43,620
Been

1024
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:43,920
Friends

1025
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,160
For A

1026
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,300
Long

1027
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:44,540
Time

1028
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,660
We're

1029
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:45,840
Living

1030
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,100
In A

1031
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,320
World

1032
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,520
That's

1033
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,000
Upside

1034
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,240
Down

1035
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,960
Trump

1036
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,200
Is

1037
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,320
The

1038
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,660
Perfect

1039
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,300
Example

1040
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,520
Now

1041
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,060
Of A

1042
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,340

1043
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:50,780
Turned

1044
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,200
Upside

1045
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,500
Down

1046
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,180
He's

1047
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,340
The

1048
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:53,680
Joker

1049
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:54,860
This

1050
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,040
Is

1051
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,200
A

1052
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,620
Special

1053
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,060
Year

1054
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,880
Our

1055
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,400
Country

1056
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:57,560
Is

1057
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:57,780
Doing

1058
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,300
Great

1059
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,660
We've

1060
00:18:59,660 --> 00:18:59,940
Got

1061
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:01,900
Surreal

1062
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,300
Unbelievable

1063
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,720
Shocking

1064
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,260
Psychedelic

1065
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,300
Covered

1066
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:08,540
With

1067
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:08,760
Reality

1068
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,260
Right

1069
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:09,440
Now

1070
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,900
It's

1071
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,100
Not A

1072
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,520
Good Place

1073
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:10,940
For Any

1074
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,320
Party

1075
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:11,560
To

1076
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,600
End Up

1077
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:12,920
With A

1078
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,500
Cult

1079
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:13,840
Like

1080
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,800
Situation

00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,540
Not

Weirder

Donald

Wins

1099
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,980
I

1100
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,260
Could

1101
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,520
Stand

1102
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:23,900
In The

1103
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,060
Middle

1104

Of Fifth

1105
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,600
Avenue

1106
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:24,960
And

1107
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,180
Shoot

1108
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,580
Somebody

1109
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:25,840
And

1110
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:25,940
I

1111
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,080
Wouldn

1112
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,360
Lose

1113
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:26,520
Any

1114
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:26,840
Voters

1115
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,140
Okay

1116
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,020
It's

1117
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,160
Very

1118
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,760
Effective

1119
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,000
To

1120
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,680
Slice

1121
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:31,780
The

1122
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:31,940
World

1123
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,220
Up

1124
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,480
And

1125
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:32,700
To

1126
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:38,920
The

1127
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:38,920


1128
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:38,920


1129
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,260
Is

1130
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:39,820
Killing

1131
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,140
Us

1132
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,260
The

1133
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:41,720
Crime

1134
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,580
And

1135
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:42,760
The

1136
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,200
Games

1137
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,700
And

1138
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:43,880
The

1139
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,360
Drugs

1140
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,120
We're

1141
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,000
Torn

1142
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,400
As

1143
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,760
Subgeniuses

1144
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,080
Because

1145
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,420
Of

1146
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:51,800
Course

1147
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,540
A

1148
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,560
Good

1149
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,760
Portion

1150
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:54,940
Of

1151
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,300
Our

1152
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,460
Viewpoint

1153
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:56,840
Is

1154
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,160
That

1155
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,480
The

1156
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,260
Conspiracy

1157
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,760
Is

1158
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,500
Out

1159
00:19:59,500 --> 00:19:59,620
Of

1160
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,020
Control

1161
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,620
In

1162
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,200
Fact

1163
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,440
To

1164
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:02,520
Our

1165
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:02,860
Horror

1166
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,960
Each

1167
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,700
Passing

1168
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:04,920
Day

1169
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,140
The

1170
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,420
World

1171
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,680
seems more and more subgenius.

1172
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,240
I've got highly-expected, all-natural, weight-loss age.

1173
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,840
The great story here is this vast right-wing conspiracy.

1174
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,640
There are many people that don't agree with that birth certificate.

1175
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,960
I can't trust Obama.

1176
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
He's an Arab.

1177
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,160
He is not...

1178
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,320
Everybody is in their own private Idaho.

1179
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,840
Everybody's in their own bubble.

1180
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,100
And all they do is go into a feedback loop

1181
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,780
where they can get things to reaffirm what they already think.

1182
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,380
This administration is trying to fool you into believing

1183
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,440
that the news the White House doesn't really like, well, is the news.

1184
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,360
Three million illegals voted.

1185
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,900
Where are you getting your information?

1186
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,540
The Soviet Union has a worldwide disinformation network.

1187
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,300
They go to media sites that incite them,

1188
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,840
that make them paranoid and worried and fretful about the future.

1189
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,540
They can't control the amount of breaks that are going on.

1190
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,080
Just because they're very rich

1191
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,020
doesn't mean they can rape you.

1192
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,860
They're racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic.

1193
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,200
I am no racist.

1194
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,040
You're voting for Donald Trump.

1195
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,660
None of them are interested in breaking out of the loop

1196
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,860
and realizing, oh, I've been doing, I've been programmed.

1197
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,060
Trump's derangement syndrome.

1198
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,400
Hatred of Donald Trump so intense that it impairs people's judgment.

1199
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,480
Like, if you quit being real humans and thinking for yourselves, it's over.

1200
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,580
This is your country.

1201
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:47,740
I don't know how you carve out a place for that kind of playful us and them

1202
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:53,720
in a place where the news is filling so many of those roles.

1203
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:00,960
That being said, I also couldn't have thought of the subgenius in 1978.

1204
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,400
So, obviously, they're better at this than I am.

1205
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,060
There's always going to be a conspiracy.

1206
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,760
It can morph, it can change, and it can evolve,

1207
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,640
and so can the Church of the Subgenius.

1208
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,020
We'll never fix the government.

1209
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,640
Like, we'll never get it to where everyone is happy.

1210
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,260
There will always be acrimony.

1211
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,960
And so, we desperately need comedy.

1212
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,480
Well, I think the best thing we can do is spread our message.

1213
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:37,080
And hope that it is useful in the coming crisis,

1214
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:43,520
which is descending on the planet and the human world that inhabits it.

1215
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,100
For the last 20 years, the only thing I had to do to make my half the mortgage payments

1216
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,040
is keep selling subgenius ministerships.

1217
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,940
And it occurred to me, wait a minute, this isn't a bad gig at all.

1218
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,560
Once a month, I have to sit here and assemble these things?

1219
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,680
Maybe spend half an hour a day taking them to the post office?

1220
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,060
That's not bad.

1221
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,240
People are still obviously getting a lot out of it.

1222
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,380
Just last week, I went to the post office,

1223
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,080
and there was this envelope there, postage due.

1224
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,440
I had to fork out $2.45 just to find out what was in this letter,

1225
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,920
and it had no return address on it.

1226
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,800
The postal guy said, well, I could just throw it away.

1227
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,380
I went, no, it's probably a joke, but it better be funny.

1228
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,680
I got home and opened it up.

1229
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,900
It had $1,000 in $20 bills in there, just out of the blue.

1230
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,500
I immediately took half of it to a sick person I know

1231
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,360
who cried with gratitude.

1232
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,500
It's like, no, we're not crazy to keep doing this.

1233
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,080
It really does come along at the right time for some people.

1234
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,320
Palmer, what happened to Philo?

1235
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,240
He's hiding.

1236
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,320
Oh, you guys look awful, but a lot better than I expected.

1237
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,000
Ar-ar-ar-ar.

1238
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,180
Price fog.

1239
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,900
Come on, welcome to Austin.

1240
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,980
This is sort of like a booze quest.

1241
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,540
Uh-oh, another human blockade.

1242
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,540
Look, there's something.

1243
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,540
There's a mermaid woman.

1244
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,460
A merwoman.

1245
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,820
It's you once you get your shirt off, honey.

1246
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,140
Oh, I thought it was for real.

1247
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,440
You first.

1248
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,220
I'll bet you if you take your clothes off, everybody here will follow you, dude.

1249
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,220


1250
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,840
It was just a sad, sad joke.

1251
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,140
Do it.

1252
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:03,700
No, no, no.

1253
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,180
If you took your clothes off, and I'll bet you anything this is true.

1254
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:07,760
I'm not a leader.

1255
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,060
I'm just a fast follower.

1256
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,000
If you were to do that, I'm the second guy in.

1257
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:18,180
To me, it's always been play.

1258
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,680
You go to a subgenius show, they're not waving their arms in anger.

1259
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,120
They might be pretending to.

1260
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,980
But that's the main thing you get, is laughter.

1261
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,300
And we're still just playing.

1262
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,500
This is Philo.

1263
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,080
I'm Philo.

1264
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,000
I've been Tony.

1265
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,380
This is Reverend Stang.

1266
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,460
Yeah, I'm a reverend.

1267
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,400
We're cult leaders.

1268
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,640
That's what we really are.

1269
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,700
Our real job is to be cult leaders.

1270
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,000
There you go.

1271
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,040
This will take you like a week and a half to read.

1272
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,580
It's called Church of the Subgenius.

1273
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,100
If you're not a genius, you probably qualify.

1274
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,580
Let me know.

1275
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,540
Is this like a talk show?

1276
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,700
If you feel different.

1277
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:07,020
And you feel oppressed by society's imposition of normalcy on you.

1278
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,280
You don't have to be that way.

1279
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,120
You can be the person that you want to be.

1280
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,080
We know that we think for ourselves.

1281
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,960
And that's more important than you thinking like me.

1282
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,420
I'll be sure to be asking you questions on the podcast.

1283
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:49,420


1284
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,460
Are you looking for me?

1285
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:51,600
where are you from?

1286
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:51,600


1287
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:51,620
You know me?

1288
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,380
Rachael Ny sparking yourself with the music track.

1289
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:52,380


1290
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,300
We just made an effort to bring you back to this wasn't a movie.

1291
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,720
閱

1292
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,100


1293
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,100


1294
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,220
All right.

1295
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,220


1296
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,220


1297
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,220


1298
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,220


1299
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,220


1300
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,220


1301
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,220


1302
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,220


1303
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,140
Bye.

1304
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,220
Bye.

1305
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:08,220
We were sapping with some Thunderbird wine and talked to head as nut head

1306
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,920
It's got two friends Chad and Fred, both of them are really just heads

1307
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,940
They got a room with a black lab poster and they both got their very own beds

1308
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,200
Chad and Fred, they're really just heads

1309
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,900
Chad and Fred like Portuguese bread and they always gotta be fed

1310
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:50,780
So I go to the bakery when the rooster crumbles and subsequently visit Ed Asner's head

1311
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,780
That's a good looking head

1312
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:31,140
Sometimes Chad and Fred are stubborn, they won't leave us alone

1313
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,580
They are the wampia

1314
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:38,180
Ed's head glares at Chad and Fred's heads and speaks in a very stern way

1315
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,180


1316
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,180


1317
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,180


1318
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,180


1319
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:46,140
Chad and Fred roll out of their beds and leave with a Portuguese bread

1320
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:53,800
Now at last I've got plenty of time to talk to Ed Asner's head

1321
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,560
So what do you do when you're feeling so low that you think you'd rather be dead?

1322
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,740
What do you say when the landlord's knocking and humanity fills you with dread?

1323
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,560
Cussing and spitting won't get you nowhere, remember what I said

1324
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:36,440
Drop a hundred micrograms of LSD and talk to Ed Asper's head

1325
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,280
Ed, you gotta find it for me, I'm looking here

1326
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:23,640
And that was Ed Asner's Head, a song I needed to cheer me up this very day.

1327
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:34,180
And by the Rudy Schwartz Project, old Waldo and Gunther are old friends of mine, actually.

1328
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,020
They used to live in Austin.

1329
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,180
A long, long time ago.

1330
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,600
Now live in Canada.

1331
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,280
Where they get much better medical treatment, by the way.

1332
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,060
Much more affordable and generally more advanced.

1333
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,400
Isn't that funny?

1334
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,360
You wouldn't know it to listen to the AM talk shows these days, would you?

1335
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,640
And now this.

1336
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,060
Some more reading from the Dobbs Town Mirror.

1337
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,120
Published by Dr. Onan Kanobai.

1338
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,160
Now of Columbus, Indiana.

1339
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,100
Isn't that strange?

1340
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,440
He left Portland.

1341
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,220
Why would anybody leave a peaceful town like Portland?

1342
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,640
And this issue, I might add, is dedicated to Reverend Just John,

1343
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,860
whose music I used to play on this show.

1344
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,580
And his music is in a lot of my music videos of microbes.

1345
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,720
Or my microbe videos.

1346
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,980
My YouTube channel.

1347
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,340
RevStang.

1348
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,320
Yeah, he died last year.

1349
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,000
He was kind of old and in bad health.

1350
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,580
We also lost Reverend Rock Roswell even more recently.

1351
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,600
But I ain't dead yet.

1352
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,600
Convenience personified.

1353
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,140
Why do chefs wear shades?

1354
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,580
Chef hats?

1355
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,720
Most people will try to come up with some kind of functional reply.

1356
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,180
An origin story.

1357
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:18,220
But the answer is to identify themselves as chefs.

1358
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:25,160
The teleological heresy, creationism, is everywhere when you know how to look for it.

1359
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,460
When someone you don't like does something you don't like, it shows how evil they are.

1360
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,400
And when they do something you like, it shows how clever they are.

1361
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,180
Anything as long as you get to retain your own self.

1362
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:38,180


1363
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:38,180


1364
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,080
And that's why you need to have a chef hat.

1365
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:44,200
A chef hat is a hat that identifies to everybody else you like and who you don't like.

1366
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:52,840
I do not argue for hatlessness, but I suggest there's more slack to be had if you can switch out those hats now and again.

1367
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,580
Instead of identifying the good and the wicked, say,

1368
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,780
I prefer it and see what happens.

1369
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,220
As Charles Fort said in Wild Talents,

1370
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,160
I conceive of nothing in religion, science or religion.

1371
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,160


1372
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,160


1373
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:13,140
I believe in a philosophy that is more than the proper thing to wear for a while.

1374
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,940
What is the subgenius?

1375
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,420
Or what does it mean?

1376
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:49,000
It means a shell that's like 95 million miles away from you.

1377
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,260
I am gently on the baby's behind.

1378
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,800
It means it's the same as having a baseball glove radar strapped to your butt.

1379
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,660
I think you got it. I think you got it.

1380
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,240
It's like, Bob Dobbs, huh?

1381
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,840
Bob Dobbs, huh? Huh?

1382
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:04,780
What?

1383
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,320
Sure.

1384
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:08,680
I can't forget.

1385
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,040
A subgenius must have slack.

1386
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:17,260
Of all other things, a subgenius must have slack.

1387
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,780
That is the motivator for the subgenius.

1388
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,300
So if you're one that has felt like you needed this thing,

1389
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,380
that you didn't know how to explain what it was,

1390
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,500
and yet there it was,

1391
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,640
Because of the subgenius, huh?

1392
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,560
completing you.

1393
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,100
What is that?

1394
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,240
Well, it makes you jump five or ten inches higher, that's for sure.

1395
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,960
The subgenius must have slack, but in order to get the slack,

1396
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,100
So clip those coupons.

1397
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,220
the subgenius must disengage from the conspiracy and be under his own genius.

1398
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,160
Voltaire said,

1399
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,980
We shall leave the world as foolish and wicked as we found it.

1400
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:01,800
Only the church of the subgenius can guarantee to leave the world far, far more foolish than when we found it.

1401
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,980
If the sole function of language was to communicate,

1402
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,240
then we'd have one language.

1403
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,140
We have more than one language, therefore we have more than a sole function.

1404
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,780
What other functions might there be?

1405
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,000
To exclude, to not communicate?

1406
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:25,920
This explains many languages, and language dialects, and within dialects, slang.

1407
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,740
So young people and old people can exclude each other.

1408
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:35,340
Now, is the sole function of the internet to communicate?

1409
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,220
Is the sole function of your religion to get commune?

1410
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,280
This is the golden age of literacy.

1411
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:50,660
Never before have so many written and read for their own pleasure.

1412
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:55,260
It just turns out that for many people their pleasure is

1413
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:01,220
sermonizing, scolding, tattling, bullying, and cats.

1414
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,220
Lots of cats.

1415
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,240
Cats are fine.

1416
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,320
My pleasure, says Onan, is reminding the listener to

1417
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,060
JOIN THE CHURCH OF THE SUBGENIUS!

1418
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,380
And now this.

1419
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,480
Lies up, you sinners and capers of pasta gold!

1420
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,500
Clench your pitchfork with bulging veins!

1421
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,100
The world will respect you when you are moist!

1422
00:36:53,980 --> 00:37:02,240
And the glands of the respected

1423
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,200
are the bones of the dead!

1424
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,180
You are surely more salient

1425
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:10,000
than the horses in that barn on the edge of your lips!

1426
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,900
Take this message to Walter Cronkite

1427
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,760
so that he might enjoy his lunch!

1428
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,020
Take him the glowing sector of the finest cheese!

1429
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,280
Ask him to become a card-carry member!

1430
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,660
And stroke his bloated ego

1431
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,600
on bended knee!

1432
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,120
He is to them no logitimacy!

1433
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,640
Bombardier beetles squirt boiling anal chemicals

1434
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,660
to make frogs vomit.

1435
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,660
Wot's the bombadier?

1436
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,360
But let's not dwell on unpleasantries.

1437
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,520
After all, it's already Thursday

1438
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,440
and we haven't planned next week's dinner engagement.

1439
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,220
I wish Uncle Tom-Tom hadn't bought that lawn bar

1440
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:04,200
after three months has harmed so many of us

1441
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,780
and nobody has the nerve to complain.

1442
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,260
So rise up, noosinners!

1443
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,940
Let's prepare the frosted moon!

1444
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,140
You know how much we've brewed

1445
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,440
as the time draws near!

1446
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,000
And in all this excitement,

1447
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,280
no one should be left behind!

1448
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,200
Why, there's even some room in that flipped-down rumble!

1449
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,240
And the rumble seat for beautiful Maisie Clementine

1450
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,400
with her pretty little pink taffeta ruffled blouse

1451
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,900
and her corn liquor decanter.

1452
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,820
We're set!

1453
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,800
She is sitting on the roof of the snow-covered good right here!

1454
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,180
We're set!

1455
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,060
She is sitting on the roof of the snow-covered good right here!

1456
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,160
We're set!

1457
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,580
She is sitting on the roof of the snow-covered good right here!

1458
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,900
We're set!

1459
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:06,900


1460
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,640
More Rudy Schwartz Project.

1461
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,360
Rise Up You Sinners is the name of that one.

1462
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,780
And yes, that was me heard in the mix.

1463
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,880
I only recorded that last week

1464
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,940
and emailed it to him.

1465
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,860
I got back two entire albums.

1466
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,200
Two albums in WAVE format.

1467
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,500
A week later, today.

1468
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,540
Beyond fairness,

1469
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,280
it is more effective to make peace with the gods

1470
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,780
when you're the one selecting which gods to make peace with.

1471
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:45,480
By means of the Short-Guration Personal Savior

1472
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,240
or Shordurper Sav method

1473
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,000
patented by J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1474
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,480
you can have any number of highly contradictory belief systems

1475
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,900
or objects of devotion

1476
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,120
with all sincerity and piety,

1477
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,220
simultaneously and instantaneously.

1478
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,960
And when the need or whim arises,

1479
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,080
you may cast them out.

1480
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,740
Be religious, not spiritual.

1481
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,660
The Church of the Subgenius believes every part of every religion.

1482
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,360
If you are in any other faith,

1483
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,740
either you're entirely right and everybody else is entirely wrong,

1484
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,360
or the opposite.

1485
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,860
But if you're a subgenius,

1486
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,180
you automatically get it right every time.

1487
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,780
It's win-win, Bob.

1488
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,520
Stenders by are operating now.

1489
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,280
Thank you, the Dobbstown Mirror.

1490
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,200
And thank you, the Rudy Schwartz Project

1491
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,440
for the background music from the album FROP Music,

1492
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,280
which is kind of funny because

1493
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,180
I don't think he actually frops.

1494
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,280
Or they, they, I mean.

1495
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,660
I don't mean Joe Newman.

1496
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,160
I mean, Walt Disney.

1497
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,860
I mean, Walter and Gunther and them.

1498
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,020
And all the Egyptians

1499
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,820
digged round about the river

1500
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,040
for water to drink.

1501
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,860
But they could not drink of the water of the river.

1502
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,000
Men shrink from tasting

1503
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,320
human beings' thirst after water.

1504
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,120
And what does natural history tell us?

1505
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,220
Destructions, dear friends,

1506
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,040
are things on Earth.

1507
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,180
Destructions not of all at once,

1508
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,920
but of a very large number

1509
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,160
are attributed by it to two principal causes.

1510
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,680
The tremendous onslaughts of fire and water.

1511
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,260
These two visitations, we are told,

1512
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:39,340
descend in turns after very long cycles of years.

1513
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,540
When interviewed, Los Angeles police chief Ed Davis said,

1514
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,840
when the agent is the conflagration,

1515
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,680
a stream of heaven-sent fire pours out from above

1516
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,480
and spreads over many places

1517
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,400
and overruns great regions.

1518
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,380
But the uninspired,

1519
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,040
the unhabited Earth.

1520
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,100
George, George, that's beautiful.

1521
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,300
I have been reading all the things that happened long ago

1522
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,060
when the sun stood still

1523
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,380
and David and Goliath and Daniel with the lion's den

1524
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,780
and the story of Ruth and the fall of Jericho.

1525
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,320
A lot of things happened in your days.

1526
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,160
Yours truly, Joe.

1527
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,660
Thou who walk'st in the sky

1528
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,120
with splendor and terror,

1529
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,340
king of battle.

1530
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:17,960
Let it go.

1531
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,640
The raging fire god.

1532
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,660
God Nergal.

1533
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,200
Nergy.

1534
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:22,780
Nergy.

1535
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,940
Your dog Nergy?

1536
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,120
Nergy, the dreaded Nergy,

1537
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,840
fire dog of the Venusians.

1538
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,000
Hey, hey, Nergs, did you hear that?

1539
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,180
I'll read it, I'll read it some more.

1540
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,140
Okay, Nergy, sit up now.

1541
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,740
Nergy, the fire star,

1542
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,860
comes like a raging storm.

1543
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,600
He is also called Sharapu,

1544
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:42,380
the burner and light that flames from heaven

1545
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,600
and lord of destruction.

1546
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,300
And Farnod the Flatulent, too.

1547
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,400
That's Nergy also.

1548
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,760
Nergy was the god during like pre-Babylonian times

1549
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,620
when the Babylonians were just beginning to,

1550
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,640
as we say in natural history now here

1551
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,660
at the Groucho Marx University,

1552
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,580
getting it together.

1553
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,620
During the Assyrian getting kind of,

1554
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,840
the Assyrian groovy period,

1555
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,240
the great god Nergy was known to fly over the people and...

1556
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,480
Oh, good, I'm glad you got that fish.

1557
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,880
The great god Nergy was known to fly over large areas

1558
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,880
of the Sumerian desert and flatulate.

1559
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,780
Flatulate is an astronomical expression,

1560
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,480
meaning growing flat like a cod across the solar eclipse.

1561
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,280
Like a piece of cod.

1562
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:23,600
Like a piece of cod.

1563
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,160
Like a piece of cod.

1564
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:24,680
Like a cod.

1565
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,000
Like a piece of cod.

1566
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,860
Like the old, there was the old Babylonian,

1567
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,460
you know, beginning myth that the whole earth

1568
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,940
was not a bowl turned upside down,

1569
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,260
but a cod piece raised by its experience.

1570
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,240
And that holes in it,

1571
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,100
because of the bleach used on the material,

1572
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,960
would let through the light from the living room.

1573
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,180
And the Babylonians then thought of this as god, basically.

1574
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Adventures in Cosmology.

1575
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,900
Hello, dear friends.

1576
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,460
I'm Louis P. Illuminato,

1577
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,920
president of the United Snakes of a Miracle.

1578
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,920
Let's talk about cosmology and its future for you.

1579
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,960
Cosmology is a budding young industry

1580
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,140
in the United Snakes' ever-expanding,

1581
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,820
faceplate mechanized industry.

1582
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:11,680
What's that?

1583
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,220
What's that, Louis?

1584
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,920
Cosmology holds great futures for the youths of tomorrow.

1585
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,160
What is this echo?

1586
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:19,800
Is this echo?

1587
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,380
Dear God, if you are so smart,

1588
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,300
let's see if you can read what I am saying.

1589
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,820
It's in my own code and no one knows it.

1590
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:39,480
If you can read it, make it rain tomorrow,

1591
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,940
so I will know.

1592
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,500
Your unknown friend, Gabe.

1593
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,780
Dear Gabe, this is Louis P. Illuminato.

1594
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,980
God, president of the United Snakes of a Miracle.

1595
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,460
Let's talk about your question.

1596
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,820
But first, how about this sound effect?

1597
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,120
God, or Louis P. Illuminato,

1598
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,120
knew that within the next few minutes he would have to fight.

1599
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,600
As he crossed the porch of the Royal Flush

1600
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,400
ahead of the sheriff and two deputies,

1601
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,060
he slipped his hand beneath his buckskin jacket

1602
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,780
and grinned the anger of a knife.

1603
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,620
He knew there would be no chance to draw the rifle

1604
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,780
from its scabbard on the street.

1605
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:19,900
He knew that the scabbard would be

1606
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,340
on the side of scouts.

1607
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,240
He would have to depend entirely on the knife

1608
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,020
in a fight against three men.

1609
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,540
Each of them was well armed.

1610
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,500
Hey, hey, hey.

1611
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,940
That poet's got a knife.

1612
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:32,680
Watch out.

1613
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,880
Hello, dear friends.

1614
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,580
I'm Ernest P. Illuminato,

1615
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,600
chief poet and president

1616
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,720
of the United Snakes of a Miracle.

1617
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,220
Hi, Ernie.

1618
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,140
Hi, Peter.

1619
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,580
No, forget it.

1620
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,180
No, it's all right.

1621
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:44,580
It's all right.

1622
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,000
I wanted your autograph, but I know you can't.

1623
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,640
Oh, look, I'm just a plain guy.

1624
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,120
A hundred million people would ask for it.

1625
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,280
Just because I'm God, Pete,

1626
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,520
doesn't mean I'm not human.

1627
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,580
I can dig it.

1628
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,600
God has to get up and put on one pants at a time, right?

1629
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,260
One leg at a time through the universe.

1630
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,760
God's just a guy like you and me.

1631
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,300
You know, you want to hear the greatest,

1632
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,720
the greatest and the latest from God's laboratory?

1633
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:03,380
What?

1634
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,660
Where all the little elves are working?

1635
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:05,040
Yeah.

1636
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:05,920
Well, I'll tell you.

1637
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,360
We got a plan going now in God's workshop.

1638
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,560
There's a guy in there who's got a plan

1639
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,460
to kill all the paranoids.

1640
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,400
Oh, no, really?

1641
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:13,900
Yeah.

1642
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,700
Isn't that a great idea?

1643
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,720
What about the horizontals?

1644
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,520
Anything about them?

1645
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:16,660
No.

1646
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,440
Nothing about them.

1647
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:17,620
Anything about them?

1648
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:17,620


1649
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,220
No, sirree.

1650
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:18,800
Let them lie.

1651
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,380
Let them lie.

1652
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,120
Let them ascend.

1653
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:20,980
Well, that's beautiful.

1654
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,120
Let it go, dear friend.

1655
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,740
Let it go.

1656
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,700
Let it go.

1657
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,920
Oh, you got to let it go, dear friends.

1658
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,240
Before we talk about your future,

1659
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,220
we've got to talk about your way of getting there.

1660
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,440
And you're talking about transportation,

1661
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,100
and that's God's language, friends.

1662
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,480
That's where God steps in to help you get there.

1663
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:37,280
Here's a beautiful 1964 Duster.

1664
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,440
It's a beautiful chariot.

1665
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,940
It'll get you all the way, friends.

1666
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,340
$1,449.

1667
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,320
Isn't that right?

1668
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,020
Louis P. Illuminata, President of the United States.

1669
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,200
This is your captain speaking.

1670
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,640
We are approximately 14 feet above Cairo at this moment.

1671
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,560
14 feet?

1672
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,080
Wait a minute.

1673
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:01,500
Captain, this is Louis P. Illuminata, President of the world and God.

1674
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,320
Am I talking to God now?

1675
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,380
Yes, this is it, Dave.

1676
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,500
I wish I could see you, God, at a time like this.

1677
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,920
Well, why don't you point the plane up a little bit?

1678
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,140
Drive out sleep.

1679
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,200
The books and pamphlets sold by the Subgenius Foundation

1680
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:17,620
can be found at www.subgenius.com.

1681
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:17,680
If you want to read one of the books in the book,

1682
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:17,680


1683
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:17,680


1684
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:17,680


1685
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,520
And it can literally be used to make a wish.

1686
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,600
Not just one wish, either,

1687
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,740
but as many wishes as you like.

1688
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,260
Simply purchase said items,

1689
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,360
hold them in your hands,

1690
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,720
and make a wish.

1691
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,480
Results vary.

1692
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:40,360
If you've ever tried to dig the empty part out of a hole,

1693
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,140
you know what it's like to take the rules literally

1694
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,000
and not seriously.

1695
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:47,620
If you're going to look out from the door

1696
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:47,620


1697
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:47,620


1698
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:47,620


1699
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:47,620


1700
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:47,620


1701
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,440
If you've ever felt low and asked, what's the point?

1702
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,080
Like I was this morning.

1703
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,900
That must mean that among all the possible points there could be, one of them is this.

1704
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,100
Your point is to feel low.

1705
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,680
If that's objectionable to you, good.

1706
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:11,220
That must mean you have a better point in mind in the future.

1707
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,000
A future.

1708
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,600
You've just talked yourself into something interesting.

1709
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,700
Find where that'll take you next.

1710
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:20,980
No hurry.

1711
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:24,500
It took all your life to get to merely now.

1712
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,560
Yes.

1713
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,700
When is there going to be another revival?

1714
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,400
Ah, when is there going to be another revival?

1715
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,860
Hopefully around November 14th.

1716
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,520
Around November 14th.

1717
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,980
Keep watching the area.

1718
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:38,900
What'd you say?

1719
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,720
And the location?

1720
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,480
What would the location be?

1721
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:46,400
Let's look through the mists of time and see what the location of the revival is.

1722
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:46,740
Could it be?

1723
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,420
Because there's no more you.

1724
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,080
The Tavern.

1725
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,100
The Beachland Ballroom?

1726
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,000
Yeah, I had fond memories.

1727
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,580
Actually, the first revival I ever went to.

1728
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,520
The Beachland Ballroom.

1729
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:52,780
Yeah.

1730
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,400
Was it the Beachland Tavern?

1731
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,240
The Beachland Tavern.

1732
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,620
The little old tavern on the beach.

1733
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,340
Wonderful.

1734
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,320
Well, good to know.

1735
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:00,660
All right.

1736
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,740
Death before dishonors, drugs before lunch.

1737
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,020
Later.

1738
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:03,660
I do.

1739
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,080
That's right.

1740
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,140
Enjoy a work-free drug place.

1741
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,280
Yeah, actually, it's kind of funny.

1742
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,500
We actually transmitted some information, and it feels kind of good, you know?

1743
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:11,780
It does feel good.

1744
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,800
I feel a little bit cleaner now.

1745
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:13,560
It feels really good.

1746
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:17,020
The first revival I ever went to, actually, was at the Euclid Tavern.

1747
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,820
And I had a pretty good night, actually.

1748
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,140
I got picked up that night.

1749
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,400
Well, you know, Euclid looked on Beauty Bear.

1750
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,120
What did you get picked up for?

1751
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,040
Not picked up for.

1752
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,220
Picked up by...

1753
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:33,760
He was picked up for indolence, intransigence, and inefficiency.

1754
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,360
It was kind of crazy, actually.

1755
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,280
I never expected...

1756
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,040
You see, it really works, folks.

1757
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,620
...that I'll promise to join our church, and you will get laid.

1758
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,560
It really does happen.

1759
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,260
I never expected that to be true.

1760
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,540
We offer benefits...

1761
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:46,680
And it wasn't true.

1762
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,000
No.

1763
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,220
...that no other religion can provide.

1764
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,140
I can show you too many details.

1765
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:51,600
I know.

1766
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,340
You have read the literature.

1767
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:53,600


1768
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,680
And the pleasure saucers, and you do follow the controversy.

1769
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,660
Y'all boys are wild.

1770
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,800
I've been listening in.

1771
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:01,540
You guys...

1772
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,940
You guys are special.

1773
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:03,680
Thank you.

1774
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,080
Wow.

1775
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,220
We're special.

1776
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,900
Yes, they call me Special Ed.

1777
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,640
We're special.

1778
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:11,780
Wow.

1779
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:15,200
That made my night, to have a total stranger say that we're special, actually.

1780
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:15,980
Well, we are.

1781
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:16,560
I wish...

1782
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,560
We're each and every one of us.

1783
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,240
I wish we could do the...

1784
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,420
I don't think you need to be here.

1785
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,480
I think y'all know already.

1786
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,140
I think y'all know you're special.

1787
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,900
Just don't lose your specialness on this special evening.

1788
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,420
We are all special.

1789
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:35,680
Oh, yeah.

1790
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,400
We are all special.

1791
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,720
I'll have the special, too.

1792
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,920
I ordered the special.

1793
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,380
You ordered the special today, too?

1794
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,720
I ordered the special, yes.

1795
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,840
I'm still waiting.

1796
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:45,300
Hmm.

1797
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,140
We are all special.

1798
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,940
First of all, we are all each one part of this whole universe.

1799
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:52,800
We'll have two more specials.

1800
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,200
And the universe will not be the same if one of us dies right now.

1801
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,620
Just concentrate on the pure, bright, white light of imbecility.

1802
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:04,760
Actually, I maintain that the birth of any person diminishes the value of all other persons.

1803
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,060
Particularly the lower birth.

1804
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,080
Always try to get the upper birth.

1805
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,300
Because, you know, it's just a matter of supply and demand.

1806
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,660
Or the afterbirth.

1807
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,560
We had that special show on Ant-Man's birthmarks.

1808
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:14,560


1809
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,280
You can make it nice and sweet.

1810
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:15,280


1811
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:15,280


1812
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:15,280


1813
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,580
Oh, vivid technicality.

1814
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,440
Okay, 7 billion people on Earth.

1815
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:21,880
How much is that per person?

1816
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:22,880
How much is life worth?

1817
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,860
$29.95.

1818
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,320
I don't know.

1819
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,680
What is the global per capita income on average?

1820
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,980
That's something I never see.

1821
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,160
Like, you know, you see it for countries.

1822
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,180
But I wonder what it is globally.

1823
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,760
And can that even be a measure of the...

1824
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,280
Well, I don't know.

1825
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,720
Basically, it's just a supply and demand issue.

1826
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:38,440
Human life...

1827
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,140
Isn't that what we said last night?

1828
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,680
Think globularly.

1829
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,440
Act loco.

1830
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:43,860
Oh, yes.

1831
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,920
I think the supply of human lifestyle is the demand.

1832
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:49,700
I'm sorry, cut.

1833
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,120
Speak up.

1834
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,640
What if you're a person who's special and it's really a demand for you?

1835
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,560
Oh, man.

1836
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,600
That's something...

1837
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,640
You know, some people are not that special.

1838
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,120
Yeah.

1839
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,160
And there ain't no demand for them.

1840
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,560
But if you're special, you gotta be more valuable.

1841
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,900
Because it's a demand for you.

1842
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:04,720
Yeah.

1843
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,440
Well, then you have to spread the specialness around

1844
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,520
into every crack and crevice and crevice.

1845
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,700
Every crack and crevice.

1846
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,460
Buttered up with specialness.

1847
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,280
Oh, yeah.

1848
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,980
The supply of life outweighs the demand.

1849
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,780
Too many people are following the story of Onan

1850
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,300
and not letting their seeds spill

1851
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,220
because they don't want to piss off God.

1852
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,480
Pulling out does not work.

1853
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,920
Because, you know, God laid the smackdown on Onan

1854
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,100
after he pulled out.

1855
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:30,980
You know, all he's doing is...

1856
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,840
50 million pregnant Catholic teenagers can't be wrong.

1857
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,680
He's practicing...

1858
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,820
Unless they're talking about pulling out.

1859
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:39,360
He's practicing contraception, not self-abuse.

1860
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,760
So Onan is tarred with the brush right from the start.

1861
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,860
He's unfairly charged with a crime he did not commit,

1862
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:52,760
although there was reason for God to be quite angry with him.

1863
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:57,440
And to hurl a thunderbolt which reduced him to a tiny grease spot

1864
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,220
in the margins of the Bible.

1865
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,660
God f***s us all in the end.

1866
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:03,940
There we go.

1867
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,740
Those seven magically malign words.

1868
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,080
But that's what they say.

1869
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,340
It hurts, too.

1870
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:14,360
It is painful to come into this world and painful to leave it.

1871
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,520
And in a blaze of irritable ouchness, we live our lives.

1872
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:20,960
That's true.

1873
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,820
Unless you die in your sleep.

1874
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:27,660
Well, we can't sleep now, but we can answer your questions

1875
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,980
if you want to call in, and we'll do our best to tell you

1876
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,880
the answers to the things that are troubling you.

1877
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,380
We've got a panel of experts up here.

1878
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,800
Any question...

1879
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,220
A church service...

1880
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:38,880
Is possible.

1881
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,580
There is no question off-limits.

1882
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,820
Provided by this radio station and the Church of the Subgenius.

1883
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,560
Just think any question.

1884
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:52,120
For example, you might want to know how much the earth weighs or something like that.

1885
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,400
So just call in and we'll tell you.

1886
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,280
I think we're going to take another call here.

1887
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,820
I'll show you my bacon.

1888
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,460
I have a question.

1889
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:02,920
Ask your question.

1890
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,680
How much does Bob weigh?

1891
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,640
Ooh, how much does Bob weigh?

1892
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,980
There's a question for you, Dr. Howell.

1893
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,180
Can Bob lift...

1894
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,060
Make himself...

1895
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,240
So fat that he cannot lift himself.

1896
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:17,760
I think that...

1897
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,680
I'm going to guess before you answer.

1898
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,220
Well, all right.

1899
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,100
You're welcome to do that.

1900
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:21,560
Guess Bob's weight.

1901
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:26,920
My guess is that Bob travels at the speed of light,

1902
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,680
and therefore his mass is infinite.

1903
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:35,280
Well, if Bob were to do that, yes, but we're talking about Bob at rest.

1904
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,800
Oh, look, the collar hung up.

1905
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,600
I was going to say 265 pounds, too.

1906
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,500
Well, that's just one of those mysteries.

1907
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,340
Who's still with us?

1908
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:45,580
I'm here.

1909
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:49,600
We're having a signal interruption, a little bit of difficulty.

1910
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:55,900
You see, part of Bob's makeup is heavy matter from extrasolar planets,

1911
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,780
which, like deuterium, is quite compressed,

1912
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,980
like the heart of a neutron star.

1913
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,320
But a far more significant puzzle in the annals of the subgenius

1914
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,100
is the search for the missing artifact,

1915
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,800
the holy grail of the Church of the Soul Genius,

1916
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,000
the scissors of sight.

1917
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,580
What we need is to locate the famous scissors of sight,

1918
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,660
and we are stumped since the true scissors have been lost to mutant kind for many centuries.

1919
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,540
In a private letter, Reverend Ivan Stang, I will now quote him, said,

1920
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,400
No man today has those scissors.

1921
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:36,580
He also said that the scissors were most likely created from the remains of a huge Atlantean crystal,

1922
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:43,160
the misuse and subsequent explosion which caused that continent to sink with a watery splash.

1923
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:43,980
Vindica.

1924
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:43,980


1925
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:51,900
The Atlanteans were the most important contributors to the gene pool that eventually produced the subgenius race.

1926
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,340
It does seem plausible that rather than trying to rebuild the lost empire,

1927
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,360
the remaining Atlanteans would instead build a few power icons,

1928
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:04,620
before tragically diluting their seed, like Onan,

1929
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:10,300
by crossbreeding with ancient pink human slave tribes they themselves had helped to create.

1930
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:13,660
It is from this distant epoch, 80 to 79,

1931
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:14,580
9 million BC,

1932
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:20,380
that the scissors and many other powerful but little-known sure-dur-per-saves originate.

1933
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,420
I hope you have been satisfied by this answer to your question.

1934
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:29,860
Correlation is not causality, but coincidence is conspiracy.

1935
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,620
What's the difference?

1936
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,940
Whether it brings you slack or takes away your slack.

1937
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,040
That's what it says here in the Dobstown Mirror.

1938
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,340
And I better check off the ones that I...

1939
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:43,760
read.

1940
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,540
Because I...

1941
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,580
I'm getting old. I can't remember what all I've said and what I haven't said.

1942
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:54,900
This pen doesn't work for hooey. It works about as well as my fingers.

1943
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,560
Okay, all right, okay.

1944
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,180
Price Bob.

1945
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,440
This has been the hour of slack number 1833.

1946
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,440
From the Church of the Subgenius, and you can get more information.

1947
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:12,860
I mean all the information you could possibly want from

1948
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,740
subgenius.com

1949
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:22,280
And if you want to mail us something or get something from us by mail, our address is

1950
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,380

or

1952
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:27,740
Ivan Stang

1953
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,940
Or the Smiths

1954
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,620
at post office box

1955
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:35,760
807

1956
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,600
Glen Rose, Texas

1957
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,780
76043

1958
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,700
And we'll see you in the next video.

1959
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,080
Praise Bob.

Yes dear friends that was the swinging love Corpses

1965
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:42,840
Closing the show out there. Give me back my phone

1966
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:50,400
thing I got my fun thing back that was my old buddy dr. Philo Drummond on

1967
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,540
vocals with his brother and cousin also in the band the swinging love corpses

1968
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:07,860
man that was a great band and we're still around and so I can put the show

1969
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:18,300
