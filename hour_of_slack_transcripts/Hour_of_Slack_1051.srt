1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,740
Car input, computers, tapes, all go.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,660
Laser beam cycling, normal cryogenic systems, go.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,480
Cathodes at 67,000 volts and steady.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,140
Time selector set at present.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,000
All set, Al. Stand by for a time synchronization.

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,520
Standing by.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,640
Date, 5 July, 64.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,740
Time, 11 hours, 14 minutes.

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:30,980
Counting.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,500
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, mark.

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,520
Mark.

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,460
Lights.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,260
Stand by to activate image stabilizer switch.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,320
Ready.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,300
Switch on.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,000
Switch on.

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,200
Only a madman or a fool would intentionally set fire to one of our forests or woodlands.

18
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,980
Yet 90% of our forests are forested.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,180
Most fires are started by the self-genius, Power of Slack.

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,020
They impede the production and transportation of critical defense supplies.

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,340
As I said, there is hope.

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:19,760
The aliens will come and if, assuming Bob has enough numbers, they will take us off to Planet X.

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,820
You know, come to think of it, no one's ever asked what happens on Planet X.

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,780
But it must be really slack from the pool.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,860
And the Earth will be, the unfaithful will all be destroyed and we get to help.

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:43,060
And we, now so far, admittedly, every July 5th, we're out there hoping that this year is 1998.

27
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:54,540
We get up at 7 in the morning and out there at Brushwood every X day, faithfully waiting for the saucers like a bunch of Heaven's Gate nuts.

28
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,760
And I have found over the years, I've learned.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,060
I've learned from gossip that the pagans at Brushwood, and they seem to think that we're going to do another Jonestown.

30
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,920
We've actually had them do spells to keep us from doing the terrible mass suicide.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,860
They assume that every cult that knows how to use computers is planning.

32
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,500
But friends, you can relax about that.

33
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,120
That Jonestown franchise is worn out.

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,640
Jonestown 2.

35
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,420
That was a pale shadow.

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,440
It was all commercialized.

37
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,760
Jonestown 3 was a pathetic mockery.

38
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,640
It was just the whole product placement.

39
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,380
I mean, Jesus, like those Heaven's Gate people.

40
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:48,460
Friends, until we can break Jonestown's record, the Kool-Aid will just be Kool-Aid and the pills will just be pills.

41
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,160
We don't care how long it takes.

42
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,880
The Church of the Subgenius, friends, has a hundred years of attitude.

43
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,960
Meanwhile.

44
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,460
About those aliens.

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,640
You know, Charles Fort, the great, well, I'm not sure what to call him.

46
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:11,740
The great weirdo, Charles Fort, said, I think we are being fished for regarding aliens.

47
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,640
And we say yes, but sorry, Charlie.

48
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,800
We're not looking for humans with good taste.

49
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,280
We're looking for humans that taste good.

50
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,220
But I suspect.

51
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,680
I can no longer turn my back on Cadet Stinty.

52
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,280
The rigors of space travel have somehow twisted his mind.

53
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,540
He's gone crazy.

54
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,920
He's got the space madness.

55
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,640
And you can smell the dottle of the pipe.

56
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,500
Amino acids.

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,540
As it were.

58
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,820
The amino acids are playing tonight.

59
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,580
I wish they were playing.

60
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,360
Actually, probably in the CDs I have.

61
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,000
I have a bunch of.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,760
Hours of slack.

63
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,500
In the archives.

64
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,740
Yeah, who knows?

65
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,640
I know there's some song.

66
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,360
I have best of Bob songs, number something.

67
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,580
Oh, he rocks.

68
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,640
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,880
We say yeah to X Day 9.

70
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,020
Yeah, boot capita.

71
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:19,620
That reminds me that this July 5th, 2000, whatever this year is, the world will.

72
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,860
Who knows?

73
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,160
I mean, it might be 98.

74
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,760
Actually, at this point, we're not really.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,200
Banking on anything much ending except, you know, the free.

76
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,020
Well, how many people usually like that?

77
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,900
Is it become like the Burning Man in New York kind of thing?

78
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,400
No.

79
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:46,320
Although there is an interesting little beginning festival called Burning Wood, which is rather small so far.

80
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,440
I think there's only been one.

81
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,240
And that's it was the guy actually told us it was based on Burning Man and Starwood.

82
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:53,760
Yeah.

83
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:54,780
Starwood.

84
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,720
I never would have guessed.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,160
In Yankee land out in the New York's in the woods.

86
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,720
Yankee land.

87
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:07,860
Brushwood, the clothing optional campground owned by our good friends.

88
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,500
Keep letting us do things there.

89
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,900
And it's Starwood's only like 1500 people.

90
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,580
And they don't burn a giant man.

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,080
Does this mean I'm the cowboy Dave?

92
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,620
Hell of a big pile of beautifully decorated wood.

93
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,020
Am I cowboy Dave?

94
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,620
Yes.

95
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:25,760
Yes.

96
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,060
And usually lonesome cowboy Dave is in a cage inside this burning.

97
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,660
Just like me.

98
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,800
It's not a Burning Man.

99
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,540
It's just a big pile, like I say.

100
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,880
But there's an actual man inside the pile of wood.

101
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,800
Oh, please.

102
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,760
So in a way, it's not nearly as big as Burning Man, but they do go the distance.

103
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,160
I understand the.

104
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,640
They're kind of like Burning Man boys in the old days when they used to really kill.

105
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,240
It's like a Burning Man cover band.

106
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,760
For art projects.

107
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,680
There are actually now is Action Girl.

108
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,240
Yes.

109
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,840
I was proud to say there are little Burning Man contingents in all 50 states.

110
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,360
Yes.

111
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:16,340
And Glass Madness was accosted recently by a sort of Bobby of Burning Man who went into a wonderful rant of high secrecy about, you know, he's going to have an event now.

112
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,800
It'll be a Burning Man thing.

113
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,400
You can make it.

114
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,120
But don't tell anybody.

115
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,900
And he'll give him the address just before it happens.

116
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,480
Right.

117
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,120
It was all.

118
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,440
Very, very hush hush.

119
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:25,860
Yes.

120
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:35,640
There are a lot of those hush hush festivals that remain hush hush to everyone except the founders who go around telling their friends and everyone they meet about them.

121
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,380
About what?

122
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,900
And that's the festival, man.

123
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,160
Things like Burning Man.

124
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,060
You missed it, dude.

125
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,940
Hundreds of little tiny weenies.

126
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,120
Yeah.

127
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,020
Burning Wood.

128
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,980
Or Wood Man.

129
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,560
Shooting festivals.

130
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,560
Burning Mandible.

131
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,780
Man Wood.

132
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,360
That's it.

133
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,080
Man Wood.

134
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,880
Man Wood.

135
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,820
Man Wood.

136
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,620
That was kind of a sexy festival.

137
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:53,900
Thank you.

138
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,840
The Wellman Wood.

139
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,180
The Wellman?

140
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,640
Yeah.

141
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,100
Well, Man Wood.

142
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,900
Man Wood.

143
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,260
Well, Man Wood.

144
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,480
What about Woman Wood?

145
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,640
What was that movie about the guy that grew up inside a TV?

146
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,880
Women don't have wood.

147
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,900
And he was all bent over when he got out.

148
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,040
When Elvis shot the TV.

149
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,120
And tried to also remove their wills.

150
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,760
When Elvis shot the TV, this guy jumped out.

151
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,560
And he went on to live a life in the real world.

152
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,680
He freed him from the prison.

153
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,760
But he was a TV guy living in the real world.

154
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,800
Living in the real world.

155
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,700
Living in the real world.

156
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,480
We just gathered information about what a NASA�

157
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,800
DNA sort of thing.

158
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,920
He can't read my mind.

159
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,840
Soχilll ra.

160
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,900
The planet most similar to ours in all the universe.

161
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,280
The Earth.

162
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:04,640
Therefore, our object will be to capture the Earth and colonize it with our own species.

163
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,180
Prepare the ship for an immediate attack.

164
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,260
Hit one of them, Bob.

165
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,920
Go to it, Bob.

166
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,520
Damn it, Bob. You've got to regain control.

167
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,620
To our mother star, Pyrrhus.

168
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,860
Our mission has failed.

169
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,860
We are in retreat.

170
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,440
Send spaceship number two immediately.

171
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,520
We found a deadly creature protecting the Earth.

172
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,300
Its name is...

173
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,540
Bob!

174
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,720
Yes, friend.

175
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,240
Bob is the one deadly creature protecting the Earth from everything but itself.

176
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,460
Thanks to Norrell Preff there.

177
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,920
Well, X-Day is coming very soon.

178
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,800
So we're playing holy recordings of the last X-Day drill,

179
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,500
which had Dr. Philo Drummond and Dr. Howell at it.

180
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,460
Also, some puzzling evidence.

181
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,220
KPFA radio show X-Day bits.

182
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,720
Also, from Starwood 25.

183
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,680
And Winterstar 06 sermons.

184
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:28,180
Plus some new music by Ed Fred and the collages of Krep and Lemur.

185
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,760
And now, Phineas Narco from NationalSynical.com.

186
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,120
Coincidence could be called the junk food of understanding.

187
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,920
It may be like an empty calorie or a dead end, but nevertheless you have it.

188
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,700
Of course, it can be indicative of what one is thinking.

189
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,420
Without one's complete awareness.

190
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,140
And may or may not be important.

191
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,040
But it is nevertheless accompanied by a feeling of importance.

192
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,320
Or a pleasurable and eerie significance.

193
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,480
The mind can be a significance junkie and gravitate toward a feeling of

194
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,020
this is significant and that it's on to something.

195
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,820
Because that's the sort of thing it's built to do.

196
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,680
This can lead you into some freaky areas if you don't manage to think about it.

197
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,200
And see them for what they are.

198
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:28,060
Namely, a statistical phenomenon indicative of expanded associational thinking.

199
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,240
Rather than something necessarily significant.

200
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:39,440
Even though Bob predicted that July 5th, 1998, the aliens would land, destroy all the humans,

201
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,840
and save the dues-paying subgeniuses.

202
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,940
It didn't happen.

203
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,220
Did we give up?

204
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,660
Did we let the Jehovah's Witnesses out-cook us and let them out-cook us?

205
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:47,660


206
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:47,660


207
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,080
Answer no!

208
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,180
We were right back here the next year, waiting for those saucers.

209
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,760
Just as if Bob never lied in his life.

210
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,480
We don't care about how true or untrue it might be, friends.

211
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,520
Because that is what belief is all about.

212
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,480
It's faith.

213
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,040
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

214
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,920
You use your mind to think about Bob's religion.

215
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,740
And occasionally, friends, believe it or not,

216
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,920
we've seen subgeniuses who were disappointed.

217
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,120
When the aliens didn't show up.

218
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,800
Who were angry.

219
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,240
In fact, friends, I've...

220
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,460
Now, you know, we started this nice, friendly, mockery religion.

221
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,180
You know, I mean, it's a room full of people laughing most of the time.

222
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,160
How bad are we?

223
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,420
Yeah!

224
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,260
We have...

225
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,380
There are people who want to kill my ass.

226
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,480
Who hate me!

227
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,000
I've got a lot of hate mail.

228
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,260
And who is it from?

229
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,600
Not Christians.

230
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,960
I wish it was.

231
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,140
Starwood gets funny letters from them.

232
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,660
Not Christians.

233
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,820
Not the church of the subgenius.

234
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,700
Who do we get the funny letters from?

235
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,820
Former subgeniuses.

236
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,900
Who we deprogrammed ourselves.

237
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,940
When they found out that they weren't really going to be able to ride in a spaceship for $30,

238
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,660
they felt cheated.

239
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,480
Friends, we gave those people a gift.

240
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,980
If they but had the eyes to see,

241
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,660
they would realize that we gave them the gift.

242
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,660
The gift of disbelief.

243
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:25,080
So that the next time some smooth-talking guru comes along and tells them that, you

244
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,980
know, we have the beautiful, perfect world.

245
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,540
We're going to wipe the saucers.

246
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,300
All you have to do is cut your balls off and give us $900 a month.

247
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,200
Friends, it could have been Heaven's gate.

248
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,200
They should be thanking us for ripping them off.

249
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,840
Praise God!

250
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,760
So what's happening now, Reverend Stan?

251
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,640
Well, uh, it's a little bit of a mess.

252
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:47,640


253
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:47,640


254
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:47,640


255
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:47,640


256
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:47,640


257
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,300
We're tired of you as an audience.

258
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,040
The excitement is palpable.

259
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,140
We've become discouraged now.

260
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,940
I've just finished flipping and labeling the tapes.

261
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,240
That's my main duty the next day.

262
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,480
Tapes are flipped and labeled.

263
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:04,320
You know, you can buy many wonderful souvenirs to take back from you from this occasion.

264
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,580
You can take them back and look at them and remember your time out here at Rushmore.

265
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,340
Oh, we have such beautiful memories.

266
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,080
We have these commemorative Slim Jim sausages for sale up here.

267
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,220
You have our permission.

268
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,620
Come on up and check out the

269
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:17,620


270
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:17,620


271
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:17,620


272
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,360
Come on up and have a Slim Jim of your own.

273
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,020
Plus we have these strips of paper that I spend a lot of time tearing very straightly.

274
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,380
Save them.

275
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,420
They may come in handy for bookmarks or other things.

276
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,600
Well, like any other religion, we have these, uh, we have an us and a them.

277
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,640
And us is everybody we like, which is usually just ourselves.

278
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,220
And them is pretty much everybody else.

279
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,940
And, uh, we have lots of derogatory words for them, the Barbies and Kens.

280
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,600
Uh-huh.

281
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,300
The cage dwellers.

282
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,340
The little norm worms.

283
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,080
The conspiracy, the pink boys.

284
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,440
The...

285
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,840
Mediocratons.

286
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,240
The mediocratons, yeah.

287
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,220
We come up with new ones all the time.

288
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,320
And just to, and, you know, you know all that is, is just an ego boost.

289
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,680
It's not that we love Bob so much.

290
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,680
It's that we love the idea of everybody else going to hell.

291
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,040
And that is what religion is all about!

292
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,600
How many of you know that?

293
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:23,940
How many Buddhists do you know who you know that that nice Buddhist is thinking to himself,

294
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,940
I've got less ego than anybody else here?

295
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,100
You know who I mean.

296
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,340
The New Agers who try so hard not to act angry.

297
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,180
How you planning on getting him back to Earth?

298
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,040
We's kinda hoping you'd take him.

299
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,120
Ask him if we can get his chocolate and cigarettes.

300
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,900
If we take him to Earth, can we keep his chocolate and cigarettes?

301
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,020
We ain't got no need for it.

302
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:55,900
Okay.

303
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,880
Oh my God, don't be.

304
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,540
Yes, yes.

305
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,560
Yes, yes.

306
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:04,660


307
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,820
Yes, yes.

308
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,720
Yes, yes.

309
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:06,900
Yes, yes.

310
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,120
Yes, yes.

311
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,120


312
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,280
Yes, yes.

313
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:07,500
Yes, yes.

314
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,700
Right.

315
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,300
Yes, yes.

316
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:23,580
Yeah.

317
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,040
Yes.

318
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:24,520


319
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:24,520


320
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:24,520


321
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,100
Okay.

322
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,100


323
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,100


324
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,360
officials Nikhil and Gupta for feelin .

325
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,360


326
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,360


327
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,360


328
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,360


329
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,360


330
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,020
It had to be a great pun.

331
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,780
Let me talk to you.

332
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:31,780


333
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,100
Matt, remember?

334
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,100


335
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,260
Let's talk.

336
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,240
Want to see the镇ic grotto?

337
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,460
A sense of frequency?

338
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:37,460


339
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:37,460


340
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:37,460


341
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,540
The girl with the vagina made of glass

342
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,300
So perfect and pure

343
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,660
And gynecologically demure

344
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,280
And the way her buttocks choose on her shorts

345
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,140
Is very nice

346
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,480
Oh yes, it's very nice

347
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,540
And the way her perfect bosoms need no support

348
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,080
Oh yes, that too is very nice

349
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,360
And wherever she may go

350
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,380
All heaven surrounds her

351
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,000
Envy's green-eyed monsters confound her

352
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,120
Age-old myths and legends come true

353
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,800
Ancient prophecies all come to pass

354
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,280
All this and all because of you

355
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,320
The girl with the vagina made of glass

356
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,780
Ah-woo, ah-woo, ah-woo

357
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,200
Ah-woo, ah-woo

358
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,340
Ah-woo, ah-woo, ah-woo

359
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,160
Ah-woo, ah-woo, ah-woo

360
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,680
Why, Samuel Curtis, you flatter me

361
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:50,520
My dear Cloris, any beautiful words spoken on your behalf would only be the...

362
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,240
Big truck

363

Bible-based science

364
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,900
Big

365
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,180
Bible-based science

366
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,480
Bible-based science

367
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:09,500
Bible-based science

368
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,380
What did your father teach you?

369
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,020
What did your father teach you?

370
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,480
What did your father teach you?

371
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:16,480


372
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,060
My father taught me to kill the sunflower

373
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,860
My father taught me to kill the sunflower

374
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,160
Congratulations, Mr. Curtis, you are now awake ten minutes to Venus

375
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,400
How many minutes?

376
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,160
How many minutes?

377
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,020
How many minutes?

378
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,580
How many minutes?

379
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,480
Oh...

380
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,840
I'm ready, One day

381
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:45,840


382
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,000
You are yes but the last

383
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,000


384
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,000


385
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,000


386
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,000


387
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,520
I'm just blushing

388
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:46,520


389
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,140
Did I just sayóg

390
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,140


391
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,340
Uh-Take all things

392
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,280
It's my saggings

393
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,240
Galaxies

394
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,500
Cr길

395
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:53,500


396
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,280
Blakes

397
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,540
So Gay

398
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,260
I don't wanna drag you

399
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,000
You can do...

400
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,320
He stood about ten-three

401
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,020
His voice rang like crashing waves of a sea

402
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,320
He spoke of untold prophecies

403
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,820
And forgotten civilizations

404
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,140
How we as people are asleep

405
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,420
In a voice's true context

406
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,260
Visual views of humans being recharged

407
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,360
Like puppets on a stream

408
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,000
Quests for knowledge being sodomized in your dreams

409
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,140
Government cover-ups in a nutshell

410
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,600
Gunshots blast, children scream

411
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,560
Psycho repeated like bad dreams

412
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,980
We were taught not to fly

413
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,380
And our wings got clipped

414
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,500
I'm waiting on the sun to become as one with the moon

415
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,420
Tidal waves and thunderstorms are soon to rule the earth

416
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:57,420
He spoke of how some of us must find loopholes with the stars

417
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,600
New atmospheres

418
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,620
Somewhere that we can cultivate new hemispheres

419
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,260
All my lessons ran clear

420
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,000
War revelations

421
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,260
Murder in the mind of seven nations

422
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,100
Politicians with their fingers on the triggers

423
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,700
Indeed contemplation

424
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,120
No more conversation

425
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,300
Blood must be spilled

426
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,140
Enemies must die

427
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,180
So people shoot to kill

428
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,660
This life isn't for real

429
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,400
It's just for fun

430
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,600
It's just a depiction of the hereafter

431
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,160
And he opened his hands

432
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,680
He said, you rewrite the chapters

433
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,080
I'm coming down from cloud nine

434
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,820
I got a message for your motherfucking minds

435
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,140

I'm out

441
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,400
Watch this

442
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:08,600

HEY

00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,160
WHEN

448
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,960
THE

449
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,100
WHEN

450
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,760
THEY

451
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:24,900
HAVE

452
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,000
SHIRTS

453
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,400
WHEN

454
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,320
THE

455
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,940

THE

457
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,260
BAD

458
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,000
Don't you know that I love it so?

459
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,900
To be, be, be an American astronaut.

460
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,560
Can't you see what it means to be, to be the American astronaut?

461
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,600
And don't you know that I love it so?

462
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,060
To be the American astronaut.

463
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,740
Please.

464
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,860
To be the American astronaut.

465
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,400
From the movie.

466
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,260
Uh.

467
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,600
By the Billy Nair Show.

468
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,240
Who are performing at 9X Day.

469
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,080
You can learn more about them at BillyNair.com.

470
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:38,920
Uh.

471
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,860
The amino acids are in the background here.

472
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,560
And they will also be at 9X Day.

473
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,140
But before that we heard Johnny Future.

474
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:55,880
And you can get Johnny Future by emailing johnny__future at yahoo.com.

475
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,380
And before that.

476
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,440
Manifest Destiny.

477
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,860
And I would fly in an old Stuka aircraft.

478
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,380
And land with my whistling landing craft.

479
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,260
Listen to these old guys.

480
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,940
I'm really tired.

481
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,360
Spread out my sleeping bag and take a nap.

482
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,540
This five hour show is blazoring my ancient memories.

483
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,160
Yes.

484
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,200
It is the tough time show.

485
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,900
Trying to store their memories.

486
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,220
This isn't in Fat Mouse.

487
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,720
To serve them.

488
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,380
We are serving up liquid oxygen.

489
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:27,380


490
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:27,600
Liquid chicken.

491
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:27,840
Yeah.

492
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,760
Liquid chicken slack.

493
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,780
If they were printed only for the nudist cult.

494
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,020
They would never exist.

495
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:32,440
Yeah.

496
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,480
Chicken grease and nudies.

497
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,720
And five years after you put the photos of the peep of the nude cultists online.

498
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,680
You can call 848-4425 and I'll answer your call right now.

499
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,180
They call you up and ask you to take them down because they gotta get a job now.

500
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,420
Call at 848-4425.

501
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,460
No.

502
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,480
Not well done.

503
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,540
Even those of you who have called several times tonight can call again.

504
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,100
So friends.

505
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,560
If you're ever going to get a job.

506
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,260
Don't take off your clothes at a subgenius event.

507
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,840
And stand in front of the cameras.

508
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,220
Too late now.

509
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:01,940
Hey.

510
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,100
Where is the young marine station?

511
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,920
Some instances but.

512
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,800
I think she's out of the marines now.

513
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:09,860


514
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,200
I believe him.

515
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,860
Has she returned to dog stock?

516
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,120
Huh?

517
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,680
Has she returned to dog stock?

518
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:15,980
Yes.

519
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,500
She was.

520
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,020
One of the faithful.

521
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,300
Oh yes.

522
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,340
Doesn't she sing songs and dance around?

523
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,040
She did in fact dance around the great fire.

524
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,880
And like an experience.

525
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,720
There is a hallmark to being a couple.

526
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,680
And yet she had never been to such a thing.

527
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:37,080
I thought that she was a reincarnation of some ancient wood puffer goddess.

528
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,300
Or pine sapper.

529
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,460
However it's been well stated that very few blind people join the nudist colonies.

530
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,880
The church of subgenius.

531
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,060
Or the nudist colonies.

532
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,320
Why would a blind person want to join a nudist colony?

533
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,160
They can't see who's looking at them.

534
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:54,860
They're only three or four.

535
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,440
There's a blind subgenius radio broadcaster.

536
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,980
Reverend Yukon Jack.

537
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,040
He's blind as a bat.

538
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,100
Actually much blinder because he doesn't have echolocation.

539
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,120
You know why flatulent smells right?

540
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,760
And he rebroadcasts all of the shows.

541
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,140
Liquid hour of slack.

542
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,720
And the echo would be up there.

543
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,720
Is this college radio?

544
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,360
Regular radio?

545
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,240
No this is pirate FM small radio.

546
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,560
Small circulation.

547
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,600
98!

548
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,560
98!

549
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:32,740


550
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,460
It's here now.

551
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,020
98 it's now.

552
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,360
Here's a man that really appreciates that new power.

553
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,940
Take a tip from me.

554
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,140
I'm a professional sailor from the future.

555
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,040
Today.

556
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,940
This is another forward step.

557
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,900
Remember you get power from 98.

558
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,420
What?

559
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,040
98.

560
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,860
98.

561
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,200
98.

562
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:52,580


563
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,120
98.

564
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,540
98.

565
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:56,360


566
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,720
98.

567
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,140


568
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,680
It's here now.

569
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,860
A thanks to Reverend Maynard Brainard.

570
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,660
And now back to Dr. Howell.

571
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,860
Dr. Philodrum and it was truly Reverend Ivan Stang at 8X Day.

572
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:18,780
Some patients with T-Series originating in the temple have intense religious wars.

573
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,700
Intense experience of God visiting them.

574
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,180
Sometimes it's a personal war.

575
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:27,140
Sometimes it's a more diffuse feeling of being one with the cosmos.

576
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,420
Everything seems suffused meaning.

577
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,000
The patient will say, finally I see what it's all really about.

578
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,600
I really understand God.

579
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,820
I understand my place in the universe because of the cosmic scheme.

580
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,700
Why does this happen?

581
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,680
Why does it happen so often in patient and temporal seizures?

582
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,100
I'm Dr. Philodrum.

583
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,680
I'm Dr. Howell.

584
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:51,680


585
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:51,680


586
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:51,680


587
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:51,680


588
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,040
The way we grow is to look at the past.

589
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,120
Very in the past.

590
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,020
Still give us strength for the super thing.

591
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,420
The red alarm, the roots of pride every time it rings.

592
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:12,860
It means it's time to go beyond the normal thing.

593
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,420
Pay attention and be prepared to do it right.

594
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,240
Do it right.

595
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:20,820
Do it right.

596
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,660
Do it right.

597
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:21,660


598
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,140
The super thing, the thing that makes you bigger than life.

599
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,920
Magnetic trumpets blowing.

600
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,340
Synthetic saxophones.

601
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,660
The evidence kept growing from below.

602
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,300
Mutant motivations.

603
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,840
Buried in the past.

604
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,020
Still give us strength.

605
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,960
The super thing.

606
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,460
Won't you tell me what it takes.

607
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,360
To do the super thing.

608
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,960
Won't you give me what it takes.

609
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,660
To do the super thing.

610
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:21,660


611
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,840
To do the super thing.

612
00:27:53,100 --> 00:28:05,980
To do the super thing.

613
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,060
To do the super thing.

614
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,100
To do the super thing.

615
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,100


616
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,520
To do the super thing.

617
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:10,520


618
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:10,520


619
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:10,520


620
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,320
Well, folks, I guess this concludes our segment.

621
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,120
Believe us, we've enjoyed bringing it to you

622
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,220
just as much as you've enjoyed

623
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,160
having us bring it to you.

624
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,500
But now, the evening will take

625
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,540
new and delightful form.

626
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,360
We're not sure what goes on.

627
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,060
No, we want them to occur organically.

628
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,420
X-Day, surroundings.

629
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,960
Well, the best thing about X-Day

630
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,420
happens away from the stage.

631
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,740
So clearly you're still so close to X-Day.

632
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,680
Santos and Lindshift,

633
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,140
of course you're getting into some

634
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,540
really good 성 and fly will

635
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,520
b忙 like you never have before,

636
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:51,980
but you're literally missing it.

637
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,760
Okay, fingers crossed.

638
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:52,880
That, uh,

639
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,620
that kind of outweighs

640
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,700
it all, right now.

641
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,680
Next week 25AK is off.

642
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,340
Here are Alex Jones's

643
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:58,440
shows for the ones who've got

644
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,180
it show refunded.

645
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,980
In addition,

646
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,200
follow down with

647
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,680
For the good of our

648
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,080
legenhaus and

649
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,560
for the good of the

650
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:04,560


651
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:04,560


652
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:04,560


653
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:04,620
Saturday is Friday,

654
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:04,620


655
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,440
Except this year. It'll just continue forever and ever.

656
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,040
In fact, has anybody planned to take...

657
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:17,300
Yeah, I guess we've got to remember to take brushwood with us when the rupture happens.

658
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,080
Somebody's got to remember to do that.

659
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,580
Well, there'll be a new heaven and a new earth.

660
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,180
Well, but we'd like to... Some of us are collectors, Dr. Howard.

661
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,580
You know, a new heaven and a new earth is great, but we want that amazing, fantastic number 15 back.

662
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:38,760
Well, you might take the old brushwood to get with you, you know, sort of like a modern train layout.

663
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:46,720
You know, nothing like the new giant brushwood, which can contain a hundred universes like ours.

664
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,920
I have a copy with a torn cover.

665
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,080
You still have amazing fantasy number 15?

666
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,480
I have amazing fantasy 15 with a half-torn cover.

667
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:59,820
I had one, but I sold it to a crippled guy for $3.50 in 1969 or something.

668
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,360
I thought you...

669
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,180
Ripped it off a crippled newsie.

670
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,460
Yeah, I still have most of Spider-Man 1 through 50.

671
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,860
Here's the thing, man. What is the middle letter in Bob's name?

672
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,100
Is it a U?

673
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,380
No!

674
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,860
U are not in the middle of Bob's name.

675
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,600
O is in the middle.

676
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,640
What does O mean to you?

677
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,380
It means U-O-Bob.

678
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,140
Bob.

679
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,140
And Bob, you know, you don't have to love Bob.

680
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,140
But it's Bob's only one O short of boo, and you do love booze.

681
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,580
Everybody loves booze.

682
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,360
And we're into love.

683
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,520
This is a love church, but it's also a hate church because we're very practical.

684
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,260
We have a kind of a temper tantrum of hate, you might say.

685
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,760
It's hate.

686
00:30:53,200 --> 00:31:01,400
We try to broaden our love by kind of squeezing our hate, distilling our hate into a perfect teacher.

687
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,860
A perfect essence of hate.

688
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:09,120
A hate through mockery of the false prophets, which, like I say, that's anybody we don't like.

689
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:09,600
We don't love.

690
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,120
We don't love.

691
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,640
We don't love.

692
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,160
We don't love.

693
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,620
We don't love.

694
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,820
Our record for this date is 1951.

695
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,000
Saturday morning with a chance of Saturday night.

696
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,400
It'll be plenty of Sunday.

697
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,460
Sunday night looking at Monday with a chance of early Monday.

698
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,380
The seven great lakes will eventually move into the northeast and bring New York City.

699
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,340
Welcome to the end of the world.

700
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,600
Welcome to the end of the world.

701
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,340
Welcome to the end of the world.

702
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:32,340


703
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:32,340


704
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,780
Welcome to the end of the world.

705
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,360
.

706
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,940
Welcome to the end of the world.

707
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,680
Welcome to the end of the world.

708
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,320
Welcome to the end of the world.

709
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:40,320


710
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,380
Welcome home to the closest...

711
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,280
The crisis of this vostrateось Lauterbachooo challenge.

712
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,280


713
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,300
Gift of any man of the image of the spirit himself, welcome to the end of the world.

714
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,540
Loan that's "'s the redemption of Satan's life".

715
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,660
It's the end of the world.

716
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,960
Welcome to the end of the world

717
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,580
We'll see how we work

718
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,820
See how we work

719
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:22,020
No stuff, no stuff, no stuff, no stuff

720
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:28,340
You're all no stuff, no stuff, no stuff, no stuff

721
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,320
No stuff, no stuff, no stuff, no stuff, no stuff

722
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,860
Some mess took smashing into buildings and everything

723
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,460
And they always make a mess

724
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,100
We interrupt this program to bring you a news bulletin from Washington

725
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,780
The White House is just in

726
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,040
We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a report involving you from the United States

727
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,560
That's what we're doing

728
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,640
We interrupt our program to bring you a special broadcast

729
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:21,320
We interrupt this program to bring you a news bulletin from the United States

730
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,060
It happened before

731
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,040
It will happen again

732
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,760
It's just a question of when

733
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,860
It's the end of the world

734
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,380
It's the end of the world

735
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,620
It's the end of the world

736
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,260
Reverend Ed Fred did that

737
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,980
And before that, some lean mer

738
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,660
Some preaching at Starwood

739
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,540
Some Devo

740
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,440
And some Phineas Narco

741
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,620
Coming up

742
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:57,920
Uh

743
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,640
What is on the schedule?

744
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,260
Now, Reverend Stang, tomorrow at this site

745
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:07,920
What will occur here when the shadows of evening steal across the sky?

746
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,180
What's the bird's eye lowdown on this hoedown?

747
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,400
Tomorrow is the big, big, big day, friends

748
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,940
The great day

749
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,380
I believe that, uh

750
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,940
Okay, nothing happens before one o'clock

751
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,100
Praise Bob and Stan

752
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,200
Oh, for God's sake, sure

753
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:21,980
Yes, of course

754
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,480
So you can sleep late, right?

755
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,480
But will there be, uh, woe tanning going on here?

756
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,100
There'll be, uh, like

757
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,200
I would say

758
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:28,840
Jamming

759
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,220
It's much like what's in that, that, uh

760
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,740
Although the schedule is a complete fiction

761
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,280
By coincidence, it's pretty close to what that, that will be

762
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,300
I believe it's like, uh

763
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,980
At one o'clock, we had called for the baptism in the pool

764
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,440
Now, wasn't really, truthfully, Reverend Stang

765
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,860
Wasn't that the previous year's schedule with simply having the dates changed?

766
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,400
Yes

767
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,740
Yes, and now I'm going to change them even more

768
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,240
That's what I thought

769
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,080
We're going to move the baptism up to two o'clock

770
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,700
Two o'clock

771
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,180
That's a slack-filled way to create a schedule, don't you think?

772
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,860
Uh, and I'm not sure who'll be performing the actual baptisms this year

773
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,780
I don't know if Dr. Leguim will be doing it

774
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,140
Jesus is not here

775
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,780
He's infiltrated the conspiracy so deeply

776
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,160
That he might as well be Satan

777
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,360
He is Satan now

778
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:15,880
Praise Bob

779
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,920
We need a man on the inside

780
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,580
I've always been on the inside for you

781
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,860
But I want you to know that

782
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,320
It's part of my job

783
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,060
So, in the, in the meantime, however

784
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,080
We'll have the baptism in the pool tomorrow

785
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,500
I guess I may end up having to do some of that

786
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,200
Gentlemen, the cheeseburgers have arrived

787
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,540
Don't worry, I'll wear my bathing trunks

788
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,620
So you won't be afraid to get close to me

789
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,620
Or, I can't wear my papal robes

790
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,500
I think I would drown

791
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,120
Then after that, we'll

792
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,480
I think it said we'd show movies

793
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,040
Uh, subgenius movies

794
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,220
Not conspiracy bad films

795
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,920
That's right, we'll be going up into the hospitality shed

796
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,440
That would be like after the baptism

797
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,620
Probably about three o'clock in the studio

798
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,000
Up at the top of the hill

799
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,080
That's just past the shower room

800
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,200
And that's where we're going

801
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,360
We're going to be going up to the

802
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:06,360


803
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,500
The

804
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,980
The

805
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:10,980


806
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,320
The

807
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:12,340
The

808
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:12,940
The

809
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,000
The

810
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,000


811
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,000


812
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,000


813
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,000


814
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,000


815
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,000


816
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,000


817
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,980
The The General 😮

818
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,080
All right, all right, gentlemen

819
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,700
Let the dance contest begin!

820
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,420
Sorry, government!

821
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,660
We're lot to go

822
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:56,660


823
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:56,660


824
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:56,660


825
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:56,660


826
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:56,660


827
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:56,660


828
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:56,660


829
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:56,660


830
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:56,660


831
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:56,700
segmented on European footages

832
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:56,700


833
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:56,700


834
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:56,980
This 그럼

835
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:56,980


836
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,520
Love is a flipping, rolling riddle

837
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,420
Love is smiling when you hear them giggle

838
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,040
Those angels giggle when they know you're smiling

839
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,220
Love is running in an open field

840
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:29,260
Love is smiling and the happy way you feel

841
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,080
When you know you're smiling

842
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,740
So how can you keep from smiling

843
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,340
When you see yourself in the mirror smiling

844
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:45,580
Just about to say the name of the girl that makes you smile

845
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,560
Love is smiling

846
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,680
Love is thinking of when you die

847
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,720
Love is smiling

848
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,700
When she hears your name and she'll start to cry

849
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,520
She'll remember you smiling

850
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,700
Love is living in a magic land

851
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,720
Love is thinking of how you'll hold your hand

852
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,760
And you'll both be smiling

853
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,320
So how can you keep from smiling

854
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,900
When you see yourself in the mirror smiling

855
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,200
Just about to say the name of the girl that makes you smile

856
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,200


857
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,040
To say the name of the girl that makes me cry

858
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,220
The Billy Nair Show, sort of.

859
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,160
From the incredible movie, The American Astronaut.

860
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,600
Praise The American Astronaut and Billy Nair Show.

861
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,620
And now, Norah Preff.

862
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,680
Activate the radar screen.

863
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,360
It's fantastic.

864
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,400
Activate the video, Tron.

865
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,520
Activate the video, Tron.

866
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,520
Activate the video, Tron.

867
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,520
Activate the video, Tron.

868
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:22,960
Brainwave.

869
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:23,640
Control device.

870
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,840
Adjust aim.

871
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,380
It's fantastic.

872
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,300
Destroy all the Earth people.

873
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,820
Annihilate them forever.

874
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,980
The Earth shall soon surrender.

875
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,940
We have learned how easy it is for us to defeat them.

876
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,860
We are now ready to complete their annihilation without any resistance.

877
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,320
There is no need to keep such useless creatures.

878
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,860
Prepare to attack at once.

879
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,420
Prepare to attack at once.

880
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,880
Prepare to attack at once.

881
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,380
Prepare to attack at once.

882
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:06,260
We are now ready to complete their annihilation without any resistance.

883
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,800
The quick freeze monster.

884
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,600
The supersonic monster.

885
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:19,820
You.

886
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,620
Jim.

887
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,220
Jim, do you smell something fishy in the air?

888
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,820
I don't smell anything.

889
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,880
The Billy Mayer Show from the American Astronauts.

890
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,540
Again, also on one of their CDs, I think that is.

891
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,500
And now, hey, where's Bob?

892
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,480
There he goes!

893
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,320
He's feeling his ovarian re-trio.

894
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
That's a mighty good idea for you.

895
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,180
Just make sure you get loaded too.

896
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,900
Cooked.

897
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,020
Every morning and you'll hear Bob.

898
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,580
The future is now, now.

899
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,300
With each new tomorrow.

900
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:07,700
No more I'll face the heartaches of the past.

901
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,700
For now they are gone, gone.

902
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,580
Forever no more sorrow.

903
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:23,440
I hope that my happiness will last.

904
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,660
That was Neil Dick.

905
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,200
Now, Rel.

906
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:46,860
Hi.

907
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,940
I don't have a whole lot of time.

908
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,260
And I've kind of been running across the country.

909
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,120
Oh man, I don't know where to start.

910
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:07,180
They're going to triangulate on this position really, really soon.

911
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:07,820
Okay.

912
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,040
Okay, what we're thinking of as aliens,

913
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,280
they're extra dimensional beings.

914
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,280
They are not what they claim to be.

915
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,320
I'm sorry, the government knows about them.

916
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,120
And, and...

917
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,320
Is it the government or...

918
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,960
That was awful strange.

919
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

920
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:35,940
Blew up here.

921
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,680
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

922
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,560
Am I on the air?

923
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,220
Belly up.

924
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:39,860
I presume.

925
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:40,840
I presume.

926
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,760
How can you presume?

927
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,840
How can I presume?

928
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,040
How can you presume?

929
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,140
How can I presume?

930
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,800
Okay, another question from the audience is...

931
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,300
Is this my drink?

932
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,840
Are all Yetis partially Cajun?

933
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,020
Well, an interesting question.

934
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,060
And perhaps one that comes from the land of the Cajuns,

935
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,080
or Acadians as they once were called.

936
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,100
But the fact is...

937
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,500
I see, I feel a certain amount of hope and hoping behind this question.

938
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,820
Yes, and it's hope that I'm not...

939
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:20,540
But I hate to dash, but I'm afraid all Yetis are not partially Cajun.

940
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:26,400
The Acadian people were French settlers of Canada who were displaced.

941
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,220
And they...

942
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:33,840
Their famous Cajun patois is a result of the language they originally spoke.

943
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:42,320
Their diaspora is detailed in the poem, Evangeline, by the immortal Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

944
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,120
Uh...

945
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,840
You know, the forest, the murmuring pines and hemlocks.

946
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,240
You can read all about it, probably on the internet.

947
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,460
But Yetis are universally found around this Terraqueous globe.

948
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,260
And not really the native of any particular region,

949
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:07,460
except what is remote and away from the smelly, disharmonious haunts of humans.

950
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,920
Okay, thank you.

951
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,000
The response to this eternal empire is easy to recognize.

952
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,760
We say that

953
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,980
We have a real energy investigation,

954
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:31,280
Even today,

955
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:38,960
Outside the barely visible stars and the the molecules in the atmosphere,

956
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:45,580
It's been proven to be true, like one and one are two.

957
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,540
It's checked and double checked, a fact that can be backed.

958
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:54,400
Because it is, because it is a scientific fact.

959
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:59,840
It's a scientific fact that there are belts of radiation in outer space

960
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,420
which are a hazard for future space flyers to overcome.

961
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,040
It's a scientific fact, a scientific fact.

962
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,840
It has to be correct, it has to be exact.

963
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,720
Because it is, because it is a scientific fact.

964
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,920
Well, of course,

965
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,840
even scientific facts are not perfectly exact,

966
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,860
but they are as exact as it is humanly possible to make them at the time.

967
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,560
It's a scientific fact, a scientific fact.

968
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,380
It has to be correct, it has to be exact.

969
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:54,440
Because it is, because it is a scientific fact.

970
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,620
The fight and the dying mean there's no denying.

971
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,560
The wreckage, the bodies,

972
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,100
nobody left crying.

973
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,780
The lifting, the burning,

974
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,460
the world will stop turning.

975
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,820
The chaos, the violence turns to utter silence.

976
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,500
At the end of the world,

977
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,920
when the river has cleaned all the fields.

978
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:24,100
At the end of the world,

979
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,180
revelations will record with the seven seals.

980
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,880
At the end,

981
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,720
of the world,

982
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,960
the death to the eve of destruction.

983
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,440
At the end,

984
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,200
of the world,

985
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,600
when the earth goes into deconstruction.

986
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,300
The flames will rise higher, consumption by fire.

987
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,640
The world will burn to ashes in smoking hot gases.

988
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,960
Volcanic erosion and earth-core implosion.

989
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,180
A massive explosion, the doomsday is chosen.

990
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,140
At the end,

991
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,920
of the world,

992
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,400
there will be much devastation.

993
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,740
At the end,

994
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,480
of the world,

995
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,660
the galaxy will need a vacation.

996
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,280
At the end,

997
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,000
of the world,

998
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:28,240
a new asteroid field will be formed.

999
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,240
At the end,

1000
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,560
of the world,

1001
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,640
there's good reason to be alone.

1002
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,320
That's right folks,

1003
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,700
it's the end of the world.

1004
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,820
But before you grab a seat,

1005
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,260
bend over and kiss your sorry ass goodbye.

1006
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,100
Because you're gonna fry.

1007
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,520
That was Reverend Ed Fred at the end of the world.

1008
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,080
Norrell Preff and Lee Murr follow.

1009
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,800
You're listening to the Hour of Slack number 1051.

1010
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:16,460
More information can be had at subgenius.com.

1011
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,300
Eve, I'm over here!

1012
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,880
And I'm coming with you.

1013
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,820
When we get away from here,

1014
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,120
we'll be living among normal people again.

1015
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,560
There is something strange in the air.

1016
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,340
Don't you feel it?

1017
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,160
Or is it that I'm just so sensitive?

1018
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,540
Did you see what I see?

1019
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,200
Holy smoke spread!

1020
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,080
Wait a minute!

1021
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,000
I need some coffee.

1022
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,000
What can it be?

1023
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,660
Can you tell me why Fish Face is so frantic?

1024
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,900
Something terrible.

1025
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,920
Hey Pat, that's impossible!

1026
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,520
Damn it all, Pat, what's that?

1027
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,480
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1028
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,100
It's up to you, Cornfield.

1029
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,500
I'll be the lightning rod.

1030
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,100
Will someone please tell me what's going on?

1031
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:10,140
I don't understand what you mean.

1032
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,120
Amazing.

1033
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,040
Stupid.

1034
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,980
And dull mechanical apparatuses.

1035
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:16,680
Oh.

1036
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,060
Infinitesimal.

1037
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,380
Ah, yes.

1038
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,080
The High Command.

1039
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,620
With pleasure.

1040
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,020
With pleasure.

1041
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:29,800
With pleasure.

1042
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,940
Idiots on Mars.

1043
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:32,920
Right on microwave.

1044
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:33,760
Hi, Bob.

1045
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:34,880
Fred Steele.

1046
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,740
Where did you spring up from?

1047
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,140
But you hit me at a bad moment.

1048
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:38,740
Wait, Bob.

1049
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:39,800
There's something else.

1050
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,000
He's a crazy kid.

1051
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:41,740
Bob.

1052
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,000
Execute the order.

1053
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,680
We must calculate mass, size, and speed.

1054
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,280
But Commander, but Commander.

1055
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,340
But that's murder.

1056
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,680
You've created a panic.

1057
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,280
I've been here at your side for several years now.

1058
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:56,260
As usual, the bigwigs have to try to find a scapegoat.

1059
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,100
The Bigwigs are the ones who are the most dangerous.

1060
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:57,100


1061
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:57,100


1062
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:57,100


1063
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:57,100


1064
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,420
I maintain nothing.

1065
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,880
I ascertain there's only one opinion that interests me.

1066
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,620
My own.

1067
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:04,460
Oh.

1068
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:10,560
One would say, ladies and gentlemen, that you are disappointed to learn that the end

1069
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,840
of the world has been postponed.

1070
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,000
I understand the PSI course is very grave.

1071
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,440
We know damn well it's not true.

1072
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,160
However, the people have faith in you.

1073
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,000
Eve.

1074
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,080
Eve.

1075
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,200
Stand back, you madman.

1076
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:26,900
Of course.

1077
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,080
I'm not mad.

1078
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,080


1079
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,080


1080
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,080


1081
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,080


1082
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,080


1083
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,080


1084
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,080


1085
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,080


1086
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,080


1087
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,080


1088
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,080


1089
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,080


1090
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,080


1091
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,080


1092
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:35,940
If the discipline is at my fingertips, is it a shame that I frankly admit that my

1093
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:35,940


1094
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,160
To think, just the two of you, that just to think I had a chance to take a игрle.

1095
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:36,160


1096
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:36,160


1097
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:36,160


1098
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:36,160


1099
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,600
I'd go, air, air air.

1100
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,000
At this point in time, I would be over the moon.

1101
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,200
Next time, I would fly Οo Snowman instead.

1102
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:44,200


1103
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:54,000
What's your FE

1104
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,080
This is war.

1105
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,060
To unleash every propaganda need given with all of us.

1106
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:57,060


1107
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,700
and their means of tool disposal to tranquilize public opinion.

1108
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,000
Bob, I love you, Bob. I love you, Bob.

1109
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,640
Take me with you, Bob.

1110
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,700
Up there?

1111
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,820
The moment of neutralization.

1112
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,560
The squadron commander is Bob.

1113
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,940
I don't like the smell of this story.

1114
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,620
Why? Because it's inspired by non-scientific motives.

1115
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,400
Are you crazy? Hit one of them, Bob.

1116
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,580
I'm not insane. Go to it, Bob.

1117
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,220
Damn it, Bob. You've got to regain control.

1118
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,580
You all go to hell.

1119
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:28,360
This is terrible. Drawing out agony for the whole world.

1120
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,600
Most things happen unexpectedly. Even the apocalypse.

1121
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:32,960
Psychic, you know.

1122
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,160
Where does she go?

1123
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,100
These, this, and that, and that.

1124
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,320
Deep inside.

1125
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,360
Do you really think there is someone inside?

1126
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,900
Oh, shut up.

1127
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,540
Bob! Bob!

1128
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,000
Bob! Bob! Bob!

1129
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,600
I love you, Bob.

1130
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,560
The number of people still astonishes.

1131
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,980
Um, uh, uh, um.

1132
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,440
More than two people died.

1133
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,140
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

1134
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,580
Nearly two million more lost their humanity.

1135
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,920
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

1136
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,100
This is me speaking.

1137
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,840
Second minutes hours.

1138
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,740
Experience the fine fragrance of snuggle.

1139
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:13,780
Somebody get on the pipe.

1140
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:21,960
Somehow, in some way, I not only went through the sound barrier, but I've gone back in time.

1141
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,720
Stay in your own backyard.

1142
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,980
You're still on Earth or on the ship with me.

1143
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,360
Strange and complex sanity of man.

1144
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,120
Stupid.

1145
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,800
A telephone connected to nothingness.

1146
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,860
The ultimate.

1147
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,140
They're big.

1148
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,640
They're tough and they're shrewd and they got eyes.

1149
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,780
This is incredible.

1150
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,680
This is really incredible.

1151
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,460
Frankly, Grandfather, I think this whole thing is a bore.

1152
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,240
Through sleep.

1153
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,600
It's time for me to be the man.

1154
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,660
Time, time, time.

1155
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,200
Ah!

1156
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,960
This time enough at last.

1157
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,260
To each his own.

1158
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,140
To penetrate!

1159
00:52:59,660 --> 00:52:59,660


1160
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:00,640
Yeah!

1161
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,060
Yeah!

1162
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:01,780
Yeah!

1163
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:02,900
Yeah!

1164
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:02,900


1165
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:02,900


1166
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,120
Well, that's, uh, very interesting, uh, Viacom.

1167
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,160
Oh, wait a minute. What's going on?

1168
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,380
We...

1169
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,940
All of us...

1170
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,720
We are in hell.

1171
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,640
We are so high.

1172
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,100
We will be taking off in three minutes.

1173
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,460
What in the name of everything holy is going on?

1174
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,560
What's going on?

1175
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:24,880
What's going on here?

1176
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,660
What's going on here?

1177
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,860
What that book says.

1178
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,160
Where are we?

1179
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,840
What are we?

1180
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,580
Who are we?

1181
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,080
Where are you?

1182
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,640
Where's everybody going?

1183
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,340
Who are you?

1184
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:46,920
A couple of very unimportant items seem to have eluded me, like who I am.

1185
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,440
Will you come out?

1186
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,120
You're a bad man.

1187
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,620
You're a very bad man.

1188
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,540
Yeah, I'm a bad man.

1189
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,540
You've got the answers.

1190
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:55,980
You be dead!

1191
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,340
You'd better start thinking happy thoughts.

1192
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,400
You get real people with answers.

1193
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,880
The time has come not to dissemble.

1194
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,840
We're too close to the actual rupture for that.

1195
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,080
That's right.

1196
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:14,020
We have to make a clean breast of all our sins, uh, put our foulnesses and abominations right here on the table.

1197
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,260
So you can see them and smell them.

1198
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,560
You guys can go first.

1199
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,360
This is the one song that you guys did all the way through.

1200
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,300
It's the only one that Sveaks could remember the words to.

1201
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,340
Hey everybody put your finger in your nose.

1202
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,240
Kick a pick a rock and wipe it on your clothes.

1203
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,380
I don't know how you feel one way or another.

1204
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,700
Kick a pick a rock and wipe it on your clothes.

1205
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,960
Kick a pick a rock and wipe it on your clothes.

1206
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:21,760
Hey everybody put your finger in your nose.

1207
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,240
Kick a pick a rock and wipe it on your clothes.

1208
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:26,960
It's the only one that you guys did all the way through.

1209
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:38,980
Kick a pick a rock and wipe it on your clothes.

1210
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,240
Everybody doin' it

1211
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:53,540
Pick a burger out and wrap it on your chewing hands

1212
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,980
Everybody doin' it, everybody doin' it

1213
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:24,660
Pick a burger, pick a burger

1214
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:32,440
Pick a burger, pick a burger

1215
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,900
Pick a burger, pick a burger

1216
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,840
I'm with this huge list.

1217
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:24,880
Pile this on me.

1218
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:28,260
It gets to a point where I can't even move anymore.

1219
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,280
Can't write.

1220
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,280
Can't read.

1221
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,260
Can't do anything except try to fight.

1222
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,500
Don't you see?

1223
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,880
Eddie, hang on.

1224
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,840
I've been around in circles till I think that I'm my fault.

1225
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,780
And if I take the step to the road, I'm walking down the wall.

1226
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,740
I don't know what to do.

1227
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,720
I don't know what to do.

1228
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,760
I don't know what to do.

1229
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:34,460
Little Theodore at 7X Day, and before that, the Acid Core at 7X Day, played back at 8X

1230
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:40,640
Day, the Acid Core, which is the combination of the amino acids heard here in the background

1231
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:46,460
and also at upcoming X Day festivals, and the Swinging Love Corpses, Christ Bob.

1232
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:57,760
Don't tune in, same time, same station, and don't listen to The Self Genius Hour of Swing.

1233
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,760
Miss tomorrow's exciting episode, fellows and girls.
