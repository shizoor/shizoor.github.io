1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
Peter was talking the other day, and they were talking about nanobytes and kilobytes,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,060
and I got god.com on my internet.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,800
Hell with that stuff, Dobbs.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,500
Dobbs is the ultimate computer with Dobbs.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,900
It's not Dada, but Dada.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,400
It's not Dada, it's Bulldada.

7
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,580
You launch this bit about how instead of ones and O's, it's B's and O's,

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,220
and the B's are kind of curved, and the ones that aren't quite an and and or gate,

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,260
or a plus or minus gate, it's kind of a minus and a sort of maybe minus sometimes gate,

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,600
which leads you to real strange conclusions a lot of the time.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,220
Yeah, that's how the alien computers work.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,920
Well, it's right, right, it's a stochastic resonant bob.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,660
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,320
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,460
The Self Genius Hour of Swatch.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,780
Welcome potential initiates and idiots,

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,720
and remain with us for the next...

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,260
...hour.

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,960
As we delve deeper and deeper into the infamous X-Day Drill tapes.

20
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:14,600
Yes, a couple of weeks ago, we just finished surviving the X-Day Drill 1996.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,940
They're at Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman, New York.

22
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,760
And there's so many tapes.

23
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,020
We're just going to start randomly going through these amazing preaching and music tapes

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,580
from this astounding event.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,420
Uh, this morning, let us say a big howdy to listeners at WREK in Atlanta.

26
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,040
Praise WREK.

27
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,580
And so we shall proceed with this WOTAN jam.

28
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,840
This is the Swingin' Love Corpses combined with Bill T. Miller and, uh,

29
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,500
I think Pastor Craig, the Luciferian Initiation Fund or something like that.

30
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,860
It's amazing. It's horrible.

31
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,180
And, uh...

32
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:56,520
Ooh.

33
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Oh, yeah, yeah.

34
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,460
Where's that prairie squid?

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,260
I wonder if we ought to...

36
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:29,860
Yeah, if we...

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,800
If we put the squid out today, he's going to be pretty used by tomorrow.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,960
And I don't want to have to throw him out before tomorrow

39
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,880
because I think we may unveil the squid on Saturday morning.

40
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,700
Because the squid is, you know, it's not going to live forever.

41
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,720
Yeah, I've got to figure out what to wear.

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,100
I really do have the squid, by the way.

43
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,440
I prefer the mountain squid.

44
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,920
Well, this is a Mississippi Delta squid,

45
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,720
which is not the...

46
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,800
They actually smell funny,

47
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,520
unlike a mountain squid or a straight prairie squid.

48
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,620
Well, the smell is an aphrodisiac all in itself.

49
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,880
Well, for some people.

50
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,360
No, the smell of a good rotting squid

51
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,260
inflames your pheromones all the way down.

52
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,140
It can twist up your DNA helix like an old mangled twist tie

53
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,640
if you're not careful, but the trip's an E-ticket.

54
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,340
Yeah.

55
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,880
So, which night should I get naked, Doug?

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,380
Huh?

57
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,880
Which night should I get naked?

58
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,320
Saturday.

59
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,080
Saturday.

60
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,160
Saturday night.

61
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,380
Okay, so I don't get...

62
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:29,980
Saturday night.

63
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,620
I don't get the squid on my bustier.

64
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,400
We're going to rape Bob.

65
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,580
Jesus is going to nail him to the cross.

66
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,180
The devil girl for Sunday morning.

67
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,360
There may be violence.

68
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,020
There may actually be violence,

69
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,260
and if you're running around naked,

70
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,020
that would inflame even greater levels.

71
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,360
And we did have violence that Saturday night.

72
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,900
At one point, Dr. Legume brought out a globe of the planet Earth,

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,100
a normal, like, classroom globe,

74
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,580
but it was filled with blood.

75
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,280
And he had it hanging from the rafters

76
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,560
and took him a great big ol' hammer,

77
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,180
a big ol' Wotan-type hammer,

78
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,620
smashed that globe open,

79
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,480
splattering blood all over the sex-ecutioner from Guar,

80
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,920
who had thought he was on vacation

81
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,400
from being covered with stage blood for once.

82
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,540
But no, no.

83
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,820
And then following that, Dr. Legume...

84
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,740
Well, let's just listen to the tapes.

85
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,200
We really did crucify, or start to crucify Jesus.

86
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,040
The Lord Jesus Christ, who actually was there at the X-Day drill,

87
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,360
and in fact works in this office now,

88
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,200
and at the last minute decided instead to crucify

89
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,080
our short-duration personal savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

90
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,900
So let us continue with those Saturday night recordings.

91
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,480
Yes.

92
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,600
Thank you, brothers and sisters.

93
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,840
Oh, yeah.

94
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,480
Oh, yeah, I got the whole world in my hands,

95
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,620
and we're gonna wipe it out in just two short years.

96
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,240
Yes!

97
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,480
Some of y'all might have got a little bit of blood splashed on you,

98
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,240
but not as much as you're gonna have then.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,900
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters,

100
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,660
we're living in an age where you will see

101
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,740
the corpse of the old world and the broken bones of time.

102
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,960
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.

103
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:29,960


104
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:29,960


105
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:29,960


106
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,800
Oh, yeah.

107
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,020
You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.

108
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,660
All you gotta do is follow the smoke.

109
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,160
Oh, yeah, because that smoke's gonna lead you right back

110
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,000
to J.R. Bob Dobbs' Mighty Pup.

111
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
Oh, yeah.

112
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,840
Oh, yeah.

113
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,900
The conspiracy's against you, brothers.

114
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,040
The conspiracy's against you, sisters.

115
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,860
Oh, yeah, they want you to play the game.

116
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,640
They want you to cut your hair.

117
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,960
Oh, yeah.

118
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,280
They want you to get a job.

119
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,400
They want you to behave.

120
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,120
They want you to obey.

121
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,680
They want you to die.

122
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,480
Oh, yeah, brothers and sisters.

123
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,080
It's a sign!

124
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,800
Oh, yeah.

125
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,740
The Earth's going 90 miles an hour down a dead-end street,

126
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
brothers and sisters.

127
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,740
90 miles an hour down a dead-end street.

128
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,280
And Bob is just ahead.

129
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,960
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.

130
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,380
Brothers and sisters.

131
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,100
Bob is just ahead.

132
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,040
Don't pass him by.

133
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,960
Run him down!

134
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,620
Whoo, brothers and sisters!

135
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,220
Whoo!

136
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,840
Oh, yeah.

137
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,240
Oh, yeah.

138
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,060
The time has come for our most unholy rituals.

139
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,600
Oh, yeah.

140
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,860
Oh, yeah, time is ticking away.

141
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,600
Time is ticking away.

142
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,580
Oh, yeah.

143
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,840
Got me a little calendar here.

144
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,220
Little visual aid for you.

145
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,800
Oh, my hands are so cold.

146
00:06:59,800 --> 00:06:59,960
Oh, my hands are so cold.

147
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,800
Got me a calendar.

148
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,240
It's an inspirational season's calendar.

149
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,140
It says on the inside here,

150
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,180
Upland Baptist Church.

151
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,700
But every day them Baptists

152
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,400
look up there on that wall

153
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,780
and watch the day go by.

154
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,000
There's a day.

155
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,140
There's a day.

156
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,580
There's a day.

157
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,580
They put that little X on their calendar.

158
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,520
But come July 5th, 1998,

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,260
it will be the final X.

160
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,640
X day, brothers and sisters.

161
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,120
And we're going to be there.

162
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,100
Can I get an amen?

163
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,420
Can I get a hallelujah?

164
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,920
Can I get a praise ball?

165
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,920
Oh yes, brothers and sisters.

166
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,180
I can see, I can see

167
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,960
the way that this is going to be going tonight.

168
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,020
Bob has lost his mighty pipe.

169
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,780
Whoo!

170
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,300
But we ain't going to let that stop us.

171
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,960
Oh no, brothers and sisters.

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We ain't going to let that stop us.

173
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,360
We're going to party on pipe or no pipe.

174
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:04,620
Whoo!

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,320
Ah!

176
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,880
Ah!

177
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,520
Ah!

178
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,820
Ah!

179
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,760
Everybody make some noise!

180
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,460
Everybody make some noise!

181
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,940
Legume now points out Jesus.

182
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,880
You stand accused, brother.

183
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,100
You stand accused of being Jesus.

184
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,980
And there's only one way I know of

185
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,940
that I could possibly...

186
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,660
could possibly deal with a man such as yourself.

187
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,080
Crucify him!

188
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,540
Crucify him!

189
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,360
Crucify him!

190
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,240
Crucify him!

191
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,300
Crucify, crucify, crucify!

192
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,920
Crucify him!

193
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:40,920


194
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:40,920


195
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:40,920


196
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,960
Crucify!

197
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,360
Jesus is now given the cross piece of the cross.

198
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,300
Grab that board, Pope Fred!

199
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,540
You, your cross piece brother.

200
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,300
You're getting dragged to the Golgotha!

201
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,100
Okay?

202
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,200
Crucify!

203
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,420
Crucify!

204
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,700
Now friends, it's difficult for me to explain the spectacle which now took place.

205
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:14,480
This crowd of subgeniuses followed Jesus, whipping him, scorching the Lord, yes,

206
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,520
walking slowly up the hill towards the Mount of Skulls that we had prepared up there

207
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,420
at the cost of several Bobby's logs.

208
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,720
Some of the subgeniuses are wearing masks that I handed out.

209
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:37,940
We had Satan, JFK, the Overman, and one of the Greys from the Gwar tour,

210
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:47,860
all whipping and chastising the poor Prince of Peace, who now works for me in this office,

211
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,360
all the way up the hill as the sun set.

212
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,260
Listen to the blood.

213
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,780
The thirst, the bloodlust.

214
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,180
Heal Jesus good!

215
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,540
Help him up!

216
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,640
Help him up, my friend!

217
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,180
Heal Jesus good!

218
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,100
Heal Jesus bad!

219
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,540
What is the law?

220
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,400
Oh, we must mend!

221
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,620
What is the law?

222
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,420
That you spill blood?

223
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,540
Now scourge him!

224
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,340
Here!

225
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,680
Crucify him!

226
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,200
Get up, you whips!

227
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,600
Get up, you whips!

228
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:20,860


229
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,480
Get up, Jesus!

230
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,220
Up you go, staggers!

231
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,880
Come on, Mr. Sleazy, promoter, businessman!

232
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,160
Oh yeah, Jesus thought he'd be a rock star this time!

233
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
Get him on down!

234
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,080
Deceive him!

235
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,600
You hear me, boy?

236
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,720
No mercy here!

237
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,820
No Samaritan's hair!

238
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,520
No son!

239
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,140
No!

240
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,380
The pinkest of the boys!

241
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,620
All right, who has the sacred hammer and the sacred nails?

242
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,660
We must make a choice.

243
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,120
Someone must die here today.

244
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,320
Perhaps it could be Jesus.

245
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,940
Perhaps, though, we should give him another chance.

246
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,280
Who has done even more?

247
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:54,400
Who has done even more?

248
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:54,400


249
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,240
Who has done even more harm to our...

250
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,480
Jesus has probably not harmed the...

251
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,680
He's trying to help.

252
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,560
He's trying to make up for what his followers did.

253
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,680
Crucify the boy!

254
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,220
He came to...

255
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,200
He was born again in this world, saw what his followers, his fan club had done, and

256
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,040
decided to try to make amends.

257
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,900
And so came to work for J.R. Bob Dobbs.

258
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,820
Spare him!

259
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,460
But...

260
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,280
Spare or spare?

261
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,500
We need to prove our faith by killing just another messiah, another long-duration personal

262
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,460
saviour, or shall it be...

263
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,800
Shall it be more in keeping?

264
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,280
Shall it give us more slack, perhaps?

265
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,520
To kill Bob!

266
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,500
Kill Bob!

267
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,420
Kill Bob!

268
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,540
Kill Bob!

269
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,280
Kill Bob!

270
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,600
Kill Bob!

271
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:41,600


272
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:41,860
Kill Bob!

273
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:41,880
Kill Bob!

274
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:41,880


275
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:48,660
Oh my God, listen to this horrible, even more bloodlust now, when the crowd is given

276
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,060
the opportunity to kill Bob.

277
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,280
The Dobbs effigy, a really good one.

278
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,180
Is...

279
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,020
Applying the sacred nails.

280
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,860
Is hammered into the cross by Jesus and Dr. Legume.

281
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,620
Jesus will get you!

282
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,360
Bob has given up his slack for all of us.

283
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,380
Bob wore polyester underwear.

284
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,080
Nail that...

285
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,300
Nail hard, Jesus!

286
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,880
You know what it feels like!

287
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,200
Jesus is actually more of a plumber these days.

288
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,840
Nail that pipe to his face!

289
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:23,260
Now Jesus and Legume are joined by Satan, not the person in the devil mask, but the

290
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,560
prophet El Diablo himself.

291
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,580
In their shared hatred of Bob Dobbs, the big brother and the little brother, so long rivals,

292
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,060
Satan and Jesus now cooperating.

293
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,360
It's a lovely sentiment, I suppose.

294
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,580
And now the sacred stump, hauled up here by the sacred slaves.

295
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,520
You all had to be killed, by the way, after hauling the sacred stump.

296
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,320
Now, shall we...

297
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,300
Brothers?

298
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,380
Brothers?

299
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,240
Who here will help me hoist J.R.

300
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,240


301
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,240


302
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,240


303
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,240


304
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,240


305
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,240


306
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,240


307
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,240


308
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,240


309
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,240


310
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,240


311
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,240


312
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,240


313
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,240


314
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,240


315
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,300
Bob Dobbs up to hang and die?

316
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,060
I will help you hang!

317
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,380
Oh, they're all so eager.

318
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,520
A thousand Jews killed him in a minute!

319
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:14,980
And so the cross is raised and hoisted on high, and Jesus and the overman, Philo and

320
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:21,560
myself, step forward to spit on Bob, gambling at the foot of the cross, rolling dice.

321
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:27,480
Susie the floozy was washing his feet with her hair, and then washing her armpits with

322
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,060
her hair.

323
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:28,900
Burn him!

324
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,140
Here is your chance, friends.

325
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,700
Why have you proceeded?

326
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,900
Are there any among us who would add another?

327
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,860
He thirsts.

328
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,960
Spit upon him.

329
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,180
There's no man among you!

330
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,540
He thirsts!

331
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,940
And they gave him vinegar.

332
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:48,660
And Dr. Legume sprays down the Dobbs effigy with starter fluid, in preparation for igniting

333
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,940
the gigantic cross.

334
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:50,980
Where he burned?

335
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:51,500
Where he burned?

336
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,060
Where he burned?

337
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,100
Where he burned?

338
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,460
And the Dobbs is ignited.

339
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,620
The flames leap into the air, as does the crowd.

340
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,260
It's a gorgeous sight, friends.

341
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:12,200
The Dobbs effigy, stuffed with children's pajamas by Dr. Legume, so as to be its most flammable,

342
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:18,800
lit up the eager faces of the worshippers as they watched the flesh of Dobbs melt and

343
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:19,580
splatter.

344
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,620
The

345
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,120
Dobbs effigy, stuffed with children's pajamas by Dr. Legume, so as to be its most flammable,

346
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:49,560
lit up the eager faces of the worshippers as they watched the flesh of Dobbs melt and

347
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:49,560


348
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,660
splatter.

349
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,280
The Dobbs effigy, stuffed with children's pajamas by Dr. Legume, so as to be its most flammable,

350
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,400
lit up the edge of Dobbs effigy, so as to be its most flammable, lit up the edge of Dobbs

351
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,420
effigy.

352
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,240
And then, we had to bring out too many little entschieden-to-be-mentioned subgeniuses with

353
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,240


354
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,920
Also, some subgeniuses brought out weenies and marshmallows and proceeded to barbeque

355
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,640
them off the burning Dobbs corpse.

356
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,560
The hell Jesus, now Jesus, now Jesus, now Jesus, now Jesus!

357
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,300
And then of course that wasn't enough.

358
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:15,360
And then we had to nail, we nigg'd on our deal and went ahead and killed Jesus as well,

359
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:15,700
friends.

360
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:22,060
It was such a lovely way of starting that Saturday Night Devival.

361
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,120
Actually, let's go on and see what else happened as we meandered back to the pavilion

362
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,140
where the Devival and the X-Day drill continued in progress apace.

363
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,020
Thank y'all.

364
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,720
I want you to know, all electronic gear, when I tap into the gear,

365
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:57,160
and I tap into Bob nightly, let me tell you, I tap into Bob 24-7.

366
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,280
And I'll let you know with our radionic equipment that Bob is doing just fine,

367
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,500
and he's got his hand in all your pocket.

368
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,280
So you make sure you cough up them dollars to Bob, or I'll basically strangle your ass.

369
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,980
He may be serious, I don't know.

370
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,360
He's new in the band.

371
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,040
Bob's jerking us off.

372
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,280
Let's play that song we practiced last week.

373
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,600
Yeah, let's play that one.

374
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,160
That one song that one guy taught us that one time.

375
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,580
Yeah, yeah, that one.

376
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,160
You know, last Wednesday night, we were sitting around on the fourth dimension.

377
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,760
My song, even though we'd never met, but we're so strong and down with Bob,

378
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,300
you don't need to be, you don't need to practice.

379
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,640
We can play through our noses, our Bob and our hearts.

380
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,680
Osmotic jamming.

381
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,320
Osmotic jamming.

382
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,300
Down with Bob.

383
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,280
If y'all are down with Bob, we're going to be there that day.

384
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,300
In numbers.

385
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,380
We're not going to be afraid.

386
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,960
We've got tomorrow with Bob in our hearts.

387
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,500
And if you got any frock, we'll smoke that before they come down, too.

388
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,460
We don't want to come down either, you know what I mean?

389
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:10,840
I don't know.

390
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,040
We don't want to come down either.

391
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:15,680
We don't want to come down either.

392
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,920
Osmotic jamming.

393
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,260
Or ecstatic jamming.

394
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,260
Osmotic jamming.

395
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,860
Osmotic jamming.

396
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,320
Osmotic jamming.

397
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:27,620


398
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,280
Osmotic jamming.

399
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,260
Hey, bring the damn band down behind me, boys.

400
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,520
Add!

401
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,100
Add!

402
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,380
Add!

403
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,260
Add!

404
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:42,640
Add!

405
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,020


406
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:43,580


407
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:43,620


408
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:43,620


409
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:43,840
Add!

410
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:43,920


411
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:43,920


412
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:43,920


413
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,460
Add!

414
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:44,460


415
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:44,600
Add!

416
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,040


417
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,040


418
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,400
Add!

419
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,260
Oh, yes, Reverend Susie the Floozy.

420
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,500
I know she's a very shy, withdrawn person,

421
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,360
and I don't want you to make her nervous or anything.

422
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,000
What's she going to do?

423
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,420
Susie's hardly ever been on stage before,

424
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,020
and this is like her first time in front of people.

425
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,260
I'd like to have a piece of her brain.

426
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,780
I know most of you probably came here from Atlanta

427
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,840
where you listen to Bob's Slack Time Funhouse,

428
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,800
the original Bob's Slack Time Funhouse radio show,

429
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,720
which name I stole from our website.

430
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,920
You bastard.

431
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,020
One at a time or all at once?

432
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,560
Can I stack them with one at a time?

433
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,820
Friends, sisters, Susan the Floozy.

434
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,540
Yes, give me that primetime religion, friends.

435
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,200
Oh, seekers, yeah, it's good enough for me.

436
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,040
Praise Bob.

437
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,540
Yeah.

438
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,520
Well, welcome to the Amy Sempleman Slack

439
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,960
Foursquare Temple Defiable Encounter Mutilation Center.

440
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,020
And Bob's Jack Shack back on Highway 69

441
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,260
on the way into town as our big sponsor.

442
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,920
So we're trying to stop there on the way back, okay?

443
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh, yeah, welcome, seekers, to the X-State Drill.

444
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,440
We're just teeming with Oregon energy.

445
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,320
We can feel the Xs coming up over there.

446
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,520
They're rising.

447
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,820
And it's a good feeling because Bob's in the mood for a second coming

448
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,560
and a third coming and a fourth coming,

449
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,780
which is the special down at Bob's after Jack and Shack.

450
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,500
Out of the way.

451
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:36,260
Although you did still have to spend extra for the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th coming,

452
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,080
but the 11th one is again free.

453
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,400
Oh, so seekers, yeah, get ready to cook.

454
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,380
Because we're getting drenched in the breadcrumbs of slack.

455
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,600
And Bob's is going to be rolling us up and deep frying us to a nice crackly, crispy crunch.

456
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,320
And we're going to taste good, dip, dip, potty, some honey, butter, mustard.

457
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,260
Oh, I can't wait to eat that chunk of black.

458
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,180
Me neither.

459
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,400
Oh, so lucky upon this kettle of fish, oh, ye mighty, and despair, despair, big, too.

460
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,900
Because X-Day is on the way.

461
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,560
Oh, yeah, you can laugh about it right now, but it's just too short for your seekers.

462
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,240
And what are you going to do then?

463
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,900
What are you going to do when the Krypton lasers are slashing the skies overhead?

464
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,000
Where are you going to plug your laptops in then, huh?

465
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,940
All right.

466
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,500
I've done a little bit of thinking about it.

467
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,020
And now I figure the best way to do it is to take that despair.

468
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,340
Take that despair and fold it.

469
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,280
Double it back upon itself.

470
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,780
Fold it like this.

471
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,440
Origami.

472
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,380
Into a Googleplex of slack.

473
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,820
Slack sent straight from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

474
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,460
Yes.

475
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:58,020
Oh, they may have burned his body, but they didn't burn his baby.

476
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:07,380
I mean, they can't burn his dream.

477
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,360
And as wet as that dream is,

478
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,720
we've got to follow it, seekers.

479
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,960
We've got to follow it every step of the way.

480
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,900
Because that's what my ministry is all about.

481
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,320
Yes.

482
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,100
I want you to take that despair and crack it like a whip.

483
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,960
Use it against the world.

484
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,140
Because when you're absolutely on the bottom,

485
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,100
there's nowhere else to go but up.

486
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,140
Unless you can dig.

487
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,400
And you're a deeper pit.

488
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,360
And Bob is that divine entrenching tool

489
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,560
that enables you to steam shovel your way out of your troubles

490
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,380
until you blast out the other side.

491
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,160
Preaching.

492
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,260
Preaching.

493
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,740
Oh, preaching.

494
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,080
Yes.

495
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,820
So that's what my ministry is all about, your seekers.

496
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,040
Because I'm handing out shovels, sinners and sinnerettes.

497
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,220
You there, take this garden trowel and see what you can do.

498
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,340
Sister, there's a Bobcat front-end loader waiting for you at the end of the day.

499
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:11,340


500
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:11,340


501
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:19,000
You there, take this hoe and don't treat her too rough.

502
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,820
And let's see what we can do to help Bob along.

503
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,400
Because we need to wake up and smell the slack.

504
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,020
We're all getting older and today is the first day of our last hurrah.

505
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,520
And you better start living like it is.

506
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,320
Because if you don't, you're not going to live.

507
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,320


508
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,220
And if you don't, there'll be nobody to blame but you.

509
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,440
You can't blame the nasty old Amhadona conspiracy.

510
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,920
Because we're down here on the street corner.

511
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,980
We're in that ice cream truck of slack.

512
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,720
You hear that little ding-dee-ring-dee bell ringing.

513
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:04,240
And you figure, oh, I'll come down later and get on Reverend Susie's gospel bus for Bob.

514
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:10,160
Yeah, there ain't that whole much that much later to go around, seekers.

515
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,220
Yeah.

516
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,620
You can't monkey with her because the lifetime supply's not that good a deal anymore.

517
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,600
So it's time to get right with Bob.

518
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,760
Get left with Bob.

519
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,020
Get in and out with Bob.

520
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,500
Up and down with Bob.

521
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,060
Yeah.

522
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Yes, baby.

523
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:38,920
Because if you don't come next day, Neagie is going to be munching your well-buttered butt like a Betty Fwock.

524
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,300
So don't go crying to me.

525
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,980
Praise Bob!

526
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:43,680
Yeah!

527
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,180
Oh, Susie!

528
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,020
Oh!

529
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,400
Yeah!

530
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,200
Oh!

531
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,140
Yeah!

532
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,500
Oh, oh, Jesus.

533
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,560
Yes, perhaps the goddess is right.

534
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,120
Or left.

535
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:08,480
Who, who laid, who put, as Susie said earlier, who put the lay?

536
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,220
In Dr. Lake Hume.

537
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,480
What?

538
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,440
Who put the Hume in Dr. Lake Hume?

539
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,660
Oh, uh, Father Joe Malman, is that you standing over there in the dark?

540
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,340
Yes, you do.

541
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:20,940
Yes.

542
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,580
It seems how the band members don't seem to have enough air.

543
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,360
All drunk, half-way passed out now already, I guess, after Bill Miller.

544
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,480
Oh, and the Luciferian Liberation Front, of course.

545
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,740
No, we have to leave.

546
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,120
And?

547
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Friends?

548
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,680
You may think it could be a long night, yes.

549
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,040
It could be a much longer two years.

550
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:50,920
If you don't get straight, get right with Bob and listen to the word this time of the great Papa Joe Mama.

551
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,120
Praise Papa Joe Mama!

552
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,400
Yeah!

553
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,840
Yeah!

554
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:55,860
Yeah!

555
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,100
Yeah!

556
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,300
Yeah!

557
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:58,800
Yeah!

558
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,380
Yeah!

559
00:25:59,380 --> 00:25:59,380


560
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:05,400
In 1941, the German death routine roamed over Europe with difficult efficiency.

561
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,380
Death to the Untermenschen, destruction of all inferior subcultures.

562
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:14,920
Long live the Reich, the German Reich, that will last for a thousand years.

563
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:22,320
At the head of that crazed war was one Adolf Hitler, a maniac determined to have world domination.

564
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,480
He started his revolution in the early 30s, carried a plague through the streets.

565
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,100
He was shot by his own police force and hauled off to prison.

566
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,040
Many of his comrades were also shot.

567
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,880
Their blood was splattered on the very plague that he carried through the streets.

568
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,780
That plague was later called the blood plague.

569
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,740
He used it to anoint all of the guidance in the Reich.

570
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,740
When the war came to a close in 1945, the word was out.

571
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,260
Quote Stalin, bring me back the blood plague!

572
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,280
The Soviets swarmed over Berlin searching for the plague.

573
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:03,020
Even though every major leader in Nazi Germany was brought to justice, the blood plague was still there.

574
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,020


575
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,940
The blood plague was never found.

576
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,860
It's still out there, my friends.

577
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,740
And now, we too, have blood on our legs.

578
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,380
This blood comes from that world, a replica, a symbol of the world we shall conquer.

579
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,880
Only we will not be conquered by any allies, of normals or pinks.

580
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,840
For we have here a sacred document of our own.

581
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,940
A document which I would like to read.

582
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,680
I will read it to you now.

583
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,520
It's entitled, Watering Down Dobbs.

584
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:51,560
Because it's my sad duty to report to you, friends, that even as I speak, the conspiracy has embarked on a sinister plan of subgenus genocide.

585
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,220
Yes, my dear friends, that means you and me, brothers and sisters in the faith,

586
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,920
are involved in a sinister plot against us devised by the conspiracy

587
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,160
to undermine our great genetic heritage.

588
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,240
It is a true punch below the belt, for that is precisely their target.

589
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,820
To sabotage our seed.

590
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,520
To pervert our progeny.

591
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,800
For the conspiracy is set out to destroy our race by robbing our men of their precious bodily fluids.

592
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,060
Are we going to allow that?

593
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,840
No!

594
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,040
Did I hear a hell no?

595
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,300
Hell no!

596
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,160
Hell no!

597
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,240
Yet, as disgusting as it is to contemplate, it is true.

598
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:44,720
They ought to inbreed with us, forcing Bob to let the remains of their lineage live so that half of his own flock may flourish.

599
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,540
But they don't know Bob, do they?

600
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,720
He would rather die a fourth time than let the con continue.

601
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,900
They've hogged the hell long enough, and look at the mess they've made.

602
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,700
Just look at it.

603
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,660
Disgusting as it is, it's all theirs, and they are to blame, are they not?

604
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,580
Hell yes!

605
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,660
Only Bob has the courage to take a steady hand in the helm and lead us through the reef.

606
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,900
Only Bob is a leader that can fight the current.

607
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,880
A captain who can keep the ship on course.

608
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,880
That captain is Bob.

609
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,740
And that ship is the Exus Fighting Class Star Cruiser.

610
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,120
Both man and machine are en route right this instant at full light speed.

611
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,500
They shall arrive in two years hence.

612
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:43,300
But what, you might ask, would good old Captain Bob think if he arrives and finds his crew fraternizing with the enemy?

613
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:53,340
Hugging them, kissing them, and, Bob forbid, doing the waterbed backstroke.

614
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,360
You simply cannot do this with members of the opposite sect.

615
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,380
This is not a rhetorical question, friends.

616
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:10,360
It's already happening all over the world thanks to the conspiracy mass marketing campaign to love one another in the name of tolerance.

617
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,960
Oh, the hypocrisy.

618
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,400
The hypocrisy!

619
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:21,400
How can the conspiracy, who routinely persecuted our people throughout history, even pronounce the word tolerance with a straight face?

620
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:28,300
They should fear being struck by lightning for daring to remind Jehovah of their crimes against the chosen race.

621
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:28,840
But no.

622
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:28,980
No.

623
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,400
Now that the industry, they pretend to be our friends.

624
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,640
Oh, and are they not our friends?

625
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,120
Well, they're not.

626
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,340
And, uh, Papa Jo Mama will continue.

627
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,420
They pretend to be our friends.

628
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,280
They say the subgenies are intolerant because we don't want our children reproducing with their ilk.

629
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,960
They call us old fashioned because we don't want to dumb down to their level.

630
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,000
They taunt us.

631
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,200
They label us.

632
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,620
They claim we're out of touch.

633
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,200
Well?

634
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,820
Perhaps we are out of touch.

635
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:07,540
Or perhaps, just maybe, they're mad because we don't want to touch them.

636
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,580
But that's not our fault, friends.

637
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,760
It's theirs.

638
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,400
I mean, just look at them.

639
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:21,740
They're like filthy little rats scrambling through the maze of life in search of the cheese quiz they smell but can't find.

640
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,820
They never suspect that the conspiracy moves the goal every time they near it.

641
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:32,380
Nor do they notice that the clever ones of them are busy, abducted, and dissected to discover what went wrong.

642
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,840
No, sir.

643
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,700
These lowly creatures actually think they are worthy of our company.

644
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,400
Nay, they are cruel to us all.

645
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,700
Now, now, we don't like to be cruel to animals.

646
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,120
But we don't even really want to hurt their feelings.

647
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,340
But really, what else can we say?

648
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,880
Vermin are vermin and there's no two ways about it.

649
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,620
Hell yeah!

650
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,820
Even if we could love them.

651
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,880
Like, say, a pet.

652
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,340
What would be the point?

653
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,080
We'd still have to kill them once X-Day arrives.

654
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,280
I mean, otherwise the X's won't come.

655
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,980
After all, who wants property that's infested with rats?

656
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,040
Do you want property infested with rats?

657
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:12,900
Hell no!

658
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,140
Do you want property infested with pigs?

659
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,360
Hell no!

660
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,240
Hell no!

661
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,020
So please, let's be reasonable about this.

662
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,800
I mean, let the normals enjoy the last few minutes.

663
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,580
Let them enjoy the last few days with their own kind.

664
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,020
We'll smile and we'll be patient.

665
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,860
We'll even open the doors for the women.

666
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,020
And we'll let their men cut in front of us on the highway.

667
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,660
But we can't let them taint our race with their own bloodlines.

668
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,560
That just won't do.

669
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,980
If they want to mix their blood with someone else's,

670
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,320
just tell them to wait till X-Day.

671
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,440
There'll be plenty of blood mixing then.

672
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,720
Why, some of that blood may even be ours.

673
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,420
Why, sure.

674
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,460
We expect them to struggle.

675
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,220
We'd do the same if we were in their shoes.

676
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,060
I think it's only sporting.

677
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,200
We'll give them the same chance that they gave us when they were in charge.

678
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,240
Like they say, fair's fair.

679
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,080
So let's be honest with one another.

680
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,880
Our separation has nothing to do with intolerance or hate.

681
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,460
It's just plain common sense.

682
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,400
Why would anyone want to become friends and mix with the mud race

683
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,780
when a storm's coming that's gonna wash all the dirt down the drain?

684
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,280
We can be as sympathetic as anyone else.

685
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,880
But don't ask us to be stupid.

686
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,900
When you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas.

687
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,100
It's as simple as that.

688
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,340
There's no such thing as safe sex with the normal.

689
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,380
Unless, of course, you're necrophiliac.

690
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,620
We don't believe in getting pinks a single inch of what they want.

691
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,120
Let alone ten.

692
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,300
Because we know whatever's pink on the outside

693
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,880
is usually pink on the inside.

694
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,820
Now me?

695
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,400
I'm just an humble preacher.

696
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,160
But I say it is more blessed to spill your seed

697
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,020
than to plant it on cursed ground.

698
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,120
Stamp out the noxious weed of normalcy

699
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,040
and sow the earth that gives it root.

700
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,820
For if thy penis sins against thee,

701
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,320
cut it off and cast it away.

702
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:24,060
For what profit the body that perish for the part?

703
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,120
Hearing is the word of all praise, Bob!

704
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,320
Praise Bob!

705
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,280
Felt good.

706
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,940
And now we have a few words from

707
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,900
Who Shall Stand Forth Reverend Stang.

708
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,140
However, those of you who are alt-flaggers

709
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,720
will most surely be ready to hear the

710
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,860
four-dimensional preaching

711
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,180
of the great Dr. Dinosaur.

712
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,000
The silverback,

713
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,300
the, the, the, the

714
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,540
oldest and wisest of all the alt-flaggers,

715
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,140
on there since before the internet even began.

716
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,520
Again, accompanied here by Steve Slack.

717
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,400
I have no earthly idea what is about to happen.

718
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,660
Except for that. I knew that was going to happen.

719
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,360
And so, Dr. Dinosaur is Steve Slack.

720
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,660
And now, the great Dr. Slag.

721
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:27,860
He is the one who will be

722
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:27,860


723
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:27,860


724
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:27,860


725
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:27,860


726
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,940
Well, praise Bob, brothers and sisters,

727
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,660
I'm glad to see y'all here.

728
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,180
And I'm really glad to hear you enjoying the Nanjon music.

729
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,540
It's kind of rough for some of the big folks out there,

730
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,420
and even some of the unsaved Yeti,

731
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,180
to understand it all.

732
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,440
And we're here because we know.

733
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,920
Well, now, what do we do about those folks that don't know yet?

734
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,380
Like the book says, there's a lot of unsaved Yeti out there.

735
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,600
Some of this coming on is awful weird, don't you think?

736
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,620
Oh, yeah.

737
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,280
Well, it damn well better be.

738
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,700
You don't want it to be normal, do ya?

739
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,420
No!

740
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,540
Well, they can't quite handle it.

741
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,580
So, sometimes we gotta come on to them in a way

742
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,240
that they can understand a little bit better.

743
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

744
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,240
Back when I got started,

745
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,500
coffee houses and whatnot were in vogue.

746
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,920
You could hear all kinds of music from guys sitting down with guitars like this.

747
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,220
Well, it's time we do a little outreach to some of those folks

748
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,200
who think they're still kind of normal.

749
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,840
It sounds a little more normal,

750
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,720
but it's by Bob!

751
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,260
Bob the Worst Slack!

752
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,260
Yeah!

753
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:39,680
Yeah!

754
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,120
Hear that?

755
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:43,980
Yeah.

756
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:46,880
Yeah.

757
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,600
Yeah.

758
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:49,900
Yeah.

759
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:49,900


760
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:49,900


761
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:49,900


762
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,500
Well, what good would a church be without a hymn?

763
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,260
Yeah!

764
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:52,600
Yeah!

765
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,840
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you a hymn.

766
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,320
Yeah!

767
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,240
For the Church of the Subgenius.

768
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:07,220
Oh, Yeti sinned from ancient times.

769
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:07,220


770
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:07,220


771
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:13,760
Walk unto Dallas seeking grain.

772
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:26,380
And was the smiling face of God's on myriad sea rocks seen?

773
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:33,020
And in the grim and pipe divine,

774
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:39,940
summon the wool on which to pull.

775
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:50,680
And, Worse of Genii, I summon Tear to praise Bob and be slack-full.

776
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:57,600
Bring me my pine with burning gold.

777
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,940
Bring me my salesman's holy fruit.

778
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,000


779
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:09,740
Bring me my slack, this I must have.

780
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,040
Bring me my saucers of release.

781
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:29,160
I will yet feed my mental life upon the pigs throughout the land.

782
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,860
Yeti, awake!

783
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,400
Atlantis, rise!

784
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:39,300
And we shall ponder into sand.

785
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,720
For folks born who can't whiff a thing

786
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,920
Ooh, they got no foot plan

787
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,980
When the saucers land on the roof

788
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,280
They'll stick their heads in the sand

789
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,320
It ain't me, it ain't me

790
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,560
I ain't no human son, no, no

791
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,580
It ain't me, it ain't me

792
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,780
I ain't no little pink one

793
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,000
Some folks are born with no wife at all

794
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,280
All they got's one soul

795
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,220
And when the exes take him on board

796
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,380
They'll be down in the hole

797
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,520
It ain't me, it ain't me

798
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,280
I ain't no me puppet son, no, no, no

799
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,960
It ain't me, it ain't me

800
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,360
I ain't no little pink one

801
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,200
¶¶

802
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,600
¶¶

803
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:10,820
¶¶

804
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,060
¶¶

805
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,800
¶¶

806
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,300
Some folks in Harry's know yet his genes

807
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,700
Ain't like you and me

808
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,640
I say we go grab the chainsaw

809
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,240
Kill that evolutionary tree

810
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,860
It ain't me, it ain't me

811
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,620
¶¶

812
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,080
I ain't no me puppet son

813
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,560
¶¶

814
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:37,060
No, no, no, it ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't a little pink one, no.

815
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:12,400
Anybody who hasn't heard it, I know this hurts, but 7 o'clock tomorrow morning, 8 hours from now, I'm going to be here for my main little rant.

816
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,260
Actually, you should be here about 6.30, or a quarter of, so we can get the pills passed out to everybody.

817
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:25,080
As I said before, don't touch those pills before 7 o'clock when we announce that exact time.

818
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,020
I believe I had somebody who had the correct time.

819
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,960
Those pills simulate the rupture.

820
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,580
And it's important that we all be sort of in sync.

821
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,720
If they last exactly 51 seconds, we will be timing that.

822
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,660
And we'll probably do a little bit of chanting and so forth.

823
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,480
I'm saving most of my ex-day stuff tomorrow.

824
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,060
It says here, don't reveal too much, okay?

825
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:53,580
Put flyers in bathroom, trash, the sacred trash bags, remember your recycling and so forth.

826
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:58,880
I don't want to have to apologize to Brushwood for the messy, sloppy, anti-ecological subgeniuses.

827
00:41:59,480 --> 00:41:59,880
Yeah!

828
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,220
Yeah!

829
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:00,540
Yeah!

830
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:00,540


831
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:00,540


832
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,160
Should have the iron on wings of slack tattoos tomorrow when the sales table is open.

833
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:12,120
And as a sort of a contrast, a counterpoint, shall we say, to the good Dr. Dinosaur.

834
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:20,620
Now, I think the bad Reverend Nikki Death Chick has a little activity planned,

835
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,620
which she may be inviting volunteers up here.

836
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:29,340
Reverend Nikki Death Chick, the latest new employee of the Great Subgenius Foundation.

837
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,020
Thank you.

838
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,340
Reverend Nikki Death Chick.

839
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,780
I don't really have a lot to say.

840
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,280
I just have a few things to do.

841
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,020
I just want to say a few things about guilt.

842
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,320
Guilt is the conspiracy's way of preventing you from gaining slack.

843
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,380
We don't need guilt.

844
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,320
We need a way to remove guilt.

845
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,300
In the conspiracy's religions, there is a system of punishment that they give to you.

846
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:59,120
I have devised a ritual in the Church of the Subgenius whereby you not only get your guilt removed by punishment,

847
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,000
purification,

848
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:00,940
through pain,

849
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,620
but you get slack through the benefits of the punishment,

850
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,500
and Bob benefits as well because you tithe unto Bob

851
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:19,420
when you donate a love offering to me for administering upon you the Subgenius spanking ritual.

852
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,900
I need volunteers right now.

853
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,740
Scores.

854
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:29,740
Who will be able to come up here and give me a love offering to spank them and remove?

855
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,200
Their hideous guilt.

856
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,160
Who is it?

857
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,360
Come forth.

858
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:34,580
Yes.

859
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,980
I am guilty.

860
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,420
What are you guilty of?

861
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,620
Oh, you name it, honey.

862
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,940
I just, I tell you what, I love to be punished.

863
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:49,640
I really, I really enjoyed being tied up last night by those great, big, strong women.

864
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,540
I like to see strong, strong women.

865
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,320
I don't like weak women.

866
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,640
I'm a weak man.

867
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,000
I'm not a bad man.

868
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,740
I'm just a very bad, sacred.

869
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:00,360
These are just some of my favorite things.

870
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:00,660
I'm never going to be described as a right man.

871
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,600
You gotta put your hands up, hands up, on the podium.

872
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,060
Okay.

873
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,260
Do you feel the guilt?

874
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,640
Do you feel it?

875
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:08,940
I want the guilt.

876
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:10,860
Harder.

877
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:11,720
Harder.

878
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,200
Do you feel the guilt leaving?

879
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,780
Do you feel it?

880
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,180
Do you feel the guilt leaving?

881
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,220
Good.

882
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:17,780
Good.

883
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,380
More, more.

884
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,080
Let's go.

885
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,420
Oh, God.

886
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,200
Yes.

887
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:25,860
Thank you.

888
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:26,560
Thank you.

889
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:26,700
Thank you.

890
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:27,680
You're welcome.

891
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,360
Okay.

892
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,200
Anybody else?

893
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:34,880
Come on, come on, give it to me, give it up, give it up, right now.

894
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,240
I didn't have to say what I was guilty of.

895
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,940
Well, tell me, what are you guilty of?

896
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,880
I want to be obeyed by a thousand different women every day.

897
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,720
That's very, very bad.

898
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,180
Do you need more?

899
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,040
Uh, that's enough.

900
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,340
Okay, give it up.

901
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,600
Okay, anybody else?

902
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,640
Come on now, anybody else?

903
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,720
I want another one.

904
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,700
Okay, come on.

905
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,060
Oh, they're okay.

906
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,800
Oh, what?

907
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:25,900
Oh, if there are any even bigger, stronger women, I still feel a little bit too much guilt.

908
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,960
Time for some violence.

909
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,160
Oh, some sex and violins.

910
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,420
Oh, it's gotta be bad.

911
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,960
Did I court your place for clay?

912
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:36,540
Yeah.

913
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:53,680
Can you learn some Phil Washington speak?

914
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:53,940
Let me get changes here.

915
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:53,940


916
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:54,540
Let's see...

917
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,680
firefighter while all other things are this, so...

918
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,260
back to normal.

919
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:56,260


920
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:56,300
was that it It looks at

921
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,620
And it's going to

922
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,380
It's going to

923
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,340
he�로

924
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,080
what do you think?

925
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:03,760
You'll do great.

926
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,380
that's awesome.

927
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,100
Love you and take care of yourself.

928
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:05,300
Bye.

929
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:05,840
Bye bye.

930
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,380
Bye bye.

931
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:06,420
See you.

932
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,760
Bob is a rabbi!

933
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,100
Help!

934
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,120
Yes!

935
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,540
You're a lot closer than you even think!

936
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,020
Bob is the way!

937
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,300
Bob is the path!

938
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,060
Believe or die!

939
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,220
Oh no!

940
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,600
Oh my god!

941
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,500
Don't kill us, you fucking ball-digger!

942
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,140
Jesus!

943
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,320
Bob is not the answer!

944
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,220
And neither is A.J. Graff!

945
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,320
He's ripped me out for all my sake!

946
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

947
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,520
No, not yet!

948
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,580
Bob, Bob!

949
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,280
You're gonna have to work harder than that!

950
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,440
The power of Bob compels you!

951
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,340
The power of Bob compels you!

952
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,180
He's a pink boy!

953
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,940
Bob is the apple of my eyes!

954
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,540
He loves you, Bob is kind!

955
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,340
He gets all the crap!

956
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,040
He gets all the women, and he gets all the slack!

957
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,540
This may be true,

958
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,920
but how would you get slagged if Bob

959
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,280
does not first have all the slack?

960
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,820
I want my slack! I want to kill Bob!

961
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,180
Maybe you have a choice, uh, maybe, maybe you have a choice.

962
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,360
Come on, join me! Kill Bob!

963
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,020
Kill Bob! Kill Bob!

964
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,500
Kill Bob!

965
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,960
Kill Bob! Kill Bob!

966
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,320
Kill Bob!

967
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,860
Kill Bob!

968
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,640
Bob's a conspiracy patty!

969
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,120
It's true.

970
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,320
Bob faked his own crucifixion so he could be resurrected

971
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,040
and become your personal savior!

972
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,000
We need to kill him for real this time!

973
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,260
Grab your finger, Bob, and whack his little head off!

974
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,740
This is not a joke!

975
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:25,440
This is not a joke!

976
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,500
It feels so good!

977
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,500
Bunkie-Doh is lining up for the fight!

978
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,520
Oh my god! He actually got him!

979
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,440
Kill Bob!

980
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,040
Kill Bob!

981
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,380
Kill Bob!

982
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,860
Kill Bob!

983
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,620
Oh my god, his eyes are rolling!

984
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,500
The mannequin head is almost totally destroyed!

985
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,980
A $50 mask is senselessly good!

986
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,020
Kill Bob!

987
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:48,960
Kill Bob!

988
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:49,380
Kill Bob!

989
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,020
By the power of Bob,

990
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,240
I've cast out the control!

991
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,640
I've cast out the conspiracy demons of the

992
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,340
rude McDonald's clerks!

993
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,900
The conspiracy demons of

994
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,380
blabbering Bobby assholes!

995
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,180
I've cast out the conspiracy demons of

996
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,320
people who don't buy OBE CDs!

997
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,880
I've cast out

998
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,660
the conspiracy demons that have been

999
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,500
holding this man down!

1000
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,760
I've cast them out!

1001
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,460
The power of Bob compels you!

1002
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,560
The power of Bob compels you!

1003
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:21,520
The power of Bob compels you!

1004
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,280
Save baby!

1005
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,120
Save! Save!

1006
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:26,680
Save him, Andy!

1007
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,140
High Drop!

1008
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:27,220
Arggh!

1009
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,260
It's only one thing to do!

1010
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:33,980
Baseball!

1011
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,320
Baseball!

00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:50,340


1015
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,220
Please fill me in head first

1016

1017
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:51,220


1018
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:51,700
I promise to have Ylva!

1019
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,420
Gratitude!

1020
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:54,520
we have a very special guest

1021
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,320
brought all the way up here from Oklahoma

1022
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,160
and a crate. Is she still here?

1023
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,320
Tarla Stark.

1024
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,240
The home of man.

1025
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,040
The symbol of the internet.

1026
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:10,340
The Suzie the floozy of old slap.

1027
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,680
Do it! Do it!

1028
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,600
Yes baby, I give it up.

1029
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,280
To Sister Tarla Stark.

1030
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:18,880
Woo!

1031
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,360
Ladies, gentlemen, and sisters.

1032
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,080
Tarla, Tarla, Tarla.

1033
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,980
So let's heat things up. I heard you all like sex.

1034
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,160
Yes!

1035
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:32,960
Give us sex!

1036
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,120
Well why don't we do this one.

1037
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,940
Hot, sweet chocolate.

1038
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,660
Dip a finger in and lick it off.

1039
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,100
Candied oranges with a jelly bean in between.

1040
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,080
Red hots, hot to try.

1041
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,740
Gobble it up sweet.

1042
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:48,980
Spicy.

1043
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,120
Served on a lace panty.

1044
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,780
A neck of wafer wedged in marshmallow.

1045
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,440
Fat free, sugar free.

1046
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,760
Endlessly renewable.

1047
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,160
Have your bonbon and eat it too.

1048
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,340
Praline in meringue.

1049
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,100
Jordan almond wrapped in divinity.

1050
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,840
Don't worry about it getting too hot.

1051
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,200
It melts in your mouth as well as your hand.

1052
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:10,120
Woo!

1053
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,300
There's a little tattoo on the candy store door.

1054
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,440
It says, thank you for coming.

1055
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,700
Have a nice day.

1056
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,420
Yes!

1057
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,340
Sister Tarla!

1058
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,000
Yes!

1059
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,000


1060
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,080
Yes!

1061
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:25,100
Woo!

1062
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,660
Give us more sluts, sister!

1063
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,400
Yes!

1064
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,180
Let me do a little bit of a piece of something to my favorite herb.

1065
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,600
And I believe yours.

1066
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,680
Oh, never cross your words.

1067
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,500
Garlic?

1068
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:42,940
This one I call Mary Jane.

1069
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,360
Sweet girl, I have loved you for so long now.

1070
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,260
You are in my heart.

1071
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:48,500
You are in my blood.

1072
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,260
My comfort, my sanity, my red haired vixen.

1073
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,220
I love the scent of you.

1074
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,300
The taste of you.

1075
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,160
Bitter and smoky sweet.

1076
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,640
In the darkness, I open myself up to you.

1077
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,900
Roll you with my eager fingers.

1078
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:03,980
Swallow you down.

1079
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,480
There is never enough.

1080
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,640
Those withered men who call us names and scorn our love.

1081
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,720
They will pass from this time.

1082
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,000
Taking their chains and blindness in tow.

1083
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,680
And on that green day,

1084
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,240
those of us who have been with you for so long,

1085
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,520
who have been true and faithful,

1086
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,700
who have cradled you through the nightfall,

1087
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,740
shared you in secret and called you sister, lover,

1088
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,560
will set you aflame.

1089
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,040
Burning, burning, burning.

1090
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:29,960
Yeah!

1091
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,620
This is my kind of poetry, man.

1092
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,760
This is a little piece I like to give

1093
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,260
Stange's daughter credit for too,

1094
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,900
because she gave me the title.

1095
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,620
This is Wake Up and Smell the Dead.

1096
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,220
There's a place I own in Stange,

1097
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,760
a place I have hidden inside you.

1098
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,440
A place where in retrospect you will believe

1099
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,200
that my smile was the brightest,

1100
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,820
my eyes the wickedest,

1101
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,660
my mouth the most cunning,

1102
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,480
and my wit the most cunning and urbane.

1103
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,520
My mouth will become in memory

1104
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,980
the most cunning creation that God ever laid his hand to.

1105
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,540
You came to me young.

1106
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,400
What did you expect?

1107
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,300
A tabula-rosy girl with an empty head

1108
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,760
and a dewy heart,

1109
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,920
ready to be filled with lies?

1110
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,380
Well, I could have been that.

1111
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,320
I could have been a playboy,

1112
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,800
a powder puffed tail like a searchlight

1113
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,720
to draw your eyes and make you squirm.

1114
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,840
I could have been nothing more

1115
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,880
than a soft well of cleavage,

1116
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,620
a warm wet fantasy

1117
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,760
with moist lips,

1118
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,760
an easy to understand vocabulary

1119
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,380
and a list of hobbies that always included fellatio.

1120
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,860
I could have been the kind of woman who pretended

1121
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,660
to enjoy the burgeoning bludgeon

1122
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,180
inside your heart-shafted remarks.

1123
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,800
I could have been there.

1124
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,480
I could have been on Oprah or Sally

1125
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,940
or Jenny or Montel,

1126
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,480
or the trailer park woe,

1127
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,440
wearing a hard, thin line of black around my eyes

1128
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,740
in my best K-mark

1129
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,560
Jacqueline Smith rhinestone sweater,

1130
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,700
tawdry but teachable,

1131
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,100
a girl to be saved

1132
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,380
and molded gently into a tight, quiet prisoner,

1133
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,140
afraid of losing everything I had learned to need,

1134
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,680
faking orgasms

1135
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,680
and making up for it later

1136
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,860
with a charge card,

1137
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,280
a home shopping network,

1138
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,040
a stash bottle of Jack Daniels

1139
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,200
and a Panasonic dual speed.

1140
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,980
I could have done that.

1141
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,440
I could have been so in love with the word

1142
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,480
that you would have had to take me in the library stacks

1143
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,300
smearing Joyce and Thomas,

1144
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,660
yes, Hemingway himself,

1145
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,860
with the pearly effluvient of our literary passion.

1146
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,700
I could have loved the word so much

1147
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,700
that I would have walked around with pebbles in my pockets

1148
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,060
mumbling like Virginia Woolf

1149
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,860
or cooing quietly to myself

1150
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,880
like a pigeon on the grass, alas.

1151
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,920
And because I could not stop for sex,

1152
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,880
it would kindly stop for me.

1153
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,660
I would have been so grateful for your instruction

1154
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,440
that I, Easton Inn, would be put to shame

1155
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,560
and praised at your research skills.

1156
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,080
I could have been that.

1157
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,140
I could have been any one of a number of fantasies,

1158
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,740
an interesting side path

1159
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,600
on whatever idea you had of perfect love.

1160
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,860
But I was none of those things and more.

1161
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,200
I was the thing you never dreamed of,

1162
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,380
the thing that made you wake up in the night

1163
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,060
wondering at the newness of it all.

1164
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,740
Plaid boy,

1165
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,640
all straight lines and intervals

1166
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,280
and expectations

1167
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,140
you could have never predicted me.

1168
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,540
And since you didn't kill me when I left,

1169
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,580
I guess you'll have to love me till I die.

1170
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,120
Whooo!

1171
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,360
Yes!

1172
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,180
Can you get a drink of water

1173
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,060
before I do one last piece?

1174
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,480
I'd like to close this evening's

1175
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,360
cultural renditions

1176
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,280
with the Industrial Church of

1177
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:32,860
Love and Money.

1178
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,900
My ticket to salvation

1179
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,300
is a 3 x 2 inch square

1180
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,760
of printed white pasteboard

1181
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,240
stamped with the name J.R. Bob Dobbs

1182
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,440
so that when the time

1183
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,080
of rending and pain is upon us,

1184
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,840
I will be lifted up

1185
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,700
into the safe, soft arms of otherworldly goddesses,

1186
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:55,500
and serve forth the pleasures of all flesh satisfied.

1187
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:58,840
And the squid will anoint me with their perfect

1188
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,980
and malleable bodies, till I am rendered quivering

1189
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:06,100
and senseless, a shell of skin housing purest slack.

1190
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:11,320
From below will raft the faint cries of humans

1191
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,020
as they ignite and implode.

1192
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,840
But please, for mercy, the promises never before

1193
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,520
made in sincerity will be transformed

1194
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,900
into a harmonic chorale of my vengeance.

1195
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,820
And all the while, the squid will anoint me.

1196
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,300
The years of swallowing my own bile,

1197
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,180
along with the machinations of them,

1198
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:30,320
the hustlers and entertainers, the preachers, teachers,

1199
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,920
and government whores, the arbiters of taste,

1200
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,720
encouragers of waste, the sanctimonious chaste,

1201
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,880
the Barbies and Kens, the little red hens who say,

1202
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,880
will you help me?

1203
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,900
When what they really mean is, I have no brain.

1204
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,680
Please tell me what to think.

1205
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,000
You know, them.

1206
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,500
Those years will be washed away

1207
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,520
in a wave after endless wave of a joy beyond

1208
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,540
10,000 simultaneous earth-moving orgasms

1209
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,240
as the squid anoint me.

1210
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,520
When I leave this place, so unappreciative

1211
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,320
of my true genius, on a sunny July morning some days hence,

1212
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,940
do not fear for me, for that perfect body, I'm hiding,

1213
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:09,020
that I've been slaving so hard to achieve and maintain

1214
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,440
will be mine in the flash of time it takes me to decide

1215
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,380
just how big to make my eternally perky breasts.

1216
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:15,880
Yes.

1217
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,440
Yes.

1218
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:17,500
Yes.

1219
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,780
I am going to a place beyond my most monstrous fantasies,

1220
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,600
into the realms of elder gods.

1221
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,540
Or at least that's what they tell me.

1222
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,120
I couldn't read the fine print.

1223
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,980
Pass that pipe and pray.

1224
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:28,900
Yes!

1225
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,380
Yes!

1226
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,160
Yes!

1227
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,400
Yes!

1228
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:35,580
Yes!

1229
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,180
Yes!

1230
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:36,300
Yes!

1231
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:36,440


1232
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:36,480


1233
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:36,480


1234
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:36,520


1235
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:36,740
Yes!

1236
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:36,740


1237
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:36,980
Yes!

1238
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:37,140
Yes!

1239
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:37,220
Yes!

1240
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:37,400
Yes!

1241
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:38,060


1242
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:38,060


1243
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:38,640
Yes!

1244
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:38,640


1245
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:40,580
Yes!

1246
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,480
Yes!

1247
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:51,540
Yes!

1248
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:55,940
Yes!

1249
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:55,980
Yes!

1250
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,460
Newer!

1251
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1252
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1253
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1254
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1255
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1256
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1257
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1258
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1259
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1260
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1261
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1262
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1263
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1264
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1265
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1266
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1267
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1268
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1269
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1270
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1271
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1272
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1273
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1274
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1275
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1276
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1277
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1278
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1279
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,100


1280
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:07,840
Newer!

1281
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:08,900
Newerbox.

1282
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:13,040
all sorts of retarded brothers to love.

1283
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,300
Gorsh, Sister Susie,

1284
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,680
can I put my finger between your naples?

1285
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,160
No, why, Chainer, that's not your,

1286
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,520
those aren't my naples.

1287
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,360
Uncle Chainer molested you, too.

1288
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,080
Oh, Cousin Susie, that ain't my finger neither.

1289
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,960
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry

1290
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,940
Hour of Slack.

1291
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,620
For free information on Bob Dobbs

1292
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,060
and the Church of the Subgenius,

1293
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,540
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to,

1294
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,680
got your pencil ready?

1295
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:49,080
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1296
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:56,220
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1297
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:59,080
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1298
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:01,800
Woo!

1299
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,460
Pray now.

1300
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:04,380
Pray.

1301
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,580
Have faith in God.

1302
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,880
You are going to stand up.

1303
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,680
Have faith in God.

1304
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,220
We are listening to Jehovah Hates Fred.

1305
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:18,720
Thank you.

1306
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,220
What do you like?

1307
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:20,840
I don't know.

1308
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,160
You just know you're not.

1309
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,280
Have faith in God.

1310
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,300
I'm just going to think the tape's put in the wrong way.

1311
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:25,780
It's going backwards.

1312
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,620
Have faith in God.

1313
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:32,500
We're filling your mind now with subliminal messages

1314
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,320
saying you will give me,

1315
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,680
say it again,

1316
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,940
all of your money,

1317
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:43,000
if you are over 16 years of age,

1318
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,580
and you have the female persuasion,

1319
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,700
you will give me.

1320
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:47,540
I'm sure.

1321
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:48,740
I don't know if that's information.

1322
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:53,020
Are you just asking for your opinion?

1323
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,600
I'm just going to sit down on the floor

1324
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,200
and do what the nice Andrew tells you.

1325
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,600
Okay, for our last song,

1326
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,760
we're going to do Bob Don't Live Today by Jimi Hendrix.

1327
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:03,080
Yeah.

1328
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,720
All right, you go, Andrew.

1329
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:08,740
Strut that stuff.

1330
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:14,980
Will I get slapped tomorrow?

1331
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,240
Bob just don't say.

1332
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,220
Will I get saved tomorrow?

1333
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,700
Bob just don't say.

1334
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:28,700
No.

1335
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,360
Well, I know for sure.

1336
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,840
Bob don't live today.

1337
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:36,920
No.

1338
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:56,940
He got showcase.

1339
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:03,080
If you get a Die Hard sold.

1340
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,240
He got showcase.

1341
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:04,240


1342
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:04,240


1343
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,040
Whoa, leave it to the

1344
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:09,940
Today, he got shot dead back in LA.

1345
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,220
As if Bob Don't lives today.

1346
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,940
There's no slack anyway.

1347
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,100
There's no f***ing slack in this world.

1348
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,160
It's the X's when they come.

1349
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:40,720
It's gonna be in 2998, cause Stag and the rest of the crowd forgot to carry the one from the three scriptures.

1350
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,940
Sorry, it's all over. We are not going to be saved.

1351
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,920
Bob Don't lives today.

1352
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,220
The pipe is broken.

1353
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,800
Gone away.

1354
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:03,160
But Bob Don't lives today.

1355
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,900
The X's have passed us underway.

1356
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:10,360
The conspiracy is one man.

1357
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:16,440
The words of the swinging love pox is totally f***ing bad ass bummer, dude.
