1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,980
Bob and Bob and Bob and Bob!

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,680
By special order of the mayor of Springfield,

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,800
you are in my grudge and in full and complete pardon.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,540
Bob! Bob, come in!

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,460
And by morning, the rest of the city was gone.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,080
I'd say it was set.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,720
It was incredible.

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,120
Coming up on the hour to the dining room level,

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,620
Bill Chappell.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,780
Kids controlling the micro-bodies in our food.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,860
Who is free to television set.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,220
Free to telephone.

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,260
Into the computer.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,120
The scabies of the core and the heart.

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,140
Morning.

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,080
Television?

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,640
Without portication is a disease.

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,860
The main cause of cancer, a lack of masturbation.

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,020
The heart is in sex.

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,300
No sex, no life.

21
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,780
You are not listening to the subgenius hour of slack.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,900
The subgenius hour of slack is listening to you.

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,740
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of slack.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,480
Slack, slack, slack.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,060
Slack, slack, slut.

26
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,540
Local Feng L慩

27
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:58,940
Black.

28
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,880
Black Death.

29
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,320
You can escape the plague.

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,060
Send one dollar to Bob.

31
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,800
Bob's on the other line, so let's go to Bob and see what Bob has to say.

32
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,460
Bob, are you there?

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,620
Yes, sir.

34
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,400
Is this the Bob that takes everybody out in the desert and lives in caves?

35
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,560
No, I'm just Bob, just regular Bob.

36
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,020
Oh, okay.

37
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,560
Well, you heard the other guy talking about Bob, and I saw your name, Bob, and you're calling from the same city,

38
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,380
and I just figured you're maybe the cave dweller guy or something.

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,060
That was crazy.

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,900
What's up, Bob?

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,780
No, I...

42
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:41,760
Sweet hour of slack, how great it is to become one with Bob.

43
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:57,100
So quit your job and get in line for the divine immaculation, J.R. Bob Dye.

44
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,600
Amen.

45
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,040
Amen.

46
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,620
Amen.

47
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,160
Amen.

48
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,500
Amen.

49
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,680
The divine immaculation, J.R. Bob Dye.

50
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,260
Amen.

51
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,340
Amen.

52
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:06,880
Amen.

53
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,480
Amen.

54
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,240
Thank you.

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,840
Be seated.

56
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,560
Amen.

57
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,140
Good morning.

58
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,720
Welcome to the First Church of Belbridge, a subdivision of the Church of Subgenius.

59
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,160
Amen.

60
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,960
Amen.

61
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,280
Amen.

62
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:20,680
Amen.

63
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:20,860
Amen.

64
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,120
This morning, we're going to talk about the Jehovah God.

65
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,560
Amen.

66
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,340
Amen.

67
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,320
Amen.

68
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:27,540
Amen.

69
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:27,700
Amen.

70
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:27,760


71
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:27,760


72
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:27,760


73
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:27,760


74
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:27,760


75
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:27,760


76
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:27,760


77
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:27,760


78
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:27,760


79
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:35,360
Some of y'all actually believe there's an invisible man in the sky watching over your

80
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,640
ass every minute.

81
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,260
God knows when you've been sleeping with your neighbor.

82
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:45,800
Why?

83
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,000
Amen.

84
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,060
Amen.

85
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:48,720
Amen.

86
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,140
God knows when you've been sleeping with your neighbor's farm animal.

87
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,760
Amen.

88
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,860
Bubba Tyrone.

89
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,620
I must resist temptation.

90
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,740
Get behind me, Satan.

91
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,420
There's a demon with a lance

92
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,160
inside of my pants.

93
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,440
Amen.

94
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,520
Please hit me, Bobby.

95
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,520
Please hit me, Bob.

96
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,500
I seen my neighbor's wife naked

97
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,980
and my penis got hard.

98
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,540
Please hit me, Bobby.

99
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,520
Please hit me, Bob.

100
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,380
I seen my neighbor's wife naked

101
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,000
and my penis got hard.

102
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,560
Amen.

103
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,100
Everybody.

104
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,780
He taught me.

105
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,500
He taught me.

106
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:53,920
He taught me.

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,180
He taught me.

108
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,980
Praise his name.

109
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,580
He taught me.

110
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,840
He taught me.

111
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,900
He taught me.

112
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,500
Praise his name.

113
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,240
Amen.

114
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,180
Thank you.

115
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,500
Be seated, everybody.

116
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,540
Praise Bob.

117
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,320
Praise Bob.

118
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,260
Oh, yes, dear friends.

119
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,000
And that was, in fact,

120
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,160
the first church of Elvis

121
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,240
in Bob.

122
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,120
Here, they sent us a tape

123
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,420
from right here in Texas.

124
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,920
I wonder how they even hear

125
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,900
of this show here.

126
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,940
And there'll be more

127
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,380
from First Church of Elvis in Bob,

128
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,620
I'm sure, at some point.

129
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,920
We also heard a little bit

130
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,140
of the Crystal Methodist call in.

131
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,380
Live prank calls

132
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,900
done at our Austin DeVival.

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,980
And there'll be more of that

134
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,540
coming up.

135
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,060
Friends, you also heard

136
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,200
a little bit of Friday Jones,

137
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,600
a little bit of Reverend Felicia,

138
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,340
and a little bit of John Casual's

139
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,340
media barrage.

140
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,260
And friends, you know,

141
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,540
it's getting to be like

142
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,900
near to Christmas time.

143
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,660
Now, ain't it?

144
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,600
And normally,

145
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,260
that would be an excuse for me

146
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,100
to just rerun

147
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,700
the standard old Christmas show,

148
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,160
dear friends,

149
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,720
that you hear every single year.

150
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,840
And especially this year,

151
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,860
because this will be

152
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,980
the last Christmas.

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,600
There will be no more

154
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,900
Christmases on Earth

155
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,160
after this one.

156
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,520
But, I lost the tape.

157
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,720
I can't find the dang tape.

158
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,000
So, we've got so much

159
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,620
new material in

160
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,040
that there's no excuse

161
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,360
for reruns,

162
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,640
aside from my lack of time.

163
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,420
But that's okay, friends.

164
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,660
We've got, let me announce

165
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,280
very quickly,

166
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,820
if you happen to be

167
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,860
able to make it,

168
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,480
we have X Day Drill .5

169
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,900
New Year's DeVival

170
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,940
coming up in Austin, Texas.

171
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,320
New Year's, actually,

172
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:51,980
the weekend after,

173
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,420
after New Year's,

174
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:53,740
Saturday,

175
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,440
January 3rd,

176
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,340
dear friends,

177
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,420
this will be

178
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,260
one of the largest,

179
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,080
most insane DeVivals ever.

180
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,520
Austin, Texas,

181
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,540
January 3rd,

182
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,700
at a place called,

183
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
and this is the name

184
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,300
of the club,

185
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,920
Bob Popular.

186
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,960
Eh-heh.

187
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,100
For, um,

188
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,340
information about

189
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,880
subgenius DeVivals

190
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,420
and so forth,

191
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,560
you can call the DeVival

192
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,100
hotline,

193
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,800
which number,

194
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,020
I don't know where,

195
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,060
where the heck

196
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,660
is it?

197
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,960
While you try,

198
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,920
if you're serious,

199
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,460
call 1-888-669-2323.

200
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,740
All right.

201
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,420
Now, um,

202
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,600
and the confirmed guest

203
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,280
there will be

204
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,940
yours truly,

205
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,920
Jesus Christ,

206
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,300
I mean, me,

207
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,860
and also Jesus Christ.

208
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,980
I wouldn't want to imply

209
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,540
that I was Jesus Christ.

210
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,880
Dr. Katahdin Legume

211
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,640
is likely.

212
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,340
Pope Angus,

213
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,320
Nikki Deathchick,

214
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,440

215
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,260

216
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,020

00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,300
X-Day,

220
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,200
1998,

221
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,080
July 5th,

222
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,120
well, actually,

223
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,220
let's say July 4th,

224
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,100
there won't be much

225
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,480
of a day on July 5th,

226
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,100
but July 4th,

227
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,560
X-Day,

228
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,160
big event in Brushwood,

229
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,740
New York,

230
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,900
where we do our

231
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,600
X-Day drills.

232
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,440
Doctors for Bob.

233
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,980
Doctors for Bob.

234
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,940
Well, the original

235
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,920
Doctors for Bob,

236
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,660
well, minus the guy

237
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,160
that died,

238
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,980
Drelloyd,

239
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,300
uh,

240
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:19,840
Jayner,

241
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,560
Sterno,

242
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,200
uh,

243
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,040
Dr. Snavely,

244
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,040


245
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,460
Eklund,

246
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,140
Gene Splice,

247
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,740
will be

248
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,600
the final performance

249
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,720
on X-Day.

250
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,380
Thank you.

251
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,320
And, uh,

252
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,080
what else?

253
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,700
Well, I'm gonna get back

254
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,460
to the tapes, friends.

255
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,660
We've got great stuff.

256
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,460
An amazing

257
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,020
Papa Joe Mama rant

258
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,700
from, uh,

259
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,280
Dr. Reverend Ed Strange's show.

260
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,140
We've got, uh,

261
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,320
and, uh,

262
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,260
the Crystal Methodist

263
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,760
prank calls.

264
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
They're kind of hard to hear,

265
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,000
but, uh,

266
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,320
they're, um,

267
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,360
but they're worth it.

268
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,240
And, uh,

269
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,140
we've been so busy lately,

270
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,640
friends,

271
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,200
uh,

272
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,460
the, the big hammer

273
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,480
came down, uh,

274
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,940
regarding our website,

275
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,800
which had been

276
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,040
a charity, uh,

277
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,380
situation, uh,

278
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,220
donated by

279
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,600
the University of North Carolina.

280
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:01,920
Well,

281
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,700
they've been

282
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,660
real great about it.

283
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,120
They, they defended it

284
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,040
as long as they could,

285
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,880
but one trustee

286
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,660
of the university,

287
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,360
too many,

288
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,920
got one too many lawsuits

289
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,480
from the Church of Science,

290
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,020
blah, blah, blah,

291
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,260
ye, and, uh,

292
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:16,680
the, uh,

293
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,280
uh, threats, rather.

294
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,000
And, um,

295
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,300
too many, uh,

296
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,500
calls from relatives,

297
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,440
uh, discussing

298
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,680
the pierced, uh,

299
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,380
blah, blah, blah,

300
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,680
close-ups on

301
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,500
www,

302
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,480
on the new

303
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,760
www.subgenius.com.

304
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:31,660
Um,

305
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,440
we have been in the,

306
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,420
by the time you hear

307
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,040
this show,

308
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,680
we will have fully moved

309
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,800
the website over,

310
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,460
and anything that

311
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,320
didn't work before

312
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,700
probably will work now.

313
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,660
Oh, what else?

314
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,600
What else did I,

315
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,660
before I go on,

316
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,640
there, there were

317
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,180
a couple of news items

318
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,040
I, I wanted to, uh,

319
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,480
mention.

320
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,400
Oh, giant rats.

321
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,760
This is very important,

322
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,480
uh, from the

323
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,960
Onan Canobite News Service.

324
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,220
These are the end times.

325
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,360
Santiago, Chile.

326
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,160
Chile.

327
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,820
A Chilean ecological group

328
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,900
has sounded an alarm

329
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,140
about two-foot-long

330
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,320
mutant rats

331
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,640
that have attacked

332
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,820
barnyard animals

333
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,460
in a suburb of Santiago.

334
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,320
The private Orbe news agency

335
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,780
said Mauricio Barraza,

336
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,400
uh, president of Ecologra,

337
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,780
believes that the rodents

338
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,900
had grown so large

339
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,900
because they fed

340
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,080
on the droppings

341
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,640
of hormone-fattened

342
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,720
poultry.

343
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,860
According to Barraza,

344
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,820
the giant rats burrow

345
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,040
in the banks of the Mapocho,

346
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,380
the filthy river

347
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,380
that crosses Santiago,

348
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,980
and have shocked farmers

349
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,980
in Maipu, a Santiago suburb,

350
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,040
with their vicious attacks

351
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,300
on chicken and small goats.

352
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,000
And friends,

353
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,240
those mutant rats

354
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,180
will soon be swimming north

355
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,840
on El Nino

356
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,900
to meet you and me.

357
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,040
And now, my reading

358
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,000
from, uh,

359
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,420
The Onion,

360
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,500
in this case.

361
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:52,940
I mean, this,

362
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,520
I love this newspaper so much.

363
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,400
The, the Onion

364
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
from, uh, Madison, Wisconsin.

365
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,980
This time I'm going to read

366
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,500
one of their editorials.

367
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,680
I, I hope I,

368
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,940
I'd rather have

369
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,020
Hedgelak of the Hildanes

370
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,280
himself read this.

371
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,740
He wrote this.

372
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,080
Um,

373
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,200
but I will try to do it justice.

374
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,060
I will lean back.

375
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,300
Now, from the microphone.

376
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,580
No, I have to pull this down

377
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,560
just a little bit.

378
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,020
Okay.

379
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,160
I am Hedgelak of the Hildanes,

380
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,080
and I have spoken.

381
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,660
The youth of today

382
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,560
have no valor,

383
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,700
no courage,

384
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,800
of kings,

385
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,420
t-shirts,

386
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,400
blue jeans.

387
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,040
When I was a young man,

388
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,340
we wore bone helmets

389
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,860
and horns that proclaimed

390
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,460
our kinship with valorous

391
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,340
deeds of courage.

392
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,200
We wore hair shirts

393
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,440
that ripped our flesh

394
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,360
even as we drank our mead,

395
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,300
and we fought for

396
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:50,960
great treasures

397
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,460
known across this middle earth.

398
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,640
My son,

399
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,300
Unferth the Spirited,

400
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,760
once sacked an entire mead hall

401
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,320
for a bloody boar's head

402
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,340
hanging from the door.

403
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,980
That was his treasure.

404
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,640
He wore it and became known

405
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,040
as Unferth the Boar's Head.

406
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,340
Where is such valor today?

407
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,380
Last week I spied a young man

408
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,300
exchanging money

409
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,280
for a Snickers candy bar.

410
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,620
Money?

411
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,560
Exchange?

412
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,360
Where is the honor

413
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,320
in such an act?

414
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:18,900
And further,

415
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,940
he did not even

416
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,160
stab the cashier

417
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,800
when he left.

418
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,280
I am Hedgerlach,

419
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,360
son of Hrothgar,

420
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,860
who wore Banlok,

421
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,340
the sword of the Skildings,

422
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,860
as a token of his valor.

423
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,740
I sacked for golds and jewels.

424
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,800
I've lost patience

425
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,680
with today's youth,

426
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,800
with their music

427
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,760
and their automobiles.

428
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,320
I demand Viking ships,

429
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,440
spears, swords,

430
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,280
and torture devices.

431
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,760
I recently saw a young maiden

432
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,820
taking part in a most

433
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,760
shameful exchange.

434
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,900
She was providing fellow citizens

435
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,540
coffee in return for paper currency.

436
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,920
What has happened?

437
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,480
What has this nation-state come to?

438
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,480
I want swords, fire!

439
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,840
I want sacking and burning!

440
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,660
Where is the courage in negotiation?

441
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,200
Without deeds of valor and courage,

442
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,720
how do we remember the name

443
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,240
of Wealthy Owl, the Peace Weaver?

444
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,340
We do not, I tell you.

445
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,060
This morning I saw a group of children

446
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,220
running around playing tag.

447
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,180
And who was killed?

448
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:09,840
No one!

449
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,100
There was no carnage,

450
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,340
no headless beast, nothing.

451
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,140
For what?

452
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,480
Again, I say nothing.

453
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,280
No head of the wicked Grendel,

454
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,280
no houses of kings,

455
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,220
no spoils at all.

456
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,340
You call this valor?

457
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,820
We need sacking and burning.

458
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,500
The whole of this Middle Earth

459
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,420
shall be destroyed without

460
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,340
the might of its people.

461
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,720
We will perish in the depths

462
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,540
of the dark abyss,

463
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,640
leaving no name behind.

464
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,460
The need of valor is urgent,

465
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,060
the time of reckoning imminent.

466
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,880
Nation's youth, hear me,

467
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,600
and hear me well.

468
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,160
I know all this, for I am Hedgelac,

469
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,720
prince of that fane known across the land.

470
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,580
And I have spoken.

471
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,380
An editorial from Community Voices,

472
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,140
the Onion newspaper, Madison.

473
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,320
Wisconsin.

474
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,060
And finally, I'm going to give you

475
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,920
the information, contact information,

476
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,980
for The Onion.

477
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,880
And it is, as we say,

478
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:09,400
well, it's www.theonion, one word, dot com.

479
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:15,160
You can email onion2, that's onion numeral 2,

480
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,400
at theonion, one word, dot com.

481
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,320
Or you can email me, at theonion, one word, dot com.

482
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:28,020
Or you can phone 1-800-695-4376.

483
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,060
Once again, that's subscription information

484
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:38,060
for The Onion, 1-800-695-4376.

485
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,300
Yes, and now to return to the valor.

486
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,240
Hello, friends, and welcome.

487
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,680
The sermon tonight is entitled,

488
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,020
The Bandwagon of Bob.

489
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,640
The Bandwagon of Bob.

490
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,340
Now, how does one explain something as complex

491
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,380
and sophisticated as Bob's bandwagon?

492
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,700
The answer, my friends, is to begin at the beginning.

493
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,660
Since the dawn of time, humans have sought to know their god.

494
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,880
Who is he? What does he want with us?

495
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,580
What is his plan?

496
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,860
Literally hundreds, if not thousands of religions

497
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,480
have sprung up to exploit this instinctive desire

498
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,760
to know one's creator.

499
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,040
The real motives of most these religions

500
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,860
becomes painfully obvious over the course of time.

501
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,360
They dangle the circle of religion,

502
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,140
the so-called answers of the universe,

503
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,760
in front of their followers' faces,

504
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,980
like a carrot on the end of a stick.

505
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,260
If the faithful want a taste,

506
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,560
they need to hook up the church wagon

507
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,200
and pull it down the road to better reach their goal.

508
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,120
But alas, the ever-elusive carrot

509
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,900
seems to move forward as well.

510
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,360
Lifetimes come and go,

511
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,340
but few of the faithful feel any closer to their goal

512
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,580
than they were when their journey began.

513
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,520
And by then,

514
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,160
they're too tired and worn out

515
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,980
to try another route.

516
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,520
All religion.

517
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,480
Dear, dear friends,

518
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,160
it is not enough to hook up your wagon to the nearest religion

519
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,460
and pull with all your might.

520
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,660
Faith on your part is important,

521
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,520
but the faith you choose to have faith in

522
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,000
is equally important.

523
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,100
If your religion is wrong,

524
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,040
all the faith in the world won't make it right.

525
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,500
Only God has the power to make a world

526
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,440
of wrong religion right,

527
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,940
and he would never do that.

528
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,740
It would be bad for business.

529
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,400
It would bring down the morale of all the true believers,

530
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,460
because the true believers believe

531
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,720
that everything in their faith is true,

532
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,420
and that includes the part that says

533
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,820
there is only one true religion,

534
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,180
their religion, not the other guy's.

535
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,160
So which religion is right, my friends?

536
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,780
Well, ask yourself this.

537
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,480
If you were God,

538
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,640
which religion would you make right?

539
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,140
The fundamentalist religions of persecution and war?

540
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,420
The Christian religions of guilt and self-denial?

541
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,140
Or perhaps, just perhaps,

542
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:27,080
the subgenius religion of humor and self-sacrilege?

543
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,520
You see, a lot of folks out there don't stop to realize

544
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,760
that God has to listen to his own bullshit.

545
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,880
But he does, even more so than everyone else.

546
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,140
What you mumble at church, God has to listen to

547
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,160
a million times over as everyone else repeats the exact same thing.

548
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,120
Critics, they dismiss the subgenius religion

549
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,460
as being too diverse.

550
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,540
They say, oh, there's too many inconsistencies.

551
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,900
Or they holler, what you claim this week

552
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,360
contradicts what you said last week.

553
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,960
Well, maybe that's the entire point, my friends.

554
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,060
God's already heard last week's theology,

555
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,980
and he's tired of it, sick of it.

556
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,800
This week, he wants something new.

557
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,760
People conveniently forget what the purpose of religion is.

558
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,600
From God's perspective, it's not to entertain us.

559
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,320
It's to entertain him, God Almighty,

560
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,860
Savior of the Universe.

561
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,980
When it comes to heaven, conventional religions claim

562
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,220
God wants to save the most souls.

563
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,580
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

564
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,860
Now why the hell would he want to do a stupid thing like that?

565
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,900
He's got to spend the rest of eternity with those bozos.

566
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,620
God doesn't want quality of souls, my friends.

567
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,160
God wants quality.

568
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,120
Souls cool enough to hang out with him forever and ever.

569
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,300
Not to drive him crazy, that's why they believe him.

570
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,360
And they've got all these conspiracy religions out there, friends,

571
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,820
to distract the losers and boring people away from the one true religion.

572
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,940
And that's also why the subgenius religion is so hard to take seriously.

573
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,700
If we were easy to believe, everyone would want to jump on the bob wagon.

574
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,100
Remember, there is no such thing as space in space.

575
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,340
Avoid those pleasure saucers, come Edge.

576
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,400
Judgment Day.

577
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,280
Space is at a premium, and there is no such thing as extra space.

578
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,800
The fewer that climb aboard, the more room and board there is for the rest of us.

579
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:27,020
So forgive the subgenius if he doesn't come crawling to your door, wearing a coat and tie, begging you to join his religion.

580
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,320
Because the truth is, we'd just as soon watch you burn.

581
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,980
It's up to you to realize the right religion, my friends.

582
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:43,760
But believe me when I say that your choice will affect you, the rest of your short, pain-filled, puny little lives.

583
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,020
Unless, of course, you choose Bob.

584
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,940
Herein doth the word of Bob!

585
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,000
Praise Bob, amen!

586
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:53,440


587
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:05,400
Baby Bob! Baby Bob! Baby Bob! Baby Bob! Baby Bob! Baby Bob!

588
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,400
Responsibility only to oneself.

589
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,520
Life, liberty, and the pursuit of pleasure.

590
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:21,880
The new declaration of independence for the teenager around the world.

591
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,800
Then when it starts to fade, the old world returns to what it was.

592
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,280
Come over to a similar apartment in the village.

593
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,480
Smoke a joint. Burn a little grass.

594
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,060
Pot party. Roach party. Mainliner. Skin pop. Shoot some crystal.

595
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,720
The language of the narcotic and marijuana user.

596
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,220
The language of a large and ever-increasing number of teenagers.

597
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:08,380
Starting in high school on Benzedrine and Dexedrine pep pills, it is not long before many soon graduate to marijuana.

598
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,260
The teething biscuits to a whole generation.

599
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,120
The generation of adolescent psychics.

600
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:21,740
And if marijuana is the appetizer, the advent of the space age technology has provided the main course.

601
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,320
Lysergic acid diethylamine.

602
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,320
LSD, the crazy acid.

603
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,820
To use it is to take a trip.

604
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,000
A trip in the world of mystique, religion, and self-knowledge.

605
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,340
For others, it is a trip to the emergency ward of the nearest psychiatric hospital.

606
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,800
For some, it accentuates the beat.

607
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,300
For some, it quickens sexual desire.

608
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,900
For some, it is the release of sexual inhibitions.

609
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,940
But whatever it is, teenagers are going for it.

610
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,860
A drug that can be made in the kitchen sink is hard to stop.

611
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,960
And may be the forerunner of a new drug society out of some science fiction writer's imagination.

612
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,820
Will drugs pave the road to destruction?

613
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,860
Or will they be the structure for the now generation?

614
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,160
The End

615
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,060
The End

616
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,340
The End

617
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,680
The End

618
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,180
The End

619
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,740
The End

620
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:39,800
The End

621
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:39,800


622
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:39,800


623
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:39,800


624
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:39,800


625
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,200
The End

626
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,480
The End

627
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,160
The End

628
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,780
The End

629
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:05,980
is coming upon you. Your wealth has rotted and moths have eaten your clothes. Your gold and

630
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:13,260
silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have

631
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:19,160
hoarded wealth in the last days. Look, the wages you failed to pay the workmen who mowed your fields

632
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,440
are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the almighty

633
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:32,720
dogs. You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of

634
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:41,820
slaughter. You have condemned and murdered innocent men who are not opposing you. The subgenius church

635
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:51,340
is one small step away from becoming in full mystery Babylon, the adulterous harlot of revelation.

636
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,420
And we all know what a harlot is.

637
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:01,040
It does a harlot screws. And this harlot is going to screw you.

638
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,940
Amen, brother. Amen.

639
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,460
Thank you for listening to the Prozac Free Radio Show. We're almost out of here. First, let you know,

640
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,960
we won't be here next week. Lucky, finally get a vacation from the station.

641
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,300
I'm gonna jump in the car and just head south to warmer weather.

642
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,420
Well, I thought maybe we...

643
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,000
We might be incapacitated by a certain Rodney.

644
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,980
Oh, doubtful.

645
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:35,600
Although, I suspect I may be fleeing authorities. One never knows.

646
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,780
We'll be out in the parking lot cleaning our radiator with a toothbrush, taking those last chunks out.

647
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,240
See you, Rod.

648
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,760
The dog?

649
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,620
Oh.

650
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,160
Oh, why I'm at it, just to thank you for coming up here.

651
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,740
I'm going south. You guys need anything?

652
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,840
Yeah, I knew a car.

653
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:06,320
Oh, yeah. And while you're down in South Carolina, stop at south of the border for me and pick up a sombrero for me.

654
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,180
You know how to find it? Just make a left at that dead black and white dog.

655
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,120
Oh, yeah, the one we ran down last... Yeah, okay.

656
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:14,840
Mickey.

657
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,600
I know where you mean.

658
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,320
Mickey.

659
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,360
Oh, Mickey.

660
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,800
Also known as...

661
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,860
Mick Mick.

662
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,100
Oh, Mickey. Oh, Mickey.

663
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:32,520
You know, it's amazing to me that someone would pay a $3,000 reward on the head of a $25 dog.

664
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,200
So the head is exactly what we will deliver.

665
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,340
If you want the rest of the body, that'll cost you extra.

666
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,180
You'll find it on a stick in your front yard, Ronnie.

667
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,000
Dog head on a stick.

668
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,720
You know, in Mexico, that's a delicacy.

669
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,560
We'll even give it its special road rash free of charge.

670
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,420
Yeah, we thought about bringing you...

671
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:01,400
The whole dog, but it's a long trip from North Carolina, and one's ought to get a bit peckish on the way.

672
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:10,340
We dragged the head back behind from the illustrious station wagon window, but we nibbled on the rest the whole trip.

673
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,540
But if you're offering $3,000 for the whole dog, I mean, the head's got to be worth at least $1,500.

674
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,500
I mean, that's where the little doggy brain is housed, after all.

675
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,420
Well, you got to remember that.

676
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,320
So he probably doesn't really need the head so much.

677
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,060
It's the other end that he used the most.

678
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,780
We're holding that for final payment.

679
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,220
Oh, yeah.

680
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,220
Don't worry, Ron.

681
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,160
We're keeping it nice and warm for you.

682
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,860
We're using that aquarium tube light to keep it all nice and moist.

683
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,440
Wee doggies.

684
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,600
Brothers and sisters, this has been Prozac Free Radio.

687

And the participants.

688
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,960
No animals were harmed during the taping of this show.

689
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,900
We now return your radio control to you until next week after next.

690
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,680
Or at least until somebody else shows up.

691
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,880
I'll never know how Ed Strange always gets the music to end just perfectly like that.

692
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,740
Friends, Reverend Strange, Dr. Legume, Joe Mama, some great ranting there,

693
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,280
and you will be able to access almost equally great ranting, perhaps even greater,

694
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,420
at the Oscars.

695
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,360
At the New Year's End of the World Drill .5,

696
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,000
sponsored by Fringeware in Austin, Texas,

697
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,300
at Bob Popular Club.

698
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,500
That's the name of the club, Bob Popular,

699
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,620
sponsored by Fringeware.

700
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,060
The idea is to pack as many mutants into one place

701
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,200
for the biggest freakout of the last year of our lives.

702
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,500
Be ready for slack like you've never experienced before.

703
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,980
There will be ranters and music all night.

704
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,780
In fact, we'll use time control to roll back the clock

705
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:58,280
and ring in the new year with noisemakers hats and even a ball drop.

706
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,640
I will provide the ball.

707
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,660
Witness the Earth anthem.

708
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:07,020
See the acid Jesus drop a dope beat.

709
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,060
Marvel at Pope Angus's coat of many colors.

710
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,460
Experience deaf chick's newest ritual of pain.

711
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,500
Dance, dance, dance, frop and die.

712
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,480
Get resurrected and do it all again.

713
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,760
Covet, lust, hate and hate because tomorrow will be.

714
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,380
Not come.

715
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,080
Dear friends, we'll see you there.

716
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,860
In the meantime, praise Saint Wanderer

717
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,860
for digitizing this show for the internet

718
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,120
and working so hard on the sub-site move this week.

719
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,240
Hail Wanderer!

720
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,180
Hail Legume!

721
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,180
Hail Joe Mama!

722
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,480
Hail Reverend Ed Strange!

723
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,400
Hail, um, hail yes!

724
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,160
Praise Bob!

725
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,360
And the...

726
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:53,700
Oh, this jazzy music here is from Schoolgirl.

727
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,200
A moral report.

728
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:00,180
A CD of German, 70s German softcore porno movie music.

729
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,820
Thank y'all.

730
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,800
Look into my eyes.

731
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,140
Don't seem right.

732
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,660
You can see it.

733
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,860
Don't seem right at all.

734
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,260
There's something, something unclean.

735
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,340
Yes, yes.

736
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,960
Like being in league with the...

737
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,800
That's it.

738
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,600
You got it right.

739
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,620
Divine simplicity.

740
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,600
You said it like it's got to be said.

741
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,900
Yes, no decision.

742
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,340
The devil.

743
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,460
That's who we'll have fighting on our side.

744
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,900
The devil.

745
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,800
Yes, yes.

746
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,980
We're all input systems.

747
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,780
The devil.

748
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,880
The operators.

749
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,840
They had my mind.

750
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,500
You Had My Minds.

751
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,740
Not dead.

752
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,700
Not alive.

753
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,020
They had my mind.

754
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,600
We're all input systems.

755
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,140
And operators.

756
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,840
Not dead.

757
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,560
We're all input systems.

758
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,380
Not alive.

759
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,460
And operators.

760
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,720
Burit, advance!

761
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,340
Pass the bell.

762
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,080
Oh, don't run me out.

763
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,760
I called you for too much.

764
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,980
I can't.

765
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,320
Can't fool me.

766
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,420
Can't fool me.

767
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,060
Can't fool me.

768
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,000
They had my line.

769
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,240
Had my line.

770
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,260
Had my line.

771
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,140
My line.

772
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,520
If my unhappiness came up very suddenly, maybe it'll go away again.

773
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,520
We can keep you unhappy, son.

774
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,480
Give us a chance.

775
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,120
You're gonna have to handle reality with nothing added, sport.

776
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,940
You're gonna have to handle reality with nothing added, sport.

777
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,980
You're gonna have to handle reality with nothing added, sport.

778
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,900
You're gonna have to handle reality with nothing added, sport.

779
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,400
You're gonna have to handle reality with nothing added, sport.

780
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:39,680
You're gonna have to handle reality with nothing added, sport.

781
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,140
The main cause of cancer is a lack of motivation.

782
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,220
The Juventus squad恐uched by sexual violence.

783
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,920
No sex no life.

784
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,060
No help, got to do, got to have

785
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,480
Lots of sweet bodies, licking, yammy

786
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,780
I believe that my heart will good start

787
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,080
The pigs want to take it away

788
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,820
They want us to crave till we die

789
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,860
I believe

790
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,120
We must jerk off with soft cars

791
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,200
Stick their dicks in the pig stash

792
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,400
From On the Necessity of Bestializing the Human Female by Margot Sims

793
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,280
Answers to the six most often asked questions about heterosexuality.

794
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,460
Question. What is heterosexuality?

795
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:41,320
Answer. Heterosexuality is a disease characterized by the desire for intimate physical connection

796
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,460
with a person or persons not of your gender.

797
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,600
Question. What causes heterosexuality?

798
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:53,320
Answer. No one knows exactly what causes heterosexuality.

799
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,420
There are reasons to believe that there are several different causes.

800
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:01,460
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to heterosexuality in certain families.

801
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,200
Environmental factors either cause or contribute to some cases of heterosexuality.

802
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:11,640
There is no evidence that heterosexuality is transmitted via public toilets.

803
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,500
Question. Who gets heterosexuality?

804
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,480
Answer.

805
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,540
Answer.

806
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:17,540


807
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,180


808
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,180


809
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,180


810
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,180


811
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,180


812
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,180


813
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,180


814
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,260
Heterosexuality strikes nine out of ten Americans.

815
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:25,180
About ten percent of the population appears to have a natural immunity to the disease.

816
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,680
Heterosexuality strikes people of every socioeconomic class, race, and religion.

817
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,380
Heterosexuality is usually contracted in early childhood and, if untreated, lasts a lifetime.

818
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,000
Question. Is heterosexuality fatal?

819
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,500
Answer. Not usually.

820
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:48,180
The average life expectancy for heterosexuals is about one in one hundred percent.

821
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,640
The average life expectancy for a person is about one and a half years shorter than for homosexuals.

822
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,140
Childbirth used to be the most frequent cause of death directly attributable to heterosexuality,

823
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,100
but monster and obstetrician methods have greatly reduced this risk.

824
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:07,540
The biggest killer now is the IUD, intrauterine device, followed closely by the pill and enraged husbands.

825
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,400
Still, chances of survival are excellent.

826
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,320
Question. Can heterosexuality be prevented?

827
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,180
Answer. Not yet, but research on a vaccine has shown that it can.

828
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,180


829
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,180


830
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:18,820
The vaccine is promising.

831
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:24,960
It is hoped that an injectable serum manufactured from the tissues of healthy, i.e. homosexual donors,

832
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:30,000
will provide lifetime protection from heterosexuality in children under the age of six.

833
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,800
Question. Is there a cure for heterosexuality?

834
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,300
Answer. No.

835
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:43,720
Heterosexuality cannot usually be cured, but there is a very effective treatment that so completely controls the symptoms of heterosexuality

836
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,100
that nearly complete, permanent remission of the disease is possible.

837
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,280
Yes, you can be cured of heterosexuality.

838
00:34:52,300 --> 00:35:02,920
Send $1 to Gay Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

839
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:13,220
Oh, and to think I was just wondering how Ed Strange manages to make those pieces of music in just when the person's talking.

840
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,180
Just by the divine luck of God.

841
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:18,180


842
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:18,180


843
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,840
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

844
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:27,720
Friends, that was Irreverent Friday Jones with that rant by Margo Sims, What is Heterosexuality?

845
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,640
We heard a little bit of some ranting from Reverend Felicia.

846
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:46,260
And that thing that started off this side was The Bogwan Rag by Ludwig Sears, a subgenius we haven't heard from in a long time.

847
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,160
And we've got a lot of tape from him.

848
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:57,940
And I guess now it is time to go into that last Austin devival sponsored by Fringeware.

849
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,860
Praise Paco.

850
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:13,740
At which the Crystal Methodists performed some live on stage and also on the air prank calls

851
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,740
to some stations.

852
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:24,040
This was a national effort in that it was announced through the internet and so forth beforehand.

853
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:29,180
And there were calls coming into the station from all over the place.

854
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:37,160
It's kind of hard to hear, but it was quite a miracle that it worked as well as it did at all.

855
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,500
It was truly an interactive and disgusting thing.

856
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,480
So we shall proceed.

857
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:43,720
Thank you.

858
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,440
We hear in the background here this...

859
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,320
I think I disagree with you on this point.

860
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,040
I guess it may be Brother Russell calling this...

861
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,440
Okay, where do you disagree?

862
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,760
This Christian talk show.

863
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,920
I'm going to try to filter this as best I can.

864
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:06,400
I think that Heterism has a place in the church, and it did in the early days, but it's just when these authorities tried to come in.

865
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,560
Can you give me some examples?

866
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,620
Okay.

867
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,720
Like the church fathers, you know, they came and they made the Bible disciples.

868
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,640
They were the official version.

869
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,920
You can't add to it or take away from it.

870
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,980
I think the Bible says that itself, doesn't it?

871
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,500
Well, at least the book of Revelation does.

872
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,140
You know, Jesus sat down with the wine drinkers and the prostitutes.

873
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:25,640
Yeah.

874
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,920
He was cool with that.

875
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,120
Yeah, but he didn't get drunk and he didn't sleep with the prostitutes.

876
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,740
I mean, there's a difference between associating with befriending and hanging out with individuals and then also engaging in their practices.

877
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,740
Well, I mean, see, that's what my Aunt Melba said.

878
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:52,000
She's a pastor of a church, the Faith Tabernacle Outreach Ministry Mission Crusade Healing Deliverance Temple in Jesus' name.

879
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,740
I'll cut that out.

880
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,240
Let me see.

881
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,540
Jeff, an Aurora call.

882
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,020
You got Mark?

883
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,200
Yeah, as I said, from now on we're going to institute an IQ.

884
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,680
They cut the Aunt Melba reference, but then they get another one.

885
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,240
How do we make that?

886
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:11,300
I mean, I know you got to be under the age of 34, but let's say you got to have an IQ above 34 as well in order to call the program.

887
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,260
You think that's a good idea, Chris?

888
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,320
I think that's great, but how do I test it?

889
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,960
Do I ask them whether they worship Bob?

890
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,740
Yeah, I think that would be a good start.

891
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,460
Or if they live in a cave.

892
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,120
Jeff, an Aurora, Colorado. How you doing, Jeff?

893
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,340
Hi, Chris and Leif.

894
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,160
And Mark. Don't forget Mark.

895
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,460
Mark, Mark. Yes, of course.

896
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:36,780
Well, you know, I'm afraid, I don't know about the last few callers, but...

897
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,280
I hope you're on a little different level than that.

898
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,880
I think we are on another level here, Leif.

899
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,160
I think primarily I'm concerned about backsliding myself.

900
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,800
And I think you're right. We all risk backsliding into a hedonist position.

901
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,440
And I think that the culture today just makes it easier to go in that direction.

902
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,020
Well, I agree with you.

903
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,660
I think the culture, there's so much thrown in our face.

904
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:11,080
There's so many things out there that are available to us that, yeah, it's very difficult to be self-controlled.

905
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,240
It's very difficult to...

906
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:18,260
Before you put something on your credit card, before you sign a check, before you throw cash on the table,

907
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,200
it's difficult to stop for a moment and to think, you know, I wonder if God would like me to do something else with this money.

908
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:30,860
Maybe there's someone in need that could use this $50 that I'm going to spend on this new pair of shoes.

909
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,260
He's just stringing them along.

910
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,080
More than I.

911
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,220
Absolutely.

912
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:42,240
But, you know, we get caught up in the whole quickness of what...

913
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,240


914
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:50,660
Everyone who has called this session, we've heard so far is a crystal bad minister of such genius.

915
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,340
Well, I'm afraid that you put your finger on the point, Leif.

916
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,260
I mean, and I'm worried for my own salvation.

917
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,540
We should all be worried.

918
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,980
We should all pray every day that we don't get backslidden.

919
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:06,240
Now, the Internet, for instance, is an area where a lot of my great Christian friends got caught in a trap

920
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,360
because they go out there, they may keep their lives, you know, crystal clean,

921
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,680
but until...

922
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,900
until they go out and they experience vicarious...

923
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,000
and you never know how Satan is going to work.

924
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,720
He sneaks up on you.

925
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,660
I think the Internet, for instance, he fell into...

926
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,340
he fell into backslidden theology.

927
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,920
He became a crystal Methodist.

928
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,700
A crystal Methodist?

929
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,900
A crystal Methodist.

930
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,420
And that is after having spent years and years in the church.

931
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,240
Yeah.

932
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:35,760
Yeah.

933
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,220
Well, we...

934
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,480
Well, we got them all going on tonight here.

935
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,060
I hope I'm believing these things, folks.

936
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,440
If...

937
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,220
if any of you look to the...

938
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,080
stations, I apologize.

939
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,740
I've gone hitting the red button, bleeping these guys.

940
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,180
We got them coming out of the woodwork tonight.

941
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,480
The red button will not stop us!

942
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,140
The other two are from Colorado.

943
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:55,480
The other two are from Austin, and who knows where the next one...

944
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,180
Actually, that was a Chicago one, but I did ask them if you were...

945
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,060
No, that was Colorado, I think.

946
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,100
Yeah, the thing is, um...

947
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,320
the Lord here, Jesus, the real Jesus, who's be...

948
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,480
here,

949
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,220
here, posted on the internet that people should call in this station and so forth.

950
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,940
So, you know, it's not just Friends of the Crystal Methodists and people here in Austin.

951
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,500
There are folks all over the country, in theory, you know, probably not a hell of a lot of them,

952
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,320
maybe a dozen or so, calling this station and, you know, going,

953
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,300
well, I'd like to talk about hedonism in my church.

954
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,660
And then when they get on, you know, hopefully slowly working their way up to my church.

955
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:42,220
Oh, yeah, the church of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, Launcher's Society or something like that.

956
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,280
Sorry, aren't we a bunch of illiterates around here?

957
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,560
Ah, let's chew some gum and forget it.

958
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,900
Well, you know, let's not pretend.

959
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,880
Let's go to Louisiana and talk with Shiloh tonight, who's 18.

960
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,880
Hi, Shiloh.

961
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,240
Hi.

962
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,360
How are you tonight?

963
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:53,980
I'm fine.

964
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,260
What's going on with you and Jesus, Shiloh?

965
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,000
Yeah, you asked the question a while ago what to do about Jesus, something to that effect.

966
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:01,340
Yeah.

967
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,700
Well, I believe that you should renounce him and all the lies that he stands for.

968
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,220
Oh, we're having a fun night on Dawson McAllister Live.

969
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,360
Now, where did you get all that baloney, Shiloh?

970
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:14,240
Well, I was raised in Christianity as a child, and it basically made me miserable.

971
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:21,340
And after I got older, I decided to, you know, renounce Jesus Christ and join the Church of the Subgenius.

972
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,740
All right, let's start over again.

973
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:28,040
How were you raised in Jesus Christ now or in the church?

974
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,000
I went to Christian school, and I went to church, and I was force-fed the lie of Christianity.

975
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,440
You were what?

976
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,140
Force-fed the lie of Christianity.

977
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,480
What is the lie?

978
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,800
Christianity, Shiloh.

979
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,300
Virtually everything that it stands for and the hypocrisy that it stands for.

980
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,180
Wait a minute.

981
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,260
I mean, I can't say that I've ever run across hypocrisy in the Church of the Subgenius.

982
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,960
The Church of the Subgenius?

983
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,360
Yeah.

984
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,540
What is that, Shiloh?

985
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:55,180
It's basically like a cross between almost like a UFO cult and the Church of Satan.

986
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,680
It's a church out of Dallas.

987
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,280
Oh, bless your heart.

988
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,720
You've gotten into some demons.

989
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,440
You are into demons, Shiloh.

990
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,460
Oh, Dawson.

991
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,080
I am a demon.

992
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,420
That's what I thought.

993
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,020
I have all authority in Jesus Christ over you, Shiloh,

994
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,680
and you need to give your life back to Jesus Christ and get rid of those demons, how many there are.

995
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,440
You need to give those up.

996
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,240
Demons, let go of Shiloh in the name of Jesus Christ.

997
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,660
I prefer to keep my demons.

998
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,020
Yeah, well, you and your demons will spend eternity in hell, Shiloh.

999
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,460
Well, I don't believe in hell.

1000
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,620
Well, it doesn't matter whether you believe in hell.

1001
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,400
Jesus Christ, who is the truth, says there is a hell.

1002
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,840
And you are...

1003
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,040
You have been told the truth, and you know the truth,

1004
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,720
and you have chosen in your rage to turn away from the truth.

1005
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,600
I'm not enraged, Dawson.

1006
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,660
In your enragement towards the Holy God, Shiloh.

1007
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,940
I have nothing against Jesus.

1008
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,840
It's basically his fan club that I'm against.

1009
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,100
You said it was hypocrisy.

1010
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,200
Yes, his fan club.

1011
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,020
You said he was a liar, Shiloh.

1012
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,520
Yeah, he is, but there's nothing wrong with a liar.

1013
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:00,040
Shiloh, I'm going to say to you real quick here,

1014
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,140
because I refuse to let Satan get in the way of kids.

1015
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,300
Well, I'm all for your demonic laugh, but let me finish.

1016
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:12,420
I am not going to let Satan get on the air here and sabotage this show.

1017
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,240
When you are not open to Christ, you don't want Christ at this point,

1018
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,540
you've turned away from Christ, you've taken on demons,

1019
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,040
you've called yourself a demon,

1020
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,100
I am here to tell you that the hottest place in hell

1021
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:31,060
are reserved for people who had Christianity all around them

1022
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,820
and yet refused to...

1023
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,120
I know the hottest place in hell.

1024
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:33,120


1025
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,020
The hottest place in hell is for people who listen to Marilyn Manson.

1026
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,460
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1027
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,820
A hotter place in hell will be for someone like you

1028
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,000
who heard the truth over and over again and turned away, Shiloh.

1029
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,740
Yes, but I don't drink and I don't smoke and I don't sleep around.

1030
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,120
I don't know a lot of Christians who do that.

1031
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,200
I'll tell you the greatest sin there is.

1032
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:56,020
The greatest sin there is, Shiloh, is rejecting Jesus Christ,

1033
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,180
and you flat out have.

1034
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,420
That is the greatest sin.

1035
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,860
That is the unpardonable sin.

1036
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,560
Mm-hmm.

1037
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,500
The Holy Spirit says to you, Shiloh,

1038
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,780
come to Christ, come to Christ, come to Christ,

1039
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,800
come back to Christ, which he has done.

1040
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,620
And I say, no, no, go away.

1041
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,280
That's right.

1042
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,080
That is the unpardonable sin,

1043
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:17,140
and that is the sin that will take you and your demon to hell forever.

1044
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,800
Well, at least I'll have company then.

1045
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,420
No, you won't have company because hell is totally dark

1046
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,480
and you're going to be totally in pain

1047
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,000
and you will not be able to see anybody

1048
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,500
and you will be in such agony there will be no party there.

1049
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,940
Kind of like being in church.

1050
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:32,800
Mm-hmm.

1051
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:33,760
I've had enough with her.

1052
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,580
Hang her up right now.

1053
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,520
Do you hear that demonic laugh as she went,

1054
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,460
I'm not going to let Satan take over these airways tonight, folks.

1055
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,460
I refuse to.

1056
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,880
Let's stop and pray for her, though.

1057
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,680
When I sense there are demons, like I did the last two calls,

1058
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,440
I'm not going to mess around.

1059
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,540
Thank you very much.

1060
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,620
Let's see if we can get back to hedonism.

1061
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,220
Danny in Colorado Springs.

1062
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:54,880
Hi, Danny.

1063
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:55,760
Oh, hi.

1064
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,240
Let's get back to some hedonism.

1065
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,000
Hedonism.

1066
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:58,400
Yeah.

1067
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,660
Boy, I was listening with my girlfriend,

1068
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,180
my girlfriend Connie,

1069
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:09,380
and she is of the opinion that anything you want to do is okay.

1070
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,640
And I'm going to an Assembly of God church,

1071
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,980
and I feel totally fine with my denomination,

1072
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,420
and I don't think that we can do just anything we want to do.

1073
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:18,960
What do you mean?

1074
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,200
Is she a Christian?

1075
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,600
She says she's a Christian,

1076
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:28,320
but she says that, you know, anything she wants to do is the will of God.

1077
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,760
The will of God?

1078
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,140
And I don't understand.

1079
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,180
Just sit here, Danny.

1080
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:32,820
The will of God?

1081
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:33,840
Yeah.

1082
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:34,660
Who's God?

1083
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:35,960
No, the will of God.

1084
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:36,580
Oh, God.

1085
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,080
Yeah.

1086
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,160
Anything she wants to do is the will of God.

1087
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:40,980
God.

1088
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,280
You just said God's again.

1089
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:43,840
No, I said Bob.

1090
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:44,880
Bob?

1091
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,280
I said it's the will of God.

1092
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,540
I think you're all messed up, man.

1093
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,360
No, but...

1094
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,400
But try to call in again and try to speak by us again, Danny, okay?

1095
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,760
It was a good try this time.

1096
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:56,540
What?

1097
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,340
It was a good try.

1098
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:57,820
What?

1099
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:58,700
It was a good try.

1100
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,100
God.

1101
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,080
Okay, Bob.

1102
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:00,500
Bob.

1103
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:00,780
Bye.

1104
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:02,600
Bye.

1105
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,760
We've got some really weird ones tonight.

1106
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,600
That's what happens with live radio, you know.

1107
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,160
I mean, we don't screen any of our calls.

1108
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,840
We let everybody on, and then I kind of got to deal with them.

1109
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,720
You know, they seem to be getting smarter.

1110
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,660
They're catching on.

1111
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,600
I guess maybe they finally decided to evolve.

1112
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,620
Oh, they won't like it.

1113
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,280
Believe me.

1114
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,240
They won't like it.

1115
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,160
Hey, we got a drawing real quick.

1116
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,740
I don't believe any of these.

1117
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,020
Drawing.

1118
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:30,560
Hmm?

1119
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,160
I don't believe any of these.

1120
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:32,160


1121
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,720
I don't believe in evolution, so I'm not going to.

1122
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,860
I'm ready for what is rightfully mine.

1123
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:36,860
I'm God, people.

1124
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,100
You know, I deserve more than what I'm getting right now.

1125
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,460
I own everything.

1126
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,200
I own everything.

1127
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,300
I own you.

1128
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,240
You say, yeah, all right.

1129
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,400
Sure you want me.

1130
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:49,500
Well, we'll just see.

1131
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,440
We'll see, man.

1132
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,720
You ain't got to help me.

1133
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,280
You don't have to.

1134
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,600
You know, you can blow it off.

1135
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,300
But you're no friend of mine.

1136
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,420
Once I find out that you didn't help me,

1137
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,380
and once I find out that you did not try to,

1138
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,020
that you did not send me a letter,

1139
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,240
and you did not do it immediately,

1140
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,160
then I'll use that as a curse.

1141
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,680
I'll use that to curse you with.

1142
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,220
And I may very well send you to hell for it.

1143
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:12,740
You know?

1144
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,940
Don't think that you can't do one simple thing and go to hell.

1145
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,700
Don't think that, because you can't.

1146
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:19,520
Matter of fact,

1147
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,120
let me explain to you the way Satan becomes Satan.

1148
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,460
Satan used to be a holy angel, too.

1149
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,160
Okay?

1150
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,080
Me and Satan, me and my brother Mike,

1151
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,680
we walked into this room where God Almighty was sitting.

1152
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,500
And God Almighty, who was our Father,

1153
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,420
he said, look, hey, I'll tell you all what.

1154
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,060
Let me explain to you all what I'm going to do.

1155
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,360
We're going to go, and we're going to live another life,

1156
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,240
and we're going to learn the difference between bad and good.

1157
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,380
On this planet, I'm going to make it where absolutely anything you can imagine,

1158
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,840
anything you can comprehend,

1159
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,280
and anything you can think about can come true.

1160
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,480
And my brother goes, whoa, wait a second, God.

1161
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,620
Don't do that, man.

1162
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,020
Don't do that, because if you do that,

1163
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,400
then they won't need you anymore.

1164
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:06,020
And he said, boom, for that, you're Satan,

1165
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,760
and you'll be Christ.

1166
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,860
What's, what's, what's turning heads

1167
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:19,000
in subgenius fashion today?

1168
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,760
Why, it's the lonesome cowboy Dave look,

1169
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,460
complete with all the finery.

1170
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,860
That stylish, rakish hat with the bloody hole

1171
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:39,240
from the recent suicide attempt.

1172
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:43,200
That little hospital number there

1173
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,940
with the urine and vomit stains on the front.

1174
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:51,620
I mean, now that's turning heads or turning something.

1175
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,620
Lonesome cowboy Dave, friends.

1176
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,000
You know, I heard this song many times,

1177
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,000


1178
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,000


1179
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,000


1180
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,000


1181
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,000
before, it's a wonderful life.

1182
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,740
But we all know, don't we?

1183
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,340
It ain't a wonderful life.

1184
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,260
It's a pile of shit.

1185
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,100
And we're all, yeah, yeah, right.

1186
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:11,960
That's right, too.

1187
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,880
And we're all living in this steaming, hunking,

1188
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,240
holy, holy, holy, holy, holy pile of shit.

1189
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,800
And we're trying to eke our way out.

1190
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:24,800
I eke my way out with Bob Dobbs at least three or four times.

1191
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,560
I was a mental patient in a Sebring State mental institution.

1192
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:31,000
I didn't have nothing going for me.

1193
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,100
And I was staring into the john one day,

1194
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:38,620
doing my extra medications, looking at the plash of waters,

1195
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,080
trying to do my breathing exercises.

1196
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,040
I am somebody.

1197
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,060
I am something.

1198
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,660
I am going somewhere someday.

1199
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,380
I ain't shit.

1200
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,260
I ain't shit.

1201
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,860
My life ain't nothing.

1202
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,760
And then I discovered J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1203
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:00,800
Somehow.

1204
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,620
I saw him on the freeways as I was going down Route 90.

1205
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:11,260
The Russians masturbating in the car with those little weird Indian shields dangling

1206
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,460
from the rear view mirrors.

1207
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,100
I saw him at a hot dog stand.

1208
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,580
Newton Nathans in New York.

1209
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,260
I saw him in a bad dream.

1210
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,920
In a bad dream.

1211
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,320
.

1212
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:25,320


1213
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:25,320


1214
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,000
.

1215
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,120
.

1216
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:26,560
.

1217
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,160
.

1218
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:33,380
.

1219
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:33,380


1220
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,100
.

1221
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:34,100


1222
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:34,100


1223
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:34,100


1224
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,580
This is not a ploy to get your money.

1225
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,600
This is a ploy to get your soul.

1226
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,600
It's not much of a ploy.

1227
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,740
It's gonna take work, to squeeze the juices out of each and every one of you.

1228
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:52,260
Much in the same way the juices have been squeezed out of me.

1229
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,680
I'm hardly standing.

1230
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,840
I'm hardly alive, but I got faith in J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1231
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,980
And I know that this force, this form of power has been little in a million years and I get

1232
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:00,980


1233
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,460
On next day, most of you are going to be dog meat.

1234
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,300
And I'm going to be a big puppy chomping down on that cattle ration.

1235
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,200
Yeah, you could say things are going to go from bad to worse.

1236
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,540
There's people doing experiments out there on your mind.

1237
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
They have these little prathral worms that can go through the air.

1238
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,400
They're like remote viewers.

1239
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:29,300
And when they work their way into your brain, they start eating your brains right out.

1240
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,280
And telling you what to do.

1241
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,680
I've been getting signals for a long time.

1242
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:40,420
In fact, doctors at Sebring State had to put me on nivane to stop the voices.

1243
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,240
I hear voices like this.

1244
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,200
I hear hollow, hollow, hollow, hollow, hollow cries in the night.

1245
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:49,040
I hear people trying to chew at my intestines.

1246
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,900
But still I live on.

1247
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:53,360
And then I hear voices like this.

1248
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,040
Hello, David. How are you today?

1249
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,000
How are the minerals and the trinifons?

1250
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,480
What's doing with you and the ice baths?

1251
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,780
Are the ice baths working today?

1252
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,020
Voices.

1253
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,480
Hollow voices in the dark.

1254
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,860
Everyone in here is infected with the same kind of madness.

1255
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,060
You all got them things growing out of the side of your heads.

1256
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:20,160
You all got them weird like things that come out of your ears in the middle of the night.

1257
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,540
And whisper commands.

1258
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,580
You're getting them commands.

1259
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,100
Aren't you?

1260
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:29,240
And there's only one way to stop them guys.

1261
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,220
Military intelligence.

1262
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,480
And in the spaceships too.

1263
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:39,240
See, because when they built them guys, them gray things, you know, they're clones.

1264
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,760
They took the matter right out of our skulls.

1265
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,280
And they stuck them right in the cockpits to fly around.

1266
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,820
It doesn't make any sense to you. It doesn't happen.

1267
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,940
But it's only gonna keep getting worse.

1268
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,400
Until each and every one of you got to give up the ghost.

1269
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,280
Just a little bit.

1270
00:53:59,280 --> 00:53:59,280


1271
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,060
Jesus ain't funny.

1272
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,320
This is...

1273
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,860
This is horrific.

1274
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,300
And stupid.

1275
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,440
So what can you do?

1276
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,440
Well, you can give the Reverend Ivan Stang your money.

1277
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,820
Or better yet, you can give me your money.

1278
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,720
Because I ain't promise you anything in return.

1279
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,460
What could be better than that?

1280
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:22,540
You just give me your money and I'll be as happy as shit.

1281
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,900
And I don't know how you'll feel about it.

1282
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:25,800
But I'll do it.

1283
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,140
What?

1284
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:35,780
And next Friday you have to go to the hospital once for everything.

1285
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,360
Some shit.

1286
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:38,360


1287
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:38,440
Cause the

1288
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:38,440


1289
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,160
Come on.

1290
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:39,640
What the fuck?

1291
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,120
The

1292
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:40,120


1293
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:40,120


1294
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:45,300
You fucking stop right now.

1295
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:45,900
Unfortunately your memory isn't full.

1296
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,140
This these Together.

1297
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,780
You've got to let go of all of it.

1298
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,140
Like a moist evacuation.

1299
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,360
Yeah.

1300
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,000
Like your sphincters have been treated with morphine.

1301
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,440
Just spoot it out.

1302
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,280
Yeah.

1303
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,200
Release it on.

1304
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,360
And them hammers won't come down anymore.

1305
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,900
No more life in the factory.

1306
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:08,300
No more of them hard crystal bitter tears.

1307
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:14,380
Some of you are waiting for the testifiers to come down.

1308
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:17,660
And them suborbital skull crystals that are going around the planet.

1309
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,640
I don't know if you know about them or not.

1310
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,440
But that's another thing our government is doing to us.

1311
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:27,660
And it's sapping all the juices right out of us.

1312
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,380
I don't know how much longer I can take it.

1313
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:39,640
So if we were to communicate in that way, you'd all scream out praise Bob.

1314
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,040
And I could go release this moist evacuation.

1315
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,140
And clear my mind again.

1316
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,140
On the count of six and a half.

1317
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,460
One, two, three, four, five, six and a half.

1318
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:51,660
Praise Bob!

1319
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:53,980
Thanks.

1320
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:04,260
The following broadcast is brought to you by the forces of darkness.

1321
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,680
Makers of the world's great religions, governments, and corporations.

1322
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:12,220
And when you're in the moon, have a hunkering hankering for alien smegma pie.

1323
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,940
For a taste that's out of this world.

1324
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,040
Try an alien smegma pie.

1325
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,800
When the X ships come.

1326
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,280
I mean on X day.

1327
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,700
When the ships come down.

1328
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,360
Each and every one of you will be led off to your own private.

1329
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:26,860
Excuse me.

1330
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,880
Little area.

1331
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,460
Where anything you desire will be crystallized immediately for you.

1332
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,500
Except for in case of people like me.

1333
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,960
Who will be led into smaller rooms to be confined until the rest of it's over.

1334
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,420
But you'll see.

1335
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,720
Your favorite girl or your favorite guy.

1336
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,360
And you're right in front of him.

1337
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,400
And like a Cadillac car.

1338
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,080
Anything you want.

1339
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,280
Anything your heart desires.

1340
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:53,220
At least this is the bullshit I've been sold on.

1341
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,220
At least so I've been told.

1342
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,960
By the reverie.

1343
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:57,540
Oink the stinks.

1344
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,200
Well.

1345
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,380
I uh.

1346
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,480
I spewed my last sputum.

1347
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,440
It's dry.

1348
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,900
It's very very dry.

1349
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,420
So goodnight.

1350
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,200
Goodnight.

1351
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:08,540
Goodnight.

1352
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,560
Oh.

1353
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:12,760


1354
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,200
Oh.

1355
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:13,600
Oh.

1356
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:13,720
Oh.

1357
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:13,900
Oh.

1358
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:14,320
Oh.

1359
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:14,340


1360
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:14,360

That's melba at fringewear.com.

1376
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:36,100
And what else? I've got so many cuss words to cut out of this show after I send it to the Canadian and pirate stations and the internet.

1377
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:41,700
Praise Juan Derer. Praise Jesus. Praise Ugly Shiloh.

1378
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:44,780

And everyone else involved.

1384
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,960
And Owen, of course, here in the background.

1385
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,100
The Flying Ryan.

1386
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:11,920
The brothers.

1387
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,940
Jimmy Ryan and his brother.

1388
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,860
Having at it, and good night.

1389
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:33,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh

1390
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:39,800
You have held the same as I

1391
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:41,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh

1392
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:41,680


1393
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:41,680


1394
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,080
Then you know what I mean

1395
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:50,220
Just keep on going, don't you cry

1396
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:54,060
It won't solve anything

1397
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,820
Don't take my words to life

1398
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:05,020
I'll take what I know is right

1399
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,160
Stick to your guns and fight

1400
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,820
Oh yeah

1401
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:18,340
See I'm stuck in my ways

1402
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:23,720
In my ways

1403
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:33,580
In my ways
