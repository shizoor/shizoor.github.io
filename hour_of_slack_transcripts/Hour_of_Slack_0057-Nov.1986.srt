1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,240
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,940
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,220
I have the second!

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,360
No trouble.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,720
Just get set and get going.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,300
Hey, hit me.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,720
Recording.

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,820
Everything's going fine.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,640
No trouble.

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,400
Where are we, Rob?

11
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,740
The code is broken.

12
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,640
Trouble?

13
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,260
Big.

14
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,140
Security?

15
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,400
I have the lid on tight.

16
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,060
Well, take it off for me.

17
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,180
That's message here.

18
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,180
Mars needs women.

19
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,880
Mars needs...

20
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,660
It's a gag.

21
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,740
It's a prank.

22
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,360
It's a fake.

23
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,040
I don't think so, sir.

24
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,360
Bob?

25
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,380
Bob?

26
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,340
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

27
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,540
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

28
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:04,560
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Black.

29
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,180
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

30
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,860
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,300
sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius,

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,420
with Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

33
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,240
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

34
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,620
For the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs,

35
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,440
living avatar of slack and saint of sales on planet Earth.

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,040
Are we controlled by secret forces?

37
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,220
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

38
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,460
Do people think you're strange?

39
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:48,940
Do you?

40
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,480
Then you may be on the right track.

41
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,100
Are you abnormal?

42
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,940
Then you are probably better than most people.

43
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,720
Yes!

44
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,400
You're kind of a joke.

45
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,360
And we feel the praise.

46
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,660
And we say the right thing.

47
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,760
Mother of the Subgenius.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,680
Mother of the Subgenius.

49
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,320
By blowing them off.

50
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,240
Bob's promise is to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior,

51
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,580
to explore new ways of going over the edge,

52
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,020
and coming right back.

53
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,140
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't.

54
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,020
To help you create the highest possible earnings

55
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,000
from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

56
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,760
To turn conspiracy-implanted personality disorders around.

57
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,040
And channel them into an illusion of creativity

58
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,760
that will fool normals and get you sex.

59
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,560
Bob Dobbs!

60
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,040
Bob Dobbs!

61
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,020


62
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,160
Bob Dobbs!

63
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,160
Bob Dobbs!

64
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,000
Bob Dobbs!

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000


66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000


67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,800
Bob Dobbs!

68
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,160
Bob Dobbs!

69
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,160


70
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,620
Bob Dobbs!

71
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,380
Bob Dobbs!

72
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,560
Bob Dobbs!

73
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,760
Bob Dobbs!

74
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,420
Bob Dobbs!

75
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:11,420


76
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:11,620
Bob Dobbs!

77
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:11,700
Bob Dobbs!

78
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,720
Bob Dobbs!

79
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,160
Bob Dobs!

80
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,260
Bob Dobbs!

81
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,260


82
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,260


83
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,260


84
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,260


85
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,260


86
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,260


87
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,040
Ah, yes, dear friends.

88
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,220
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,

89
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,160
and this is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

90
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,660
But, friends, I still haven't mounted.

91
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,460
I'm late to the radio station.

92
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,160
I still haven't.

93
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,840
I haven't made it to the station.

94
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm broadcasting from this little remote mic,

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,640
and I'm trying to get everything packed up together

96
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,660
here at my house.

97
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,220
This is the Bulldada time control laboratory.

98
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,080
This little security system.

99
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,740
Shut down that little security system.

100
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,920
Turn off the fake revolving hand.

101
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,960
Oh, wait, I turned it on.

102
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,580
Get these things working right.

103
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,900
Oh, it's, well, you can't even see where I am.

104
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,500
These are the kitchens of the Bulldada time control

105
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,180
laboratories.

106
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,680
You can see the little soles on ice over here

107
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:17,000
that haven't yet been thawed out and prepared for the vast hole

108
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,520
in here.

109
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:25,400
And over here, we've got the slackless children

110
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,980
who've been cast out of the home for slackless children

111
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,720
because you didn't send in your donations to the station,

112
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,160
friend.

113
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,080
Look at these poor little children.

114
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,560
What do you have to say to the people, children?

115
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,340
My tooth is loose.

116
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,120
Like my favorite sleep now.

117
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,120
I got an ant bite to do.

118
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,500
A big old bump.

119
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,120
Right.

120
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,180
See, friends, these are truly slackless children.

121
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,320
And these kids, these ant bites and these little bumps,

122
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,040
and bruises.

123
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,960
Now, friend, you're not going to let these poor kids,

124
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,440
these are American kids.

125
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,640
You're not going to sit by and let these kids be in pain

126
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,160
and slacklessness, are you?

127
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,760
See, they all call me daddy.

128
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,880
Isn't that sweet?

129
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,120
These are only two of over 5,000 of them

130
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,160
because we have this amazing electronic babysitter here,

131
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,980
this handsome robot.

132
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,860
You can hear it talking.

133
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,100
See?

134
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:29,500
See, if you turn this amazing household robot on,

135
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,620
it will just sit and entertain the kids.

136
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,280
And they don't have to do anything.

137
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,400
You don't have to do anything.

138
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,800
It's a great time saving device only available

139
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,400
from the hour of slack, dear friends.

140
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,580
Listen to those kids laugh with joy in the background.

141
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,960
It's time to be manipulated.

142
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,260
Brother, I want to tell you something.

143
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,080
The world is tired of dead preachers.

144
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,180
Dead preachers preaching dead sermons to dead congregations.

145
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,820
They're tired of cold services and cold churches.

146
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,240
This world is hungry for reality.

147
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,000
They've had enough of Hollywood.

148
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,840
They've had enough of Nashville.

149
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,460
They've had enough of .

150
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,260
Okay, that was City Lights by Jimmy McGriff.

151
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,060
I'm going to turn it back on.

152
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,060


153
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,060


154
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,060


155
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,060


156
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,220
Gue uncertain.

157
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:25,300


158
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:25,300


159
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
The k potent.

160
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,580
We lazy Aktarianomie has hurry the

161
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,260
totasha of corruption.

162
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:46,000
That wake up call made yesterday,

163
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,720
we started it right when out there.

164
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,040
We started it at 10 a nd this morning, brethren.

165
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,040


166
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,040


167
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,260
That just kept going.

168
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,440
I met these guys that sleep down by the police station, and we...

169
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,260
That was a really cool parade for Bob.

170
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,460
I was surprised how many...

171
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,480
It seemed like every KON person was there.

172
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,240
I didn't know there were nearly that many Bob fans.

173
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,760
Indeed.

174
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,000
I noticed they didn't all have...

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,640
They weren't all...

176
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,480
They didn't have all their trucks fixed up like...

177
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,080
Like worshippers or whatever, but...

178
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,880
Oh, there we go.

179
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,140
So I was still editing this thing when...

180
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,100
In the car on the way here.

181
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,980
I just woke up.

182
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,200
I woke up outside the police station.

183
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,100
Oh, there we go, yeah.

184
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,040
You're outside.

185
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,020
Huh?

186
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,680
Oh, yeah, well, they...

187
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,420
A lot of the subgenius people sleep in the downtown area

188
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,460
around the police station.

189
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,940
So when they really get hungry,

190
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,260
they've always got a place to get a, you know, a meal.

191
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,260
I see.

192
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,280
Well, let me see.

193
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,660
Let's see if this thing here works.

194
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,940
It's hard to tell with some of these tapes.

195
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,100
These church tapes can't tell if the machine's broken

196
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,860
or it's the tape or the poltergeist or what.

197
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,820
You want to get here and talk real quick?

198
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,500
We can do this.

199
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,780
We can at least inform you.

200
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,840
Time control.

201
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,440
The ride's giving me...

202
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,000
He knows that a creative sale

203
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,460
is one in which the idea that leads to a purchase

204
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,040
generates in the mind of the salesman

205
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,060
before it does in the prospect's mind.

206
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,660
A variety of ingredients.

207
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,080
You can create an appetite in the prospective customer...

208
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,560
You don't see very many dead animals lying around.

209
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,420
Psst.

210
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,100
Psst.

211
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,140
Psst.

212
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,280
There are quite significantly altered...

213
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:13,900
Wood.

214
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,180
Boom.

215
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,980
Boom.

216
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,860
, or they're destroyed.

217
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,340
Boom.

218
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,700
Psst. Psst. Psst.

219
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,880
The lid's off.

220
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,700
It's gonna be louder beyond Ontario

221
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,460
than it's gonna be here.

222
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,080
Those sounds...

223
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,460
Those sounds...

224
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,480
...are weird.

225
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,380
The NEW

226
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,420
Trash.

227
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,880
Spooky chefs are a bit mostly stern.

228
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,880
They've often thought that It'll never get to do anything before the next business.

229
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:07,120
But I can feel my legs feeling like I'mReagles.

230
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,180
Come on!

231
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:21,420
The Three找köping Advocate.

232
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,580
Hey, King, what's shaking?

233
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,600
My everything.

234
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,940
Oh, dear.

235
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,860
Come on, get up off that chair.

236
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,040
Follow me.

237
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,120
Ready?

238
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,760
Go!

239
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,980
The subgenius.

240
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,060
Our old subgenius.

241
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,700
Welcome, potential initiates.

242
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,660
I love you.

243
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,080
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to

244
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:05,140
is specially designed only to be played on radio station K-N-O-N

245
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,880
and only in the city of Dallas, Texas.

246
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:24,180
Here is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang, dear friends.

247
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,540
The sexiest man on earth.

248
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,660
A young Adonis who's irresistible to women.

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I can't wait a moment longer.

250
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,580
I've got to have sex with you.

251
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,480
Now, sir.

252
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,060
Settling down, girls.

253
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,940
Oh, it's beautiful.

254
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,540
Beautiful.

255
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,100
The facilities are now enormous.

256
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,080
This is where the young composer feeds a fragment of it

257
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,120
into several tape recorders and gradually...

258
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,920
Gradually achieves slack, dear friends.

259
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,520
Oh, and the mighty K-N-O-N parade was wonderful.

260
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,400
I knew it wasn't really the Bob...

261
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:24,740
Oh!

262
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,700
Subgenius.

263
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,860
Subgenius.

264
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,820
Subgenius.

265
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,300
Rock.

266
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,260
Now, for the very first time...

267
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,020
Selling is not limited just to people called salesmen,

268
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,100
for we all have something to sell.

269
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,860
The doctor sells his patient.

270
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,780
The lawyer sells his jury.

271
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,040
The doctor sells his...

272
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,440
The pastor sells his son to the congregation.

273
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,160
The lover sells his love to his sweetheart.

274
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,620
The peanut vendor sells his peanuts.

275
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,500
We've got all kinds of...

276
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,640
Not to lose, really.

277
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,040
Yes, everyone selling together blends hearts and minds and spirits,

278
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,960
just as the musicians in an orchestra harmonize musical tones

279
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,620
to create a mighty symphony of prosperity.

280
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,960
Oh, praise sales.

281
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,020
And Bob?

282
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,400
Bob is the greatest salesman.

283
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,300
Symphony of prosperity.

284
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,180
The end times.

285
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,640
Now you can have this amazing new symphony

286
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,300
right in your own home.

287
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,960
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

288
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,860
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

289
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,120
This tape is copyright 1982.

290
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,820
82?

291
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,140
By the subgenius.

292
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:44,800
Foundation.

293
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,700
Yeah, sure.

294
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,180
That's what I call time control.

295
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,640
The Reverend Jaynor Hypercleets from Little Rock, Arkansas

296
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,320
tried to make it all a little clearer to me

297
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,840
with his own explanation of his conversion

298
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,380
into the church of the subgenius.

299
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,640
They said this jar was my mind

300
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,980
and then they poured it down a sink.

301
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,180
Run that by me again?

302
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:08,720
I don't know.

303
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,220
What do you mean?

304
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,660
They said your mind is in this jar

305
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,200
and then they poured it.

306
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,140
Down the sink.

307
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,520
Can you go into a little more detail?

308
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,980
Well, Bob is the original church

309
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,980
that sanctifies the worship

310
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:36,040
and launching of bodily parts of golfers.

311
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,520
The exes are the alien invaders

312
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,200
which come in a year.

313
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,600
I'm not sure what the year is.

314
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,000
We at What's Up America,

315
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,180
though not given to making predictions,

316
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,780
feel that the church of the subgenius

317
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,780
is surely the church of the future.

318
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,160
Well, Bob is a kind of total all-consuming sex.

319
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,620
He can create an appetite in the prospective customer

320
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,900
that isn't hungry.

321
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,980
That isn't hungry.

322
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,200
That isn't hungry.

323
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,320
Ha ha ha ha ha!

324
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,080
Ha ha ha ha ha!

325
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,400
Ha ha ha ha ha!

326
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,280
The lover sells his love to his school.

327
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,280


328
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,680
Sweetheart.

329
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,500
For we all have something to sell.

330
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,540
Yes, and K-N-O-N has unfortunately had to stoop

331
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,620
to trying to sell itself to the federal government.

332
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,680
Can you believe that we're driven to have parades

333
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,600
to try to get support?

334
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,500
I mean, actually, the support's there.

335
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,540
We just had to prove that the support was there.

336
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,080
And friends, I think it was a beautiful thing.

337
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,560
It was a wonderful parade.

338
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,860
And we've got a live report on that.

339
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,680
That...

340
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,720
What was that?

341
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,840
How long am I gonna be in here?

342
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,420
That's a good question.

343
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,120
You wanna go home?

344
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:00,700
I mean, shoot.

345
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,680
Well, no, no.

346
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,200
Hey, I'll keep entertaining the masses, folks.

347
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,460
Well, let that guy.

348
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,400
Give me...

349
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,720
Okay, then I'll go home.

350
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,060
Dr. Gene Scott's time slot.

351
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,280
48 minutes.

352
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,780
Yeah, we have a new program on.

353
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,780
Excuse me?

354
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,160
Oh, yeah.

355
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:13,660
What time is it?

356
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:13,740
3 o'clock.

357
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,880
Friends, at 3 o'clock.

358
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,600
Oh, well, that's...

359
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,320
You know, that's a weird thing about this church,

360
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,260
this time-controlled doctrine.

361
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,440
It can really throw you.

362
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,000
And right now, we're gonna go to that parade.

363
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,760
Well, see, you know, if it wasn't for K&N

364
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,900
and most of y'all out there,

365
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,220
you wouldn't even have heard of Bob,

366
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,740
much less know who he is.

367
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,680
So we'll be kind of jumping back and forth again

368
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,280
if we can just maintain the continuum.

369
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,420
Doug, this is Guy Ponce after the parade.

370
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,060
That was fantastic.

371
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,440
I had to leave early, but it was a beautiful parade,

372
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,080
and I hope it does some good.

373
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,200
I just wanted to compliment you on it

374
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,080
if you were a co-organizer of that thing.

375
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,500
I love the way it was all lined out

376
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,060
in, like, boroughs of New York.

377
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,900
So, uh, good show.

378
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,620
Talk to you later. Bye.

379
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,160
Keep that child alive.

380
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,740
The operators of radio station K-N-O-N

381
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,140
are basking in a show of support tonight

382
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,440
from thousands of listeners.

383
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,900
That may or may not make any difference.

384
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,820
The FCC doesn't think K-N-O-N managers

385
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,180
should be operating the station

386
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,300
and have given the license to someone else.

387
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,260
The voice of the people.

388
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,600
The voice of the people

389
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,680
is what all these demonstrators call K-N-O-N radio.

390
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,720
To show their support for the community-run station,

391
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,400
at least 2,000 supporters staged a protest parade

392
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,520
stretching through the heart of downtown Dallas to City Hall.

393
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,600
The demonstrators were as diverse

394
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
as the programming on K-N-O-N.

395
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,100
We got your cowboys, we got your Indians,

396
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,520
we got your Solsters, your lowriders,

397
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,100
your, your, your black gospel people.

398
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,100
We've got everybody.

399
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,160
Tonight, the Christian radio station

400
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,980
run by the Criswell Center

401
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,260
that is taking over K-N-O-N's spot on the FM dial.

402
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,220
K-N-O-N supporters say their station

403
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,120
is doing a good job of serving the community.

404
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,380
And they're appealing the ruling that may silence K-N-O-N.

405
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,820
If the ruling goes against us,

406
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,640
it's amen for community radio.

407
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,400
K-N-O-N!

408
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,700
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

409
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,200
Whoo! Praise Bob!

410
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,200
Whoo! Praise Bob!

411
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,260
Whoo! Praise Bob!

412
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:34,720
Whoo!

413
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,020
Help me! My leg's gone far!

414
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,800
I ain't jammed! Got no leg!

415
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,060
Yes, dear friends,

416
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,120


417
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,920
this is Reverend Ivan Stang here,

418
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,440
waiting for the parade to begin.

419
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,660
The great K-N-O-N parade

420
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,280
in celebration of ourselves,

421
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,320
our cool selves,

422
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,640
those cool enough to march,

423
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,300
or crawl, or hobble,

424
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,100
or roll along in the mighty K-N-O-N parade.

425
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,640
Of course, the subgenius contingent,

426
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,040
flopping and stumbling along.

427
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,620
Actually, we haven't been able to do that yet.

428
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,520
We're still waiting.

429
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,060
Waiting, but for what?

430
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,460
Oh, there's the Batmobile.

431
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,200
The Batmobile finally made it over there.

432
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,600
In typical subgenius fashion,

433
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,800
the subgenius cars and trucks

434
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,980
are spread out completely randomly throughout the parade.

435
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,620
Most of us don't know where the other ones are.

436
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,660
And, uh...

437
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,080
Yeah, Stang sent me out to look for some of them,

438
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
and, well, a cop came by,

439
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,780
and he asked me what I was doing out here,

440
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,260
and I told him I was looking for a pickup on Harry Hines.

441
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,500
Fast, he almost arrested me.

442
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,360
Ha, ha, ha!

443
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,080
That was the voice of the Reverend Seyfaud,

444
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,040
who many of you would want to avoid

445
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,080
on a dark night.

446
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,440
But it's a sunny day.

447
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,560
We did the special rituals,

448
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,100
and I don't think it's gonna rain.

449
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,340
You can hear the ant band,

450
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,880
the tiny parade of K-N-O-N ants

451
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,920
going by in the background, practicing.

452
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,280
And, uh...

453
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,260
Oh, there's Batman.

454
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,680
Batman is here.

455
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,060
Oh, Batman, Batman,

456
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,740
could I bother you for a few words

457
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,360
to our radio listening audience?

458
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:19,660
Hell yeah, hell yeah.

459
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,920
I'm sure it's been a...

460
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,500
What kind of a week has it been

461
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,580
as far as crime fighting goes?

462
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,660
It's been a wild week.

463
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,980
There's been all kinds of wild accusations flying

464
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,040
here and there about, you know, the, uh...

465
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,840
What is it? KWBC throwing rotten eggs at all of us,

466
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,460
K-N-O-N-ers and so on.

467
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,420
So we called out the Bat Crew to make sure

468
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,500
that the Bible Institute didn't, you know,

469
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,600
throw rotten eggs at us.

470
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,640
Praise Bob.

471
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,000
But, uh...

472
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,460
Yes, friends?

473
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,740
And me and the male wonder, doing it again.

474
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,920
This is our, probably our fifth parade in Dallas.

475
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,800
I haven't seen, yeah,

476
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,060
I haven't seen the male wonder.

477
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,060
He must be...

478
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,600
He's probably squirming around somewhere.

479
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,440
Yeah, yeah.

480
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,280
If I know him.

481
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,600
Move it out.

482
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,040
Yeah.

483
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,180
And is he a male wonder?

484
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,820
You subgenius gals out there,

485
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,800
I will, you know, commit a few crimes

486
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,540
and get them to show up.

487
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,400
They'll teach you right from wrong.

488
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:11,980
Real quick.

489
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,440
Confidentially, I like men.

490
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,480
So, uh, any, can you, how about violence?

491
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,840
That's what our listeners want to hear,

492
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,740
is real bizarre violence stories.

493
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,040
As long as you're sincere about it.

494
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,960
Deformed, I am.

495
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,140
Deformed criminals that we haven't heard about

496
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,780
in the news yet.

497
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,660
We got, we got one we just caught.

498
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,400
We broke his arm off and put him in the trunk.

499
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,120
Oh.

500
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,140
And, uh, the Batmobile.

501
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,300
Is this a new deformed criminal or...

502
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,140
Yeah, this is newly deformed.

503
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:34,420
Right.

504
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,800
Oh, oh, so you deformed it.

505
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:35,860
We just got it.

506
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,600
We just got it back on the project.

507
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,480
You deformed it.

508
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,220
Oh, yeah, yeah.

509
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,940
I tore his arm off while Robin held him down.

510
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:40,500
Huh.

511
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,800
He's great.

512
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,200
And, uh, he should be in the trunk for the rest of the parade.

513
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,500
Oh, there's Reverend Belt.

514
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,420
Chastity Belt is here, of course, in the parade.

515
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,820
Yes, I'm glad to be here today.

516
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,540
Looking for a Kim Can, as I am.

517
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:52,900
Yes.

518
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,120
They've been...

519
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,600
You know, why didn't they have a truck, a flatbed truck, with a bunch of chemical toilets

520
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,020
on it?

521
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,780
I have thought of this as a potential offshoot of the, right, Reverend Chastity Belt, Church

522
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,200
of the Avenged Sword of the Lord Ministries.

523
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,920
And I may consider this soon.

524
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,380
Something a little different.

525
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,940
I mean, this is the first of my, you know, tax-deductible toilets.

526
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,720
You know, if we were true to Bob's word, we wouldn't...

527
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,360
We'd do like Bob, you see.

528
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,440
We'd walk through those construction sites, kicking the Kim Cans over, screaming at the

529
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,060
workers.

530
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,180
You're men.

531
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,000
You're mammals.

532
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,480
Why can't you just...

533
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,620
Why do you need to hide in a closet, he'd say.

534
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,660
I agree with this.

535
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:38,500
So many people in Plano and other areas must be just like that and living true to the word

536
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,380
of Bob, because they don't feel the need for Kim Cans just to...

537
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,320
Got one Story Only.

538
00:22:53,180 --> 00:23:02,660
You never know what that is, yeah.

539
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,260
It's just too easy to lose.

540
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,980
We may use very short term prior to E parece hearts on the wages at 18 million or pr

541
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,380
7 and 20.

542
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,760
We're so honored to have you here in the parade here for KMOM.

543
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,460
That's right.

544
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,740
Batman was just telling me that you deformed a new criminal just this morning.

545
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,740
Pulled the arm off.

546
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,740
Got him in the trunk already.

547
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,320
Yeah.

548
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,420
We put one of those big arm stoppers on him over the stump where his arm used to be

549
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,760
so the blood wouldn't all ooze over the bat.

550
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,780
What did you do with the arm?

551
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,400
I just left it there in the street for the city crew.

552
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,160
Oh, yeah, the animal control or whatever.

553
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,620
Ivan's thanks.

554
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,280
I get you back.

555
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,760
Oh, it's Norm Ward?

556
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,600
Well, what happened to you?

557
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,720
How come you don't come in after the show to insult us?

558
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,820
I got fired.

559
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,120
You're still on Monday morning, aren't you?

560
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,020
I mean, Friday morning.

561
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,280
Friends at Norm Ward Friday morning.

562
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,540
The only talk show that...

563
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,180
That you'll ever listen to.

564
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,720
Because next Saturday is the end of the world.

565
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:27,020
And friends, dear friends, besides the Batman and so many other celebrities down there,

566
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,740
we're also dealing with a lot of...

567
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,080
There were just a few subgenius church old-timers.

568
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,740
Butt Naked was there and the Hell Swami Satellite Weavers.

569
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,000
As usual, the Hell Swami created some really wonderful graphics.

570
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,740
And so forth.

571
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,820
What is wrong with my monitor, my friends?

572
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,340
There's still...

573
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,480
Once again, we've got those creatures.

574
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,140
Yeah, there we go.

575
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,980
We had some fine graphic displays.

576
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,760
So did everybody else at all the shows.

577
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,360
So those of you who didn't make it, man, I pity.

578
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,540
I pity you.

579
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,200
Because there was a real motley crew down there.

580
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,220
As seen in this hidden FBI footage here.

581
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,200
A lot of new subgeniuses.

582
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,960
I'd actually been dreading that part of it.

583
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,820
Because, you know, there's so many bobbies about normally.

584
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,140
There really are.

585
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:22,940
And...

586
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,080
But what we had were real nice folks.

587
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,220
They looked real fierce.

588
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,940
You wouldn't want to meet Reverend Zaphod, for instance, anywhere.

589
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,560
In the get-up, he was in there.

590
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,580
He looked like Mad Max.

591
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,360
There's an Inquisition monk.

592
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,840
And where was Ann Leonard?

593
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,560
But it was beautiful, friends.

594
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,280
Just beautiful.

595
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:51,760
We're going to move here into less and less of what you knew you were going to hear.

596
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,980
Bob Dobbs is a sex god.

597
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,160
Oh, come on.

598
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,380
Get off of that.

599
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,040
Once he offers something far more powerful.

600
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,040
An excuse.

601
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,160
A divine, all-inclusive excuse.

602
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,880
Which allows the bearer to free...

603
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,100
Free himself from the grip of temptation by overindulging in it.

604
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,080
Until it releases him.

605
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,280
The true seeker must give himself up to temptation.

606
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,840
Or he will never conquer it.

607
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,020
The second rule of the church in the church is...

608
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,720
Two months is always better than not enough.

609
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,380
Can I get a two month?

610
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,120
No!

611
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,420
Let me always better than!

612
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,060
That's right.

613
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,240
I'm the king.

614
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,740
We give you...

615
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,400
A few weeks.

616
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,940
Even if you look, you would buy any shit.

617
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,460
What?

618
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:55,840
The sad, weekly self-denial preached by the New Age Movement is pure conspiracy pablum.

619
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:02,880
The true son or daughter of Bob knows that our universe is no laid back, Om chanting cosmos.

620
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,540
But an active, tumultuous, squirting universe.

621
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,140
Bent on rampant...

622
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,580
Reproduction and easy grins.

623
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:17,960
The false cults may try to teach personal transformation, psychic development, human potential.

624
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:26,880
But Bob goes straight for the glands and seeks to amplify the self to bloat the abnormality potential of his pupils.

625
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,140
Only through excess can one contact the lower self where the real decisions are made.

626
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,660
Don't just eat a hamburger.

627
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,120
Eat the hell out of it.

628
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,220
I am a man, as I said, that would do anything...

629
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,040
For Bob.

630
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,600
What's that you say, Bob?

631
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,180
Dang it all.

632
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,820
Bang my head against the floor.

633
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,840
Right now, Bob...

634
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,720
He'd kill himself for Bob.

635
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,180
I know I said that.

636
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,560
He would.

637
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:52,940
He'd kill himself.

638
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,660
That's gonna hurt, Bob.

639
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,600
Well, I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it now, did I, Bob?

640
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,740
All I said was that that was gonna hurt, Bob.

641
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,300
I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it.

642
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,580
I didn't say I was gonna...

643
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,100
Most people don't realize it, but they have a gland in their body, a body that's not

644
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,100


645
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,100


646
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,100


647
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,100


648
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,100


649
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,180
a man's.

650
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,500
It's a Bob gland, so to speak.

651
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,060
And these are the subgeniuses.

652
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,320
We're trying to find these people, let them know about their Bob glands so they can massage

653
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,000
it properly.

654
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,860
They need to exercise their abnormality potential.

655
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,440
This is what man is beginning to forget to do.

656
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,660
We're letting ourselves be led by nameless, faceless corporate entities, and we've got

657
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:38,080
to release the power of abnormality that we have.

658
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,080


659
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,080


660
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,260
The power that is in so many of us.

661
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,480
Really, it can't be explained in words.

662
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:51,480
We feel like bodily worship is the main mode of God and inner force.

663
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,520
How do you worship, Bob?

664
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:01,960
Like I was saying, Bob-ily, bodily worship, which would be something like...

665
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,060
Ah!

666
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,660
Ah!

667
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:11,900
Bob!

668
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:13,920
Bob!

669
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:13,920


670
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,260
Bob!

671
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,840
Bob!

672
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,160
Bob!

673
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,000
If you're driving 60 hours, take a Bob.

674
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,640
Dog!

675
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,000
Dog!

676
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,120
If you're driving 60 hours, take a Bob.

677
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,120


678
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,480
If you use your mutant powers, take a Bob.

679
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:25,900
Dog!

680
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,280
Dog!

681
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:26,620
Dog!

682
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:33,780
If your blood is glowing as sugar, when you're picking a pumpkin, they shoot him with a lunas.

683
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,720
Take a Bob.

684
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,440
Dog!

685
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:35,740
Dog!

686
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,340
Bi-a-tree!

687
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,040
Bi-a-tree!

688
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,400
Buy a tree and carve yourself a garden of peace.

689
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,140
I send the angel of the Lord.

690
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:52,200
I send right now power, the very glory of God into that home.

691
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,180
I move back the foul spirits of opposition, the lying spirits, the binding spirits.

692
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,620
I speak authority to you in the name of Jesus Christ.

693
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,520
Don't ask any questions.

694
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,640
Just do as I say.

695
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,300
All right?

696
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,280
We're pretty sure he's a psychopath.

697
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,180
Now, how do we spot him?

698
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,420
Well, if he's wearing a Napoleon hat, it's easy.

699
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,880
Otherwise, they come in all sizes and shapes.

700
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,840
11-year-old girls to 80-year-old men.

701
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,620
They all look perfectly normal.

702
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,660
I keep telling you all, this is a sick and perverted nation.

703
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,180
All tired.

704
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,300
And nobody wants to listen to me.

705
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,880
Nobody wants to hear about Bob.

706
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,600
Nobody.

707
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,220
I try to tell everybody what's going on.

708
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,760
They won't listen to me.

709
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,820
Well, to tell you the truth, I can't stand it anymore.

710
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,240
Bob.

711
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:52,980
Bob.

712
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,600
Bob.

713
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,100
Bob.

714
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:01,980
Bob.

715
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,560
Bob, take care of me.

716
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,260
Bob.

717
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,500
Just do away with them all.

718
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,820
I don't want them anymore.

719
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,820
They'll be a problem and lose you to my mind after all.

720
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,180
They don't love you, Bob.

721
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,500
They don't love you like I do.

722
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,340
Oh, God.

723
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,620
Oh, God.

724
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,260
But let's leave things of this world behind

725
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,620
and walk now down the path of Bob

726
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,860
for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.

727
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,000
Oh, yeah.

728
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,160
Yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

729
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,260
And I know some of my listeners are going to think I'm crazy

730
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,940
for what I'm about to say, but you know what?

731
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,360
I don't care, because I have slack.

732
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,240
And you don't even know what that is.

733
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,280
I've got Bob Dobbs in my life.

734
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,540
Bob Dobbs, the living avatar of slack.

735
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,380
So I know I'll be safe on the pleasure vessels

736
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,200
of the sex goddesses from Planet X

737
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,180
when that day of judgment comes.

738
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,880
Ah, yes, and you unbelievers

739
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,620
will fry in a hell of your own making.

740
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,180
And how do I know this?

741
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,780
Why am I so sure?

742
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,060
Because I have slack.

743
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
I have faith, my friend.

744
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,900
Faith in Bob.

745
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,120
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

746
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,500
Nay, nay, you let that Bob signal from space

747
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,000
beam straight into your skull,

748
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,440
unfettered by your stupid notions

749
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,140
of good or evil or job or free will.

750
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,920
For the word of Bob is a direct word.

751
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,740
It is not written in some roundabout symbolic manner.

752
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,460
You don't try to figure out what it means, my friend.

753
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,000
You just do what it says.

754
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,260
Because Bob said it, I believed it,

755
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,640
and that settles it.

756
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,120
Let there be slack.

757
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,940
Uh huh.

758
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,480
Everything's safe.

759
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,020
Get outside, exercise, and take a bath.

760
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,720
YShowers

761
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,980
Oh, take a bath

762
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,040
our

763
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,640
Fukimono

764
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,020
All and VGO

765
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,220
all análès

766
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,660
allalala

767
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,220
lalalala lalalalala lalalalala

768
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:14,460
You cannot run from your own legs.

769
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,980
There's not a man or woman in here tonight who can run from their own legs.

770
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,020
Is there what you're using to run from a whip or how you gonna run from your own legs?

771
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:40,020
You cannot run from your own legs. You cannot hide from this man, J.R. Bob Dock.

772
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,640
You cannot hide from this guy, cause he's bigger than you, he's bigger than all infinity, he's bigger than the universe.

773
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:49,360
Oh, help me somebody, shake out your legs. My legs are on fire, freak.

774
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,660
You cannot see your own eyes. What are you gonna do, turn them inside out?

775
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,040
Oh, what the hell was that?

776
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,960
Who makes the rules?

777
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,960
If someone asks,

778
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,360
I'll tell you.

779
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:15,080
The advanced initiate, once freed from conspiracy programming as well as the worldly goods that enslaved him,

780
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:22,860
makes his pilgrimage to Dobstown, the church's fabulous walled encampment deep in the jungles of Malaysia.

781
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,980
There, the initiate's third nostril is surgically opened by psychic surgeons,

782
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,500
allowing him or her to whiff-read the psychic stench of those around him.

783
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:42,500
He masters the sciences of schizophreniatrics and memory editing, creating a clean slate on which Bob may write.

784
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:53,820
The purging is at last at hand. The day of doom is here.

785
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,480
All that is evil, all that have eyes, are blind.

786
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:03,480


787
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:03,480


788
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:03,480


789
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:19,540
Your parents, your leaders, those who would call themselves your judges, those who have lied and corrupted the earth, they shall all be cleansed.

790
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:32,160
In your hand, you hold my light, the gleam in the eye of set.

791
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:41,760
This flame will burn away the darkness, burn you away to paradise.

792
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,360
The light of the dark will burn you away to paradise.

793
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:15,040
And here another view of beautiful Dobstown, and the treatment that the initiate receives at the hands of Bob Dobbs and his chosen teachers.

794
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:22,240
My child, you have come to me, my son.

795
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,740
For who now is your father if it is not me?

796
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,940
Who gave you the will to live?

797
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,400
I am the wellspring from which you flow.

798
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,740
When I am gone, you will have never been.

799
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,380
What will your world be without me?

800
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,200
My son.

801
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,740
The end.

802
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,420
The end.

803
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:02,960
The end.

804
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:02,960


805
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,620
Extra meditation thus taught, whereby the mind is voided upon the great throne of relief.

806
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:13,500
You dont use your mind to think about your religion.

807
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,700
Bob is a very special kind of religious leader.

808
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,760
Bob is a short duration personal savior.

809
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,540
Yes children, Bob will be the savior.

810
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,400
In your heart, and in your mind, and in your mind, and in your heart, and in your mind.

811
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:30,400


812
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,140
God wants you to take him into your checkbook.

813
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,860
But after you've taken him into those sacred places,

814
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,300
God wants you to think about him, consider him, and then cast him out!

815
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,460
God wants you to make your own religion, your own rules.

816
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,080
...of what he calls short-duration personal saviors.

817
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,860
Now they will know why they are afraid of the dark.

818
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,960
It is foolish and cowardly to cling to any one personal savior.

819
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,960
The hectic pace of modern life demands disposable saviors,

820
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,120
specific ones suited to the moment at hand.

821
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,840
A sort of while-you-wait-do-it-yourself religion.

822
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,500
Now you're sure to understand the meaning of anything from a book you're reading,

823
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,200
to a smudge on the corner of a page of that book,

824
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,540
to a TV star you're currently enamored of,

825
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,000
to a brick that just misses crushing your skull

826
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,940
as it falls from the cornice of a rotting tree.

827
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,320
To the coagulated, dripping neck-stuff of a decapitated World Cup golfer.

828
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,800
And it can last anywhere from a nanosecond to your entire lifetime!

829
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,520
And you can have one or ten or millions of short-duration per-savs

830
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,500
concurrently, consecutively, and simultaneously.

831
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,720
Don't let the fact that Bob is a white man fool you.

832
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,460
His church truly spans the globe and embraces all races,

833
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,620
creeds, and several sexes.

834
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,080
Some undiscovered.

835
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:03,800
The subgenius race is the master race because it comes in all colors,

836
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,940
all sexes, all shapes.

837
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,500
And there's three sexes, by the way.

838
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,560
You know it.

839
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,340
Mmmmmm...

840
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,840
Bob is a rock.

841
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,720
Bob is a tree.

842
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,760
Come on, sing along!

843
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,600
Bob is a tree.

844
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:26,960
Bob is a you.

845
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,660
And Bob is me.

846
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,360
For the deaf people, please look to the stage right.

847
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,920
Bob is rich.

848
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,460
Bob is poor.

849
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,620
Bob is a window.

850
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,140
And Bob is a door.

851
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,160
We're gonna pick it up a little bit.

852
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,700
Bob is the sun.

853
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,260
Bob is the rain.

854
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,940
Bob is my tongue.

855
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:11,640
And Bob is my brain.

856
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,240
Welcome to the End Times.

857
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,500
In today's End Time essay, we will be covering the difference between

858
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,840
the Goprofram and the Bloodyhead Launcher Society itself.

859
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,000
As seen here in our first slide, the Bloodyhead Launcher Society goes on forever.

860
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,080
There is no end, and there's no use resisting.

861
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:41,600
.

862
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:41,600


863
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,580
.

864
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,000
.

865
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,820
. .

866
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,560
. .

867
00:40:59,560 --> 00:40:59,620
.

868
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:08,340
I hate when they say that your calls you're sitting in bed my calls right yes

00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,920

872
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:37,220

and that big white stone that everybody's going to know personally

894
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,620
in their very own home.

895
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:13,620
Ah, yes, dear friends, that stone, that's the stone.

896
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,100
That's the stone that you think you might know

897
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,520
and you think might help you.

898
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,540
But by God's dear friends,

899
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,000
that's the stone that's going to ruin your very lives.

900
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,640
You think you know who Big Brother is?

901
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,400
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

902
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,700
Dear friends, I want to tell you that you don't know.

903
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,480
You don't know nothing.

904
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,660
Come on, do it.

905
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,100
Those UFOs, they're flying all over your house.

906
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,140
That's right, then they know about bomb.

907

help me somebody help me my leg are on fire copyright 1986 jenner hypercons

976
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:31,640
well we've got some uh great looking we've got all of the official subgenius altar pieces that

977
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:38,040
haven't been stolen over the years the six foot bob head and the the wings of slack and

978
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:45,480
the uh well that's that's from the rio bisbee band that's some guys in maine that flag of the

979
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,700
wings of slack used to be on the back of a motorboat

980
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,480
and it's

981
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:55,940
an ironic symbol of how pathetic time control is until we have bob back because it's almost

982
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:02,320
completely falling apart with the fe spray tearing away at the you know when the clock

983
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:07,540
dissolves in the middle of it that'll be it i read something in the bible about that

984
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,660
you know just the bible's got all the same stuff that books the subgenius it's just older more

985
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:18,480
you know fancy language well it's you know it's just old people and they're the ones that need it

986
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,220
This is violent and, you know, lewd.

987
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,260
But it's got all those Middle Eastern idioms, you know.

988
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:22,960
Yeah.

989
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,040
Huuuh! Huuuh!

990
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,220
Listen to those mighty huuhs!

991
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,480
Huuuh! Huuuh!

992
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,560
Now, you know, that actually started out as

993
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,520
Huuuuh!

994
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:40,300
And it gradually got perverted over the years into this...

995
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,080
Well, it's better than I think.

996
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,340
St. James Brown started that?

997
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,180
You don't what?

998
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,420
End up with a sore throat.

999
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,560
You're right. You're right.

1000
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,140
Well, but, you know, if you do it enough, you don't get a sore throat.

1001
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,140
You get lightheaded.

1002
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,020
You talk like...

1003
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:53,240
Yeah.

1004
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,540
But that's... No, that's good.

1005
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,540
Lightheadedness is good.

1006
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,080
Well, as you can tell, friends, the, uh...

1007
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,260
It took a while for the parade to get started up.

1008
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,840
So we had a sort of a miniature sub...

1009
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,580
Ha!

1010
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,060
Miniature subgenius convention going on there.

1011
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,420
...getting the Batmobiles started.

1012
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,180
Could you come over and lay your hands on the battery?

1013
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,540
Hey, the way I do healings, I can't do them in public.

1014
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:17,540


1015
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,020
Okay?

1016
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:18,920
Whoa!

1017
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:25,500
And I don't believe that exhaust pipe has got enough diameter to it to work on that thing.

1018
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,940
So lay it on, but the hands aren't necessary.

1019
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:28,500
Yeah.

1020
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,560
Now, Chastity Bell is really...

1021
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,800
She's a good healer of appliances.

1022
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,380
See, we had Dr. Drummond was here all...

1023
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,020
Hey, Zandy!

1024
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:37,600
Watch out.

1025
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,820
Don't drop the ray gun on that Bob face.

1026
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,200
And damage the ray gun.

1027
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,220
Look, they're starting to move up there.

1028
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:47,540
I bet they're...

1029
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,760
I better grab my...

1030
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,360
Oh, take up the cross.

1031
00:49:52,580 --> 00:50:00,160
Friends, I've got a giant, heavy wooden cross here with the six-foot bobs taped to the back.

1032
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,200
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1033
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:08,300
This is the hour of slack.

1034
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,920
Now, you know how you do that?

1035
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,300
You go, this is the subgenius radio ministry.

1036
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,560
Our almost...

1037
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,460
Almost...

1038
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:25,700
And it is, dear friends, on KNO and 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

1039
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:34,960
The only station that inflicts the word of Bob and the church of the subgenius on you.

1040
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,680
This is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1041
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,280
And it was a...

1042
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,240
But the parade gathered in momentum.

1043
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,600
I'll tell you, I can't imagine what the people along the street watching this conversation...

1044
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:46,900
Could go by.

1045
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:47,520
Could it...

1046
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:52,800
I mean, there were all these outlandish, Mardi Gras-type groups going by.

1047
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,160
And then along would come the subgeniuses.

1048
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,420
And it was sort of like Exodus.

1049
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,580
You know, it was...

1050
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,600
It was astounding.

1051
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,100
It was inspirational.

1052
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:15,420
These mystical emblems on poles carrying flags and pictures of this man with a pipe and dots all over his face.

1053
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,820
The face of Bob Dobbs.

1054
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,120
His hair pompadoured back.

1055
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,860
A modern guru.

1056
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,760
A modern leader for us all.

1057
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:32,900
A symbol of the freedom and the slack for which we mutants pray.

1058
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,900
And it was a great parade.

1059
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,440
Even little kids were in it.

1060
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,800
I brought my X and XY unit.

1061
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,340
People by the road.

1062
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,080
Some laughed.

1063
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,500
Some stared blankly in incomprehension.

1064
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:57,020
And a few unsavables rolled their eyes and sneered like they thought we must be the most hopeless juvenile fools.

1065
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,900
And we are friends, among other things.

1066
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:06,960
But they'd never understand the freedom it takes to be able to know Bob.

1067
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:07,620
For they're...

1068
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,400
And they're...

1069
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,360
It's their poor blinkered idea of being...

1070
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:14,580
Mature.

1071
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,400
Huh.

1072
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:17,380
Mature.

1073
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,960
Hey, grow up, man.

1074
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,120
Like, this Bob stuff is stupid.

1075
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,980
Why don't you get into Washington, Dallas Cowboys like everybody else?

1076
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:26,400
Friends!

1077
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,020
We don't care if it's Bob.

1078
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,760
Bob himself doesn't care if you worship him.

1079
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,920
You might as well be worshipping Dan or Bill.

1080
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:34,720
Praise Bill.

1081
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:35,660
Or Spider-Man.

1082
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,800
If it gives you slack, then great.

1083
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,340
If you really have slack, my friends, you're a soldier for Bob Dobbs.

1084
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:43,340


1085
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,120
Whether you mean to be or not.

1086
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,880
Ah, yes.

1087
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,100
So the parade moved out.

1088
00:52:54,460 --> 00:53:09,960
The awe-inspiring face of Bob striking fear into the hearts of the lawyers who, for mere money, would make us have to raise more money ourselves come the pledge drive.

1089
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,160
In one hour, dear friends.

1090
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,860
The pledge drive starts.

1091
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,080
Now, next week will be our pledge drive show.

1092
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,700
And you better be ready for it.

1093
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,200
Dr. Zaphod, St. Frazier, praise St. Frazier.

1094
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:31,880
The mighty Cecilia are all gonna be here answering your phone calls, your pledges, your pleads.

1095
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,840
And they'll be healing you over the phone.

1096
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,040
So now's the time to give to KNON.

1097
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,960
But preferably in the name of the hour of slack.

1098
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:41,140
Come on.

1099
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,180
Because that helps show that we have support.

1100
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:50,040
So we won't be replaced by some other show that can claim to be more relevant to the community.

1101
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,460
More relevant.

1102
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:58,760
What could be more relevant, dear friends, than the word of Bob Dobbs?

1103
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,880
Yeah, I've got two more reels of tape hanging off of me.

1104
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,640
Oh my gosh, that microphone is dangling in an unseemly way.

1105
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,820
I really shouldn't do that.

1106
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,160
I'm asking for it.

1107
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,700
I have microphones hanging off of me.

1108
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,980
And this one, it actually doesn't do me justice.

1109
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,340
You're in a critical position.

1110
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:19,940
Yeah.

1111
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:20,580
Are you sure it's staying?

1112
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:21,460
Yeah.

1113
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,440
I just wanted to shake your hand.

1114
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:23,800
Howdy.

1115
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,660
Oh, are you a member or a...

1116
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,120
I'm not your listener right now.

1117
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,720
I've been thinking about joining.

1118
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,540
Well, thinking ain't enough, my friend.

1119
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,060
That's right.

1120
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,800
Without that membership card in your pocket, you don't know what's gonna happen.

1121
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:40,800


1122
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,320
I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen to you come next day.

1123
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,720
But I just wanted to shake your hand.

1124
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,840
Hope that all this does real well.

1125
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,480
Yeah, I hope we get our license back.

1126
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,100
Well, it's not gone yet.

1127
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,700
They'll appeal for a couple of years.

1128
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,160
But the problem is that they'll have to pay for the appeals.

1129
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,840
So they won't be able to go to 100,000?

1130
00:54:59,140 --> 00:54:59,360
Right.

1131
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:06,140
The whole problem is, you know, it's like the judge is mad because they haven't gone to 100,000 watts.

1132
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,140
And the reason they haven't gone to 100,000 watts

1133
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,580
is because they had to spend all their money on lawyers.

1134
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:19,200
Well, as you can hear, the parade participants are getting very impatient to start.

1135
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:26,980
We're already almost 45 minutes late in getting a move on here with this parade.

1136
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,120
Now, some people are walking forward.

1137
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,820
Oh, marching to the slaughterhouse.

1138
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,020
Start to move out.

1139
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,580
Now, you guys remember to wave that bob head around.

1140
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:40,800
I'll hold it up.

1141
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,360
And you've got your little green pipe down.

1142
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:43,860
Daddy's here.

1143
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:44,660
Oh, no thanks.

1144
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:45,900
He's trying to cut down.

1145
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,760
We ought to be in front of the gospel group.

1146
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:48,560
Yeah.

1147
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,960
We are gospel.

1148
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,680
We are the only good news.

1149
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,600
It's a full slack gospel.

1150
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:00,980
Actually, well, their gospel is fairly, it's about a three-quarters slack gospel.

1151
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,460
They're not, I like the gospel.

1152
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:05,440
Last time I was up by the front, they weren't making enough noise.

1153
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,040
In my opinion.

1154
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,040
Well, they're more solemn, you know.

1155
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:09,920
They're more solemn.

1156
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:10,480
That's true.

1157
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:15,800
They take the suffering path, the suffering path of the crybaby Jesus.

1158
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,600
No, no, no, no.

1159
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:22,020
I don't think the Kano and gospel folks do because they're black Christians.

1160
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:28,580
And they're more like, they like to hoot and holler and have fun and, you know, praise the Lord.

1161
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:35,100
As opposed to your, you know, more standard mainstream guys that are all real solemn.

1162
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:35,920
The generic Christians.

1163
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,520
Yeah, the generic ones are, they don't know how to have fun.

1164
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,820
But the gospel people do.

1165
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:51,420
You know, I mean, I don't understand how they can believe in some dead guy on a stick instead of a guy with dots all over his face like we do.

1166
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,740
I just don't understand that.

1167
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,780
Well, I mean, that's such an irrational belief.

1168
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,800
A dead guy on a stick, right?

1169
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,540
It's sort of like launching a, you know.

1170
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,320
A head or something.

1171
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,000
Well, it's like launching a Carol Burnett.

1172
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,100
Or a Sam Snead head.

1173
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,320
It didn't make any sense.

1174
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,100
No, no.

1175
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:16,140
You know, there's an Arnold Palmer head and yet they launch a, you know, Jack Nicklaus head.

1176
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,580
What's the point?

1177
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,340
What the heck is the penguin doing in the Batmobile?

1178
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:23,040
You guys.

1179
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,020
And the questioner.

1180
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:27,020
We had Batburgers for lunch.

1181
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,660
That guy is drunk with his Bat beer and now we don't know what we're drinking.

1182
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:30,100
Oh, man.

1183
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,660
Oh, God.

1184
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:35,080
I was hoping you guys could stay off the Bat beer.

1185
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,300
At least for the duration of the parade.

1186
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,500
We all have our own crossings, Barry, you know.

1187
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,600
Yeah, right.

1188
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,320
Look at that.

1189
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,280
The Batarang's all beat up.

1190
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,120
Got beer stains all over it.

1191
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,300
We're ashamed of you.

1192
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,040
We're ashamed.

1193
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,880
Well, Batman and Robin are all beat up.

1194
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,220
There's little kids.

1195
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:59,900
There's little kids that look up to you superheroes and super villains as role models.

1196
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,620
I'm tired of being a role model.

1197
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:02,920
I'm tired of it.

1198
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,600
I just want to kick some booty.

1199
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:06,580
Excuse me.

1200
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:19,860
Oh, we're finally, finally the subgenius death march from Dallas to San Francisco.

1201
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,520
The fourth annual subgenius death march.

1202
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:30,780
If five or six of us are left when we finally make it there, then we win.

1203
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,500
Then all who died win also.

1204
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:34,580
Yeah.

1205
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:34,660
I think so.

1206
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,680
Nev Reedy started the death march.

1207
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,400
With Star, Todd, and Dan.

1208
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,360
And he's lived through all of them so far.

1209
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,120
All the death marches.

1210
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:45,820
All the parade ones.

1211
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,260
Yeah.

1212
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:52,840
But boy, they throw a hell of a dock stock festival at the end of everyone who ever is left.

1213
00:58:55,100 --> 00:59:03,360
And friends, I wonder as we subgeniuses struggle along here, what these people think.

1214
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:11,260
They're thinking, this looks like some sort of a religious group they're thinking.

1215
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:18,060
They're carrying crosses and mystic symbols, but they don't recognize the guy hanging on

1216
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,120
the cross, you know?

1217
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:19,720
Yeah.

1218
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,020
It's like when did Jesus get back haircut and smoke a pipe?

1219
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,420
Three pills.

1220
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:28,000
Three pills.

1221
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,040
Three pills.

1222
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:32,540
Three pills.

1223
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:33,060
Three pills.

1224
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:33,060


1225
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,500
Three pills.

1226
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:40,660
One part of the conspiracy would like you to believe in the little, cute, squatty aliens.

1227
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:46,400
The Spielbergian aliens who'll come to save us all.

1228
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,000
Oh, they'll come just in time before the conspiracy pushes the button.

1229
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,840
You'll be too loud to have them on your side.

1230
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:57,660
Because at least there's two arms and two legs.

1231
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,660
It could be worse.

1232
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:03,740
It could be much worse.

1233
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,720
Three amorphous, hideous things glide up upon reality.

1234
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,720
You'll be lucky to get that.

1235
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,300
At least that's something you can puke at.

1236
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,140
Something you can throw up over.

1237
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,420
Something you can run in fear away from.

1238
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:24,620
What if it's something you can't run away from because you can't see and it's everywhere?

1239
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:27,560
Something just like the conspiracy is.

1240
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,660
God, what you gonna...

1241
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:29,960
Are you just gonna sit there?

1242
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,380
They won't even have to do it.

1243
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,840
Bob won't even have to see the day the world happens properly.

1244
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,100
It'll happen by accident.

1245
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:57,200
The exes have landed.

1246
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:03,580
Earth's under their control.

1247
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:11,300
Bob's vision stands proven.

1248
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,860
The city's radioactive holes.

1249
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:25,660
We don't know what their game is.

1250
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:29,180
But their name is...

1251
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,000
Unpronounceable.

1252
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:38,520
Monsters like a true man will be around thee all night.

1253
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:43,700
And shall make thee to look past the door which should be locked.

1254
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:49,600
And thy silences will terrify thee and bring thee naught but devils.

1255
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:55,000
For thy spirit is locked away inside the wild stern.

1256
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:59,580
But thou shalt not see which man is in some great firm's space.

1257
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:04,980
Their machines following our tracks.

1258
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:11,820
Bob's vision stands proven.

1259
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:18,040
A world without slack.

1260
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:25,640
But what is the commodity with which Bob will bargain Earth's future?

1261
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:29,840
Some claim it is the souls of his followers.

1262
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:34,540
The true subgenius does not question Bob's wisdom in such matters.

1263
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:40,280
We have only our simple faith that heaven will be ours if we only believe.

1264
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:49,980
Ironically, his mission will not be to sell Earth but to prevent Earth being sold and transformed into a kind of Stuckeys in space.

1265
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,540
Don't forget that Bob is...

1266
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:55,120
Has come to, uh...

1267
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:59,740
has prophesied the end of the world by July 5, 1998...

1268
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,800
When most Americans will have hangovers, but it's not just for the Americans.

1269
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,100
It's for everyone in the world.

1270
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:08,180
Right. That is...

1271
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,520
that is why...

1272
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,920
Yeah, start smokin', start drinkin', and live it up.

1273
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,900
Start fornicating as if your very life depended on it.

1274
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:23,080
I'm speaking to you in the old calendar year, 1981...

1275
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,120
which we refer to as 17BX.

1276
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:31,220
BX before the excess before the excess land this is true all the signs of are

1277
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:36,980
already in place and Bob has come to us to make sure the end of the world

1278
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:45,220
happens but this plan will succeed only if only if dear friends that you get

1279
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:51,660
ready for that pledge drive that thing starts in an hour oh ten minutes yeah

1280
01:03:51,660 --> 01:04:00,580
ten minutes now oh oh the wrong script once again and boy this is probably the

1281
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:05,840
most important one you know I've we've before been able to sort of have fun

1282
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:12,320
with the pledge drives and and we will this time but I mean this is getting

1283
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:19,100
really serious as you heard a little earlier it's like this the this station

1284
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,760
has has been

1285
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:29,180
under severe constraints that cost a lot of money legally and we're gonna stay

1286
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:32,980
on that's not with their people have misunderstood that you know this was we

1287
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:39,380
only had a couple of weeks or something we've probably got a year or two as long

1288
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:46,180
as they can pay for the legal fees all this stuff happens in Washington not in

1289
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:50,560
Dallas and in Washington they don't you there aren't very many canoen fans they

1290
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,000
don't know

1291
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:59,080
that much about it and thus we do things like the parade which was really

1292
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:03,500
intended to get some some media attention that that might some echo of

1293
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:07,980
which might make it all the way up to the mighty courts in Washington but I

1294
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:10,260
need to get on with this live report from the parade

1295
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,360
Bob money sex

Bob money sex free pills

1297

1299
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:24,660
Bob money sex free pills

1300
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:27,100
Bob money sex free pills

1301
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,960
I want like lightning straight down the

1302
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:40,360
You know if you get hit with this if you get hit on the head by this cross I'm carrying the Bob cross and you get a cut on your head then that's good because oh we gotta run okay come on

1303
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,440
Oh my gosh

1304
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,440
Hey

1305
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:44,460
Howdy

1306
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:47,000
Nice to meet you I'm a pink infiltrator

1307
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:48,340
Oh my gosh

1308
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:48,900
It's true

1309
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,060
A pink infiltrator?

1310
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:50,640
Yeah it's true

1311
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:58,540
I'm surprised they ever gave that you all ever gave us enough credence to even bother to infiltrate I mean

1312
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:06,020
Well what it is is I got tired of chasing communists and types where I had to be secret about it

1313
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:06,360
Yeah

1314
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:14,180
And I applied for some kind of a job where I didn't have to be secret about it where I could come and say that I was infiltrating and they said that you guys were in so that's why I'm here

1315
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,020
Oh okay well as long as

1316
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:18,160
You guys

1317
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,000
You guys

1318
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:26,080
Well I don't I don't I guess there's nothing you know nothing you could tell them that they would want to hear or would believe

1319
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:32,540
Yeah I think they might actually be trying to get me off their back you know give me a foolish assignment just to keep me away from them

1320
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:38,160
You sound like you probably ought to just you know convert to Bob and you know renounce your pinkness

1321
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:39,140
Well

1322
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:46,080
Although no one can really do that exactly but they can if they think they do then they usually write us checks

1323
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,080
Oh yeah?

1324
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:47,160
Yeah

1325
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:47,460
Yeah

1326
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:50,140
So you see it's at least

1327
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:50,740
Well I wrote you

1328
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:57,540
You know within the hypocrisy you know within the limitation of hypocrisy it's very honest sort of church

1329
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:58,380
Oh yeah?

1330
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:58,680
Yeah

1331
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,300
I want a picture

1332
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,240
Computer generated

1333
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:06,600
Tell me something actually I have to write a report tonight what should I tell them?

1334
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:07,500
Oh for who?

1335
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:07,880
I don't know

1336
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:08,280
Oh for the

1337
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:08,780
For them

1338
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:09,300
For them

1339
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:09,680
It's a conspiracy

1340
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:16,980
Oh tell them that this appears to be a threat to human peace and sanity and it's like

1341
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:17,060
I don't know

1342
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:21,820
It's like undoubtedly is the one world religion prophesied in the bible and it's

1343
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:22,040
Okay

1344
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:26,360
You know that it's not a bunch of sort of silly teenagers

1345
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:27,420
Uh huh

1346
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:30,160
Guys that ever grew up but it's

1347
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:30,600
I see

1348
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,140
You know like Jim Jones, Charlie Manson kind of serious

1349
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:33,600
Okay

1350
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:41,600
And you know you definitely saw people under the influence of mind control and those that had minds

1351
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,920
Okay alright I will thank you for the guidance on that

1352
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:45,620
Sure sure

1353
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,240
Who helped me?

1354
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:47,580
Somebody

1355
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,840
Well there's some Bob-Bites over on the side

1356
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,300
I got it on the tape

1357
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:54,400
Huh?

1358
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:55,480
I got it on the tape

1359
01:07:55,480 --> 01:08:03,580
Oh thank you okay Captain Sun Sunson has brought a new donation of audio tape we can use on

1360
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:10,240
the show it's in a ball but Bob can play this kind of thing back just by holding it up to

1361
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:10,800
his temple

1362
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:15,400
Daddy next time it stops I'm going to run and hop in the back

1363
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:15,600
Okay

1364
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:15,600


1365
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:15,600


1366
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:15,600


1367
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:15,600


1368
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:22,060
You know those serious looking liberals back there behind the Bob truck look kind of they don't

1369
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:23,720
They don't look like they're having as much fun

1370
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:24,120
Daddy

1371
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,020
Oh

1372
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,480
Get in place get in place

1373
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,840
Don't jump don't jump

1374
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:35,400
Oh my gosh the questioner is climbing up the side of a building here at St. Paul and Munger

1375
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:43,180
Batman and Robin are pursuing him they're in hot pursuit but oh my gosh Batman is not in the shape he used to be

1376
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:45,580
He's obviously out of shape the Riddler is out of shape too

1377
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:52,040
He's about to get away from him easily the Riddler went in one window Batman followed him now the Riddler is coming out the other window

1378
01:08:52,040 --> 01:09:03,660
But right into the arms of Robin who is so plastered from drinking his bat beer if that's what it really is that oh my gosh and the Riddler easily out distances

1379
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:07,840
Oh there goes the Batarang friends oh it doesn't even return to it

1380
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,760
It returns

1381
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:13,020
Yeah after the questioner threw it

1382
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:13,680
Questioner

1383
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,400
That's not the Riddler it's the questioner

1384
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:15,560
Questioner

1385
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:21,700
He's evil because he goes around to people and questions whether their job is meaningful and stuff

1386
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:22,800
Where did the truck go?

1387
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,420
Where did the truck go?

1388
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,440
I'm being stupid

1389
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:39,240
They're watching Batman and Robin and the subgenius truck went way ahead of us and that's one more example of why Bob didn't call it the church of the genius

1390
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:45,560
This I think we're just about if on camera one it looks like coming around the corner here

1391
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:49,680
And just about to go by the back side of the first Baptist church which was just a coincidence

1392
01:09:50,640 --> 01:10:07,660
I couldn't believe it there was there was a you know I don't think anybody was worried about exactly but there were a few you know six or seven nice pink type folks with grins on their faces and looking very friendly to us really

1393
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:15,540
But surrounding them were a bunch of hired security guys with guns armed guards dear friends to protect those men who were in danger of being killed by the cops

1394
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:15,540


1395
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:24,040
And I think that's what we're trying to do here is to protect those servants of the Lord from the evil dangerous and even sometimes dark skinned K-N-O-N fanatics

1396
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:29,580
You know I'm not I don't know what they thought we were gonna do like bomb their abortion clinics or something

1397
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:33,460
There must be some shit we can do

1398
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:41,160
The one who kicked out the demons from this building

1399
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,040
Praise Bob

1400
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:46,900
We've had good

1401
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:13,540
They will eat them and grow strong

1402
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:15,540
ordan

1403
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,720
Yes, Nunu loves me!

1404
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,720
Yes, Nunu loves me!

1405
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,680
My Brooklyn tells me so!

1406
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:31,680
Who is this Nunu of whom they speak?

1407
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:34,520
You must not speak of me, Nunu.

1408
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,520
Surely not the ancient sex goddess of antiquity?

1409
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:42,900
The one they call the Venus of Willendorf?

1410
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:47,020
Known by other names? The obese ancient

1411
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,760
180 year old woman of fertility?

1412
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:54,400
Surely not! Surely not that one!

1413
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:58,880
Buck is heavy in the Nunu. That's why he gets around.

1414
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:00,600
Well maybe I ought to carry this thing.

1415
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:06,640
I was carrying this bob across with a giant,

1416
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:10,860
giant bob stuck on the back. Nothing blasphemous meant here.

1417
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:12,000
It was strictly a...

1418
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,500
The whole world is watching!

1419
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:16,820
It was strictly an allegorical sort of thing.

1420
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,500
I mean, the money changers are in the temple, friends, as far as I'm concerned.

1421
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:23,200
He feeds the false churches!

1422
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:28,720
Give us not these false flags! Give us not these Mercedes!

1423
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:31,640
Give us not yet ye television stations!

1424
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:37,040
Oh good, what it says there, it says full house, but Bob will give it to you straight!

1425
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,100
True Bob!

1426
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,080
Nothing but aces with Bob!

1427
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:45,740
Well we're walking by the first Baptist church parking lot, dear friends!

1428
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:46,700
Praise Bob!

1429
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:47,560
There are some...

1430
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,620
Six aces!

1431
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,420
Two out of the sleeve!

1432
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,820
They're nice folks.

1433
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,840
I'm sure they're...

1434
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,820
I'm stumbling by here with this,

1435
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,340
with this, uh,

1436
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,220
Bob crucified.

1437
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:04,880
I'll get it. No, no, no, no, no.

1438
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,680
I have to carry it, it's the effect, the martyr effect.

1439
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,460
I'm doing this on purpose.

1440
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:13,180
I'm walking like our Lord Jesus did when he had to carry the cross.

1441
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:17,100
Like Bob did, our Lord Bob did when he had to carry his briefcase.

1442
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,940
All the way across Manhattan.

1443
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:21,860
This is where I got my doctor's badge, isn't it?

1444
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,080
Where's my...

1445
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,200
my child? Oh, there.

1446
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:26,560
Oh.

1447
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:35,040
Well, he's... that was a very, uh, actually sort of an anticlimactic moment passing the first Baptist church enemy of K-N-O-N.

1448
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,640
Because, uh, they weren't...

1449
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,220
No one yelled, no one was rude to each other.

1450
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,520
We yelled,

1451
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:42,860
praise Bob, and they prayed.

1452
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,240
And Bob prayed on them.

1453
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,780
Those are just Bob's words.

1454
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:48,760
You know Bob's words.

1455
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,880
Bob, Bob,

1456
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,440
oh no, now I have to run again with this.

1457
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:56,220
Oh my God, this huge Bob head is acting like a...

1458
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:57,100
a kite!

1459
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:59,120
It's like a hand glider!

1460
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,300
I'm 20 feet over the street,

1461
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:02,820
I can't believe...

1462
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,740
Oh, let me down, that was incredible.

1463
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:06,800
I got you on the rope.

1464
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:12,960
Listen, if we could drive a little faster, I could stay suspended with that kind of wind.

1465
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:13,740
Yeah, we thought that might work.

1466
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:14,380
Yeah.

1467
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:17,000
I never showed up.

1468
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:18,620
Oh, Batman and...

1469
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,460
Batman, he's angry.

1470
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,680
I just like building that

1471
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:26,120
edifice of spewing hatred!

1472
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,500
One more time,

1473
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:28,440
I'm gonna puke!

1474
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,540
He... Batman just said, if I...

1475
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:33,540
Speaking of the first Baptist church, if I

1476
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:35,460
pass that... that what

1477
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:37,620
edifice of spewing hatred...

1478
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,420
I'll puke.

1479
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:41,620
But he's got that mask on, you know,

1480
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:42,740
that's quite a sacrifice.

1481
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:44,600
Batman...

1482
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:46,180
Yeah.

1483
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,340
Oh, I bet that's it.

1484
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,080
Slack, sex, Bob! Slack, sex, Bob!

1485
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:55,420
Slack, sex, Bob! Slack, sex, Bob!

1486
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:58,260
Slack, sex, Bob! Slack, sex, Bob!

1487
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:58,960
Slack, sex, Bob! Slack, sex, Bob!

1488
01:14:58,960 --> 01:14:58,980
Slack, sex, Bob!

1489
01:14:58,980 --> 01:14:59,320
Pilled!

1490
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:03,400
You know this is true! Those puns, they will fester,

1491
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,440
they will kill, they will cause

1492
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,240
horrible nasty absences

1493
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,540
if you don't let them go, if you don't let them

1494
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,300
out of your body, if you don't spout

1495
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,320
those horrible puns and horrible

1496
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,640
nasty riddles and jokes, they will

1497
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,500
kill you, kill that other

1498
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:18,620
soul within you.

1499
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,480
I think he... I think he's been getting him

1500
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:22,400
some Bob pills.

1501
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,460
Bob!

1502
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:27,680
The passers-by, they mock

1503
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,620
us, they stone us!

1504
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,660
Run with Bob! Run with Bob and take

1505
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:33,360
pictures of it! Friends, this...

1506
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,160
the weight...

1507
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,560
I feel the weight of Bob's

1508
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,460
face, every dot,

1509
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,560
every dot seems like it

1510
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,300
weighs a ton.

1511
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:44,380
And I believe,

1512
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,600
Mr. Stang, Dr. Stang,

1513
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,060
Professor Stang,

1514
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,340
that every dot does in fact

1515
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,360
constitute a universe

1516
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,560
within the realm of Bob's

1517
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,640
power. And they all

1518
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,660
weigh like a 10 billion dwarf

1519
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:01,640
stars. That's right. They're all

1520
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,620
black holes. They all weigh

1521
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:05,720
what a black hole does. They all signify

1522
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,660
what black holes signify.

1523
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,360
Every dot of Bob

1524
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,400
will suck in

1525
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,120
everything else in the universe.

1526
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:15,380
And the only reason that anyone

1527
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:17,480
given one doesn't is because

1528
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,460
of the proximity to each other.

1529
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:22,080
They negate

1530
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:22,980
each other's pull.

1531
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:25,500
That's right. That's right.

1532
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,760
Oh! Oh my gosh!

1533
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,480
My microphone swinging

1534
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,700
obscenely at my lap!

1535
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:35,100
I can't believe it!

1536
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:37,660
Bob is coming!

1537
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,500
The end is near!

1538
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,560
Bob is coming! Get him a towel!

1539
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,780
And Bob comes

1540
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:46,540
again and again

1541
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,000
to justify

1542
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,080
your sins, my friend!

1543
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:54,020
To rationalize

1544
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:54,860
your sins!

1545
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,640
To teach you to live with your sins,

1546
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:58,580
brothers and sisters!

1547
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,440
Live with your sins!

1548
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,740
But why, Bob? Why am I doing this?

1549
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:05,680
Why do I give myself

1550
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,500
leg cramps?

1551
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,500
Why am I floating your hideous head

1552
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:12,660
miles and miles

1553
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:14,860
in front of unheeding,

1554
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:18,800
unwhiting

1555
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,720
passers-by?

1556
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,660
Oh my gosh!

1557
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:22,120
There it is!

1558
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:22,720
City Hall!

1559
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,340
It's within sight!

1560
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,400
And there I will get upon this cross.

1561
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,360
My hands will be scotch-tape

1562
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,020
to this cross.

1563
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,220
They'll nail me up!

1564
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:36,580
And they'll nail me up!

1565
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:37,660
They'll nail me up!

1566
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:39,140
Just as

1567
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:41,280
the evil false churches

1568
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,820
would nail K-N-O-N up!

1569
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,640
They're riding out of

1570
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:46,900
the proper air!

1571
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,420
You can make it stink!

1572
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,940
Come on! The last few minutes

1573
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:53,240
you've been via Dolorosa!

1574
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,440
I don't know!

1575
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,420
Oh my God!

1576
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:59,140
It's just a few inches more

1577
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,160
and then they'll kill me!

1578
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:02,000
Oh! Oh!

1579
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,360
Why are we stopping? I want to die!

1580
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:07,660
I finally see

1581
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,460
Bob! I understand

1582
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:11,320
now! Kill me!

1583
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:12,620
Kill me!

1584
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:15,720
Now I know

1585
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,540
what... Now I know what slack is!

1586
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,680
Nail me up!

1587
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:21,180
K-N-O-N almost killed him!

1588
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,220
Killed him!

1589
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:25,680
Wait, wait, wait! That N-O-N isn't sanctified!

1590
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:27,420
The laying on of the

1591
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:28,260
putting herbs!

1592
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:31,500
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1593
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,180
Oh! Oh!

1594
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:33,860
Oh!

1595
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,020
My Bob! My Bob!

1596
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,660
Why hast thou forsaken me?

1597
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:40,540
Oh!

1598
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:41,740
Bob!

1599
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:45,580
Oh!

1600
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:46,120
Woo!

1601
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,980
You really look pretty!

1602
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:48,940
Come on!

1603
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:54,780
Yeah, I wish I had some, uh,

1604
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:55,880
some toothpaste

1605
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,640
so I could look like I was slobbering.

1606
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:58,460
Woo!

1607
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:00,800
Oh!

1608
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,040
Here,

1609
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:04,640
City Hall

1610
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,220
for the money changers.

1611
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,320
Gathering of the Horde.

1612
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,080
Stop stand!

1613
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:13,620
I thought it was a myth!

1614
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:14,820
A joke!

1615
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:16,900
Oh, God!

1616
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:17,920
Figures!

1617
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,060
Eugh!

1618
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,000
We made it!

1619
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,540
Dr. Spade, we made it!

1620
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:27,380
Do I get to die now?

1621
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,200
Yeah! Is the show over?

1622
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:31,500
Is this the end of the show?

1623
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,620
Is this the end of the show?

1624
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:35,600
Wait a minute, Slade! We're about to do the

1625
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,040
cassette over! No!

1626
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,620
No, kill me first!

1627
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:41,300
I can't stand another 90 minutes to this!

1628
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,240
Contemplate this

1629
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,160
on the Tree of Woe.

1630
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,260
Crucify him.

1631
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:06,520
Dinner for wolves?

1632
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,100
Ha ha ha!

1633
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:11,380
Ha ha ha!

1634
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:13,540
What gods

1635
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:14,280
do you pray to?

1636
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:20,600
I pray to the four winds.

1637
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:23,480
And you?

1638
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:25,660
To Plum.

1639
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,400
But I seldom pray to him.

1640
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,820
He doesn't listen.

1641
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:37,640
Ha ha ha!

1642
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,940
What good is he then?

1643
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,160
Eugh!

1644
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,580
It's just as I've always said.

1645
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:45,360
He's strong.

1646
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:48,620
If I die, I have to go before him.

1647
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:50,820
And he will ask me,

1648
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:52,600
what is the riddle of steel?

1649
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:54,500
If I don't know it,

1650
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:55,760
he will cast me out of Valhalla

1651
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,480
and laugh at me.

1652
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:57,640
That's Plum.

1653
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:00,120
Strong on his mountain.

1654
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,720
Eugh! My god is greater.

1655
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:05,020
Ha ha!

1656
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,940
Plum laughs at your four winds.

1657
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:08,920
He laughs from his mountain.

1658
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:10,660
My god is stronger.

1659
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:14,760
He is the everlasting sky.

1660
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,720
Your god lives underneath him.

1661
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:23,520
Eugh!

1662
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:23,860


1663
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:24,620
Eugh!

1664
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:27,540
Eugh!

1665
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:27,540


1666
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:27,680
Eugh!

1667
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,360
Eugh!

1668
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:33,360
This is KNON 90.9 FM

1669
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,960
in Dallas, Texas.

1670
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,780
Fire and wind come from the sky.

1671
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:37,660
Eugh!

1672
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,300
From the gods of the sky.

1673
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,680
But Krum is your god.

1674
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,060
Krum, and he lives in the earth.

1675
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:49,060
Once giants lived in the earth.

1676
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:49,860
Kronan.

1677
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,000
And in the darkness of chaos,

1678
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:55,040
they fooled Krum.

1679
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,300
And they took from him the enigma of steel.

1680
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,940
Krum was angered.

1681
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,420
And the earth shook.

1682
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:06,420
And fire and wind struck down these giants.

1683
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,660
And they threw their bodies in the sea.

1684
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:07,660


1685
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:07,660


1686
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:08,020
And the waters.

1687
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,360
But in their rage,

1688
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:14,940
the gods forgot the secret of steel

1689
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:16,360
and left it on the battlefield.

1690
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,200
And we who found it

1691
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,380
are just men.

1692
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,500
Not gods.

1693
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,400
Not giants.

1694
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:29,620
Just men.

1695
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:33,780
And the secret of steel

1696
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:35,660
has always carried with it a mystery.

1697
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,640
You must learn to understand

1698
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:37,640


1699
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:37,640


1700
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:38,500
its riddle, Kronan.

1701
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,680
You must learn its discipline.

1702
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,360
For no one,

1703
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,660
no one in this world

1704
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:46,500
can you trust.

1705
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,220
Not men. Not women.

1706
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,060
Not beasts.

1707
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,400
This you can trust.

1708
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:58,000
This, son.

1709
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:01,680
This image of J.R.

1710
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,100
Bob Dobbs.

1711
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,860
And this radio station.

1712
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:07,600
Ah, yes.

1713
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:09,620
Well, friends,

1714
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:11,300
I have one last request.

1715
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,460
If you were there at the, um,

1716
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:14,980
at the parade,

1717
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:16,780
subgenius believer or not,

1718
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:20,340
if you have any good 35mm photos

1719
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:21,380
of the, uh,

1720
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:23,560
subgenius section with the giant bob head,

1721
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:25,460
or especially any

1722
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:27,460
videotape, I can really use that.

1723
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,580
And you could either drop it in my box

1724
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,060
at the station here

1725
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:33,800
on San Jacinto, or you could mail it

1726
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:35,700
along with your request

1727
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:37,620
for information about the

1728
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:39,020
church at the subgenius.

1729
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,780
To P.O. Box

1730
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:43,660
This is, this isn't, I'm not about

1731
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:45,220
to read the station's box.

1732
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,680
This is the subgenius post office box.

1733
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:50,720
Uh, P.O. Box

1734
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:54,940
140306

1735
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:56,080
You got that?

1736
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,020
140306

1737
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:00,240
Dallas, Texas

1738
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:02,860
75214

1739
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:05,520
Or, uh, I suppose

1740
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,280
you could call me right now

1741
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:09,460
8237490

1742
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:12,060
You know, the pledge drive

1743
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:13,860
is about to happen,

1744
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:15,000
folks, and there,

1745
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,240
once again, I cannot stress

1746
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,000
strongly enough

1747
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:21,320
just how important

1748
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:22,440
it is

1749
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,600
to your eardrums,

1750
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,000
to your hearts and minds,

1751
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,820
to be able to, you know,

1752
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:31,280
people who, um,

1753
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,380
uh, who listen to the show a lot

1754
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,620
and don't listen to what's going on on the internet,

1755
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:38,300
and the other stations.

1756
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:41,580
You don't know how lucky you are.

1757
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,560
You really don't.

1758
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:47,720
It's, it's money.

1759
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,320
It was funny, at the parade, one of,

1760
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:51,120
I brought my two test tube babies

1761
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,060
to the K&ON parade, and one of them,

1762
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,740
young Idnax, got so fired up

1763
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:57,220
that he actually spouted a new

1764
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:59,680
church motto, which is unusual for him,

1765
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:01,360
because he, normally he's a

1766
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,600
heretic against Bob.

1767
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:05,440
My own son, he thinks Bob's just

1768
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,680
a big face with dots.

1769
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,300
He believes in Santa Claus, but not Bob.

1770
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,960
Yet he comes up with some concise

1771
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,380
wisdom. It's funny, Bob

1772
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,240
always speaks most clearly

1773
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,220
through those who respect him least

1774
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:19,280
and mock him most.

1775
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,160
But, uh, he said,

1776
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,540
he said, Daddy, I got a new

1777
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,480
line. Don't take money, take Bob.

1778
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,020
The whole crowd started chanting it.

1779
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:29,540
And other, other cults might say it's better

1780
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:31,800
to give than to receive, but in Bob's

1781
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,100
philosophy, see, it's better

1782
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,740
to take than to receive.

1783
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,540
That's a subtle difference, but

1784
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,900
I was proud of my boy there.

1785
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,320
You oughta see how us original

1786
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,380
apostles treat Bob. The more we do

1787
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:45,580
for him, the more we have to

1788
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,460
abuse him and insult him, and otherwise

1789
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:49,120
we'd fall into the same trap

1790
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,380
that all other great world religions

1791
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,120
fall into. Now,

1792
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:55,180
a little earlier, somebody called and said,

1793
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:56,780
once again, we keep,

1794
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:59,380
every show it seems like, I get a call from somebody

1795
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:01,540
who says, why are you doing this?

1796
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:03,640
It's like, it's not that they don't

1797
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:05,540
get it, or at least

1798
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:07,400
they get it, sort of, but they don't really,

1799
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,900
they're not listening enough to realize.

1800
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,560
And they were upset, because

1801
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,600
they thought we were, you know, mocking Jesus.

1802
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:15,520
Friends, if

1803
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,360
you listen, if you

1804
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,340
really listen, and I don't mean,

1805
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,440
you know, skim the radio, but

1806
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,460
if you listen to what we're saying, we never

1807
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,260
mock Jesus,

1808
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:27,200
or even

1809
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,160
Buddha, or

1810
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,520
you know, any, any of

1811
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,580
the great teachers and bringers of

1812
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,500
slack. We sometimes even

1813
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:36,600
paraphrase them.

1814
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:39,660
But we do, we do

1815
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:41,420
mock those who we think

1816
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:42,820
have perverted

1817
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:45,560
the sweet names

1818
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,460
of these leaders, who, most

1819
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:49,500
of whom, in fact, almost all of whom,

1820
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,500
are not only Bob's drinking buddies,

1821
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:53,740
but they all said, more or less,

1822
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:55,700
that the mutants shall inherit the earth.

1823
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:57,640
They said that

1824
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:59,000
it was okay

1825
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:01,620
if something was different, if it

1826
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:02,920
wasn't just like you,

1827
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,700
you should treat it as if it was

1828
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:07,580
your, you know, like

1829
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,200
you would want it to treat you.

1830
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,000
And, uh,

1831
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:13,420
I don't know anybody here who tried to close

1832
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:15,220
down anybody else's radio stations.

1833
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,480
And yet, somehow, we're expected to

1834
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:18,560
turn the other cheek,

1835
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:21,440
you know, you're gonna get the other cheek

1836
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,480
slapped if it, you're turning it

1837
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:25,200
to somebody who claims

1838
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,540
to be, I don't know,

1839
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:28,480
I don't wanna, God,

1840
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:31,180
this makes me so mad, I'd get to,

1841
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:32,660
I'd get to cussing again.

1842
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,620
Uh, let me see what else I had

1843
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:36,740
here. It was,

1844
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:42,040
it was wonderful.

1845
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:43,900
It was a great parade,

1846
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:45,020
and I wanna see,

1847
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,320
you know, I think it ought to be a yearly event.

1848
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,180
Uh, if any of you all missed it,

1849
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:51,180
you know, watch it,

1850
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:52,520
come to it next time.

1851
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:55,480
Oh, oh,

1852
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:56,980
Ron finally made it!

1853
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:57,840
Ron Lindsey is here.

1854
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:59,480
We'll get out of here with just one last,

1855
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:01,660
uh, brief

1856
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,520
message, I think.

1857
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,360
Let me see, no,

1858
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:06,840
we can't,

1859
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:09,700
Conan's been running back there for a while.

1860
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:12,180
You let me know,

1861
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:13,040
Ron. Friends,

1862
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,080
thanks a lot

1863
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,380
for supporting the station,

1864
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:19,720
and thanks a lot for calling in your pledges

1865
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,600
to Ron Lindsey as in the

1866
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,440
hour, er, several hours

1867
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,640
coming up. I want you to,

1868
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:27,560
to do that now, you know, I want,

1869
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,580
I also want you to pledge the hour of slack,

1870
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:30,600
okay? You got me?

1871
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,980
Just right at the appointed time.

1872
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:35,840
Otherwise, dark forces

1873
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,920
of antiquity

1874
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:37,820
will be

1875
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:38,420
coming at you.

1876
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:38,980
So, I'm gonna

1877
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:39,880
get you back in time.

1878
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:47,800
And I will

1879
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:50,140
take you

1880
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:50,340
home.

1881
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:52,560
I'm gonna

1882
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,420
take you home.

1883
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:55,920
I'm gonna

1884
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,200
take you home.

1885
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:04,620
I'm gonna

1886
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:05,500
take you home.

1887
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,620
I'm gonna

1888
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:07,620


1889
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:12,240
take you home,

1890
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:20,880
baby.

1891
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:22,200
Get me home soon,

1892
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,240
but I ain't gonna

1893
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:23,240


1894
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:23,740
alone, bat.

1895
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,700
I'm just gonna

1896
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:35,200
stay here

1897
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,160
forever and dong

1898
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:36,480
you know?

1899
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,840
And all those legends about him really not being dead,

1900
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:39,780
those are not true.

1901
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:41,180
The girls know they can't get Bob.

1902
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:47,380
Because all these people are saying,

1903
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:49,480
but Bob isn't dead, he's going to come back.

1904
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:50,960
And I just want you to know,

1905
01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:55,840
we were time-scratching over the same exact moment of time

1906
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:56,720
over and over again,

1907
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:59,660
and both of us were convinced, firmly convinced,

1908
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:02,160
in the one bullet, one assassin theory,

1909
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:06,460
and that that moment was the real moment,

1910
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:07,540
and Bob was dead.

1911
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:09,560
Because we saw it over and over again.

1912
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:10,880
We saw him fall.

1913
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:14,120
We rewound the scratch, you know?

1914
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,520
We went back in the time disk a little bit,

1915
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,040
and then we ran over it again,

1916
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:18,980
and he fell down again,

1917
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:20,220
and then we run it back,

1918
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:21,280
and then he falls back up,

1919
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,600
but then you run it forward again,

1920
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:24,520
and he falls down every time.

1921
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,080
We tried everything we could

1922
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,100
to stop the moment from happening,

1923
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:31,000
but the security was so tight that night,

1924
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:31,460
we...

1925
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:31,720
We...

1926
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,540
None of our passes could get us behind the doors there,

1927
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:35,940
and it was just impossible.

1928
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:36,620
Nothing...

1929
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:38,860
Nothing we can do in the past or the future

1930
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:41,300
is going to alter the fact that Bob was shot that night.

1931
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:42,780
Bob is dead now,

1932
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:45,320
and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.

1933
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:47,160
Now, I've been dooming and glooming all over the place,

1934
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,300
depressing all my friends.

1935
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:49,480
They're all saying,

1936
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:51,620
Reverend Bleepo, there's something wrong with you.

1937
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:53,420
You're not your happy chipper self anymore.

1938
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,080
And I look at them, and I say,

1939
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:58,060
it was all going fine till that moment,

1940
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,440
to that irrational moment in time

1941
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:00,960
that just...

1942
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,820
just plain shouldn't have happened.

1943
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:03,920
Because...

1944
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:06,540
All the people that are there,

1945
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:08,440
that were there back there then,

1946
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:10,180
that are now in the future,

1947
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:11,120
that know what's happening,

1948
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:12,060
that have time control,

1949
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:14,220
none of them did anything to stop it.

1950
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:15,480
And I want to know,

1951
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:18,780
what has Reverend Stang got to do with this conspiracy?

1952
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:19,720
No, no, no, wait.

1953
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:20,160
Now, wait.

1954
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:20,600
You may say,

1955
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:22,240
Stang, oh, he couldn't do nothing.

1956
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:22,580
He's...

1957
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:24,880
He's in charge of this radio show.

1958
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:27,580
He's the one responsible for putting my words over there

1959
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:28,500
and all that over there.

1960
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:29,300
But, friends,

1961
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:30,640
that's completely impossible.

1962
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:31,900
You say, yeah, well,

1963
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,140
what about, like,

1964
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,900
Johnson and the JFK assassination?

1965
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,240
You ever ask yourself that?

1966
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:37,320
Sure, sure.

1967
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:37,640
You know,

1968
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:38,980
mourning for the world and all that.

1969
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:40,180
Now, let's be frank here, folks.

1970
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,980
Now, I'm not saying Lyndon Baines was a bad man,

1971
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:43,960
but Lyndon Baines was a powerful man.

1972
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:46,080
Lyndon Baines was a man who could withstand pain.

1973
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:48,720
Who's to know what kind of strange hypnosis

1974
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,800
he underwent with them...

1975
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,100
with them hypno-demons

1976
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:52,880
back when he visited that flying saucer

1977
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,700
on that Air Force base in 57 with Eisenhower.

1978
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,120
Yeah, he was the senator that was there that day.

1979
01:31:58,240 --> 01:31:59,920
He was supposedly standing there

1980
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:00,940
watching the whole damn thing.

1981
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:01,940
Well, if you ask me,

1982
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,880
those aliens just hypnotized him,

1983
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,720
took him both aboard the spaceship there

1984
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:07,440
and, of course,

1985
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:08,480
erased part of the mind

1986
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,320
and then put it back

1987
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,160
and then made them forget

1988
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:11,280
that they could ever remember it,

1989
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:12,240
which just, you know,

1990
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:14,260
makes the whole subconscious drive

1991
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:17,380
to do the insane thing even stronger.

1992
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:20,120
I love those aliens.

1993
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:21,260
You gotta love those aliens.

1994
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:23,160
Anyway, I mean,

1995
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,440
you gotta admire them, let's say.

1996
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,080
Maybe you can't exactly embrace them

1997
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,040
with what we call love.

1998
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:28,700
You know, sort of...

1999
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:30,260
I can't go into that right now.

2000
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:30,620
But anyway,

2001
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,200
so, at any rate,

2002
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:34,560
so what I'm just saying there is,

2003
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:35,880
you know, it's entirely possible.

2004
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:36,400
Now, please,

2005
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:38,360
I don't want any lawsuits or nothing.

2006
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,080
This is just a theory.

2007
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:39,820
I'm purporting.

2008
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,340
I'm not saying this is true.

2009
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,380
But, you know, it's just possible

2010
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:46,280
Lyndon Baines and, you know,

2011
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:47,580
his friends there,

2012
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:48,380
they, you know,

2013
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:50,720
what if he was easier to fool?

2014
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:52,180
Hell, Lyndon Baines Johnson

2015
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:52,920
was the only president

2016
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,240
that ever gave Bob a hard time.

2017
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:55,520
We were watching this.

2018
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:57,500
If you look over at magazine advertisements

2019
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:00,360
between the 1950s and the 1970s,

2020
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:00,940
you take a look at the time.

2021
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:00,940


2022
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:00,940


2023
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:00,940


2024
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:00,940


2025
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:01,400
You know, the advertisements

2026
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,180
from, you know,

2027
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:04,580
63 through 68

2028
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:06,600
when Johnson was still president there.

2029
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:08,980
You look at the pictures of Bob

2030
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:10,740
and he has stress on his face.

2031
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,580
That's because Johnson

2032
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:13,720
was the only president

2033
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:14,940
that gave Bob a hard time.

2034
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:16,760
He got right along with Eisenhower.

2035
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:18,660
He got right along with Kennedy.

2036
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:20,460
He got right along with Nixon.

2037
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21,460
All the way on up.

2038
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:22,780
Well, we can't talk about that.

2039
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,420
But, anyway, he's still there.

2040
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:25,780
Yep.

2041
01:33:25,820 --> 01:33:26,900
But, you know,

2042
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:27,600
what I'm saying is

2043
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,360
Johnson was the one man

2044
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:30,520
who would not let himself

2045
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:32,000
be hypnotized by Bob.

2046
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:33,880
Or at least knowingly.

2047
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,560
Knowingly.

2048
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:37,520
So, I'm just saying

2049
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:38,360
it's entirely possible

2050
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:40,020
this could all be a...

2051
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:41,320
This could be...

2052
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,740
Well, I have to say that

2053
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:43,900
for legal FCC reasons.

2054
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:45,360
This could be all part

2055
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:46,420
of the same damn thing.

2056
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:50,140
Anyway, I just wanted to express this

2057
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:51,100
at this time.

2058
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:53,420
So, I want all of you out there,

2059
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,100
you know, who feel any ambiguity

2060
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:56,740
towards Reverend Stang

2061
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:58,400
to make up your minds.

2062
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,720
Is he guilty or innocent?

2063
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:01,680
And even if he isn't

2064
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:02,480
either of the above,

2065
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:04,700
who is he anyway?

2066
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:06,740
I'm getting scared.

2067
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:07,700
I better get out of here.

2068
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:09,040
He's gonna do something strange.

2069
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:09,860
I can tell.

2070
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:12,220
No, Reverend Stang,

2071
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:14,740
don't put that tape eraser down.
