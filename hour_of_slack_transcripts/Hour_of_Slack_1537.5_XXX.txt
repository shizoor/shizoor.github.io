Impressive evidence.
You sex robot.
Freeze, douchebags!
Goddamn hotline!
This place is surrounded. Art's got my back.
Don't move, assholes!
Matt's guarding the back door.
Yo!
And Bob's covering the harbor.
This is so stupid.
Asshole destroyed all of Zebulon!
What does such a terrible thing?
Yes, well, it's actually a funny story about that.
The subgenius power of...
Son. Oh, son.
I was wrong about you.
There are so many definitions of a hero.
But for me, someone who lifts you up
and gives you hope when some dickhead throws your planet into the sun.
It's J.R. Bob!
Bob Dobbs, the living slack master
in his church of the subgenius.
Rachel does not come from the same clinch as Fid Chuli,
so if you can actually give her a round of applause
instead of boos,
everybody welcome Rachel Weird again.
Thank you, thank you.
It may be familiar,
and I apologize if I give you an earworm.
Okay?
Okay.
Do you want to go to X Day?
Thirty-five is what you pay.
The pinks will say I am a slob.
I quit my job.
I'm slacking off all day.
I used to be downtrodden,
but now I'm not.
And Bob is the reason why.
Do you want to go to X Day?
We can watch the world burn away.
The pinks must die.
Do you want to go to X Day?
It'll be a lot of fun.
The X's will come down for you.
All you have to do is give your cash to Bob.
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
You can get real chummy
with your Yeti clan.
Counting down to the 5th of July.
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.
Bob?
Bob?





You fuck, I know you're out there.
I see you screwed us yet again.
You promised us all saucers, but they're overdue.
We will come for you and kill you in the end.
We gather every summer.
We wake at 7 a.m.
When will all our dreams come true?
Do you want to go to X Day?
Come on, let's go to X Day.
Okay, bye.
The world's gonna end.
Right, exactly.
What the fuck?
Right, exactly.
What the fucking fuck?
So you guys can hang out.
Actually, I expect, you know, if you notice, fuckery is always on the schedule.
And, in fact, I'm looking at the time, and it's about that time.
And that time on my watch says it's time for fuckery.
So feel free to stick around for the fuckery.
And I expect we'll have some interesting fuckery participants.
Fuckery, dude.
Oh, fuckery.
My home, my world.
A fuckery day.
Lenny, a fucker, and him my way.
Fuckery, dude.
Oh, fuckery day.
Mr. Fucker on my shoulder.
That was very tweet, yes.
Very tweet.
That was a little too sweet, personally.
So I think we need a little anger.
I'm pretty good at anger.
And this is one of those that poor Stang will only be able to put on the triple X hours of slack.
Fuck advertising.
Fuck advertising.
The fact that some algorithm sees fit to remind me on a regular basis that I'm a childish old divorcee without a degree is rather annoying.
On the same fucking page, on the same fucking page,
dating for middle-aged women,
sperm banks,
to make money, you have to have your bachelor's.
Seriously, fuck that shit.
I mean hell.
God damn, hello ma'am, you're fat, unattractive, childless, a stupid failure of a woman that no one will ever want
unless you quickly settle for some second-rate shit that we're peddling and sell your soul to the fucking conspiracy.
That, my friends, is some serious fucking bullshit.
I am damn good on my own at making myself feel like shit, and I sure as fuck don't.


I don't need the age conspiracy to guilt the greed machine into doing it for me.
This thing, though, the real reason that I'm offended by this shit is I am damn fucking good at marketing.
I understand it.
Because, folks, it is 80% psychobabble and 20% luck.
And the reason shit like this pisses me off is I know exactly what went through those ad teams' head.
The conspiracy marketing blorps seeking out buttons.
But, motherfuckers, but, my brothers and sisters,
they play the game.
They planted the buttons there.
They put them there, their fucking selves.
And you would think if the conspiracy made the buttons, it would be easier for them to nail them.
Yet, they suck at it.
Next time!
This fucking marketing dipshit I know doesn't even know that, understand the basic way to press the buttons that their kind created themselves.
Because this shit isn't just Pepsi Cola, folks, or Fairfax County Sperm Bank.
It's not Big Oil. It's not Wall Street.
Civilization itself.
It depends on the marketing machine.
And one of the best marketing machines in history was Christianity.
Man, that was fucking brilliant.
So let's steal the ideas from popular pagan thought.
Make the pagan deities of Western Europe seem to be the exact most evil, cruel beings in your mythos.
Force-feed hopes.
Teach people that they are compliant and play by the rules.
They'll win the grand prize of heaven.
It's fucking brilliant.
It's sinister. It's evil.
But it's fucking brilliant.
But maybe you never bought the sales pitch.
Maybe you're a mutant.
I never bought it either.
But you know why?
Couldn't get the product.
I don't understand what it did.
I mean, I just don't get it.
See, there's very little difference between folks waiting in line for the newest I suck and the prayer vigil.
So tell me what it is.
Because here's the thing.
I fucking at least got a face that I know is J.R. Bob Dobbs.
What the fuck does God even look like anyway?
Or Jesus for that matter.
I know what Bob fucking looks like.
I know what Bob fucking tastes like if I want to.
Hello!
Hello!
So, in closing I'm going to do another call and response.
So, let's do this one.
Fuck the conspiracy.
Fuck the conspiracy!

Fuck the conspiracy!
Alright, I want a little more effort in that, y'all.
I came up here and started screaming into a microphone to the point I'm redlining the levels over there for suds.
Let's try this again.
Fuck the conspiracy!
Fuck the conspiracy!
Thank you.
Fuck the conspiracy!
Thank you very much.
Now, if someone else would like to come up here, you're welcome to do so.
We have a special guest singer.
Oh, yeah.
Now, if you can't see up here, this is the absolutely awesome,
incredible Queen Mum.
Yeah.
And if you had any doubt in your head that she was awesome, well, you're an idiot.
And so, they're going to go ahead and perform for us.
It's the Queen Mum and the lovely Princess Wee, who are going to do something special just for you.
Starting with...
There was a little bird.
Okay.
There was a little bird.
No bigger than you.
No bigger than a turd sitting on a telephone pole.
He stretched out his neck.
Then he shit about a peck as he puckered up his little asshole.
Asshole.
Asshole.
As he puckered up his little asshole.
I don't know what I was expecting.
No need to backtrack.









I don't believe it.
Yes.
Brothers and sisters,
the hour of Bob is upon you.
Bob is all upon you.
Bob is the crusty sweat
on the back of your armpits.
Bob is the three-month-long
festering fungus under your little pinky toe.
Bob is the itch on your balls
that won't go away
no matter how much you spray and spray and spray.
Hide your cornicell and won't leave him alone.
Bob is all upon you.
Bob is in places you didn't know you had.
Bob is up in you and make you feel sad,
but sometimes glad
because you know he's with you
no matter where you are stuck.
At your shitty slave conspiracy job
driving a fucking truck,
Bob is there.
He's stuck up your ass
like a fucking crushed red pepper seed
that wouldn't come out.
That's where Bob is up upon you.
Bob is all up in you.
He's that one fucking hair up your nose
that no matter how much you try to dig for it,
fucking bumblefuck around,
you can't get it out of there.
That's where Bob is.
All up in you.
The power of Bob is up in you.
When you walk into a fucking convenience store
or pass the fucking security checker at Walmart
because everybody knows we want to go steal toilet paper.
You know, nothing better to do.
Can't afford a 98 cent roll,
so you better check my receipt.
Bob is with you.
Don't let those conspiracy pinks knock you down.
Don't conform.
Am I being detained?
Do you want to speak to my lawyer?
Well, Bob off, alright?
You don't need to see my fucking receipt,
you 98-year-old Walmart greeter.
Get with Bob.
You don't need a job.
All you have to do is commit.
$35.
That's all he asks of you.
After that,
the fringe will suck you dry.
But the up front is legit.
It's read the fine print on all your shit.
Because Bob is up upon you.
He's inside.
Bob's the one that made you drink and drive.
Blame Bob.
Fuck,
I forgot.
I forgot.
I forgot about your old lady sweet and fly baby.
You forgot it was Valentine's Day.
Blame Bob.
Bob's there for you.
Bob is your scapegoat.
He's your wingman.
He's your detonated driver.
Bob is all upon you.
The power of Bob is here.
Can you smell it?
Smell it.
Come here.
I can smell it.
I can fucking smell it over here.
The power of Bob is fear.
The fear that the pinks will win.
And you won't come back next year.
You'll have a fucking excuse.
Oh, my car broke down.
Oh, my dog is in heat.
Oh, my baby daddy,
uh, you know, likes video games too much.
I can't, I can't go.
Don't let the conspiracy win.
Keep Bob with you right on your chin.
Like a warm ball sack.
Always there.
Bob is the one that's in your hair.
Like a fucking tip.
Crawling around.
Bob's the guy making that sound.
Bob's making my fucking ears bleed.
Bob's making me never want to breathe.
Bob's making me have sex with myself.
Bob's the one.
Bob's the one.
Bob's the one.
Bob's the one.
Bob's the one.

P
P
Bob's the one.
I'm the one.
Let me tell you that.
Bob is the one.
Bob is the one.
You might ask me.
Bob's the one.
Let me tell you about it.
Bob's the one for all the fun.
You see?
Bob's the one who's out with me.
Bob's the wingman.
He is your friend.
Bob will be there with you in the end.
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Drop it down!
Drop it down!
Drop it down!

Good job!
D...
D-O-P-P-S
D-O-P-P-S
D-O-P-P-S
D-O-P-P-S
Who is it D-O-P-P-S you might ask?
He's the one that causes women to undress, that's why.
He's always with you.
Keep up alive.
Not that you guys clapped, but can I get a round of applause for Gravity over here?
Actually, DJ Gravity, you are the bellybutton fuzz of J.R. Bob Dobbs, just so you know.
Some of you are the pimple on Bob's ass.
Some of you are that bit of spinach stuck in Bob's teeth.
You are, you are my friends. Some of you are the ever-flowing pre-cone from Bob's dick.
But every one of you is important.
For if it was not for the pre-cone,
for the ever-flowing pre-cone of Bob's dick,
the universe may not exist.
If it wasn't for the bellybutton lint of Bob Dobbs,
the clouds may not form.
If it wasn't for that pinky nail of Bob Dobbs, how would he have signed that contract?
If it wasn't for those fingernails, how would he have been able to scratch the backs of those exes
in the middle of trying to gain, to gain that contract,
to save your life?
To save your souls.
To make sure that when the world ends, brothers and sisters,
when that world ends, that you, you, every one of you will be saved and this planet will be burned.
So remember, even the asshole of J.R. Bob Dobbs is important.
Every little bit of him is important.
And you need to give, brothers and sisters, give out of your soul.
Make sure that every inch of Bob,
make sure that even the eyebrow hairs of Bob,
make sure that all of them, all of them are truly fulfilled and truly have that energy to continue on every day.
Now, brothers and sisters, I can see that you are listening and I'm glad to hear it,
so let's see if we can get you to participate a little bit.
So, one of the things we need,
one of the things we need, brothers and sisters,
we need some energy, we need that slack energy.
We need to feel it. We need to feel it in everywhere.
I need to feel it in my bones.
You need to feel it in your bones.
You need to be able to feel that slack in your penis.
You need to be able to feel that slack in your big toe.
I want to be able to hear Connie squirting from the slack that you guys have given off.
So, brothers and sisters,
can I get a praise, Bob?
Praise Bob!
Brothers and sisters, that is on the right track
and we are doing really good and I'm really proud of you.
You are giving out your slack and I appreciate it.
But let's give it one more try, alright?
Alright? Can I hear a praise, Bob?
Praise Bob!
Hallelujah.
I'm feeling the slack flowing
and I can feel the energies moving upon this stage
and here shortly, once we get everybody down,
we're going to get together.
We're going to blow your minds with slack tunes,
true doctor music, the multi-fisted tales of Connie.
You are still, once again, welcome to come up here
and rant and share your slack with us,
brothers and sisters.
You may have something on your chest.
You may have something on your ass.
I don't care.
You can come up here and you can share with your brethren.
If you have something to say, head on up here now
and share with us,
share with us the feeling in your heart
and what you feel.
What you need to tell us about Bob Dobbs,
your personal savior.
Raspi,
oh,
Raspi,
if the hair
on your head
is a bright,
curly red,
then what color
would you like


to put the hair
on your
Raspi?
Raspi,
if the hair
on your hair
is a bright, curly red,
then what color would you like

on your Raspi?
Raspi,

on your Raspi
That's pretty good for 80 fucking 7.
Everybody give her a round of applause.
80 fucking 7.
I feel sorry for whoever is following that.
So basically this is Andrew the Impaled.
He's the world's biggest subgenius asshole.
He's a motherfucker.
He's a real dickhead.
And you guys are unfortunate enough to suffer through his shit.
So without further ado, yada, yada, yada, let's welcome Andrew the Impaled.
He's going to play music.
Thank you, Pisces, for that glowing.
And thank you, Andrew.
That was a wholly accurate portrayal of yours truly.
All right.
So if there was a song that you wanted to hear tonight that you've heard me play before, well, I'm sorry.
I'm probably not going to play it.
Yeah.
Because you've got to deal with this.
And see, that would be enjoyable.
And that's not what this is about.
This is about you suffering.
I come out here every fucking year, just about nowadays.
And I'm not going to play this.
And I suffer a lot.
And I know you appreciate it.
But I don't think you really understand exactly what that entails.
So you're going to suffer now.
.
They say reconcile with the wife.
I say fuck it.
They say fix the holes in your life.
I say fuck it.
.
Might seem I'm leaving in a rush.
But a man can only take so much.
So I grabbed just some of my stuff.
And I said fuck it.
.
I said fuck it.
.
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
.
I said fuck it.
.
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
.
And if you don't agree, my friend, don't make no difference in the end.
Because in the end, all I have to say is fuck it.
.
They say get to work on time.
I say fuck it.
.
They say write a clever rhyme.
I say fuck it.
.
Because here's one thing that I've observed around some words.
Don't take it too seriously.



It's not much nerve.
And it might sound quite absurd.
But I say fuck it.
.
I say fuck it.
.
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
.
I say fuck it.
.
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
.
And I don't care if I lose my job.
I don't care if I become a slob.
My conscience has been robbed.
And I say fuck it.
.
Oh, now we're going to fuck it in this key.
.
They say you got to pay your bills.
I say fuck it.
.
They say you can't be drinking swill.
I say fuck it.
.
Because if I could afford better than swill, I'd probably be able to pay my bills.
But then again, I might just say fuck it.
.
I say fuck it.
.
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
.
I say fuck it.
.
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
.
And if you got a better way, go tell me on some other day.
Because on this day, all I have to say is fuck it.
.
They say love your enemies.
.
I say fuck that.
.
.
They say try to keep the peace.

.
I say fuck that.
.
Too hard.
.
Because I got to tell you girls and boys, this angry man's going to make some noise.
.
And it truly is a joy to say fuck it.
.
Now let's go back.
.
They say watch what you eat.
.
I say fuck it.
.
Put the lid down.














Put the lid down on the seat.
.
I say fuck it.
.
Because I'm going to live just how I do.
.
I don't need no advice from you.
.
Because when I hear advice, I say fuck it.
.
I say fuck it.
.
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
.
I say fuck it.
.
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
.
And if you think my song is crude or you're put off by my attitude, there's one thing
you can do and that is suck it.
.

They say compose an end to this song.
.
I say fuck it.
.
.

Fuck it.
.

Fuck it.
.
Hey father, could you unhook the phone that's plugged in over there behind you.
Not behind you, behind you.
The other behind.
Towards the wall, towards the wall, there's a phone there plugged in over there.
Could you grab that?
Alright, uh.
I should probably give a little bit of background information on that last song in case some
of you are wondering.
.
.
Ah-hah.

I'll probably do it, but I'll do it all over.

All right, thank you, I'll do it.
.
She said she'd always love me
As long as life goes on
She said she'd keep hold of me
Turns out she was wrong
She called me her one and only
In my ear she'd softly sigh
That I'd never again be lonely
That was just a lie
I guess I've been had
I guess I've been had
And if it wasn't for the cash I spent
Fixing up her car, well
I wouldn't feel so bad
I never saw it coming
Didn't realize we were near the end
And that I would soon be slumming
Even though I just paid the rent
Yeah, I thought I made all the right moves
And that things between us were cool
Yeah, I thought I might get some good news
Instead, I got schooled
I guess I've been had
I guess I've been had
And if it wasn't for the time I wasted
Cleaning her garage, well
I wouldn't feel so bad
That ain't no euphemism either
We never did fight
We always got along
We'd rock and roll
All night
Oh yeah, our lovin' was strong
We made a good team
At least that's so I thought
But then in key sense of perception
It's something I ain't got
Right?
That's fucked up
That shit's called thrash
That should suck

Turns out that was something, and that something was the end.
I guess I've been had.
I guess I've been had.
And if it wasn't for the fact he was my roommate back in school, well, I wouldn't feel so bad.
I guess I've been had.
I guess I've been had.
And if it wasn't for the fact I could have been with Cheryl Moore,
if it wasn't for the fact I just installed a brand new floor,
if it wasn't for the fact she stood there grinning at the door, well, I wouldn't feel so,
I wouldn't feel so,
I wouldn't feel so bad.
I wouldn't feel so bad.
I wouldn't feel so bad.
It's a great deal that Bob provides us that the minute you pay your registration fee,
which, by the way, registration opens at noon and is open until about 4 o'clock.
The minute you pay your registration fee, you get free unlimited fuckery.
It is a free add-on.
It's like free coffee in my cup, right?
Yes, it's like free refills, except it's free refills of fuckery, ladies and gentlemen.
This is a really important deal.
I hope you learn to take advantage of it.
And I see another question from the class.
Yes, I forgot to poop during the allotted time frame.
Will I get a chance to do so later?
Good question.
If you did not poop on the scheduled poop time, that's going to be a little difficult.
You were supposed to poop in that time frame.
Now, here's the thing is that you can ask for a hall pass,
and if your particular instructor at the time in that particular class is willing,
you can get a hall pass.
And you can poop.
Also, if you are in a particular part of your camp,
you will have to request if you can poop at that time.
The camp or party you're at will take a vote and decide if you're allowed to poop.
So that's how you handle if you did not poop in the allotted time.
Now, there is an exception.
We do allow for fropping and drinking at any point in time
because those are pretty much essential for survival the next day,
just so you know.
But food and poop are sort of on a limited schedule.
So if you're not allowed to poop at that time,
you can ask your camp mates or party mates if you are allowed to go poop at that time.
I will admit there are some camps that have a really lenient open pooping rule.
Make sure you ask before you poop and make sure that that does apply to that camp.
Pooping is for the weak!
My poop is strong!
Well, I can't stop myself.
But he is a member of the lady of, what is it, perpetual constipation,
which explains a lot about Finchuli.
I'm sorry.
Saturday the fourth, which is the last day before the end of the world,
we will have the live hour of slack, as expected.
At 3 p.m. we will baptize you.
If you have not been baptized, do you understand there is a slight risk in the baptism procedure?
It does remove all of your sins, so you have a clean slate to sin with.
However, for some people, the sudden removal of that much sin can cause a slight bit of discomfort.
So...
Be prepared for that.
So, I have done my job there to remind you guys of everything that's going on.
Don't ask me, because you should have picked up your fucking schedule.
That's why we played them.
And I was a lucky charm correctly.
The stereotype of stowing şam кл scissors off lye is wrong.

He stashed the second bottle of a hem lively sound.

Back when Bob was in the band and Ronald Reagan,
the band was called the Shitty Beatles.
And, uh,
real-
movie fans
among you
may remember in the movie
Wayne's World,
they're going into a club
and these guys in
brown smeared
insect suits
are leaving the club.
And, uh,
Wayne says, uh,
Uh, is that-
that's the Shitty Beatles?
How were they?
Because they were terrible.
So, it's not just a clever name.
So, even though
we're pretty bad,
the fake name of this band got mentioned
in Wayne's World.
And they have actors playing the Shitty Beatles.
I think I heard somewhere that there is a real band
called- called the Shitty Beatles now.
They've ripped us off.
But, we're used to that.
There's always some new
fake, uh, subgenius rip-off coming out.
Church of Dawn.
Flying Spaghetti Monster.
Christianity.
They ripped us off.
Zoroastrian.
The Rosicrucians.
They stole all that stuff from us.
I just forgot my next line.
I better go look at the script.
Flip the anus of a moon in hell
Flip the anus of a moon in hell
Split a Scientologist wide open today
Split all foolish demon possessed
Christians today
What about that other one?
That one song again with that one guy?
Split the anus of a moon in hell
Split the anus of a moon in hell
Split the anus of a moon in hell
Split the anus of a moon in hell
Split a Scientologist wide open today
Split all foolish demon possessed Christians today
See we still got it, Dr. Jones.
We got it. We still got it.
I remembered that one.
You know, even though I haven't sold it,
it's something.
It's already one of my years.
Yeah.
I can't admit those high notes like I used to.
This must be how the devos feel.
They have to play the songs just as fast as they used to, but they can only move half as fast.
Okay, Princess We is here.
We already did the first Princess We song.
Okay, that one's in the can.
Okay, we did My Place is on Fire.
You're going into the Word of God.
You're sinking in.
It's like quicksand.
It's pulling you deeper and deeper down, down, down, down, into the Word of God.
Hey, you know, I think we've already done the first side of the first Lotan album.
Oh, there's one called I Can't Believe It.
I hate those assholes. I don't remember that one.
I love those assholes.
Some people do love assholes.
I'd like to know, is there anybody here tonight that really loves an asshole?
I mean, an asshole, but first.
I mean, maybe a particular asshole you haven't affected before.
I'm not talking about that kind of situation.
I'm an asshole.
More or less.
I'm an asshole.

I'm an asshole.
What an asshole.
Love me.
Love me.
Love me.
Love me.
Love the assholes.
Love the assholes.
Would you love the assholes?
You know, that's really unique.
A lot of us have forgotten.
Can't you love an asshole?
We've forgotten about the rest of minorities, and people forget about the poor asshole.
Hey, tomorrow's the pancake breakfast, and we're bringing scrapple in that's made of assholes.
I love assholes.
Do we have that?
No, seriously.
I did bring scrapple, and we have to eat some asshole in before we eat.
I feel like you're not a hittler, that's good.
What is that thing doing?
You have babies with that thing?
Yeah.
That's the mother of my children.
Or one of them, anyway.
That's the mother of my butt baby.
Oh!
Old butt baby.
One time, my toilet broke, and I told my son, I said, Sandy, you're going to have to



go to the bathroom and be careful, because some of your little brown brothers are still
in there.
He got so mad at me.
Oh, man.
I hate that.
Yeah, your little brown brothers.
That's what I don't call them.
Little brown brother, how I love thee.
That's the problem, they're still born.
Yeah, it's sad.
It's not funny.
That's not funny.
It's really sad.
Yeah.
As if it wasn't clear enough from context, all of this Hour of Slack episode was recorded
live at the New York Times.



The 18X Day Drill last July.
That last mess we just heard was Doctors for Wotan, with myself and Dr. Philo Drummond reunited
from our old 1980s band, only this time with new wives, which makes a lot of difference.
That was Reverend Chaosmic Bobcat you heard singing, and earlier in the show with her
tune Fuckery Doo-Dah.
I think the acts were...
I don't know if you were introduced or explained, but I should mention that most of the rockin'
type music you heard was the Fuck Peas Band, also known as Six-Fisted Tales of Connie,
with Reverend Angry Larry on the most prominent guitar and also singing, as it were, on Do
the Hairball.
We also heard Priestess Pisces do quite a bit of singing and ranting, all of it basically
off the top of her head, incidentally.
Priestess Pisces basically produces songs.
She's a great singer, and she's been a great songwriter since the late 18X Day, and organizes
everything that can be organized, emcees the shows on stage, and rants and sings her subgenius
Foo head off.
Other musicians in the Fuck Peas Band include Bishop Stick, Reverend Rock God, Reverend
Hazel of the Windmills, Reverend Fid Chooly, Trademark Gee from Evolution Control Committee,
Reverend Sinfaltimus X.
Mortis, Reverend Chovvur, Reverend Aidy, Lord Ferg, Reverend R.T.



Sud Spishaw, Dr. Philo Drummond,
and DJ Gravity, and probably a couple of other people
I'm leaving out. We'll end with
Pisces and Baby Bear doing the audience hate song,
but first, Reverend Sinfaltmus
Ex Mortis will deliver his
lilting rendition of his song
Kill the Pinks.
And I must emphasize this, kids,
it's meant strictly as a metaphorical
mood piece, and not
instructions. Price bomb.

Run, baby, run!

favorite, Kill the Pinks.

You can all go fuck yourselves.
Next up, Andrew the Impaler!
There it is! It's started!
The bombs are falling!
That was the sound of the Panzerschrausers entering the atmosphere.
It's a sonic wheeze kind of noise that they make when they enter.
It's spelunking.
They spelunk into the atmosphere,
buoying us into their craft.
That's why we need all the blow-up dolls.
What's going on, Pisces?
Fuck the audience.
Well, yeah, but I mean, aside from that.
I was like, Baby Bear was looking at me.
Come up here, Baby Bear!
That was pretty awesome.
She screamed in the mic.
I didn't know she... I couldn't hear her. I could hear you.
That's all right.
Maybe it was her, not you.
No, she was the one screaming.
You had your backs to the audience. I couldn't tell what...
Yeah, well, you couldn't tell who we were.
Oh, that was the screech. I was wondering how you could be so screechy.
No, that was not me.
Oh, that was her.
That was Baby Bear.
I couldn't see you, because you were fucking me.
Yes.
In the audience.
How did you fuck me in the audience, Pisces?
Because I'm magic.
Oh, that's right. I read that on the internet.
Fuck these!
