Like to drop by the Pintest Effect? Well, welcome to the Hour of Slack!
Praise Bob, Gold, and Connie's Rack! Yes, welcome to the Hour of Slack!
La la la, la la la, la la la, Hour of Slack!
Uh, yes dear friends, welcome to Hour of Slack, the second of our triple X-prited Hours of Slack.
Uh, it's something I've been meaning to do for a long time, to take advantage of the internet,
and well, now that the conspiracy is working double time to shut down this sort of thing on the internet,
we're going to try to pump out as much of it as we can.
And in these last few days, these final days, yes friends, as you can well imagine,
the Church of the Subgenius has a gigantic collection here at the Subgenius Foundation
of rude recorded material, everything from prank calls to evil comedy to naughty songs
and bawdy material of all sorts, that would be, really, is too much trouble
to get the fucks out of for regular broadcast on the Hour of Slack.
But since this one is just for the internet, it can all just be a bunch of fucks, shits, and poo-poos!
And uh, and so, with that, praise fucking goddamn Bob!
Huuuh!
Don't tell Bob.
I won't tell Bob.
Fuck that guy.
Come and listen to a story about a man named Jed, a poor mountaineer, barely kept his family from
der 결국 hijacked.
tell me what his story is.
becoming a stick on a tree.
The legs were too short, cutting

uh for him.
So his fault?
Probably it is.
All right, now everybody just act cool.
I don't think so.

Goddamn Bob.
No.
I just want to Bob Ratby's Bob.

I love words.
I thank you for hearing my words.
I want to tell you something about words that I think is important.
I love that I say they're my work, they're my play, they're my passion.
Words are all we have, really.
You know the seven, don't you, that you can't say on television?
Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksuck.
Motherfucker and tits, huh?
Those are the heavy seven.
Those are the ones that'll infect your soul.
Bob said, fuck them!
They got to be a bad man's show!
Whoa, I see we've got some people here who've been reading their prescriptures.

I'm going to put my dick in a mashed potato.
Fucking creationists.

The year is 2002.
The Church of Scientology attempts to censor free speech, music, and humor.
And you know what Bob Dobbs says?
Fuck them if they can't take a joke, and you can't take a joke, so fuck you.
Fuck them if they can't take a joke, and you can't take a joke, so fuck you.
Scientology is trying to make me silent by telling other people that I'm violent.
They say that I'm a terrorist, I'm really just a satirist.
Delirious is enjoying this particular mess.
I was never a member, I don't hold a glowing ember from a time when they burned me or turned me to a puppet or stole all of my nuggets.
I know ran off of my money, but I think it's kind of crummy how they do it to folks.
I enjoy making jokes about the stupidly serious, the freezing and delirious, when someone points a finger.

My blowjobs are so good that the Pope declared them
a mortal sin.
This one's really gross, I'm fond of it.
My blowjobs are so good that I regularly eat it
in my stomach pump.
Thank you.
My blowjobs are so good that my longest blowjob
involved time travel.
Here's another one along the same lines.
My blowjobs are so good that my most gravitational pull
is in danger of creating a black hole.
I get Stephen Hawking nightmares.
My blowjobs are so good that if I ever became a lesbian,
the suicide rate would triple overnight.
My blowjobs are so good that last time I hit a popsicle
in public, I was in a pub.
I got charged with violating public abstentions laws.
My tongue can fold in ways that only
MC Escher could understand.
Alright, I think you've heard about enough
bad blowjobs for anything.
Alright, I've got one more.
I didn't write it, but I've got one more.
Alright.
In this Catholic parish, they had 일단
priest was out for the day. So visiting deepened Punxsutawney to hear a confession. A girl
confesses that she just gave someone a blowjob. There's a sheet on the wall of the confessional
so the priest can refer to it to give penances for standard sins. But he can't find blowjobs
on there. So he goes out and asks an altar boy, what does a pastor usually give for blowjobs?
The altar boy says, oh, about five bucks. All right, that's enough.
I'd rather maybe get out the gym. Please order some shim so I can keep my job.

Tunky the talking bear. They installed all this machinery up in his head, in his throat

Tonky's all mad, god damn, he's mad as hell, he's got a dick, and he's gonna put it up on your butt.
But hell, that bear got a dick, and he's gonna use it.
Watch out for Tonky's dick, Tonky's gonna make you come like the San Francisco earthquake.
Tonky!
Tonky!
The paradigm operating here is...
...a function of masculinity, that is to say, according to this text,
a justified and legible reaction to bodily and social oppression and phallic aggression resulting in rape.
While this linkage of bondage and rape is a trope in Western literature, going back to the Bible,
with notable examples occurring in both the Gothic genre, such as the Frankenstein legend,
and in American modernism, such as the short story of the living way of authoring, Francis Kukowski,
it finds what is perhaps its most virulent expression here.
In this text,
the impression of Tonky at the hands of a nameless group of what are presumably scientists is mechanical in nature.
They vibrate his penis,
install machines of control in most of his sensory organs,
and generally blunt his ability to reason or sense for himself.
The response is to rape, that is to say, to reassert through violence,
a masculinity erupted by the social order which is seen as intrusive and destructive.
Oddly, it is not made clear whether Tonky was a talking bear before this intervention,
or whether Tonky's entry into language is part of suppression.
In which case, an argument could be made that Tonky has been forced to bypass the mirror stage,
resulting in some sort of arrested emotional development,
perhaps stranding Tonky in the twilight world between the symbolic world and the imaginary world.
In any case, Tonky's revenge against the scientists is without a doubt sexual in nature.
He is going to use his penis against them for their transgressions against the unquestioned, or natural, one-word order.
And there can be no doubt that to be anally penetrated by Tonky as a talking bear is a severe punishment indeed.

It's a best-of compilation of this great band featuring many subgeniuses, including Pope Sternodocs.
And you can get the new Reagan's Polyp album.

I think Philo was there, too.
Anyway.
That being the case, why is there this witch hunt?
I don't understand it.
They should leave the man alone.
So is this also a product of your efforts here?
Chelsea Clinton.
Is she?
I know you were sweeping gills.
You visit the bathroom floors from McDonald's for years and years.
Personally, I think that Chelsea Clinton has got to be a product of your gist trade.
Is this true?
Well, let's face it.
Chelsea Clinton didn't come from just one gene pool.
I mean, it's fairly obvious that there's a few things going on there.
I mean, that's not just a normal person.
That's the cream, if you'll pardon the phrase, of the crop, quite frankly.
That's about 14 different...
It's awesome.
12 different science�� tranRepresentations.
Are you planning to curry track it to being just one unit of American culture?
However, I'm afraid that the closer themal experience has come,
the bigger the gap there is with the media now for such a much wider إلى inoculation
of my knowledge and opinion rather than necessarily the people who have told it.



That's a good starting Waldo.

BuS between...
Can I follow?
Sure.
It's the problem with Ben자�amedza.

Oliver North. Can you tell us
now that since Bush
is in the office, can you tell us about Bush
and his connection with the jizz trade?
You've all been quite misdirected about Bush
quite frankly. You may not be
aware of the Bilderberg jizz group
but they are in control
of most things in Europe and the Bilderberg jizz
group, frankly, they don't see
jizz being used
incorrectly.
It's a valuable commodity
and so I think deep down
they wanted somebody who
could hold the reins of power as a figurehead
that you could look at
and you could really think, I think he's suppressing
jizz. And I think
if all of us look at George W. Bush, one of the
first things that enters our mind is, I reckon that man
is suppressing jizz. Well they're suppressing
jizz for a reason. If you make a
commodity more scarce, it's
going to rise in value. I think
they have a corner
of the market on the jizz trade and
they are trying to
make jizz more scarce to raise the price
of it. It's price control
fixing, I think.
Well it is price control. I think there are nations around
this world crying out, we want jizz.
And they want it cheap, they want it affordable, they want
jizz that they can grab.
They want to be able to go out tomorrow
and get jizz. And they can't
necessarily do that now. And quite frankly
I think that it's something that we should be working towards.
The free distribution of
quality jizz. Well see
that's one of the biggest problems
in the world. There are only a few countries,
in the world, that produce quality jizz.
And they're actually
at the most
recent NATO poll,
there were seven countries in the world who actually
produce good jizz. Which countries
are these? Could you tell us? Indonesia
for some reason produces fantastic jizz.
Some of the best jizz you've ever seen.
Also China,
very good jizz. Possibly something to do with the amount of
people who are producing good jizz.
Ireland,
top jizz. We don't know why that is.
Possibly it's
some sort of fairy enchantment. But there's
very good jizz from Ireland.
In fact a lot of the Celtic countries,
Wales produces very good jizz.
Scotland's jizz is legendary.
There's jizz connoisseurs who
quite frankly won't touch anything else.
They'll only have the Scots jizz.
And
Dutch jizz, obviously.
You can't really beat the Dutch
when it comes to jizz.
The Dutch need to beat to get the jizz.
But the jizz is there.
And the second country,
I'm not going to tell you.
Is this some sort of big...
Is it a country in Europe?
It might be.
It might be a country in Europe.
That's your first question.
Hello, my name is Steven Thrasher
and I set my Canon laptop computer into.
I just got it back.
Everything that I've written on it for the past few years is gone.
I was told that you guys were going...
that I'd be called if you had to replace the hard drive.
I called Canon.
They said the hard drive didn't need to be replaced.
They just said the motherboard did need to be replaced.
Everything that I've been working on for the first two
god damn fucking years of my life is gone.
You fucking assholes.
Now I want you to call me back.
Stop fucking me around and make sure that I get back what I've been working on.
Do you fucking understand me?
And I'm tired of you fucking around with me.
I had better get my god damn disk drive back.
I'm going to sue all of you fucking pieces of shit.
Oh, it's the happy-go-lucky fuckity fuck.
It's the happy-go-lucky fuckity fuck.
You guys stood there signing calendars for two hours.
Or sat there signing calendars.
One hour.
Did any of them have boners while they had you sign?
Uh huh.
They did?
Yep.
Who?
I'm going to beat the shit out of them.
I didn't look up that far.
I just would look up and see the boner.
You'd just see the boner and sign the thanks for coming.
Yep.
That's like, thanks for coming.
Show off.

Yank this bird's face.
Tell us, we have the Pope Phil Monty from the, uh, he's the Pope of all Northern England
here.
Could you, could you please tell us what are your, what, what about the jizz trade in Northern
England?
What's going on up there?
Well, the jizz trade in the North of England is dominated by the flow of jizz from Aberdeen
from the offshore jizz rigs.
That's the black jizz market.
The black jizz market, yeah.
The North Sea Brent jizz.
Yeah, that's right.
Up in, up in the, the top end of the North Sea, over towards Scandall.



And then there's the, the north end of the North Sea, and then there's the southern end


So, uh, the jizz market is in Scandinavia, where, uh, where the British Reserve is for,
uh, where jizz is concerned.
It, the jizz reserve in fact, uh, is overtaken by the, the wave of kind of jizz centric
mentality of coming down from Scandinavia.
Well, I know we've had a lot of rumors and about, um, jizz smugglers here in Europe.
Um, it seems to be that America is one of the world's leading producers of jizz.
You should ask an American consumer.
Yeah, and consumers of jizz.
And, and there have been a lot of allegations about running jizz on speedboats in through
Portugal and Spain and smuggling this jizz ta-, without paying taxes on it here in Europe.
Well, well, Paul Black, you would really know about that much, much better than we do.
Isn't it correct that you're, uh, prevented from re-entering America because of your,
uh, previous jizz offenses?
Jizz res-
This is true.
Actually, there, jizz is, um, it is, is more criminalized than it is here in western Europe.
And, uh, that you can go to prison for a long time for jizz offenses.
Isn't it correct to have some, some sort of phrase in the legal profession there, three
jizz strikes and you're out?
Yes, that's true.
Um, take Rod Stewart for instance.
Um, Rod Stewart had his, um, stomach pumped back in the 1974 and he was found to contain,
um, very many cases of jizz.
Um, because of this, he's gonna ha-, he, he, he got off in the first offender's program
for this jizz offense actually.
That's true, but we've, we've digitally removed the name of the real pop star from the 1970s
and replaced it with the name of Rod Stewart.
To avoid any legal complications.
You know, you know what?
In this studio tonight, I, this is a really rare privilege that we have somebody of this
magnitude.
We have the, we have the, we have the czar of jizz from America in this studio tonight.
The Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of Subgenius.
Can you please come over here and tell us about jizz trade in Texas?
Actually, I, personally, I am a spunk man myself.
Yeah.
He's a, he's a spunk master.
And, and, I, in fact, I was a spunk scraper as a young man.
Yeah.
Old folks, huh?
Well, most of us were.
I would scrape the legs of old men as I shaved them, their knees.
Most of us, most of us, were spunk scrapers, as you well know.
But, but I've just, I'm disgusted the way, America is the greatest consumer of jizz on
the planet.
And the average pink boy's appetite for jizz is staggering.
The buckets of jizz gulped down by the average pink boy on the job as they, as they, in just,
just while at work.
Not to mention, you know, to hold their marriage together.
They use jizz as a status symbol, the jizz of the boss, the jizz of the, of the, of Elvis,
you know, the, the jizz that he might very well have bought from you originally.
But, of course, by the time it makes it to Wall Street or Pennsylvania Avenue, well,
why then?
It's a, you know, thousands of dollars it stepped on, but yet it's a million dollars
an ounce because of whatever name.
What are they cutting?
What kinds of things do they cut that jizz?
What do you get the jizz with?
That's what I want to know.
What are you getting instead of jizz?
Egg whites.
Egg whites.
Baboon jizz mixed in instead of.
Pig jizz.
Yeah.
Fowl.
Pig.
Vaseline intensive care lotion.
And, and what's worst of all, human jizz and mixed in with subgenius jizz.
Oh my God.
That, and that, talk about a, a, a crime against nature.
Yep.
To combine the subgenius DNA with the human DNA.
Yeah.


It's just so, it's evil.
Do you know who are the world experts on this evil technology?
The Walt Disney Corporation.
Yes, it's right.
Oh God.
Don't mention.
The Baptists were right about the, them.
Absolutely.
They boycott Disney.
So they should.
I was shocked to see Disney everywhere in Holland.
I thought Disney was just an American cancer.
No, no.
A shanker upon the penis of our body politic.
It leaked out.
It leaked out.
A pustule.
Always released by the CIA.
No antibiotics.
No.
I thought it could stop the Disney shanker.
God.
Yeah.
That's, that's the way they get, that's they get in and they taint the jizz.
The natural jizz.
Yeah.
The normal jizz.
A kid, a kid is born.
They mix Mickey Mouse jizz in there.
Yeah.
The way you should be born just spraying jizz, night and day.
Yep.
And, and yet, and yet you're tied off.
It's like there's a rubber band around it.
Yeah.
Don't you feel like that, friend?
They do.
They've just, they, they, they've, you can only jizz here at certain times, certain
places.
You know.
Only on Thursday night.
Only with the lights off.
Yeah.
Only with the lights on.
Only with somebody you know.
Yeah.
Only in a bucket.
Only in a tub.
Yeah.
Only steps on the desk.
Yeah.
Only before marriage.
Face north one week.
Face south the next.
They've driven jizz underground.
They've driven it underground.
And they're even trying to make you scared of your jizz by fake radio documentaries about
the gush.
Well, you know, actually the, uh, have you ever heard of something like called Dutch
culture?
Apparently it's all these paintings.
Like a lot of people made like centuries ago.
And uh, now it's been slowly turning into this, this jizz like Disney corporation kind
of thing, which the jizzney corporation, the jizzney corporation, it's like, it's, it becomes
like you walk here in this, what used to be once a beautiful city, but they've redone
it in a way that you suddenly feel like you're walking through a theme park.
A jizz theme park.
Yeah.
Jizz land.
Jizzneyland.
Jizzney world.
Jizzney world.

Amsterdam.
Yes.
You know, that's funny because when I had heard, heard so many, uh, fantastic stories
about the red light district and when I actually got there, I was so let down because it did
seem like a theme park.
Yeah.
It was not like a department store, but a theme park.
I thought this is a sip.
This isn't dangerous.
I looked at that place.
This is thrilling.
I looked at that place.
You have to make, you go in there and you think.
They're the best dumb red lights I've ever seen.
Well, and I gotta say that I wish that our theme parks back in the States were up to
these standards.
Is the Milky Way one big long jizz stain across this country?
Is it one sperm stain?
You can't say that.
You can say sperm.
You know, there's been a great shortage of jizz in the, in the, uh, and that would explain.
I don't think we can say that one.
Is there really?
It's just a yang.
What does that mean?
Yang and yin.
Yang and yin.
Okay.
Yeah.
The yang is the sperm part.
So it's a big yang.
Okay.
Across the sky.
So then the world was filled with yang or else you wouldn't have yanged it there, right?
I thought it was short for the jizz matrix.
I thought you were talking about the cosmic jizz matrix that is the, it's another word
for the score, the great net of all reality.
You're pulling my yang.
Come on.
No, it is.
The jizz matrix.
That's what those subgeniuses were talking about.
There were these convenience stores down south we saw called Jezzum.
Oh, Jezzum.
Yeah.

G-E-Z-M or something like that.
Jezzum.
There's a female hair remover called Nads.
Nads?
It comes from Australia as if they didn't know why they were called that.
What a gonad was.
Or even experienced the delightful flavor of gonad on their eyes as a way of making
those pallet tumors and small pieces of eyelid go away.
Like caviar.
Like caviar.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Some of them are bald
Some are kinda scary
And this is what they're called
Vagina
Vagina

They call that thing

Some belong to virgins
They're really tight and strong
But big or small
I love them all
That's why I sing my song
Vagina

They call that thing
Vagina

Some of them are smelly
Like clams and fish and such
Some smell like a summer's eve
Cause they've been douched
By the sun
Too much
Vagina

They call that thing
Vagina

Nothing could be finer than to be in a vagina in the morning.
Oh no, what is this?
Something down here smells like fish.
When's the last time you used this sink?
Ugh, your booty stinks.
I hate to tell ya, but I don't wanna smell ya.
Oh Miss Thing, you smell so funny.
Won't you wash the coochie, honey?
Wash the coochie, honey.
Ivory.
I'm so free when you wash the coochie, honey.
I love you.
I swear by every star above you.
Though near to me or far, I love you.
This is no shit.
My heart cries just to see the love in your eyes.
Love that lifts my head to blue skies.
This is no shit.
I pray when you hold my hand, you will understand.
What?

What's on my mind.
But if I'm to be denied, you can step aside and kiss my behind.
So take me, never ever to forsake me.
If this is a dream, don't wake me.
This is...
no shit.
I hope she even chose me.
You hook ass for aocoos.
hooks for underage.
Its a loops of like.
My eyes donn't think hard, but my head isrollo be loud.
So take...
maybe some rest.
Never ever to forsake me
If this is a dream, don't wake me
I dig this reverie bit
And I know at last
This is no shit
This is no shit
This is no shit
This is no shit
This is no shit
This is no shit

This is no shit
This is no shit
This is no shit
This is no shit
This is no shit

This is no shit
I'm glad y'all find this funny.
Okay.
You're probably on the steering wheel too, don't you?
Oh, all right, all right.
How long does it look like it's been sitting there?
Steve is coming off of it, okay?
Steve is coming off of it?
Yes.
How long now, huh?
I am taking, it's a fresh turd.
Okay.
What you need to do is you need to bring that turd back,
and we'll match it up.
We got a lineup.
We'll match it up with the other turds that we have.
Well, what you need to do is learn how to use a toilet.
You're not going to bring the turd back to me?
No.
You know what?
Is this a sample?
No.
I'm starting to like it.
You going to keep it as a pet?
I'm going to keep it because it's a nice little,
you know what?
It's a nice conversation piece.
Okay, cool.
Okay.
Thanks, man.
Thanks, man.
Thanks to Mr. Sister for that particular little cut,
and thanks in general to the Alt Binary Slack fucks,
the ABS fucks.
You know who you are, but friends, really,
that's where I'm getting some of the best of my foul collection
of sickness and audio.
I've actually been cleaning my computer out for this show,
and this was mostly MP3s converted.
I will be going into my old collection of tapes for the next show
whenever that happens.
Now, friends, let's let Einstein's Secret Orchestra take us home.
Friends, take us home.
With this song recorded at the last X-Day Drill,
four X-Day Drills,
2001, I should say,
at Brushwood, Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
Well, it was starting to be a really smooth professional transition there.
We had different ways of approaching this, friends.
If X-Day had been on time,
we would be out in space looking down on the Earth
with a certain amount of sentimentality having destroyed most of it.
We could be thinking, gosh,
now we're on that trip.
We're on a blue, marbled planet.
As ironic as it is.
But I've seen a job.
That's where it all started, where it all came from.
I drive very far.
Oh, yeah.
In my big fancy car.
I walk down the street, but keep my eyes to the ground.
I'll go round and round.
Like a satellite.
I'll go round and round.
And at the end of my life,
I finally see
the world in my dreams.
World in all what they see.
Oh.
Wait.
I get it now.
Yeah.
Last night,
I had that experience.
I was on a dream.
That I was standing on the moon.
I must have been playing the Mojo World too much or something.
I was on some fucked up planet,
and I could see the Earth there.
And it was just hanging in the blackened and black space.
And I thought, gosh.
For a second I thought how dangerous this all was.
I just enjoyed the moment, but I thought,
there it is.
There it is.
All the people who ever lived.
All the stories that were told.
All the deeds ever done, right or wrong.
All the little children at play.
All the animals that ever scurried about.
Nobbing each other up.
All those dinosaurs that were planted here 3,000 years ago by the fundamentalists.
But wait.
All the songs.
That were ever lived.
That was the one that got me.
It was all the songs that were ever written.
They happened right there.
On that little tiny blue, blue orb.
Just hanging there.
I could see it coming out.
And I thought, you know, if mankind fucks up, that's it.
I mean, the lizards might evolve into some intelligent form somewhere down the road, but they won't be human.
You know, they might evolve again, but they won't be human.
And if we fuck it all up then, that's it.
No more stories.
No more deeds.
No more, with no monkey hunking.

No more light.
No more songs from Earth.
And I thought, us and all our friends are so fucked up.
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.
Everybody together on the line now.
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.
Come on, let's hear it.
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.
Come on, make them hear it.
Everybody down at the roundhouse.
Come on.
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.
Yeah.
You know, as long as we come to some understanding about that part of our nature, we just might feel it.
And you know, a lot of people talk about the aliens, but you know, keep one thing in mind.
There's no physical proof that somebody has to be first.
Because we're just the first.
And for me, if we were going to get this far without help from the aliens, do we really need to sit around and wait for the aliens to come to us?
Do we really need to be the one to be a part of a big pipe whose mouth would say,
Could it be that we could actually save ourselves?
Could it be that we could trust God to build our own ship?
To our known Messiah.
That's right.
Or ship some fly helmets or at least build our own Amsterdam.
Let's kids connect the dock.
Connect the dock.
And you know, we can't build our own Amsterdam.
At least we can try to make sure that the next young kid down the line doesn't die.
We can't throw him away almost in the middle of the college rush.
He doesn't want to be involved.
We can't throw him away almost in the middle of the college rush.
I'm a son of a fantasy.
I'm a son of a fantasy.
I'm a son of a fantasy.
Oh, my God.
Go to sleep and dream of pleasure ships for my abode.
July 5th, I guess it's going to be next year now.
Go to sleep.
And dream of flight hocks, fun lovely nights, dreams and bad nights, love.
Sex goddesses and switch and guide your way.
The smiling face of God will keep you safe until next day.
Sex goddesses and switch and guide your way.

The smiling face of God will keep you safe until next day.
And friends, when in doubt, when in doubt, just get you a picture of Bob and look at
that face.
Okay.
And when your friends say, why are you looking at that face?
Why do you like Bob?
Make them look at that face.
Make them look and really look at that face, my friend,
and they will see.
They will finally see.
See.
Yes, friends.
As a great subgenius in Amsterdam said,
you better shout and make a lot of noise or whatever,
because when you die, you shut up right now.
Bob took my brain.
He reprogrammed it, and he stuck it in my ass,
and now my brain is in my ass.
My reprogrammed Bob's brain is sticking in my butt.
And you know what?
It's probably the best place for it.
It really is, because now my ass does the thinking for everything I do.
I just wish you'd stop scratching your head.
I'm not scratching my head.
That's my...
That's gross stuff coming out of you.
One of those lumps.
Are they hemorrhoids?
There's something moving in your nose.
That's true.
Yeah, that's...
Now...
This is why...
This is why shit comes out of my...
The lumps are a dick on your face.
Shit comes out of my mouth,
but enlightenment comes out of my ass.
That is the church of the subgenius,
where that is true.
Friends, no one should have to puke alone.
That's why the church of the subgenius is here.
They can do your puking for you.
They can do your puking with you.
They can feed it back to you afterwards.
You listen to the sound of Princess Way's life ticking away.
Friends, it's just a great recycling.
It's a recirculation.
In and out, in and out.
Oh, yes, friends.
You've been listening to the wonderful
XXX-rated hour.
The hour of slack number two.
The unclean hour of slack.
You can always get more information
from the church of the subgenius
at www.subgenius.com.
But you knew that,
or you wouldn't probably be listening to this,
because that's the only place we're going to be playing
this particular foul and filthy show.
But you know what?
I could go on for more than an hour.
This show's more than an hour of slack,
because it's more than slack, friends.
It's more than slack when we can use it
in the last minutes before the conspiracy
closes down.
The ability to say fucking shit
with impunity.
I can, and friends, I don't have to worry
about sticking to an hour.
You can't imagine what it's like
having to cut these shows down to one hour.
Exactly.
Or actually, 59 and a half minutes.
But friends, this time I don't care.
You don't care.
Praise Bob.
That's the end of it.
And here at the end is the mighty
post office box.
Praise Bobby.
Oh,
we're
on slack.
