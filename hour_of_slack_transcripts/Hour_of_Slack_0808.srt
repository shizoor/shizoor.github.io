Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:27,280
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station

3
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,280
and only in the city of...

4
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:43,200
Oh, friends, friends, friends, this ongoing war. I don't know when you'll be hearing this show,

5
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:51,060
but this show will be composed of some older shows. I'm going to go with part two of Reverend Susie the Flusie's

6
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:57,160
very first war show, broadcast on WREK in Atlanta.

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,420
Probably a month ago, at least. Part two of her show also, we'll be hearing lots of, of course,

8
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:10,540
Einstein's Secret Orchestra Swamp Radio from WCSB in Cleveland.

9
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,420
Oh, I don't know what we'd do without these college radio stations that let us get away with it

10
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,240
and that replay this stuff, even once we've gotten away with it once.

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,120
It's just incredible. God bless America and Bob damn the conspiracy.

12
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,580
And...

13
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,120
And, uh, however you want to define that, my friends.

14
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,540
God bless planet Earth, too.

15
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,360
Your God bless planet Earth, that is.

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,160
This music in the background is by Ego Plum.

17
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,620

18
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,880
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

19
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,560
For free information on the Church of the Subgenius,

20
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,680
always feel free to write to...

21
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,600
Ah, that post.

22
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,860
Office got that pencil ready.

23
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,840
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

24
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,140
75214.

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
We'll get that number again at the end of the broadcast,

26
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,860
along with that sacred URL, www.subgenius.com.

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,740
And now, this.

28
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,260
I'm getting out of this town alive if it kills me.

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,500
If we build a 30-foot wall, they'll find a way to get over it.

30
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,280
If we go 35 feet, they'll jump that one, too.

31
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,940
Whatever defenses we set up, these people will try to breach them.

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,840
So our only hope is Bob.

33
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,020
And a deep enough pit to hide in.

34
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,060
And you know how I feel about Hell Hole.

35
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,800
In the archives is a letter written by my dad,

36
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,540
which said, in January 1972,

37
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,580
that in reality,

38
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,320
instead of bombs falling on New York and Los Angeles and Houston and Dallas,

39
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,020
in reality, what really had occurred

40
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,260
was that the greatest door in the history of the work

41
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,860
had opened to the church.

42
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,420
He was going to be able to put,

43
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,620
in the name of God,

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,120


45
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,360
And that was an interesting thing.

46
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,360


47
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,360


48
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,060
What the hell?

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,840
Was that Garner Ted Armstrong or Norm Sekwetel?

50
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,460
No.

51
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,880
But he does bring up an interesting topic, Seeker.

52
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,340
Yes.

53
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:50,040
You know, there is one clutch of violence that stands to make a substantial profit

54
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,300
off of this whole deal.

55
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,540
Why don't you take a look at the bottom line?

56
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,420
Hmm.

57
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:56,960
Oh, yeah.

58
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,020
I do need to raise the veil on that, Bob.

59
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,980
But I need to buy a little more time.

60
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,760
Let's listen to some music.

61
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,400
And appreciate the fact that W-R-E-K Atlanta

62
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,300
isn't a Connell Rad Station yet.

63
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,440
But give them time.

64
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,100
They'll come around to it.

65
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,280
He thought with a kind of astonishment

66
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,020
of the biological uselessness of pain and fear,

67
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,980
the treachery of the human body,

68
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,420
which always freezes into inertia

69
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,020
at exactly the moment when a special effort was needed.

70
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,540
But precisely because of the extremity of his danger,

71
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,160
he had lost the power to act.

72
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,460
It struck him that in moments of crisis,

73
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,780
one is never fighting against an external enemy,

74
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,700
but always against one's own body.

75
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,060
Even now, in spite of the gym,

76
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,300
the dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible.

77
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,180
And it is the same, he perceived,

78
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,740
in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations.

79
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,160
On the battlefield, in the torture chamber,

80
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,960
on a sinking ship,

81
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,960
the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten.

82
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,120
Because the body swells up until it fills the universe.

83
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,740
And even when you are not paralyzed by fright or screaming with pain,

84
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,580
life is a moment to moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness,

85
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,080
against a sour stomach or an aching tooth.

86
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,740
Can we have some more music please?

87
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,640
I don't want to hear this stuff.

88
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,140
Can we hear more music?

89
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,860
When we speak about the end times in progress of today,

90
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:25,940
we are talking about the end times in progress of today.

91
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,380
Then of course this also applied to the last time.

92
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,020
It was God's judgment upon a godless world.

93
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,240
To begin with, I would like to say,

94
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,160
God's thoughts are not thoughts of destruction,

95
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,900
but thoughts of peace.

96
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:48,560
He said, look, I mean, God is not in the building squishing business.

97
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,100
He doesn't take life.

98
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,780
He didn't take his breath and cause those airplanes to veer off course

99
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,800
and smash into buildings.

100
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,560
He's not in the killing business.

101
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:08,840
But beyond that, I believe that we should use the muscle of the United States

102
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,860
to begin the decolonization of the Soviet or the Russian Empire.

103
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,840
And with that in mind, I would think that we as a nation

104
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,380
should send whatever arms and supplies are needed

105
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,920
to the indigenous groups of freedom fighters that are struggling for liberty,

106
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,780
whether that would be in Nicaragua,

107
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,780
whether it would be in Mozambique,

108
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,520
whether it would be in Afghanistan.

109
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,000
This conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others.

110
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,660
We could not have dreamed two years ago

111
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,180
that God was setting up a timing that is absolutely incredible

112
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,980
because the whole world is asking,

113
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,260
why? Why? Who did this?

114
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,080
How could God let something like this happen?

115
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,560
Reverend, I need to know.

116
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,720
Is God punishing me?

117
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,800
Ooh, short answer, yes, with an F.

118
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,000
Long answer, no, with a B.

119
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,760
How could we have known?

120
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,020
It has been a dream of mine for 20 or more years

121
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,500
to really depict in graphic form on the silver screen

122
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:21,740
what the Bible tells us the last few years of this dispensation is going to be like.

123
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,320
I mean, hey,

124
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,400
if you want to stay around, you can be here.

125
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,400
I'm out of here with you.

126
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,200
I'm out of here with you.

127
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,780
Oh, yes!

128
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:30,800
Yes!

129
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,120
Yes!

130
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,120


131
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,980
Come on!

132
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,520
Let's go!

133
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,760
God didn't do this, folks.

134
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,080
The devil did it.

135
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,360
Right.

136
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,740
Okay?

137
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,220
The devil!

138
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,840
And we agreed to cooperate with Jesus Christ

139
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,220
in destroying those evil works

140
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,360
and those evil men who had perpetrated this dastardly deed

141
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,300
that just boggles the soul.

142
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:53,720
It's not just the mind.

143
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,800
All of us have just been numbed, I think,

144
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,940
and yet, here's the Scripture,

145
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,800
that God just burst in my spirit.

146
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,680
Oh, hallelujah.

147
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,440
When I first got the bad news.

148
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:05,960
Ha!

149
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,560
A lot of Hollywood is cancelling the release of their films.

150
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,820
Are you cancelling the release of your films?

151
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,640
Absolutely not.

152
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,400
No.

153
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,920
A thousand times no.

154
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,460
Now, some of the other big Hollywood films had to be cancelled

155
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,600
because they had acts of terrorism in them.

156
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,420
and it is most appropriate that arnold schwarzenegger and some of those guys that had

157
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:35,740
you know what does hollywood want to make films that show acts of terrorism i well don't get me

158
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,360
started on that or we'll be here the rest of the night my german blood will begin to boil

00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:06,920
we will have the answer to the question that the world is asking right now why did god let this

162
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:15,180
happen yeah the answer to a question we had no way of knowing that would even be asked

163
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,500
the answer to a question no one asked the god in his infinite wisdom

164
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,000

168
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,440

169
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:49,500

171
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,520
than you are or you're losing the ministry but if you had the answer the political leaders of this

172
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:08,500
nation and of this world do not have any answers oh thank you very much they didn't make any money they lost millions of dollars and may they lose much more if they ever try they haven't by the way and by the

173
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:21,180
way did you know the films lately are not nearly as christian bashing as they once were i think we are making up for it past time and being filmer of the inside and outside world that kind of came starting up in beyond memory in this collection of yours in because since this was written later in her life do every day啊

174
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,180


175
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,760
making an impact on Hollywood.

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,840
Thank God for Megiddo, which was positioned perfectly in the midst of the most radical

177
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,060
thing that's ever hit the United States of America.

178
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,420
Here's the answer.

179
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,220
Here's a message in the form of a theatrical motion picture, prepared, ready and releasing

180
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,380
10 days from now.

181
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,800
Oh, Matt, I see the hand of God so clearly in this.

182
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,980
Wouldn't it be awesome if the other major motion picture producers, for whatever reason,

183
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:04,380
postponed their releases so that Megiddo is the only thing you can really come and see

184
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,300
on the 21st of September when it releases on that weekend?

185
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,380
I mean, God has got this all figured out and I know that something awesome is going to

186
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:15,900
come from this.

187
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,040
Give us your money, money, money.

188
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,360
Give us your money, money, money.

189
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,360


190
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,340
That's what we want you to do.

191
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,340


192
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,760
I can't.

193
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,320
It's too early to say too much.

194
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,180
It's too early to be saying too much.

195
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,260
It's not.

196
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,940
That's what

197
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,240
is.

198
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,300
You're right.

199
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,040


200
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,120
feared that one day would be the last day.

201
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:03,340
Now, in 2001, that day may be tomorrow.

202
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,300
Maghetto.

203
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,940
You don't have a chance in hell of getting what you want.

204
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,480
I'll always have a chance in hell, David.

205
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,940
And God's will is not always done.

206
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,180
You know, and sometimes I think we see these things and somehow we want to, you know,

207
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,480
use the old Augustine idea that everything happens.

208
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,560
Absolutely not.

209
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:22,920
This is not the will of God.

210
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,580
And we need to be willing to say that without question.

211
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,780
God can take the most awkward circumstances.

212
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,160
Exactly.

213
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,860
From this point forward, moving forward, he can do that, no question.

214
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,920
Mr. Reagan used to tell the story about that kid digging all that manure out of that stock.

215
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,740
The horse.

216
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,960
The one that actually came out.

217
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,500
Yeah.

218
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,240
He said that all of this has got to be a pony in his stomach.

219
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:41,860
It's got to be a pony, yeah.

220
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,720
It's a pony.

221
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,020
No, it's a goat.

222
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,620
You know, one of them lady goats.

223
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,760
Good Lord.

224
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,160
Oh, how could you?

225
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,100
I think I'm...

226
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,880
I'm going to be sick.

227
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,480
Oh, yes, seekers.

228
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:59,140
Am I the only one who's more than a little disturbed by all that venal dry washing of

229
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,260
hands going on on the Trinity Broadcasting Network?

230
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,120
Am I the only one who seems to be doing a little simple math and putting some numbers

231
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:17,940
together and figuring out who is going to benefit from this total top to bottom shakeup

232
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,800
in our society?

233
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,180
Yes.

234
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,760
Oh, yeah.

235
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:31,140
I've been taking in a lot of viewing seekers, but the saber rattling is...

236
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:40,900
Oh, from the Christian camp, it's disturbing to say the least, but below it, there's a

237
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:48,440
corporate financial venal coldness that makes me wonder who was behind all this.

238
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,480
Oh, yeah.

239
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,140
I'm sure it was the

240
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,580
piloting those plans.

241
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:57,180
If you believe Paul Crouch, it could have been angels.

242
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,580
Oh, yes.

243
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:06,020
The world's getting way too screwed up for even me, seekers.

244
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,940
I think that says a lot.

245
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,960
Oh, yeah.

246
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,800
Good.

247
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:43,300
And it looks like that ain't getting better than we thought.

248
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:43,940
I'd say ahesion's ingredients are complex...

249
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:43,940


250
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:43,940


251
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:43,940


252
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:43,940


253
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:43,940


254
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,680
In a quiet little village by the sea

255
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,080
I hear the calling and it calls for you and me

256
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,520
So keep your riches and your houses on the heels

257
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:06,120
Cancel all your credit cards and settle up your bills

258
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,960
Cause you don't need them anymore

259
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,780
Blow us down the factories, blow up all the stores

260
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:23,360
Cause there's a big world coming down

261
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:34,220
Cause there's a big world and it's coming down

262
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,800
Once I stood in New York City with a sign saying

263
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,440
The end is coming, friends, but then why there's still time?

264
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,720
I will admit that no one really seemed to hear

265
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,120
The word I'm going there, fingers at my sandals and my feet

266
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,160
Now they listen when I say

267
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,480
I have proof that I'm ready

268
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,560
I'm ready to go

269
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:09,940
I'm ready to go

270
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,140
I'm ready to go

271
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:52,740
I'm ready to go

272
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,320
It's a big world

273
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,760
It's a big world

274
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,460
It's a big world

275
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,960
It's a big world

276
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,220
It's a big world

277
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,440
It's a big world

278
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,760
It's a big world

279
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,560
It's a big world

280
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:39,560


281
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:39,560


282
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:39,920
It's a big world

283
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:39,920


284
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,400
Thank you.

285
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,320
Thank you.

286
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,460
Thank you.

287
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,060
Thank you.

288
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:48,940
Thank you.

289
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,180
Thank you.

290
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,000
Thank you.

291
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:11,920
Thank you.

292
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,500
Thank you.

293
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,880
Thank you.

294
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,900
Thank you.

295
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,660
Thank you.

296
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,380
Thank you.

297
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,460
Thank you.

298
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,800
Thank you.

299
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,300
Thank you.

300
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,480
Thank you.

301
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,060
Thank you.

302
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,740
Thank you.

303
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,600
Thank you.

304
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,300
Thank you.

305
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,660
Thank you.

306
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,420
Thank you.

307
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,220
Thank you.

308
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,840
Thank you.

309
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,160
Thank you.

310
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,980
Thank you.

311
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,160


312
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,580
Thank you.

313
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,120
Thank you.

314
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,320
Thank you.

315
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,260
Jack Warner's about that big world coming down.

316
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,660
I know I've played that before, but no.

317
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,820
I like to soundtrack it at home.

318
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,340
The butthole surfers with the human cannonball.

319
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,960
I found locust abortion technicians yesterday at the bookstore.

320
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,960
Yes, along with their hogs.

321
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,280
Things are just falling apart.

322
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,620
Shaved pigs had a song,

323
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,520
Die for profits, kill for profits.

324
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,580
And they spelled it B-R-O-F-I-T-S.

325
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,940
But I think we're going to have to deal with some people that are crazy for it.

326
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,620
The other kind of profit seekers.

327
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:01,680
And Planet B Project hopped in again with a letter from the shelter.

328
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,440
Oh, victims of the fury.

329
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,160
It was just too appropriate.

330
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,700
The world collapsing around us.

331
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,540
Robin's drowning.

332
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,660
But what about things right next door in the People's Republic of Chlamydia?

333
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,960
We heard there's been a like a.

334
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:36,740
A large outbreak.

335
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,920
We could call it a stain somewhere in the middle of the land.

336
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,860
You know, and some of these people are just stinking the place up.

337
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,180
Yeah.

338
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:52,260
And was that was it was that planted by the KGB CIA or was it planted by them?

339
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:52,600
Right.

340
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,480
Smush to make the CIA KGB look bad.

341
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:02,900
Or was it planted by the others to make them look like they were planting the evidence to make the CIA look bad?

342
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,460
Or was it really salami bin?

343
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:14,140
I mean, it's been over and take the salami and his crew of madman cutthroats, which must be stamped out one by one.

344
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,320
Well, I can tell you.

345
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,820
By professional cutthroats.

346
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,680
Like cutting heads off a giant bean.

347
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,100
With tattoos of anchors and mom on their arms.

348
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,140
I can tell you what.

349
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,460
And bop!

350
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,900
Grr!

351
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,600
Maybe that's the fast travel.

352
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:53,600


353
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:53,600


354
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:53,600


355
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:53,600


356
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:53,600


357
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:53,700
Ten minutes.

358
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:53,760
reacted like the internet stuff.

359
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,920
dirt all over.

360
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,820
That's just not clickta-

361
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,140
I didn't make a deal.

362
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,140


363
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,920
I didn't.

364
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,780
Thank you.

365
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,520
Thank you.

366
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,260
Thank you.

367
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,900
Thank you.

368
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,040
Thank you.

369
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,120
Thank you.

370
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:05,920
Thank you.

371
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:35,800
Thank you.

372
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,660
Thank you.

373
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,300
Thank you.

374
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,040
Thank you.

375
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,660
Thank you.

376
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:06,660


377
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,260
Thank you.

378
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,000
Thank you.

379
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,320
Thank you.

380
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,840
Thank you.

381
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,640
I think we could all use a little jolt of this.

382
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,220
Let us therefore brace ourselves for our duty.

383
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,420
So bear ourselves,

384
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,880
that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth

385
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,540
last for a thousand years,

386
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,080
we will be able to do it.

387
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,980
This is the death right now.

388
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:32,540
This is the death right now.

389
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,000
This is the death right now.

390
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,780
That's what I've been trying to find out there,

391
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,240
and I can't find it anywhere else.

392
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,140
I get the feeling that nobody out there is in charge.

393
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,340
And everybody's willing to act their part.

394
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,060
It's like a horrible, jerking fight on a playground

395
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,480
between the three biggest bullies.

396
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,360
The Seekers Group's stuck.

397
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:05,440
We're stuck.

398
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:05,440


399
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,440
We're stuck right in the middle of it.

400
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,160
What are we fighting about?

401
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,360
And all we can do,

402
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,740
all we can do is be strong.

403
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:26,040
All we can do is find that measure of strength

404
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,520
within us as subgeniuses

405
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,500
to keep slogging on.

406
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,240
Look, is this what we,

407
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:35,720
to keep slogging on,

408
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,360
to keep slogging on,

409
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,360


410
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,360


411
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,360


412
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,800
Haven't we all been getting a little too complacent?

413
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,480
Oh, yes.

414
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,780
We needed a damn good jolt.

415
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,020
Well, honey, here it is.

416
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,900
All nice and gift-wrapped.

417
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,740
And unbelievable.

418
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,260
Oh, yes.

419
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,240
Oh, yes.

420
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:04,740
Yes.

421
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,700
Anything.

422
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,600
Anything is survivable if you're lucky.

423
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,300
And that's what we're in this cult for.

424
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:19,960
And right now, I mean, damn it, Bob didn't get us off this planet,

425
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:26,260
but here's a chance for Bob to prove that that $30 membership fee was worth something.

426
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,600
At least keep my ass alive.

427
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,540
Oh, Bob, please.

428
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,500
Oh.

429
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:33,840
Oh.

430
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,080
Oh, and

431
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,780
if I go.

432
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,620
Oh.

433
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,180
align if I go.

434
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:40,620
Oh, and if I go.

435
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:40,620


436
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:49,260
If I go, I'm up in Marietta, which is close enough to kill Radius and Dobbins over there

437
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,520
that I'm just going to melt into my damn records.

438
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,780
I'm already living in a basement.

439
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,880
It's this far to a bunker, honey.

440
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,100
I'm all it's all there.

441
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,820
Oh, until it's fast enough, then I'm gonna dance a couple horseback.

442
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:03,820


443
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:03,820


444
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:03,820


445
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:08,620
I want to be a part of it

446
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,460
New York, New York

447
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,240
And the twins were part of their constellation

448
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,660
And the end of the star bore the statute of limitations

449
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,920
As she held out her mighty foot in the harbor

450
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,400
But the day the sky rained black blood

451
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,760
Came and went

452
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,280
Boy, it's getting nighty-night

453
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,400
As I get old

454
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,700
Sack and a belly laugh and a deer eyes nut

455
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,640
Pass me a chunk of that cooked man leg

456
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,820
Stang, can you tell me how bad it's gotten?

457
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,220
How bad have police state America's gotten?

458
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,600
Well, they're thinking about a bill

459
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,140
Where they could grab you for throwing a rock at a truck or a tree

460
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,240
And call you a terrorist and keep you for a week

461
00:43:59,240 --> 00:43:59,740
Until it is gone

462
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,240
They decided you were just throwing a rock at a truck or a tree

463
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,440
Man, there's some places in America

464
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,560
Where they will throw you in jail

465
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,400
For doing things only to yourself

466
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,380
With no victim at all

467
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,860
And no possibility of a victim

468
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,420
Just things that you and you yourself

469
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,340
Agreed to do to yourself

470
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:24,100
They can consider that somehow as a crime against the state

471
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,660
Since you're part of the state

472
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,940
But yet, I should point out

473
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,700
They let go of the law

474
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:29,700


475
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:29,700


476
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,980
They did let me get away with saying that

477
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,200
So it must not be too bad yet

478
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,500
Stang, would they put you in jail

479
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,760
For eating cheese whiz out of the nose

480
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,060
Of a half-prairie squid jackrabbit?

481
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,800
Now, not in Cleveland Heights

482
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,160
But over to Mayfield Heights

483
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,900
I think that they will

484
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:54,520
But only after 3 o'clock

485
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,060
And before 6 o'clock in the morning

486
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,540
You better not do it on the street

487
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,240
Or in the morning

488
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,780
You are definitely doing some time for that, buddy

489
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,520
You know, the funny thing about some of these autonomous regions

490
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,020
Is they actually get up and bark

491
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,060
Before they're supposed to do the dimwaddle thing

492
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,640
Oh, some of them have nuclear weapons

493
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,920
Yeah, and you can imagine when they start juggling these

494
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,420
Like fish in the middle of the arena

495
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,760
We're all gonna purify

496
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,380
Hey, the Church of the Subgenius

497
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,460
Has three nuclear weapons, doesn't it?

498
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,160
No, five

499
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:23,680
Five?

500
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:24,360
Yeah

501
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,820
When did they get the other two?

502
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,580
Oh, a long time ago

503
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,360
We, you, uh

504
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,720
Have we got a nuclear weapon?

505
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:29,720


506
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:29,720


507
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,240
We got them, Lane

508
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,580
You were there when we got them, you idiot

509
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,640
Oh, that's right

510
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,260
Pope Black, duh

511
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,160
Don't you remember the deal

512
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:35,580
When we were

513
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,140
The last time we were in Amsterdam

514
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,720
Oh, that's true

515
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,940
No, it was the Chlamydians

516
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,820
It was a red plutonium dealer

517
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,800
Uh, named, uh, Eichorff

518
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,800
And this, uh, you did the

519
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:53,340
The Danish Subgenius made a deal with the Ukrainians

520
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,380
Do you have any

521
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,160
Does the Church of the Subgenius have any nuclear weapons in Europe?

522
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,020
Or are they all in the U.S.?

523
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,980
Well, I'm not gonna tell you where or what we're doing with them

524
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:08,520
Or what countries they might be being shipped into right even as we speak

525
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,020
Because that would be part of an ongoing criminal investigation

526
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,080
That I personally don't want to have any part of

527
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,420
Really?

528
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:15,980
So, whatever

529
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,860
You gotta understand

530
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,140
You gotta understand

531
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,080
You can't joke about bombs and stuff anymore

532
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:22,460
No

533
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,020
You really can't

534
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,400
They really are gonna come and talk to us now

535
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,180
Yeah

536
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:27,920
Uh

537
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,700
Let them talk to us

538
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,880
What have we got to hide?

539
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,080
Yeah, you're on a phone call on the other side

540
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:33,740
It's not a question of hiding your balls

541
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,380
See, this guy thinks all he's gotta do is hide his ball spot

542
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,220
You just hang up

543
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:37,860
And the beds will go away

544
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,760
This has nothing to do with that

545
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,900
This has to do with planting a new pubic goatee

546
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,440
One that makes you invisible

547
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,020
When you have to have, well, perhaps some sort of interviewer dealing with those people

548
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,080
There'll be a couple of them big black suburbans with the smoky windows

549
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,040
Parking downstairs

550
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:52,720
Yeah

551
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,700
Somebody's gonna, like, peer out of one of those windows and pull his wife's

552
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,600
Actually, I've already been

553
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,260
I thought

554
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,920
Sure, we'd like to have a word with you

555
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,480
Or a worm

556
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,020
That's what you really gotta worry about

557
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,080
Sure, we'd like to have a worm with you

558
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:05,900
Or the name like

559
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,900
Like Charles Smith

560
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,280
Yeah, they know that's an orifice

561
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,240
I mean, a name

562
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,500
Skinny white guy

563
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,360
Why, that's the most average fellow in the world

564
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,720
That's what you're looking for now

565
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,540
Old Charlie Smith

566
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,900
Why, sure, he's just a regular guy

567
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:24,920
Joe Lunchpale

568
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,340
Mr. Mo the Log

569
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:27,900
Good Catholic boy

570
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,240
I'm just a regular guy

571
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,940
Regular barbecue feller, kind of a neighbor out there.

572
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,340
He was an altar boy and a paper boy.

573
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,780
I don't want to catch.

574
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,940
And I say, as long as you're alive,

575
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,400
shout, make noise, or whatever,

576
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:18,300
because when you're dead, you shut up like hell.

577
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,680
guitar solo

578
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,920
guitar solo

579
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:23,260
Yeah, and the storm is threatening

580
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,040
I'm alive today

581
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,240
Yeah, and the storm is threatening

582
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,080
I'm going to get to the shelter

583
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,020
Oh, I'm going to fade away

584
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,640
Won't you run?

585
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,160
It's just a shot away

586
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,340
It's just a shot away

587
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,480
Won't you die?

588
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,760
It's just a shot away

589
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,860
It's just a shot away

590
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,940
Yeah, and the storm is threatening

591
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,940
I'm alive today

592
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:12,960
It's just a shot away

593
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,460
Oh, I'm burning and popping

594
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:18,560
I'm dead, but I'm not stupid

595
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,860
Oh, I'm going to get to the shelter

596
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,120
It's just a shot away

597
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,120
It's just a shot away

598
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,220
Oh, I'm going to get to the shelter

599
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,440
Oh, I'm burning and popping

600
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,220
I won't to die

601
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,580
It's just a shot away

602
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,680
It's just a shot away

603
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,380

614

Charlie, Charlie

615
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,400
It's just a Charlie

616
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,560
It's just a Charlie

617
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,720
It's just a Charlie

618
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,280
Charlie, Charlie

619
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,960
I'm telling you

620
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,440
Sister, I

621
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,420
Back

622
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:11,000
Man, stop that wall.

623
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,780
Them cats are killing themselves.

624
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,480
Put away the guns.

625
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,160
Put the bombs on the shelf.

626
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,600
Stop this wall.

627
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,060
The cats are killing themselves.

628
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,420
Stop this wall.

629
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:40,380
Boy, they're shooting them up and they're shooting them live.

630
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,400
They even got swigs and shooting them live.

631
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:58,880
A big bomb hit a boat out in the sea.

632
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,820
The sailors jumped up and hollered, what you doing to me?

633
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,260
Music

634
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:06,260


635
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,060
Music

636
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:12,940
Music

637
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:15,700
Music

638
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:15,700


639
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:15,700


640
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,040
Music

641
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:16,840
Music

642
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:16,840


643
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,840
Music

644
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,580
Boy, they bring them down

645
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,120
Low, they're low

646
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,860
When the bomb hits the ground

647
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,240
Them cats have got to go

648
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,900
Boy, that sounds like one of them instantarian bombs

649
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,140
Where'd you get that word, Wingy?

650
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,120
Boy, I dug it out the dugout

651
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:15,060
Stop the War by Wingy Manone

652
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,000
Or Man-One, or whatever

653
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,160
I have no idea, friends

654
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,220
That was posted to alt-binary slack

655
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,040
And I thought it funny

656
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:27,820
And it's been an unusual amount of non-subgenius, non-indie music tonight

657
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:31,620
But then it was largely a Suzy the Floozy Show replay

658
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:32,920
Bless her heart

659
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,760
Gimme Shelter, there was the Rolling Stones live at the Paradiso in Amsterdam

660
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,640
An unreleased track, Bless the Internet

661
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,380
And alt-binaries sounds, bootleg mp3

662
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:48,780

00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,100
Friends, and check out our catalog

676
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,840
And spend, and then support your local station

677
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,920
Spend, and then spread your seed for the war effort

678
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,360
Because hopefully it won't cost too much

679
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,540
Hey, I know I'm going to get on a touchy subject here

680
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,740
But has a subject here?

681
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,840
Osama Bin Laden paid his $30

682
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,280
No

683
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:42,640
Wow

684
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,560
No

685
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,220
Boy, you better say no to that

686
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,220
Of course, no

687
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,900
No, I mean

688
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,120
Is there a financial tie

689
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,220
I haven't actually checked

690
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,460
Between the church and Osama Bin Laden

691
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,620
You know, to tell the truth, I haven't checked

692
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,580
I have not checked

693
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:00,360
You better read that and list the names

694
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,420
Look for all the Mohammeds and stuff

695
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,420
Well, I mean, look at how much money

696
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,880
That the Bin Laden family gave to Bush

697
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,540
You know, that's a big Texas

698
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:12,240
I mean, you would think that $30

699
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,280
I mean, they've got all that money

700
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,580
They could at least pay $30

701
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,560
Hey, what I want to know

702
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,060
Is that how those Bush girls signed up

703
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,480
We got to get the Bush girls to Ex Day

704
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,540
That's what I want

705
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,200
We must preserve the empire

706
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,840
On board the escape vessels

707
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,180
So that the seed of genius

708
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,820
Will have a suitable fertile ground

709
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,380
In which to be sown

710
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,520
In the future

711
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:38,520

00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:38,520


714
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:38,520


715
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,540
The far future

716
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,940
I want to go home

717
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,980
Keep your hat on tight

718
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:45,800
You're back to the wind

719
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,060
You're sacking the saddle

720
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:50,480

734
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,720
And I didn't know who he was

735
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,080
Exactly

736
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,660
And J.R. Bob Dobbs

737
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,000
Is the creator of

738
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,080
The Church of the Subgenius

739
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,300
This guy

740
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,860
The Reverend Ivan Stang

741
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,960
Is one of their

742
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,640
Disciples

743
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,600
Disciples

744
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,420
Disciples

745
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:23,980
Yeah

746
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,960
Alright

747
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,720
You know, it's funny

748
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,900
I don't think Jesus had

749
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,400
A disciple named Dopey

750
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,660
Poor Bob

751
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:31,880
Lone cow babe

752
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,840
Don't you know

753
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,580
What they're doing to yourself?
