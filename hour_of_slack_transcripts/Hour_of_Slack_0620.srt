1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,120
The real enemy.

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,560
What I'm asking people to do is accept that everything they've based their lives on is a lie.

3
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,540
I'm seeking salvation.

4
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,120
There are enemies of children's souls.

5
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,720
All alone in this world of wickedness.

6
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,620
Search inside yourself for your soul.

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,360
In the name of the Jesus.

8
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,520
No, no, no.

9
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,660
No, no, no.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,320
Don't be proud of yourself.

11
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,720
Fight the real enemy.

12
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,620
Don't you want to be saved?

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,300
Don't you want to be saved?

14
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,320
Fight the real enemy.

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,600
We're all looking in the same direction.

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,060
We're not seeing quite the same thing.

17
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,480
There is absolutely no other possibility.

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,180
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 miles.

19
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,420
Voyage to the moon.

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,940
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

21
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,740
The subgenius power of sweat.

22
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,340
And now for this week's verse of meditation.

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,640
The dog returns back to its own vomit and the sow is washed only to wallow in the mire.

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,600
We're glad to have each and every one of you at our service today, especially the young folks.

25
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,420
There's going to be a youth meeting tonight.

26
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,000
After the assembly and all you youth need to be there.

27
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,720
We're going to serve macaroni and cheese, fish sticks and banana pudding.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,860
Brother Blowforth will speak on dating and mating.

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,400
Is it fun or frustrating?

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,840
Should be real good.

31
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,140
New Realization.

32
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,160
Bringing you best new information for your life.

33
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,100
Not entertainment.

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,280
New Realization.

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,760
Embodiment of concept taught by Nanmaster Nenslow is here to help you.

36
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,780
CIA, NSA, CFR, Trilaterals.

37
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,400
Federal Reservoir.

38
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,580
Bilderbergers.

39
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:30,960
P2.

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,820
Club of Rome.

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,480
International race hate conspiracy.

42
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,060
All means nothing.

43
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,540
Facts are worse than you imagine.

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,600
Yeti UFO contactees by thousands.

45
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,700
Cruel, hairy alien dwarfs.

46
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,540
Slash pickup truck fuel tanks with long sharp claws.

47
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,640
Cute ET.

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,140
Aryan Space Brothers.

49
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,100
Confederation of biped humanoid worlds.

50
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:58,380
We'll wish for that when global satellite TV reveals to all that dinosaurs never extinct went underground.

51
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,400
Not through the eyes of a human.

52
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,400


53
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Not through polar holes to imaginary interior world.

54
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:09,200
But to abandoned ancient death ray cavern cities whose unwanted pets dinosaurs once were.

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,920
They have advance of us by millions of years and long ago paid off world governments.

56
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,620
Creating red herring MJ12 area 51 dreamland scams.

57
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,080
Releasing vital fragments of actual fact.

58
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,340
In foolish fairy tales to discredit serious researchers.

59
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,380
Conceal world wide network of human clone names.

60
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:29,380


61
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,720
And the

62
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,060
Invisible non-corporeal ideiforms wage war for possession of human mind.

63
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,040
Showing all traits of life form lacking only bodies.

64
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:45,040
They possess, breed, fight, survive in non-dimensional ideocosm created by humans parasitic fungus brain.

65
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,840
Lowly lichen tells the tale of fungus failure to infect plant life form.

66
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,720
Alone or with plant form, fungus is stationary subject to nature's whim.

67
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,360
Discovery of one cell animal life changes all life forms.

68
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,360


69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,580
All that.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,620
Mobile host lives, grows, develops at last the human form.

71
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,540
Creates stone heap culture.

72
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,960
Tools creating smaller tools.

73
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,920
But then.

74
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,120
Ideiforms develop.

75
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,580
Controlling animal fungus symbiotes.

76
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,840
Creates armies, religions, atom bomb.

77
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,660
Ideiform lives an expensive victim.

78
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,400
Breeds.

79
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,280
Lives though all else die.

80
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,800
Solution none.

81
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,580
Answers none.

82
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,340
Nenslow said. Beware of those with all the answers.

83
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,660
I have only more questions.

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,360
Nenslow said. I never tell you don't listen to him.

85
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,440
I tell you listen.

86
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,820
And listen carefully.

87
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,680
Compare. Use reason.

88
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,480
Never decide once and for all.

89
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,980
This person is right. This is wrong.

90
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,780
Always leave yourself an out.

91
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,480
A person said to Nenslow.

92
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,560
When commies come marching down Main Street.

93
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,340
I'd rather have a gun in my hand than a philosophy book.

94
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,360
Nenslow said.

95
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,300
If commies have philosophy book.

96
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,380
They will never march down Main Street.

97
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,340
Read. Learn. Work.

98
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,440
Do. Dare.

99
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,880
And be silent.

100
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,420
New realization.

101
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,660
Box 86582.

102
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,360
Portland, Oregon 97286.

103
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,320
Don't stand for the

104
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,800
I'm not alone to hang and try.

105
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,440
You're in the mix too late to scream and cry.

106
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,260
Daddy says what to do, so watch the club.

107
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,740
Heaven didn't fall through, you had to roll around.

108
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,320
Put it back, put it back.

109
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,120
Should have been left alone, hell can't decide.

110
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,500
Which if no tragic role to suicide.

111
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,440
Daddy says what to do, so watch the club.

112
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,080
Heaven didn't fall through, you had to roll around.

113
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,760
Put it back, put it back.

114
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:07,460
Put it back, put it back.

115
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,340
Put it back, put it back.

116
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,760
You're in the mix too late to scream and cry.

117
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,760
Heaven didn't fall through, so watch the club.

118
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:36,880
Put it back, put it back.

119
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:36,880


120
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,160
You're in the mix too late to scream and cry.

121
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,860
Put it back, put it back.

122
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,240
You're in the mix too late to scream and cry.

123
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,260
Oh, yes, dear friends.

124
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,420
Some soothing music there from Punch Drunk.

125
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:08,320
One of the members of Punch Drunk came up to me at the last D-Vival I was preaching at in Philadelphia.

126
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,200
Handed me this tape and said, well, it's kind of, you've said you like Devo before.

127
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,840
It's kind of like that, but it's not like that.

128
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:23,460
So, Punch Drunk, and let me go ahead and give you their address in case you want to write them for free information.

129
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:37,300
That's Punch Drunk at, got that pencil ready, P.O. Box 53582 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

130
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,740
Zip code 19105.

131
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,640
You know, you should always have your pencil ready when you're listening to that.

132
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,100
Smooth.

133
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,520
Smooth.

134
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,140
Hour of Slack.

135
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,420
And this is your dear host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

136
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:04,980
And just before Daddy says, by Punch Drunk, we got to enjoy the most inspiring rant there by the great Nenslow.

137
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,820
And Nenslow is just the greatest.

138
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,260
He's the greatest.

139
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,260
Do you hear me, Nenslow?

140
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,060
I love you, man.

141
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,200
And, yes, that's why he provided this music.

142
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,080
Also in the background.

143
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,140
This is Nenslow himself leading the Nensletic Orchestra.

144
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:31,040
Before that, you heard Out of Band Experience, also known as Kings of Feedback.

145
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,620
A great subgenius band doing Fight the Real Enemy.

146
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,920
And who might that be?

147
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,980
And you can reach Out of Band Experience by calling.

148
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,940
Got that pencil ready?

149
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,760
1-617-LICK-O-B-E.

150
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,840
Yes, 1-617-LICK-O-B-E.

151
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,360
We're taking it easy now at this point.

152
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,960
We've had to do three shows in seven hours.

153
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,900
And we've got two more to go.

154
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,680
But we've got so much great tape.

155
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,220
And we're going to continue now with the tapes of the Senate hearings.

156
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:15,860
Original.

157
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,680
Broadcast on WCSB Cleveland.

158
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,820
ESO radio show.

159
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:32,060
When last we left off with Cantor Chaz and lonesome cowboy Senator Dave, the accused.

160
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,200
We were autopsying President Dobbs.

161
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:45,040
The president actually had just discovered certain key facts about the brain of President Dobbs.

162
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:52,320
And were, I believe, flipping the tape on the last show.

163
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,340
So this is where the tape picks up in Dave's brain.

164
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,420
Thank you.

165
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,400
Brain had been replaced by spongy mass of pipe tendrils.

166
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,780
Which seemed to writhe with an unholy intelligence of their own.

167
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,040
This may explain some of the president's foreign policy miscues.

168
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,760
Well, we certainly have been exposed to something nearing.

169
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,060
An incredible story here today.

170
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,160
I don't know really what to believe.

171
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,080
That the president's wife's brain actually became out.

172
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,460
Tendrils, tendrils in her brain.

173
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,980
Tendrils, tendrils.

174
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,220
Someone, someone, look.

175
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,020
Help the senator.

176
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,040
Help the senator.

177
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,060
Get the pipe out.

178
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,320
Oh, no.

179
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,560
It's too late.

180
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,720
It's thrown in too deep.

181
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,660
He'll lose the whole front part of his brain.

182
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,400
Now how do you feel, Senator Dave?

183
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,220
I feel just fine.

184
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,900
I feel all smooth and creamy like Farina.

185
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,920
Or a plate of well-done grits.

186
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,420
I don't feel like napping, though.

187
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,060
He has become.

188
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,120
Dave has become.

189
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,700
He has joined us.

190
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,200
All one.

191
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,020
Unite all faith.

192
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,120
All moral ABCs.

193
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,420
Rabbi Dobbs.

194
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,900
Dilute, dilute.

195
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,040
Okay, okay.

196
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,660
All wagged out.

197
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,100
Hey, is there supposed to be different new flesh growing on my skins?

198
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,680
Oh, that's just one of the side effects of the operation.

199
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,860
Oh, tell us about your dream.

200
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,680
You were mumbling answers as if you were being held on trial in some Senate hearings.

201
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,400
I dreamed that Reverend Stang was an evil senator.

202
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:53,000
He had claimed that somehow I was investigating the church, and then I had bankrolled, pocketed

203
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,340
my bankroll that had been given to me by the Senate committees.

204
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,600
And then he had been doing it instead, but he had me crucified up there just like Sivana

205
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,920
Rowland examining his snakes.

206
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:08,260
I was going to the crossroads of the witching post, and then all of a sudden Jackie Onassis'

207
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,140
head exploded into a polyphone, kind of like Bob's did when he was exploding.

208
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,000
Did we get all that on tape?

209
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,700
Okay, take it down to the novel department.

210
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,500
Send it off to Simon & Schuster.

211
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,380
That'll be the next subgenius book.

212
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,040
It's worth it.

213
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:32,900
Those experiments and, I mean, well, the surgery is expensive, but well worth the results in

214
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,780
prophetic utterances by the patient.

215
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:42,560
As we can see, doctors here, Dave laying on the operating table, seems to believe that

216
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,600
he is standing upright.

217
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,300
And doing a radio program.

218
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,500
So come a time when three wolves shall walk through the underwoods.

219
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,680
He's hooked up to the machine.

220
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,500
Bearing pieces of cheese and monumental artifacts from, wait a minute, lights are glimping.

221
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,660
Okay, yeah.

222
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:09,580
We can type in behavioral changes, and we can use the file transfer protocol to send

223
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,040
his behavior changes out over the neural net.

224
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:21,420
So that all the other recipients, if they can download Lonesome Cowboy Dave's brain, they

225
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,360
are able to take on the courage and wisdom of Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

226
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:31,260
It's a high tech version of the primitive belief that if you ate the enemy's heart,

227
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,560
you would gain his courage.

228
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:38,700
In this case, we download Lonesome Cowboy Dave's brain and gain his intelligence, which

229
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,980
for most of us, of course, is a soporific drug.

230
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,020
It's the only way we can get him to stop.

231
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,020


232
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,200
So we can relax.

233
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:49,200
We run up a little bit of Dave's brain, and it just mellows us out, you know.

234
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,340
It lowers our consciousness so many degrees.

235
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,420
It feels great.

236
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,340
You ought to try it.

237
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,900
Come on, man.

238
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,320
Don't you want to be like everybody else?

239
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,140
Try it.

240
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,180
What are you, chicken?

241
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,800
Try some Dave's brain, man.

242
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,740
I'll try some.

243
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,920
This is pure.

244
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,420
Oh, yeah.

245
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,200
Come on, little girl.

246
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,000
The first lobe is first.

247
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,000


248
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,000


249
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,000


250
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,000


251
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,000


252
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,000


253
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,000


254
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,620
It's like a little piece of onion.

255
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,520
Here, just hold on just a second.

256
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,640
Now, breathe into this sack.

257
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,580
This sack contains some of the essence of Dave's brain.

258
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,000
Go ahead.

259
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,760
Just huff it.

260
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,500
There you go.

261
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,120
Okay.

262
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:26,600
There you go.

263
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,360
Ow.

264
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,200
She's drooling.

265
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,680
This is the brain of...

266
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,680
She's growing small.

267
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,100
She looks like a little girl.

268
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,380
Now she's four years old, three.

269
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,000
She's growing up.

270
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,000


271
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,000


272
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,000


273
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,000


274
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,000


275
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,000


276
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,760
Two.

277
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,080
Now, hopefully it'll stop here.

278
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,800
We don't know what happens if they keep going.

279
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,280
Oh, don't cry, little girl.

280
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,000
Now, it's okay.

281
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,500
We're your friends.

282
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,380
You're going to grow big.

283
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,780
You'll be a big girl soon.

284
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,520
All right.

285
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,160
Now she's growing.

286
00:15:59,340 --> 00:15:59,880
Here we go.

287
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,020
It only lasts about 20 seconds, gentlemen.

288
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,800
And isn't that miraculous now?

289
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,600
A fully grown test subject.

290
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,980
Just re-grow immediately.

291
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,980
What we are trying to do is to make possible for the...

292
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,980


293
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,980


294
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,980


295
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,980


296
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,980


297
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,980


298
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,980


299
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,980


300
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,980


301
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,980


302
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,980


303
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,980


304
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,980


305
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,820
For the person to sniff or to waft someone's brain, to eat the brain, part of the brain,

306
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,860
and immediately accrue all of the attributes of the person.

307
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,080
Imagine the same way he had described the cannibals getting the heart of the victim.

308
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:25,720
That's right.

309
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:32,960
And CEO Dobbs has decided that if we can work this formula into the hamburgers in his new

310
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,140
franchise chain...

311
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,800
Perhaps we just pat it in like we could use some spices.

312
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:42,900
The first burger god, hunger raper they're called, will be given away free.

313
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,600
Free to each customer.

314
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,340
And once they have that first one, we know that they'll come back for more Dave brain

315
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,400
tainted meat.

316
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,940
Ravaged by hunger.

317
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,020
That's good.

318
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,160
That's a good brain.

319
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,460
The problem with this brain is the convolutions are completely useless.

320
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,520
There's no information carried in this brain.

321
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,140
It seems to be some sort of sieve or some sort of...

322
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,320
That's not what's at issue here.

323
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,340
It fits on a bun.

324
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,920
That's all that counts.

325
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,660
It weighs...

326
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,300
Half an ounce.

327
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,320
Morty, think of it this way.

328
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:15,720
And it sits on a bun.

329
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,060
That's right.

330
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,780
It sits on a bun.

331
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,700
And it's 350 for the quarter pounder.

332
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:19,920
350.

333
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,220
I mean, we don't care if it doesn't really...

334
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,680
If it's not really a brain.

335
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,680
We don't care if it's not...

336
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,200
It works.

337
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,500
Look at how well it sits on the steam table here.

338
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,600
They eat it and they achieve the consciousness level of Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

339
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,080
It's cheaper than lobotomies.

340
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,900
It's cheaper than hypnosis.

341
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,480
It's certainly cheaper than trepanation.

342
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,880
And as you can see, I mean, as in my case, the trepanation is...

343
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,100
Trepanation scars never heal completely.

344
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,380
Oh my God.

345
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,800
Everybody can tell I've had one.

346
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,540
It's so relaxing.

347
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,140
I mean, it was cool back in the 90s.

348
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,440
You know, you drill your skull, see the light, hear the echoes, you know, think like Dave.

349
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,240
And...

350
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,000
But now, I mean, you know, people look at you and go, well, I see you've got a trepanation

351
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,340
scar.

352
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,120
You must have been real cool in the 90s.

353
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,180
Yeah, that's no good when you get busted with a trepanation scar.

354
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,460
Yeah, they can tell.

355
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,420
Yeah, they just take a look at you and that's it.

356
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,860
No job.

357
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,460
You know, you can't even really apply for ADC or anything.

358
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,060
Yeah, they put up...

359
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,740
I mean, you're on medication too, you know, and it's like...

360
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,080
And you usually are.

361
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm trying to explain to them.

362
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Yeah, well, but not because of the church and subgenius or anything.

363
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,860
Like, because, you know, so that's, you know, and I just...

364
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,660
Yeah, I mean, half the teenagers in town, I mean, all the Nine Inch Nails fans have

365
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,340
to go out and do the drill thing on their head.

366
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,020
Well, I mean, you know, like there's a lot of people walking around with scars on their

367
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,020
skulls, you know, big, big holes in their skulls and what kind of, you know, what are

368
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,980
they getting out of this society?

369
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,160
I mean, people think like they don't exist.

370
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,660
What kind of children are we raising?

371
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,380
Children, I mean...

372
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,860
When our high schools have to have metal detectors at the door to get them out of the

373
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,640
house, to keep the kids from bringing their Black & Decker drills in.

374
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,820
I know it's getting so far out of hand, you know, like some principals on the Near East

375
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,940
side have actually, and after installing, you know, they find a trepanation scar on

376
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,040
a person's head or a piece of a drill bit on their skull.

377
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,220
They're out of there.

378
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:06,200
In Dallas, Dallas school, I walked in to talk to the kids about drugs and drills and...

379
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,160
That's where I go looking for drugs too.

380
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,160
Exactly.

381
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,860
And there was a child, there was a fifth grader sitting there with a fresh, hot, black, black

382
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,720
hole in his head and a trickle of blood running down the side of his nose with a blank stare

383
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,640
in his eye, quoting Lonesome Cowboy Dave, sitting there right in the middle of English.

384
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,220
He'd obviously gone to the boys' restroom and, like in my day, we might go in there

385
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,600
and smoke a cigarette or something.

386
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,380
Now they go in, plug, take their power drill with that, they run on batteries and their

387
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,520
beepers and their internet and they drill that hole and if they're not high enough from

388
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,400
the first one, that means, well, drill a new one.

389
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,460
Make it a little deeper.

390
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,480
Use a gauge four drill instead of a gauge three.

391
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,940
I say one shunt and they should be suspended for six weeks straight.

392
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,000
I knew this dude.

393
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,120
One shunt and no more hunt.

394
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,160
One shunt and no more hunt.

395
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,300
You have found everything you need.

396
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,040
Some people merely blow off the top of their skull entirely.

397
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,400
Those are hipper than thou.

398
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,860
Yeah, the ones who take the whole front half of their skull off.

399
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,620
Up down to the eyes.

400
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,640
Oh yeah, they're so cool.

401
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,480
Yeah, they're like that.

402
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,700
Yeah, same way, you know, wearing black.

403
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,700
That's the only way they can be cool.

404
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,760
Same way wearing black, you know, all black and everything and their brains exposed and

405
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:22,800
stuck in a...

406
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,540
Yeah, they always have the little stud on their neck like Frankenstein's master.

407
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,300
Yeah, like it's supposed to really do something for you, you know, like I really carry that.

408
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,640
Yeah, if you see the ones with the, like, they get their left hand and right hand switched.

409
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,840
Or some have the hand of the gorilla.

410
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,680
You know what works very good, you know, they're real weak and kind of numb after that.

411
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,400
I only see gorilla hands.

412
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,220
And they're into it. They like to walk up to normals and shake hands, you know.

413
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,180
With the big clammy gorilla hands and the normal...

414
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:54,480
Yeah, let's get down. Let's cut the hole out of the front of my skull and achieve enlightenment.

415
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,460
It's the new cool thing. It's the way to get high, baby.

416
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,080
Are you... What's the matter, you fray? Come on. The drill doesn't hurt.

417
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,900
Put some Dr. Bronner's on it first.

418
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,880
Make love to the drill.

419
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,840
Bob's into it, man.

420
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,620
Become one with the drill.

421
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,660
It's God's approved.

422
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,500
Yeah, you'll love the way it sounds. It, like, echoes across your skull when it's going in.

423
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,660
It's I-1 drill.

424
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,960
It's like stereo.

425
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:25,860
I found the drill last week and in two months I made seven million dollars.

426
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,800
The drill is your friend.

427
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,620
Open yourself to the drill.

428
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,620
Let the drill open you to everything else.

429
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,380
Have you ever sat on a beach and imagined you were actually there?

430
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,600
You were actually doing a radio show while you were in a striped jacket?

431
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,540
You will.

432
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:55,340
Have you ever imagined yourself locked in a bathroom, crying, eating urine-stained cake?

433
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,620
Crying on your birthday?

434
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,160
Did you ever have a dog?

435
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:10,100
I had a great job down there at the Cosmere Blaze factory, but then the silent ease came in.

436
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,560
They laid us all off.

437
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,460
Dobbs, when are you going to do something about this invasion of our shores?

438
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,400
Sign a Patreon.

439
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:25,800
Bob, I'd like to say something about all them damn foreigners coming around here and taking up all the jobs.

440
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,040
You're so boring when I think of you.

441
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,480
You're doing nothing to my history.

442
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,520
My doctor's no fun.

443
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,060
Who cares of the pills?

444
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,860
And about those kids?

445
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,800
Give or give.

446
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,840
I can't care more about you.

447
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,920
Can't care more about you.

448
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,940
Can't care more about you.

449
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:00,020
When I woke up this morning, I was bored.

450
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,900
When I woke up this morning, I was bored.

451
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,920
When I woke up in the afternoon, I was really bored.

452
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,780
When I woke up in the afternoon, I was really bored.

453
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,740
guitar solo

454
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,760
guitar solo

455
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,500
guitar solo

456
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,120
guitar solo

457
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,820
guitar solo

458
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,760
guitar solo

459
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,980
guitar solo

460
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,760
guitar solo

461
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,340
guitar solo

462
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,780
When he catches the buzz

463
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,280
With his mind all askew

464
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,760
He delivers the word

465
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,700
From his own point of view

466
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,960
He drove a Cadillac

467
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,740
He drove a Cadillac

468
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,920
He drove a Cadillac

469
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:47,760
He drove a Cadillac

470
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,720
And I want you to get that pencil ready now.

471
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:55,140
That's iBob Digital at P.O. Box 3405.

472
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,520
That's Box 3405, Skokie, Illinois.

473
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,740
6-00-7-6

474
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,560
Listen to the sounds in this room.

475
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,760
Listen to the sounds in this room.

476
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,500
Just me and the hiss.

477
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:22,500


478
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,060
And the tapes.

479
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,800
The tapes, yes.

480
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,120
And the clicks.

481
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,240
The loud clicks.

482
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,380
And all this Dave brain.

483
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,340
All this Dave brain laying around here.

484
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
We've got to do something with it.

485
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,240
I'm sorry, friends.

486
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,220
I heard from one person who said,

487
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,440
I'm not that crazy about Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

488
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,540
But,

489
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:56,780
I don't care don't care don't care don't care don't care don't care no sir we're

490
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:04,200
gonna go right back to it we have to because it's there and and Nenslo and

491
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,440
the evil and the good we can never leave

492
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,760
you

493
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,380
Oh

494
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,920
Oh

495
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,920
Oh

496
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,200
Oh

497
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,960
Oh

498
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:17,660
Oh

499
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,880
Wow

500
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:25,640
oh

501
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,460
I

502
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,520
Oh

503
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:54,800
I am afraid of this person, but Mr. Priest, I must tell you that this constant masturbation and these pictures of Bob Roberto Daz are ridiculous.

504
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,940
It will ruin you.

505
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,800
These Fellini movies are weird. I don't really understand them.

506
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,660
Never mind. Just think of the saints.

507
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,140
Free your mind of all these evil parts of art and vernicities.

508
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,380
Think nothing of these things. Think of the saints.

509
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Like Bob Daz and vernicities, yes?

510
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,220
Yes, Saint Bob.

511
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,500
The patron saint of money and slap.

512
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,740
And no need to make fun of his bristling countenance.

513
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,060
He was quite a man in his time.

514
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,200
Did you know that Bob actually seduced every woman in Napoli in two nights?

515
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,480
But he loved every woman in Napoli.

516
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:43,000
Not once was the act debased by lust or science or reason.

517
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,500
No, Bob loved them.

518
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,540
And he said,

519
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,520
I loved all of them.

520
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,760
I loved also all the animals of Naples.

521
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,760
I loved the chickens.

522
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,540
I loved the prairie squids.

523
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,720
I loved them all and not once was the act defiled by logic or reason.

524
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,160
I loved the calamari.

525
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:10,100
I sexed the Italian breast-eating baboon.

526
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,060
I loved them all.

527
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,540
No, no, no.

528
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,320
You must put these things in the menu.

529
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,520
And animals have...

530
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,420
They have the Buddha nature, Bob said.

531
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,100
They would love you back if you loved them.

532
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,000
Except for chickens.

533
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,240
He said, chickens will not return your love.

534
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,920
I love chickens.

535
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,040
I've heard my love returned by chicken.

536
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:40,280
Did you ever buy a bucket of chicken liver and twelve pack of beer and watch TV and do dry balls, fell out and then go hunting?

537
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,300
Yeah.

538
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,620
Hell, we all do that where I come from.

539
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,360
That's how chickens return your love.

540
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,800
I don't like people that don't do that.

541
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,520
Where I come from, I don't like them.

542
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,320
We don't like people who don't do that with chickens.

543
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,300
I mean, you might as well just back your cart off of my green.

544
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,580
If you think you're the kind of golfer that ain't gonna do that with chickens.

545
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,800
We eat them.

546
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,020
We eat them.

547
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,140
We blow smoke in them.

548
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:04,480
Afterwards.

549
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,560
And then we stand up and sing the Yellow Rose of Texas, Betty.

550
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,360
Hell, we smoke a chicken.

551
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,400
You better believe it.

552
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,400
Yeah, I mean...

553
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,420
We don't even wring their necks first.

554
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,640
We just stuff them right in the pipe and light up.

555
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,120
Smoke your damn chicken.

556
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,040
You'll be clucking around going,

557
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,460
McCall!

558
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,000
McCall!

559
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:21,660
McCall!

560
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,340
Where do you think Jack Nicholson got that routine, man?

561
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,040
He and Dobbs used to party out in Hollywood.

562
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,560
Jack Nicholson and Dobbs.

563
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:28,920
They had...

564
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,180
They cost them a lot of money one time to keep from going to jail.

565
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:39,120
Yeah, I remember that one time Bob and Nicholson attacked the paparazzi when they were at that Lakers game.

566
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,140
And they had them three transsexual babes with them.

567
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,240
And...

568
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,580
But Dobbs said he didn't know.

569
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,080
Well, he never said he didn't know, did he?

570
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,220
Or he didn't know him.

571
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,140
Well, that's an easy way to...

572
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,780
He said it was kind of dry.

573
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:59,360
Yeah, well, it's always dry when you've removed the patchy skin parts and replaced it with the extraneous noodle parts.

574
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:05,880
Oh, but you won't need any of those organs anymore once you get your modem online and get hooked up to the internet.

575
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,720
You can forget your body.

576
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,580
You can forget food, sex.

577
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,680
None of that will matter.

578
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,640
You just...

579
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,100
They'll have a chip.

580
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,900
They'll have a chip that goes straight into your brain and as you turn it...

581
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,540
If you turn it...

582
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,200
If you push...

583
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,940
Push setting number 96, okay?

584
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,540
See, it made his left arm flop.

585
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,060
Now, push 97.

586
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,780
See, it made his left foot flop.

587
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,100
Okay, then I can animate the...

588
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,160
Now, push 90...

589
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,960
No, wait a minute.

590
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,420
Let me see it.

591
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:30,760
86.

592
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,820
Push 86.

593
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,200
Do you smell roses?

594
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,880
Yeah, I can smell roses.

595
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,220
No.

596
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,580
What it does is it uses ultrasonics through the headphones to squeeze a little part of your brain.

597
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,080
And you can change which part.

598
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,300
It will agitate.

599
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,180
It's like a microwave, really.

600
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:46,800
It's like a little...

601
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,660
This beats the trepanation all to hell.

602
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,800
It's like a microwave.

603
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,540
It just slightly microwaves portions of your brain.

604
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,460
It can be selective, you know, left, right, front, and back, and so forth.

605
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:02,860
And it's got number 100 is the pleasure center stimulator.

606
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,780
Go ahead and push that 100.

607
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,220
And it's not bad, is it?

608
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,580
Now, turn it off.

609
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,920
Try turning it off.

610
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,060
Oh, it's not bad.

611
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,060


612
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,060


613
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,060


614
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,060


615
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,060


616
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,060


617
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,060


618
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,060


619
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,060


620
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,060


621
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,060


622
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,340
No.

623
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,160
Yeah, it kind of gets a bit...

624
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,800
Oh, it didn't want to leave it off for long, folks.

625
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,440
It's got that pleasure center stimulator going.

626
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,460
He's got it turned all the way up to 10.

627
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,220
And now he's got to spend all the time reading the clock.

628
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,920
He finds one that goes up to 11.

629
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,420
That's virtual reality for you, man.

630
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,920
That's where it's all going.

631
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,680
This world's falling apart.

632
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,260
It's going to slide in all directions.

633
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,040
It's going to slide in all directions.

634
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,040


635
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,040


636
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,040


637
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,420
Give me back the Berlin Wall

638
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,980
It's gonna be Dobbs and St. Paul

639
00:38:49,980 --> 00:39:03,640
Oh, yes, I can feel the spirit

640
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,320
It's piling up

641
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,240
It's about washing up the back of Dave's teeth now

642
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,100
It's gonna spill over any minute

643
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,020
He's so full of the slack

644
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,660
It's lapping at his lower lip

645
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:32,460
If he leans forward, the slack will come oozing, floating out of his mouth

646
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,680
Like ectoplasm out of a trance medium

647
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,800
But it ain't no spirit of the dead, friends

648
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,440
It's the pure essence of slack

649
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,220
Love's like a fire in the air

650
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:41,220


651
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,760
It's the poison cowboy Dave's slack

652
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:51,280
Forming in its ectoplasmatic manifestory existence

653
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,780
Hovering in front of his face here in the studio like a green cloud

654
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,300
And it's forming into the shape of whatever he's thinking about

655
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,920
Which is...

656
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,480
Oh, it's Chelsea from that new Rave magazine

657
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
I recognize that pose

658
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,300
He's thinking of the cover

659
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:10,980
Weird

660
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,680
Happy to serve you

661
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:20,120
Uh, now it's just painting a cloud of slack in the shape of a naked girl

662
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,340
And it's pretty...

663
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:25,080
Dave, that's not exactly, like, sophisticated or PC

664
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,560
But it's honest, friends

665
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,820
And that's what happens

666
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,200
He hit up on that chicken

667
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,100
I mean, he hit...

668
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,680
He had a hit of the chicken

669
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,160
And the splat...

670
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,400
The slack splashed out

671
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,220
In the form of whatever he was thinking about it

672
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:41,420
And he was thinking about it

673
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,200
He...

674
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,240
He was...

675
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,840
Dave was in Dobstown for six months

676
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,560
Learning just that one trick

677
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,300
Now, anything I think of for long enough time

678
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,600
Using the alien machinery

679
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,440
Which doesn't really exist as machinery

680
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,460
I can will into existence

681
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,940
Any kind of dog-voiced, face-boy or miscreant vehicle

682
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,460
Or three-wheel bike to wheel around the block

683
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,420
And sleep in a dumpster

684
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,220
Friends, I'm...

685
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:11,440
I'm...

686
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:11,440


687
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,840
But we just saw a series of images form outside of Dave's head

688
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,660
It ended with a tricycle

689
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,320
I noticed he went through a whole bunch of things

690
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,680
There was a picture of Jojo the dog-faced boy

691
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,500
Old, you know, turn of the century photograph

692
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,260
There was, uh...

693
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,240
That picture of Kool-Aid with the face drawn on it

694
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,040
I don't think he even mentioned that one

695
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,440
It's a stream of consciousness visualizing

696
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,420
Externally...

697
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,480
Uh...

698
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,220
Well, it causes the hallucination of...

699
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:41,220


700
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:41,220


701
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,120
to be externalized is what the catalog says.

702
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,240
And you're saying that the illusions are formed in the mind of the individual,

703
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,240
then they're made concrete?

704
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,640
And then they're, well, they're not concrete.

705
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,740
They're just an image like a hologram that forms outside the head,

706
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,840
but you can't photograph it.

707
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,940
Other people can see it, but only, like we've done experiments,

708
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,140
dogs can't see it, you can't photograph it,

709
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,200
but other people will see it because it's on that etheric level.

710
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,940
The slack itself is invisible to the normals.

711
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,460
To the subgeniuses, we're floating in a sea of slack.

712
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,340
We're floating in a sea of pills, for that matter,

713
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,220
but you're just too blind, deaf, and dumb to stick your tongue out

714
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,660
and just chaw down on them.

715
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,500
You're floating in a sea of slack, my friends,

716
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,360
but I'll tell you something about slack.

717
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,720
If slack was water, Bob Dobbs would be surfing,

718
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,440
but you'd be drowning.

719
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,480
Mmm. Mmm.

720
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,580
There it goes, leaking out of Dave's mouth and nose again.

721
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,640
He's all filled up with that slack.

722
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,520
He's got that special trepanated brow.

723
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,820
He took out a hole about the size of a quarter

724
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,680
out of the front of his skull.

725
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:02,320
Didn't even bother to transplant some skin over it or sew it back.

726
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,340
It's just the corpus corallosum is exposed.

727
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,200
Supreme serenity. Supreme serenity.

728
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,060
He sees Bobby.

729
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,420
Even when Bob ain't there.

730
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,560
Supreme serenity.

731
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,040
And you know, friends, God is everything,

732
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,000
but Bob has already been everything else.

733
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,440
All the kids in my neighborhood look like Bob Dobbs.

734
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,160
All the kids in my neighborhood smoke pipes.

735
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,000
All the kids in my neighborhood are proud to be Bob Dobbs.

736
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,960
And if they ain't Bob Dobbs, they die.

737
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,080
We kill them.

738
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:37,940
Kill them.

739
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:38,300
Kill them.

740
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,140
I'm gonna kill them.

741
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:39,920
Kill them dead.

742
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,620
And if they are Bob Dobbs,

743
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,520
We kill them.

744
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,720
We kill them dead.

745
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,640
You're Bob Dobbs, aren't you?

746
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:47,540
You're Bob Dobbs too, aren't you?

747
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm gonna kill you.

748
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,000
I'm gonna kill you first.

749
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,740
You ain't gonna kill me until I get up to you.

750
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,960
Boy, I like this church.

751
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,300
Everybody turns into Bob Dobbs, and they can all sit in the pews and be exactly alike.

752
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,700
And if anybody's different, then they can hate them.

753
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,360
Hate them. Hate them. Hate. Hate. Hate.

754
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,820
Oh, I loves to hate.

755
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,740
I hate Bobby.

756
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,240
But he comes by me, hating fair and square.

757
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,000
I hate Bobby.

758
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,340
He, he...

759
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,180
Hrrrrr...

760
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,100
Hrr...

761
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:10,660
Hrr...

762
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,780
Hrrr...

763
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:16,360
On the good ship Dobbs, sailing the seas of slack,

764
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:22,540
pirating and looting the pig-carpet haters out there.

765
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,020
Looting them on the information highway as well.

766
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:26,600
Our...

767
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:31,260
The Spanish Marine Army, just lootin. Lootin.

768
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:36,840
We pull our corsairs up to their modems and climb right aboard.

769
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:44,140
We created an interactive CD-ROM game that hooks your checkbook account up to the internet.

770
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:49,860
Every minute you spend shooting those funny Dobbs figures rushing at you down that corridor,

771
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:56,560
every penny, a penny a second, goes straight to the home for slackless children.

772
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,980
Dear friends, look at this little child here.

773
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,520
He's not allowed to play at home with his human parents.

774
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:12,240
This child wasn't allowed to play with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, He-Man, Transformers, or Playboy magazines.

775
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,000
No, that's right, Ivan. This child wasn't even allowed to play with himself.

776
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,940
This child was severely deprived.

777
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,100
Doesn't that just make your heart bleed?

778
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,340
Doesn't that just make tears well up in your eyes to think these poor little...

779
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,740
These children may have the subgenius gene.

780
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,000
It could be triggered by exposure to enough...

781
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,120
Well, let's just call it information.

782
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,640
Information. Pornological Irritainment, we call it.

783
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:43,300
And, uh, it's... you know, it's... it's the... it's something you can do with that excess money.

784
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,840
The government's just gonna take it.

785
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:52,480
The government should... do you want to give it to the government so they can spend more on socialized highway building, bridge... bridge building?

786
00:45:53,420 --> 00:46:00,940
You wanna... you wanna just let the government take all you... or... will you... you know, if it has to be gone anyway, give it to the home for slackless children.

787
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,120
Dobbstown, Malaysia.

788
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,520
Tax exempt.

789
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,160
These children aren't going to cry very much longer, are they, Ivan?

790
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:14,740
These children are going straight away to that home and... and perhaps find themselves in some sort of non-mystical, non-experiential way.

791
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,840
Or perhaps they don't even really exist, do they?

792
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,720
We don't make those kids memorize boring religious passages.

793
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,440
We give them video games.

794
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:29,460
We give them Wolfenstein 3.0 in 3D.

795
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,100
We... we give them arm wrestling.

796
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,640
We give them the complete G.I. Joe set.

797
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,500
We give them Barbie... Barbie's Dream House, Barbie's Dream Kitchen.

798
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:46,640
And... but, of course, you know, we don't want to train those little... little girls to be... to grow up to be pink girls.

799
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,640
We want them to be subgenius girls.

800
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,340
And it's all in virtual reality, isn't it, Reverend?

801
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:55,700
That's right. So that's why we change those Barbie dolls before we give them to the girls.

802
00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:01,160
We... we make them... we kind of morph them between a Barbie and the Star Wars characters.

803
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,300
Now, when the ectoplasm comes out of...

804
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,040
Gives them more character.

805
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,740
Yes, but when the ectoplasm comes out of their mouths, doesn't that... wouldn't it ruin a Barbie set?

806
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:19,960
Oh, but when you see a room full of kindergarten-age children with green slactoplasm oozing out of their nostrils, ears, and mouths...

807
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,100
Baiting their nostrils.

808
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,640
Their eyes rolled back in ecstasy...

809
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,380
Tirading their mouth.

810
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,160
Forgetting their evil conspiracy toilet training forever...

811
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:28,800
Doing their bank statements.

812
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,160
Chewing on their pencils...

813
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,220
We encourage them to chew on their pencils.

814
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,680
We encourage them to break their crayons into millions of bits.

815
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:42,140
We encourage them to pick on each other, gang up and bully each other, and ostracize members.

816
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,600
We want them to learn the way things are in the real world.

817
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,900
Where they can do anything, but they're gonna have to pay the price.

818
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,900
You know? It's the school of hard knocks.

819
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:59,700
If more kids were raised in the school of hard knocks, I don't think America would be where it is today.

820
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,920
That's right, Reverend.

821
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:04,880
I think the school of hard knocks would knock some sense into these kids' heads.

822
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,560
Beat them all.

823
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:16,440
They'd quit huffing paint and Dave Brain, drilling holes in their heads and hooking internet superhighways in one ear and out the other.

824
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:22,240
Why, friends, I think if you just give your money to Home for Slackless Children, we could turn America around.

825
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,560
We could charge you with that.

826
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:29,880
We could string up normals from trees like they've been doing to weirdos for years and years.

827
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,600
For centuries. For a thousand.

828
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,880
You know who built the pyramids?

829
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,420
We did.

830
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,340
Well, no, well, no. Actually, a bunch of stupid, normal religious fanatics.

831
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:38,740


832
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,460
But you know who designed the pyramids?

833
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:40,840
We did.

834
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:41,620
We did.

835
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:51,500
We stood there and said, you know, we'd love to be hauling those 4,000 ton rocks up that slope with you men, but they need us here.

836
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,800
Telling the king that the gods want this pyramid built.

837
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,100
Yeah, now look here. See, Pharaoh, what we got here.

838
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,400
We got the junction of Mars and Venus in the constellation Cygnus.

839
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,080
Both at Ra are in junction.

840
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,420
Isis and Osiris are about to collide.

841
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,240
Right, right. And you know when the river starts flooding, you know what's gonna happen with Asakoth or, I mean, Osiris.

842
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:21,200
That's right. So the gods will kill us if we don't make all the dupes build the pyramid.

843
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,000
Make the dupes build the pyramids in the name of the gods.

844
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,240
But who will design this pyramid? Will you, the subgenius high priest, design the pyramid?

845
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:28,440
Slack.

846
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,720
No, we will get this talented normal to do the actual math.

847
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,580
We will pay him four tamarins, three beets, and a donut.

848
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:45,700
But we know it wants to be gold. The gods want it to be covered with gold and it has to look like that thing that the humans would use on their dollar bills, but without the eye.

849
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:52,700
Mmm, the mighty pyramid. The symbol of the equilibrium between the controller and the controlled.

850
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,080
It's a bloodshot eye.

851
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:07,700
As long as somebody's wielding the whip, somebody else is gonna walk out and say, whip me. Come on, whip me.

852
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,960
I mean, which one would you rather be, my friend?

853
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:19,700
You wanna be that whooped human feeling the sting of that master's whip? Or do you wanna be one of the masters?

854
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:25,960
Or do you wanna be the parasite that lives off those evil masters and those stupid dudes?

855
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:26,940
I wanna be a parasite.

856
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,060
There you go, kids. Now you're stupid.

857
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:38,940
What are you thinking? Like the mighty tick, which kills, does not, the predator kills the prey, but the parasite kills neither.

858
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,480
It torments.

859
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:49,000
It torments all equally. And we, the subgeniuses, are the parasites, the ticks upon the body politic.

860
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,740
A politic.

861
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,500
We made a joke on it.

862
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:58,300
Anyway, seriously though, to continue in a more serious vein.

863
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,980
In that the body politic is made of a vermin, shouldn't it be?

864
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:08,980
We may be called, they, sure, they call us vermin. They, they, and they consider that an insult.

865
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,240
Spermin vermin?

866
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,120
To us, that's a compliment.

867
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,600
Yes, the highest. Well, not the highest. One of the third, well, maybe the fifth highest compliment.

868
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:28,280
And in faith, we march these children down the hill out of the home for slackless children and out to the fields where they learn slack work with little tape decks around their heads.

869
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,960
And they're next listening to this show and picking, uh, soya beans, cotton, and so forth.

870
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:34,920
Oh, it's beautiful.

871
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,140
It's lovely.

872
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:36,540
Just beautiful.

873
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:41,440
They are taught, they are taught, uh, the slack yoga of service.

874
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:42,940
They learn work.

875
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,320
You see?

876
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,020
As slack.

877
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:52,220
Great idea, huh? That was, that was one of Dobbs' most brilliant, it was sort of like passive resistance, you know? It was, right! So, uh.

878
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,260
A brilliant thinker. Better than L. Ron Hubbard, I must say. Much, much more, well, it's, well, yeah.

879
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:58,260


880
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,580
He has a square face, I think.

881
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,980
L. Ron was a sex god, man.

882
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,440
Well, nobody competes with Bob, I don't know.

883
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:15,440
Oh, no, well, needless to say, you know, you know there's a, a story, possibly apocryphal, that when the last time Bob was sent to hell, that he cuckolded the devil.

884
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,740
I've heard that story.

885
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,760
Yes, that he was even a better tempter than the devil.

886
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,480
And he cheated, too, it comes to him.

887
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,400
And he put, he put two boar horns on the devil, you might say.

888
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:24,820
Oh, my God.

889
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:25,660
Yes.

890
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:26,060
Okay.

891
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:31,360
And Satan cast Bob from hell, and since he was never baptized, he can't go to heaven.

892
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,280
So, he's back on earth, he can try to kill him.

893
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,180
Hell, we did, we were the first ones to try.

894
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,120
You may hate this Bob stuff, right?

895
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,840
You don't think that occurred to us, too?

896
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,960
Oh, we tried to get out, we tried to get out back in 84.

897
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:49,420
But, yeah, go ahead, blow him away, put ten bullets through Bob's head.

898
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:53,580
He's gonna come like a cartoon character there, he'll be again grinning at you.

899
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,240
It never stops.

900
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,660
It never stops.

901
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,640
He just can't stop.

902
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,360
My mind always hurts.

903
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,140
It is painful.

904
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,820
It is very painful.

905
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,160
And he, he just won't ever die, will he?

906
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,360
He just keeps coming back and coming back.

907
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,000
It's, it's phenomenal.

908
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,700
It's kind of like the song, well, we have a song about Bob called The Song That Refused

909
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,420
to Die.

910
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,540
Should we sing it or not?

911
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,940
We've been singing it for the last hour and a half, Dave.

912
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,260
It won't go away, either, will it?

913
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:24,660
No, you can't, it's, you know, the, the ironic thing is the song, in a way, it wants to

914
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:24,920
die.

915
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:25,220
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

916
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:25,540
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's anonymously responding to his 수도

917
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:25,540


918
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:25,540


919
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:25,540


920
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:25,540


921
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:25,560
But it, but it cannot die.

922
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,240
But it, but it cannot die.

923
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:34,280
It just, it crawls on fitfully sometimes it picks up and really cooks and people go,

924
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:34,820
okay, it's good.

925
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,540
And, and it's gonna be over you know, and it might be over for a little while, but,

926
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:42,040
oh no, it picks up again.

927
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,940
Just like a mighty steak.

928
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,880
Like a, a patient on an operating table dying and he gets zapped.

929
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:46,880


930
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,820
You know, you die and then you, you zap it.

931
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,280
Because.

932
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,220
It fights.

933
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:54,180
The guitar player might die, but some other guitar player will come along.

934
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:54,640
That's right.

935
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,880
The drummer might die.

936
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,440
Some other drummers.

937
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:03,540
Or else a car that just blew a tire, the wheel flapping will be the percussion for the song.

938
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,060
That's right.

939
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:04,980
That's the way we play it.

940
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,360
That refused to die.

941
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,040
And, you know, the audience has changed a million times.

942
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,540
You know, they went away.

943
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,380
I remember when you were a pig.

944
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,540
There's always more.

945
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:14,360
Very, very tall.

946
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:14,900
I remember.

947
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:15,340
I love that.

948
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,480
There's always some sort of audience.

949
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,740
And they may flee the song.

950
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,720
They may try to kill.

951
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,320
They tried years ago, back in the 50s, they tried nuclear weapons on the bomb.

952
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,100
Bullets could not stop it.

953
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,520
Flamethrowers, paper cuts, nothing.

954
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:32,460
Nothing.

955
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,360
No cosmetic is ever going to erase.

956
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,920
It would get real ugly.

957
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,440
It would get real damn ugly and it would grow 50 feet tall.

958
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,980
You know, it was like the more you tried to kill the song that refused to die,

959
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,960
the louder and meaner and more horrible it would get.

960
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,920
The survival mechanism.

961
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:49,720
Mechanism.

962
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:50,780
Monkesson.

963
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,840
It was an artificial intelligence of its own.

964
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:55,880
Of its own kind.

965
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,220
Yeah.

966
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,920
You'd think it was all petered out.

967
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,360
Uh-huh.

968
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:59,260
Oh, yeah.

969
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,700
But it would...

970
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,780
Peter on.

971
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,420
Yes.

972
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,360
Peter's out or Peter's in.

973
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:10,060
It would rise from its deathbed like a vampire.

974
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,940
And spring into erect awareness.

975
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,760
More musicians would be drawn in.

976
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,980
And it would sap the life force out of them.

977
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,060
Like a glowing...

978
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:20,440
A bolt.

979
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,240
A bolt away.

980
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:21,740
People...

981
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:25,320
The song itself tried to warn people about the song.

982
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:29,880
I mean, part of the lyrics of the song were about how dangerous the song was.

983
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:30,420
We warned them.

984
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:30,760
We did.

985
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:31,740
We actually warned them.

986
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,680
It begged its listeners to kill it.

987
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,580
It begged for them to kill it.

988
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,880
But when they killed it, it refused to die.

989
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,500
They tried to kill it.

990
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,980
You could not kill the song.

991
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,680
The song couldn't commit suicide.

992
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,040
They refused.

993
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:50,200
They refused.

994
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,020
They refused to die.

995
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:51,620
To die.

996
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:51,920
To die.

997
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:57,920
The song was just an overlapping rhythmic notation in the back of his head.

998
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,920
Oh, sometimes it wasn't music at all.

999
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,680
Sometimes it was an earthquake in San Francisco.

1000
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:08,780
Sometimes it was a toxic insecticide spill in India.

1001
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:09,600
He remembered.

1002
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,200
Yeah.

1003
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:14,880
It might be a secret government cover-up one other month.

1004
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,820
But it was still basically the song that refused it.

1005
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,160
Sometimes it would be a radio show.

1006
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,880
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1007
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:28,160
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, send a self-addressed

1008
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,520
stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready?

1009
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:36,160
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1010
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,180
That's Bob, P.O.

1011
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:43,940
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1012
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,820
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1013
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,140
Give me back my love.

1014
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:49,140


1015
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:49,140


1016
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,460
The burning wall.

1017
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,980
Give me style.

1018
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,980
And say, Paul, I've seen the future, brother.

1019
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,940
It is murder.

1020
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,680
Things won't slide.

1021
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,100
Slide in all directions.

1022
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,600
Won't pay nothing.

1023
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,260
Won't be nothing.

1024
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:12,160
You can't measure anymore.

1025
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,320
The blizzard.

1026
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,480
The blizzard of the world.

1027
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,060
Cross the threshold.

1028
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,620
Always고

1029
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:20,620


1030
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:21,740
Everyone.

1031
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,780
healing.

1032
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,900
I'm.

1033
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,000
I'm painting.

1034
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,040
Repent.

1035
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,000
Repent.
