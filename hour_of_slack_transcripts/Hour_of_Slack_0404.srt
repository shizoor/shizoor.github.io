1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
This is real, isn't it?

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,460
I think so.

3
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:01,680
Real?

4
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,920
I'll check the tape later.

5
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:03,520
What?

6
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,320
Oh, there we go.

7
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,580
6-6-4, we're checking the park.

8
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,240
Alright, we're checking the park now.

9
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:07,720
Oh, really?

10
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,460
Is this a real police scanner or something? What is that?

11
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:10,920
Cool.

12
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,980
I think it's a show.

13
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,020
I'll check the tape later, that one isn't really sure.

14
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,580
...more, she's shot.

15
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,600
Oh, okay.

16
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,120
...from YouTube here on 11-3-6.

17
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:20,860
Okay.

18
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,520
Our communication system is not functioning properly.

19
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,380
Our transmissions are being blocked.

20
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,640
Oh!

21
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,020
Right.

22
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,320
Oh!

23
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,380
Right!

24
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,660
...more colors, more grams.

25
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,120
Like a runaway hologram or something.

26
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,240
It's very, very strange.

27
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,780
Are you afraid to die?

28
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,180
Are you afraid to die?

29
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,520
Uh-oh.

30
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,660
If you're smart, you'll make opportunities.

31
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,460
Hi, baby.

32
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,760
Some of this, maybe?

33
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:00,760
...you.

34
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,080
...in this world.

35
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,100
I hope that bus comes soon.

36
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,240
...this is all happening.

37
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,100
What?

38
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,520
What, you mean the show is-

39
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:13,960
No.

40
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:13,960


41
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,980
There are people listening, though.

42
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,760
I mean, it's really happening, it's not just telepathic.

43
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,500
Can you look carefully at him?

44
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,500
What, if I- okay, I'm looking and what do I-

45
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,460
What?

46
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,400
You're not here?

47
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:22,960
What?

48
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:23,940
You're not here?

49
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,360
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you from the psychotropic console.

50
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:29,980
I am?

51
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,120
Oh.

52
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,760
I thought I was doing-

53
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,500
What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.

54
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,660
Now what the hell is that-

55
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,200
You may call.

56
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:45,280
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slang.

57
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,820
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

58
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
A haven for the mongrel scum of the earth.

59
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,580
An engorged parasite on the underbelly of the West.

60
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,360
Ten thousand people dead.

61
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,780
Let's talk about love.

62
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,740
Love.

63
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,220
Love.

64
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,420
Love.

65
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,960
Love everything.

66
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,800
Love the creepy crawlies.

67
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,980
The spiders.

68
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,920
Love all of it.

69
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,540
You are beautiful.

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,560
You're beautiful.

71
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,440
than any dream of beauty I've ever known.

72
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,520
What is your point, Mr. Spock?

73
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,220
I love you.

74
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,880
Love!

75
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:37,860
Jake!

76
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,240
Love! Love!

77
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,560
There's one dark place that we have to be very careful in.

78
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,080
Do you know where that is?

79
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,180
Possible they might have hit the wrong entry point.

80
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,540
Yes.

81
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,960
If you'll excuse the intrusion, Captain.

82
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:53,460
Help!

83
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,660
Huh?

84
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,280
Calling the engineers.

85
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,880
They must rewire the transmitters and see that those reactors are giving enough voltage.

86
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,380
Yes, sir.

87
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:00,860
Wait!

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,380
First start the low frequency system.

89
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,060
Yes, sir.

90
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,180
Yeah!

91
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,220
B-b-b-bye-ya, dog!

92
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,180
B-b-b-bye-ya, dog!

93
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,400
Yeah!

94
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,580
B-b-b-bye-ya, dog!

95
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,720
Bad Joke Wednesday.

96
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,100
Not on my radio station.

97
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,780
We'll just go back to the music of Unibrow.

98
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,260
Making the world a better place.

99
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,420
Safe for your brain.

100
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,660
And mine.

101
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,360
Well, we suspect it's a domestic problem.

102
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,300
All right, all right.

103
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,000
Now let's be serious here.

104
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,760
I have arranged all this just to have a moment alone with you.

105
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,120
I prefer a naked microphone.

106
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,620
Come on.

107
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,200
Up to bed.

108
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,620
Here you are!

109
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,100
Here's the phone.

110
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,100


111
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,700
I'll cut you in half.

112
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,020
Forget about it for now.

113
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,080
Fuck!

114
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,080


115
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,080


116
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,500
Yes, sir.

117
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,300
I love you.

118
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,660
I love you, too.

119
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,560
Yeah!

120
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:20,100
No, don't forget that.

121
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,640
What are you hiding anything from me.

122
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,040
What?

123
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,840
He didn't get through it again.

124
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:24,840


125
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:24,840


126
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,260
I'll know when to say that before you take it back to me.

127
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,260


128
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,260


129
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,260


130
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,260


131
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,260


132
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,260


133
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,260


134
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:47,100
To join this man and these women and their Coca-Cola cans and brass, body parts, car keys and so forth in a temporary but no less virtuous bondage.

135
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes, a bondage. A bondage of life.

136
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,280
Holy matrimony. For better or for worse, but not for love.

137
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,320
Praise God.

138
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,760
Do you feel the spirit?

139
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,060
Everybody say praise God.

140
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,780
Praise God.

141
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,020
Okay, now put your hands on each other.

142
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,980
It's mostly, okay, ah, yes.

143
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,260
This is it.

144
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,040
This is a bond of some holy bloodlock.

145
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:38,900
So no matter what physical position these beloved may take in the next 24 hours, their moral standing will remain upright.

146
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:48,140
If there were any jealous losers here who feel these men, women, car keys, brass, body parts and so forth should not be joined temporarily,

147
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
even for me.

148
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,180
I'm here 24 hours.

149
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,100
Just hold your peace because we don't want to hear about it.

150
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,720
Okay, now hold your hands.

151
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,380
Let your hands on each other.

152
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,260
Hold real tight.

153
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,660
Before we proceed, has the preacher been paid?

154
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,400
You're the preacher.

155
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,600
Oh, yeah, more or less.

156
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,460
More or less, yes.

157
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,700
Paid in slack.

158
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,980
Do you insert name here?

159
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,100
Insert name here.

160
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,200
Take, okay, let's start with the, we'll do the.

161
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,000
Feminine.

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,700
The con.

163
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:19,720
Vex.

164
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,880
The male.

165
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,120
Oh, the yang.

166
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,940
We'll start with the.

167
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,340
The church yang.

168
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,680
The be-dick-ed.

169
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,020
The be-dick-ed or whatever.

170
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,840
Dominant.

171
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,100
Parcel.

172
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,420
Not necessarily.

173
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,140
Yeah.

174
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:31,920
Dominant.

175
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,320
A prod.

176
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,380
Yeah, well, we'll start with one side.

177
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,780
It could be the concave ones, too.

178
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,960
It's whoever is the main delivery.

179
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,040
Okay.

180
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,140
Dominant.

181
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,060
To, yeah, do you take these things to be your lawful wedded, quote, wife, unquote.

182
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,080
Not necessarily female.

183
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,160
In short duration, subgenius matrimony, to have and behold, in fact, to do just about anything.

184
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,160
Anything you want and hold.

185
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,200
As long as he or she agrees to it, or it agrees to it.

186
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:10,500
For richer or poorer, in sickness and kinkiness, through any hardship or disaster that may befall it or her or them or whatever in the next 24 hours.

187
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:18,340
For whatever sick and twisted but no less blessed reasons for the next 24 hours.

188
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,040
Say, I.

189
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:19,260


190
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,160
I.

191
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,660
Do.

192
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:24,920
What's wrong?

193
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,380
I don't win.

194
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,540
I trust you.

195
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,660
Okay, now get out your rings.

196
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,200
You do have your rings, don't you?

197
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,060
I got the rings on already.

198
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,140
Oh, she's got her ring.

199
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:44,880
Well, if you don't have a ring, form your handy sacred temple of, oh, there's a silly putty ring.

200
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,560
Low in the dark silly putty ring.

201
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,940
Or your handy temple of Devo.

202
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,400
As we call it.

203
00:07:51,600 --> 00:08:04,680
And we take this ring as a symbol of the holy estate of marriage and of the shackles, the girdable handcuffs of wedlock, as well as of the pole going deep into the hole.

204
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,920
Repeatedly.

205
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,580
Now, install the ring.

206
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,740
Wahoo!

207
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,360
Yes, baby!

208
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,460
All right.

209
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,420
were you stupid?

210
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,880
We should buy a new guest control Automated aquariums in mad размерsa.

211
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,120
I'minking, why didn't we just sayIC

212
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,200
through

213
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,880
Each year, Chun Sirius has a wide array of

214
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,060
這

215
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,560
What's this?

216
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,960
the Starwood

217
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,540
Festival. This particular

218
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,900
Starwood included

219
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,260
as guests Dr.

220
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,720
Timothy Leary, our old notorious

221
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,680
friend, as well

222
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,500
as Illuminatus

223
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,340
author Bob Shea

224
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,880
and really most spectacularly

225
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,280
of all

226
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,260
Jeff McBride

227
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,800
aka Magnus the Magician

228
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,360
whose magic show is so

229
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,660
cosmic

230
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,420
it really makes me wish this was

231
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,680
a cable TV show just for a week

232
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,800
so I could share that footage with you

233
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,400
and there's always lots of bands

234
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,300
and there's the endless zen

235
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,320
drumming and the dancing

236
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,500
around the bonfire and all the

237
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,260
but I don't want to sound

238
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,660
again like I'm bragging to all of you

239
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,440
stuck in your mundane world

240
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,800
about what a swinging time I had

241
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,400
so

242
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,380
but I did. In the background

243
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,280
I should mention

244
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,700
the background music is by

245
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,760
Zug's Rift and Joe Newman

246
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,140
I told you about what was

247
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,200
coming up on MTV

248
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,420
DK Jones and Huge Voodoo

249
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,240
and their poet friends were going to be on

250
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,800
MTV

251
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,700
Unplugged and they were

252
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,160
and this is

253
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,020
Maggie Estep

254
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,660
with Huge Voodoo

255
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,060
Actually friends I forgot there's a little instrumental piece here at the beginning

256
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,200
and it reminds me that

257
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,100
a Huge Voodoo in this case was joined for their MTV performance by

258
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,380
Brother Cleve Donut Duncan

259
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,160
yes or ah yes

260
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,280
that mighty, mighty gospel keyboard player

261
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,220
heard here in the background

262
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,120
Praise God

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,200

Applause

Applause

293
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,240
Patounts

294
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,240


295
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,740
The stupid jerk I'm obsessed with

296
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,720
stands so close to me

297
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,900
that I can feel his breath on my neck

298
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,040
and smell the way he would smell

299
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,440
if we slept together

300
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,960
because he is the stupid jerk I'm obsessed with

301
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,100
and that is his primary function in life

302
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,060
to be a stupid jerk I can obsess over

303
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,620
and to talk to that dingy bim-bim blonde

304
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,780
as if he really wanted to hear about her

305
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,060
manicures and pedicures

306
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,120
and new age ritualistic enema cures

307
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,660
and truth be known

308
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,220
he probably does want to hear about it

309
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,700
because he is the stupid jerk I'm obsessed with

310
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,040
and he is obsessed with doing anything he can

311
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,940
to lend fuel to my fire

312
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,840
he makes a point of standing

313
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,400
looking over my shoulder

314
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,080
when I'm talking to him

315
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,920
when I'm talking to the guy who adores me

316
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,440
and would bark like a dog

317
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,720
and wave to strangers

318
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,240
if I asked him to bark like a dog

319
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,380
and wave to strangers

320
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,680
but I wouldn't ask him to bark like a dog

321
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,480
or impersonate any kind of animal at all

322
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,780
because I'm too busy looking at the way

323
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,120
the stupid jerk I'm obsessed with

324
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,380
has pants on that perfectly define his well-shaped ass

325
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,200
to the point where I'm totally frantic

326
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm just gonna go home and stick my head in the oven

327
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,060
overdose on it

328
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,260
and not make an aspirin

329
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,140
and sit in the bathtub reading the executioner's song

330
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,740
and being completely confounded by the fact that I can see

331
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,040
the stupid jerk I'm obsessed with's face defining itself

332
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,360
in the peeling plaster of the wall

333
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,220
grinning and winging

334
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,600
and I start to yell

335
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,260
get the hell out of there

336
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,740
you're just a figment of my imagination

337
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:06,820
just get out of my plaster and pass me the next painful situation please

338
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,360
but he just keeps on grinning and winging

339
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,120
he's the stupid jerk I'm obsessed with

340
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,560
and he's mine in my plaster

341
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,560
and frankly I couldn't be happier

342
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,640
Maggie Estep dear friends

343
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,360
accompanied by huge voodoo

344
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,080
that's DK Jones, Bruce Grant

345
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,720
and in this case

346
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,580
Brother Cleve

347
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,180
Duncan

348
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,560
now

349
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,400
here's the little collector's song

350
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,360
this is last week

351
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,460
Willa Dobbs played a Star Trek edit

352
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,140
was it last week or the week before?

353
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,040
the week before

354
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,160
the amazing Captain's Log

355
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,500
and this is sort of a companion piece to this

356
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,480
to that

357
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:05,660
this is a song recorded at the Starwood event last week

358
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,440
a song by Reverend Vicki Ganger

359
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,620
unlike any other

360
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,860
this song grew out of a dream that I had

361
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,060
actually it was more like a nightmare for me

362
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,760
a dream of a sexual encounter

363
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,520
with a certain bald headed starship captain

364
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,640
and I'm not sure if that's true

365
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:35,640


366
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
now for some people that may not be a nightmare

367
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,140
there may be some women or men or aliens or things out there

368
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,060
that would find that like you know

369
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,500
an erotic adventure of some sort or another

370
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,040
I prefer my heads full as it were

371
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,680
but anyway I woke up in a cold sweat

372
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,040
and my muse decided to play tricks on me

373
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,840
because the song came through in kind of a

374
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,200
a grunge heavy metal punk sort of version

375
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,880
which I thought was highly amusing since I play acoustic guitar

376
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,280
so just kind of think of C.L. Grunge or something

377
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:24,540
it's called I Want to Be Jean-Luc's Love Slave

378
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,600
I don't know, give it a whirl

379
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,440
for real, and I said Let's Play

380
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,960
fond of The videos on my channel

381
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,460
First I watched at that far pretty

382
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,760

388
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:45,380
I want to be your love slave I want to be Picard's pet

389
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,260
When I see your hair gleam It just makes me want to scream

390
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,520
Is it real or just a dream? It's anti-matter

391
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,960
You're the only one I see Not that there's much choice for me

392
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,320
Cause George is blind And William Breit is getting fatter

393
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:20,400
I hear my captain's call All the writers on the wall

394
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,920
Oh, I want to be Jean-Luc's love slave I want to be Jean-Luc's love slave

Wanna be your love slave Wanna be your love slave

398
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,660
epic

399
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,120
Hello there Oh I want you to hear it

400
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,120


401
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,120


402
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,560
Want to be Jean-Luc's love slave

403
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:48,560


404
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,920
I want to be Your love slave

405
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:50,920


406
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,840
I want to be a peacock

407
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,420
Make it so number one

408
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,000
And gay

409
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,920
Now Warfie isn't much for chat

410
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,100
So I can really lay you flat

411
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,180
I think I've had enough of that

412
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,320
It's all so hazy

413
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,620
Well, David's got the proper heart

414
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,760
He's programmed in the pleasing art

415
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,880
Another man without a heart

416
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,840
You must be crazy

417
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,140
Oh, what more can I say?

418
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,280
I read you night and day

419
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,500
Won't you come and play?

420
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,740
Oh, I want to be

421
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,060
John Luke's slave

422
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,140
I want to be

423
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,800
John Luke's slave

424
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,940
In the shot of bed

425
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,480
But

426
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,160
And when we Gus

427
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,420
His locker

428
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,180
Blind

429
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,380
Won't you tell me

430
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:57,380


431
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:57,380


432
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:57,380


433
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,800
It's me baby.

434
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,720
Are they all my

435
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,120
Oh, I want to be

436
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,820
Als

437
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,740
All right?

438
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,760
Quicker

439
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,640
Start

440
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,620
Oh, I want to see

441
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,300
me all.

442
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,420
Yes, dear friends, Vicki Ganger and her good friend sister Melodious Chalk.

443
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,480
Enjoy the rest of the concert.

444
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,960
Coming up, a series of preachings from the Starwood Subgenius Devival.

445
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:52,140
I can't exactly remember the order I edited these in, but I believe we have Dr. Legume at first,

446
00:19:52,260 --> 00:20:00,500
and then Sister Mary Squared, au contraire, Reverend Velveteen Sly, and...

447
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:07,420
Is this a miracle? What kind of a miracle? Is this a parable? What's the point?

448
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,940
Is this a letter? What's the big idea? What's he trying to communicate?

449
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,620
My God's dead!

450
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,700
Sorry about yours!

451
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,820
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, it is done!

452
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,080
Amen and amen!

453
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,320
Praise Bob! Hell, Connie!

454
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,580
Uh-oh, friends, evil Dr. Legume is back!

455
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,760
The scariest!

456
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,440
What's the subgenius at the Starwood?

457
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,520
I'm here to talk about creationism.

458
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,360
Now, first of all, we have to take on a few of these Christian assumptions.

459
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,060
The first one is that God created the universe.

460
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,080
The second is that God created life on Earth in His image.

461
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,820
And the third is that dinosaurs were around long before us.

462
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,940
So the only thing I could come to the conclusion of is that...

463
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:14,940


464
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,420
Perhaps God is a big dinosaur.

465
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,400
Maybe he's the King of the Lizards and the Lord of Lords!

466
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,740
It says right in the Bible, in Job,

467
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,980
I am a brother to dragons.

468
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,160
Well...

469
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,100
What happened to the dinosaurs?

470
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:42,360
Was it this God Rex, this giant God-lizard up in the sky?

471
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,080
Yes!

472
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,800
Come on!

473
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,820
Say what?

474
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,680
all the other dinosaurs and he created man.

475
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,980
Men were created to serve him in his master plan.

476
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,220
When the time came, the god Rex commanded Noah to build an ark.

477
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,960
Take his children and all the animals that were on there.

478
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,560
Everybody but the dinosaurs. Yeah, everybody but the dinosaurs.

479
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,140
They didn't get to go. They just swam. They swam up to the North Pole.

480
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,020
And they all got frozen in the ice.

481
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,520
Now, man also survived this time.

482
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,480
And uh,

483
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,960
since there weren't any big lizards around to eat them no more, they started getting kind of

484
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,940
kind of uppy.

485
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:32,040
They forgot about the lizards. They declared themselves masters of the earth.

486
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,320
Replacing the god Rex with human gods.

487
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,260
The god Rex was both annoyed and amused at this stuff.

488
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,560
And bestowed upon man the secrets of the atom.

489
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,080
And the means to create pollution. The combination of these

490
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,120
two forces caused global warming. Now there will

491
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,300
come a time when the greenhouse effect will melt down the polar

492
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,060
ice caps. And the dinosaurs shall be

493
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,140
set free from their long sleep.

494
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,160
The radiation, either from the nuclear accidents caused by

495
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,040
the god Rex, or the nuclear winter caused by our

496
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,040
own foolishness, shall cause a change, a mutation

497
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,180
in the dinosaurs. Oh, wait a minute you guys. Hold on

498
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,940
just a second, Dr. Leguien. We have to get out of here in about five minutes. Okay.

499
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,040
Well, I'll just cut the

500
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,180
dinosaurs.

501
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,620
Well, I'll talk a little bit about the conspiracy.

502
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,520
The conspiracy, it poisons our water and it poisons our air.

503
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,320
I mean, ever since I found out what they've been putting in the water,

504
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,300
hell, I can't get enough of it.

505
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:48,040
But, you know, they poison us with the neurotoxin and the ink in Bibles.

506
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,880
Makes your brain go all stupid. Makes you want to just keep reading the Bible,

507
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,580
reading the Bible, reading the Bible. Every time you read it, you get stupider and stupider

508
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:01,800
from the neurotoxins. And it dulls your Bob-given powers of crap perception.

509
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,500
You know, when you're born, you have that perception to look for.

510
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,020
You look at crap and see crap.

511
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,520
It's not art. It's not food. You look at it, this is crap.

512
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,900
But the more you read the Bible, the less crap you can see.

513
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,480
And, well, they took over. They're the conspiracy now.

514
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,200
They curse us with hijabs and false prophets.

515
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,060
They imprison us for our use of the sacred herb of the Eucharist.

516
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:35,100
This is crap. Every single day, the con takes another one of our freedoms away.

517
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,020
What are you going to do about it?

518
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,580
Mutate! Arise, brethren! March proudly into Dobbs Town,

519
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,780
on a highway of golden light, following in the path of the Great Smiling One!

520
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,220
Give me some of that old-time religion! Give me some of them pills!

521
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,620
Open my third nostril wide!

522
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:01,580
And let all the stench of heaven and earth and hell that's above my psychic senses

523
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,980
help me! I'm a sinner!

524
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,500
I'm hiding behind the first seal!

525
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,620
But I'm not the Antichrist! I'm the anti-Christian!

526
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:16,440
And all my subgenius brothers and sisters are behind the seal with me!

527
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And I swear to you that the day cometh when we shall rip asunder that seal!

528
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,720
And with Bob by our side, we shall come upon Satan!

529
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,620
And we shall come upon Jesus!

530
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,580
And we shall come upon Buddha!

531
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,800
And Mohammed!

532
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,740
And all others of that ilk!

533
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,280
And lo, they shall leave town by sundown!

534
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,340
Our mighty church!

535
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,800
Praise sundown!

536
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,460
Our mighty church shall be the very knuckles of the stark fist of removal!

537
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:56,680
And all the false churches shall reap of the ass-whippings that is to come!

538
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,320
Praise Bob!

539
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Don't be caught unaware!

540
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,660

I said this is woodstock for nitwits. I mean look at these people. They've got so much

575
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:14,720
Christian ethic that it's frightening that they deny it so flatly. Kind of like how the

576
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,880
Christians do exactly the same thing when you bring up the dinosaurs. Can I sell you anything?

577

Bob, son of battle.

581
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,300
Secrets of effective subgenius sales. I don't understand.

582
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,980
Those who know don't say and those who say don't know.

583
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,860
What are you saying?

584
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,800
I don't know.

585
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,400
I don't know.

586
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:30,700
He carried a machine gun. He kicked in many doors. He hung out in the bars at night with

587
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:37,300
fishermen and whores. So Jesus, if you're listening, please hear my humble prayer.

588
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:44,080
Will you talk to your father, that old man in the air? The Christians want to leave here

589
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:50,580
to share heaven with you. I pray that you will grant their wish. We'd really like that too.

590
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,180
Amen.

591
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,520
Oh, sacred sales, dear friends.

592
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,760
Well, since you're talking about X-Day.

593
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,640
Same with the team Sly here.

594
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,500
Reverend Sly and I have worked all since last year at Starwood

595
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:19,880
to bring you a product that you are gonna need before X-Day. And we have managed for the one time only to put sex and slack

596
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,920
in a single jar. Yeah, you won't need it afterwards, you'll be lubed up all the time.

597
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:31,120
But, this is the one and only Sly's Slack Lube, my friends, and this is available at

598
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,660
Starwood over by Creative Realities Tattoo. We even have a tester there for your pleasure.

599
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:47,340
Something remotely penis-shaped, and it comes in maple, venus vanilla, flowing honey, and cinnamon.

600
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,460
Sly's Slack Lube, the one and only Sly's Slack Lube, my friends.

601
00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:00,660
It's sexy, all natural ingredients, it tastes good, it smells good, and it feels great.

602
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,680
You'll be as a sex god or goddess when you reach for the one and only pure Slack Lube.

603
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:15,500
It's slippery and won't dry up like most other lubes. It's low fat, no cholesterol, not tested on animals, so far as we know.

604
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:16,620
Yeah.

605
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,900
I'm leaded.

606
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,560
I'm leaded.

607
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,540
I'm perfect for all your lubricating needs.

608
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:28,720
Use Slack Lube and enjoy, really enjoy safer sex. Thank you.

609
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:38,820
Well, I used to be a sinner, cause I truly did believe that the Virgin married Jesus and me worth the gas thieves.

610
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:48,900
And I used to give my dough to televangelistic snobs, but then the light had shone upon me and I found J.R. Bob Dobbs.

611
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,560
And now my wallet is empty.

612
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,800
My wallet belongs to Bob.

613
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,900
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

614
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:03,980
Well, my heart is for my honey and my brain is for my job.

615
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,780
My wallet belongs to Bob.

616
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:20,340
Well, Bobby goes a frappin' every chance that he can get.

617
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:25,560
He cannot perform the biggest without even breaking sweat.

618
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,280
So I gave him all my money.

619
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,680
Reverend Stang said it was right.

620
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,560
And for only $20, he did save my soul tonight.

621
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,840
So my wallet belongs to Bob.

622
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,860
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

623
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,340
No more can the conspiracy.

624
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,680
My lowly wages rob.

625
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:55,360
My wallet belongs to Bob.

626
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,160
So, wha- where's Sister Mary Squared?

627
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,620
Not here!

628
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,280
All I see is Slacko the Clown.

629
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,820
And that's a rather- boy, you look like a little boy.

630
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,740
A pretty little boy.

631
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:17,020
Well, sting me, stang me, and bend me over and bang me.

632
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,140
No, baby!

633
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,420
I am you!

634
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,660
How you guys doing today, huh?

635
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,300
Whoo!

636
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,440
How are you guys doing today, huh?

637
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,920
Whoo!

638
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,940
All right, friends, I'm here to testify for you today.

639
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,160
I'm here to testify and to tell you who I was before I met the Church of the Subgenius,

640
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,260
because I wasn't always the well-rounded woman that you know today.

641
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,000
Oh, no!

642
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,900
Au contraire!

643
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,000
I was a normal two-boy.

644
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,460
I was a good one, friends.

645
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,180
No!

646
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:48,780
Yes.

647
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,320
I was pink!

648
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:56,340
I was so pink because I didn't think that there were other ways of living my life.

649
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,680
I didn't think!

650
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,620
I didn't know!

651
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:04,640
There was no one to show me the light, so I tried to fit in the circle into the square,

652
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,420
the square into the circle.

653
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,840
Au contraire!

654
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,340
I was twisting myself around and around and around.

655
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,580
I was a circle within a circle.

656
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,840
And it was a pattern that was a bad habit.

657
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,500
Huh!

658
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,060
And I got lots of habits.

659
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,900
You see, I went up on the mountain.

660
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,900
I went up.

661
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,320
I walked up on the mountain on Lookout Mountain, that very same mountain that Martin Luther King went up on,

662
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,500
JFK went up on, that Gandhi and all those cute little bee-dicky deities went up on.

663
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,700
And I looked out, and I saw my vision.

664
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:51,020
I saw it hanging there, dangling like a carrot to a bunny rabbit, a rabbit to a carrot.

665
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,240
Huh!

666
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,940
And I came back down from the mountain.

667
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:00,680
I came back down after seeing the way things should have been and could have been and would have been.

668
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:07,180
Had we all smartened up and started living ourselves, because everybody that goes up there on that mountain dies.

669
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,280
So I came down from the mountain.

670
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,660
You understand what I'm saying, brothers and sisters?

671
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:26,180
I came down from the mountain, because my demons inside my head, they said,

672
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:30,860
Oh, Alcatraz, we're not going to do that.

673
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,100
We're going to bring you down.

674
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,120
And friends, I became a member of the Diffie Cult.

675
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,680
Stick myself in the third eye, beat myself into unconsciousness.

676
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,260
I didn't know that.

677
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,820
I didn't know what was up from down and all around.

678
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,700
But as within me, so without.

679
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,920
And I realized I had to name my demons.

680
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:57,920
I had to get rid of them, because it's time to get rid of our chickens and start to dick it.

681
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,540
Starting and fornicating as if our very lives depended on it.

682
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,480
It does.

683
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,560
I'm not clowning around.

684
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,920
It really does.

685
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,880
I came down from the mountain, and I learned.

686
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,240
I learned that there were things that were not right.

687
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,760
There were things that I was invoking in my life.

688
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,440
I was invoking Bummer Man.

689
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,700
The greatest demon of the Diffie Cult.

690
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,020
Woo!

691
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,220
He's a slippery one.

692
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,140
He'll come into your living room.

693
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,560
He'll smoke all your fop.

694
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,580
He'll drink all your coffee in his little Superman suit.

695
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,240
Oh, yes.

696
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,760
With his little coffee stains and his cigarette holes.

697
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,760
And he'll say, oh, yeah.

698
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,940
I could have been, and I should have been, and I would have been.

699
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,920
But something happened, and I lost control.

700
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,480
And it was a real Bummer Man.

701
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,200
Yeah.

702
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,960
And along with Bummer Man came Ms. Communication.

703
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,140
Woo!

704
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,980
She's a tricky one.

705
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,440
She'll make you think you want one thing when you really want the other.

706
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,660
She'll make you sing one thing when you really want to sing the other.

707
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:11,340
She'll make you get down on your knees and praise the wrong B. Dicky deity.

708
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,300
A castrated little man hanging on a cross.

709
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,680
Choke my chicken?

710
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,000
No, choke your chicken.

711
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,820
Hey, friends, sexuality was at a loss.

712
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:27,760
As the choke is to the chicken, so is the veers to the fly trap.

713
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,420
It was tough.

714
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,420
Woo!

715
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,780
Sex hurt had not entered my life.

716
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:41,200
You mean now that I have entered into the magical community, now that I went up on that

717
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:41,320
planet.

718
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,040
And I had my vision.

719
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,440
I created all this.

720
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,680
I create my own reality.

721
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,480
And I'm responsible for what I have done and what I have seen.

722
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,880
And now I have to share this with other people?

723
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,500
I came down from the mountain.

724
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,060
And Connie lifted me back up.

725
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,200
Oh, she did.

726
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,940
It was a bumpy ride.

727
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,080
It was up and down.

728
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,300
It was down and up.

729
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,940
I was a driven woman.

730
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,420
And I didn't mind the ride.

731
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,780
It was the jerks that got me.

732
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,860
But I came down from the mountain.

733
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,860
And Connie, she lifted me back up.

734
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:28,660
And while there may be many crazed and confused things in this world today, there are certain

735
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,260
truths that we can all agree on.

736
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,340
Let me hear you all say yes.

737
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:33,980
Uh-huh.

738
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,160
Uh-huh.

739
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,920
That's right.

740
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,180
There is a dark and a light.

741
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,920
Let me hear you say, uh-huh.

742
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:40,920


743
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:40,920


744
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,620
Uh-huh.

745
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,820
Uh-huh.

746
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,520
There's good and the bad.

747
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,860
Uh-huh.

748
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:46,720
Uh-huh.

749
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,960
A wrong and a right.

750
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,100
Uh-huh.

751
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:49,520
Uh-huh.

752
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,060
Uh-huh.

753
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,720
Hail, Connie.

754
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,920
Hail, Connie.

755
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:56,600
And along with the goddess, I discovered who I truly was.

756
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,420
I discovered who I truly was as a unified self.

757
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:05,900
Since the Einstein has helped me to realize who I am, I discovered that Betty Page, Mae

758
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,220
West, and Rosie the Riveter all rolled into one.

759
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,400
I'm a woman.

760
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:10,880
I'm a woman.

761
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:10,880


762
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:10,880


763
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:10,880


764
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:10,880


765
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:10,880


766
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:10,880


767
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:10,880


768
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:10,880


769
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:10,880


770
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:10,880


771
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:18,300
I'm a woman.

772
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,240
I'm an inquiry for business and their

773
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,460
behavior.

774
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,360
Tantric.

775
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,680
I'm trans, galactic.

776
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:39,900
Talk to me on about this.

777
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,620
alleviations and alleviations and all kinds of inspirations.

778
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,600
You say that for the bobs, not the dicks.

779
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,100
It's the bobs that we love.

780
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,380
Praise Bob!

781
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,840
Praise Bob!

782
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,980
He may be dumb, but God, he's cute.

783
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,080
Praise Bob!

784
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,500
Praise Bob!

785
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,040
Woo!

786
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,900
Hurt me somebody, my legs are on fire.

787
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,000
Feed me!

788
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,540
Milk me!

789
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,700
Pet me!

790
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,780
Eat me!

791
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,000
Save me!

792
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,840
Sacred cow women arise!

793
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,760
Praise the cows!

794
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,920
Praise the cows!

795
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,120
Milk the cows!

796
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:22,480
It is time to stop prohibition and start to bitchin'.

797
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,220
Cause there's a conspiracy, my friends, going out there.

798
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,560
There's a conspiracy.

799
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,620
Oh, yes!

800
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,000
And what is that about Bill Clinton being a liberal, huh?

801
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,760
Okay, sure, he was slick enough to do that.

802
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,480
He was slick enough to get in.

803
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,640
But will he stay hard enough to do the job?

804
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,940
I think not!

805
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:52,420
It is time to start prohibition and start to bitchin'.

806
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,240
Praise the bitchin'!

807
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,580
Praise the bitchin'!

808
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,800
Praise the bitchin'!

809
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,180
Thank you, brothers and sisters.

810
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,800
Praise the blessed bitchin'.

811
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,380
Oh, yes.

812
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,520
Tonight, dear friends,

813
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,900
I'm going to share...

814
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,200
a legend with you.

815
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,800
Or rather, a tape that will become a legend.

816
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:19,060
A tape of a man who is himself a legend.

817
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,440
And certainly this is a piece,

818
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,180
albeit not a very attractive piece,

819
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,000
of radio history.

820
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,360
And before I play the tape,

821
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,880
I must tell you the story and set the scene.

822
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,960
As you know, tapes of this show,

823
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,900
The Hour of Slack,

824
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,560
are broadcast in...

825
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,460
in some sixteen cities.

826
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,460
Now, about two months ago,

827
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,400
Philadelphia became one of those cities.

828
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,680
But under unusual circumstances.

829
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,680
Of all the Philly subs,

830
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,480
it was dues-paying subgenius Reverend Craig

831
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,160
who secured a time slot for The Hour of Slack on...

832
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,520
well, on the station there.

833
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,100
But it was a three-hour time slot,

834
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,740
so Pastor Craig had to fill two more hours,

835
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:07,740


836
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,140
besides what we sent him.

837
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,420
This was a bit problematic in the beginning,

838
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,240
in that, let us say,

839
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,500
Pastor Craig was an ambitious,

840
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,160
but not very experienced radio technician

841
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,820
and or public speaker.

842
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,360
That's a diplomatic way of putting it.

843
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,760
In fact, his first several shows terribly alienated

844
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,440
his fellow subgenie-y,

845
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,880
such as Dr. Legume and his rude, rude clench.

846
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,720
And yet,

847
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,300
Pastor Craig's inexperience was exactly what allowed

848
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,440
what you are about to hear to happen.

849
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,820
And now, three weeks ago,

850
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,700
Pastor Craig called up Dr. Legume

851
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,520
and asked him to come be on the show.

852
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,540
Legume couldn't make it,

853
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,440
but he knew someone who could.

854
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,360
Someone so dangerously weird

855
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,020
that even Reverend Legume himself

856
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,100
had been known to flee his presence.

857
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,700
And Dr. Legume,

858
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,080
who is a kind of subgenius who scares other subgeniuses,

859
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,280
kind of like Pope Sternodox,

860
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,380
he's a big muscular guy who fears no death,

861
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,720
and whose a-whore, po-bucker roots

862
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,140
terrify the more e-bookish types.

863
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,480
Well, Legume's friend,

864
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,320
the Sheik,

865
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:30,000
is even more frightening and crazier.

866
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,740
So when Pastor Craig asked Legume to be on the show,

867
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,960
Legume said he couldn't make it,

868
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,840
but would arrange for the Sheik to come instead.

869
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,860
Now when Legume called the Sheik,

870
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,060
the Sheik was very, very drunk.

871
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,380
And upon being invited to the show that night,

872
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,020
he dutifully downed more Valiums and whiskey.

873
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,220
As soon as he got to the station,

874
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,800
he hurled violently,

875
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,060
and then he got on the mic

876
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,680
and delivered a eulogy

877
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,800
to Gigi Allen,

878
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,160
who had died of a drug overdose that very day.

879
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,380
Now I probably need to explain to most of you

880
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,880
who Gigi Allen was.

881
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,700
Gigi was a punk rocker,

882
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,040
so vile and violent,

883
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,500
that even the Sheik himself

884
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,560
is a pussycat by comparison.

885
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,100
Allen, Gigi Allen,

886
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,960
whose songs are all way too obscene for radio,

887
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,620
has as his main claim to fame

888
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,540
the fact that in his concerts,

889
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,880
he smeared himself with his own excrement,

890
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,980
cut himself with knives,

891
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,700
cut audience members with knives,

892
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,200
and played with himself on stage,

893
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,200
and in fact,

894
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,620
devoured the results of these leakages from his body.

895
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,840
Now he'd always promised to kill himself

896
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,100
and many audience members on stage one day,

897
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,720
but he OD'd instead.

898
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,520
We once got a surprisingly unimaginative news,

899
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,960
a shocking bummer's tale from Gigi Allen.

900
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,340
Anyway, the Sheik was not only a fan,

901
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,280
but a friend of Gigi Allen,

902
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,860
and was stricken with grief

903
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,920
over the great artist's death,

904
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,140
as well as being loaded to the gills

905
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,260
on Central Nervous System, the presses.

906
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,220
And the eulogy rant that he delivered

907
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,160
over the airwaves that night

908
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,720
is the most booze-soaked, cuss-word impregnated thing

909
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,600
I have almost ever heard on any radio tape.

910
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,560
The miracle of all this is that Pastor Craig

911
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,300
somehow was unable to shut off the mic

912
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,100
once the Sheik started,

913
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,000
and it all went out over the air.

914
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,620
Now this could only have happened

915
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,580
in the particular unusual circumstances

916
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,920
that developed that night.

917
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,160
Now I've edited all the profanity from this tape

918
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,020
so that I may share the anguish of the Sheik with you.

919
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,120
Our radio audience.

920
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,880
Now sometimes you'll be able to tell

921
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,360
where I've removed the profanity,

922
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:07,480
and sometimes you won't.

923
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,360
But take my word for it, there was a lot.

924
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,240
Pastor Craig got suspended

925
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,440
for letting this go out over the air.

926
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:21,080
But what remains is still one of the most poignant

927
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,800
sermons ever delivered by any subgenius.

928
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,620
Incidentally, when the Sheik was finished ranting,

929
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,260
he threw up again,

930
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,580
and Pastor Craig called a cab.

931
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,880
Praise the Sheik, praise Dr. Legume,

932
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,920
praise G.G. Allen, and yes,

933
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,520
praise poor Pastor Craig,

934
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,040
the most mild-mannered subgenius

935
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,500
at whose expense it all happened.

936
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,020
Yeah, I'm Pastor Craig,

937
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,560
you're listening to Baaah of After Dark,

938
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,820
the Church of the Seemed subgenius show,

939
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,420
and after the little rocky start,

940
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,040
we're back on track here.

941
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,060
And tonight's a very special night,

942
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,160
actually kind of a sad night.

943
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,640
G.G. Allen passed away, and I have with me

944
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,000
someone to give a eulogy for Mr. Allen,

945
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,760
none other than the Sheik.

946
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,760
And welcome.

947
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,300
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much,

948
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,200
Pastor Craig.

949
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,420
And let me say, first of all,

950
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:38,080
I don't really care what anybody thinks about G.G.

951
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,780
I think what I think,

952
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,900
and I think a god has died!

953
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,360
A god has died!

954
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,440
And you all burned!

955
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,400
Your brains!

956
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,300
And your knees!

957
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,080
You'll go down, and you'll sit,

958
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,740
and you'll think,

959
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,660
everything is wrong,

960
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,240
everything's wrong,

961
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,820
of course everything's wrong,

962
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,420
because G.G.'s dead.

963
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,660
G.G. is dead!

964
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,840
Now, how the f*** do I know he's dead?

965
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,380
Ha ha ha.

966
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,400
Yeah.

967
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,340
You, you, you, you, you look at me,

968
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,580
you look at me, and you talk to me.

969
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,820
Let me tell you something, my friends.

970
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,400
I am not going to play games,

971
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,100
I am not going to mince words.

972
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,780
All I'm going to do

973
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,000
is say the truth.

974
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:52,740
The truth is, G.G. is dead!

975
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,260
And when G.G. dies,

976
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,140
the whole thing dies, man!

977
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:05,580
It's like there's no real truth!

978
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,560
Now you can talk about Bob,

979
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,600
and you can talk about the Church of the Subgenius,

980
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,580
and you can talk about everything,

981
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,420
you can talk about all these things,

982
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:26,460
but there's not one single thing

983
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,880
that will really, really, really,

984
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:33,420
really, really, really, really, really, really,

985
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,700
really f***ing do!

986
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,400
I'm telling you, it's beautiful.

987
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,280
It's like...

988
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,860
Ahhh!

989
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,880
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

990
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,980
Very good, very good.

991
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,460
You see?

992
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,740
You see?

993
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:06,040
You see, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't what you think it is!

994
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:09,820
It's what you think you thought it was!

995
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:16,360
I, I, I, I, I, I...

996
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,960
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

997
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,780
Let me tell you a story.

998
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,680
Let me tell you a story, man.

999
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,760
I'm telling you,

1000
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,380
you don't like it,

1001
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,860
you can leave, you can leave.

1002
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,540
Turn the dial.

1003
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,240
Listen, everything is okay.

1004
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,900
Everything is okay.

1005
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,960
I want you to take your fingers

1006
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:48,940
and I want you to take your fingers

1007
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:55,320
and bring them down between your legs.

1008
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,040
I want you to begin to make

1009
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,080
to what I have to say.

1010
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:05,660
Because what I have to say is so beautiful

1011
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,640
and so unreal

1012
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,140
and so, so intense.

1013
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,700
I'm telling you!

1014
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,980
It's sinful.

1015
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,040
And I want you to do it.

1016
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,880
I want you to think of God

1017
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,760
and I want you to think of Jehovah

1018
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,120
and I want you to think of Satan.

1019
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,680
I want you to think of every sick thing

1020
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:44,820
you could ever possibly imagine.

1021
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:46,940
You!

1022
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,260
You are me

1023
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:54,380
and I am you.

1024
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,960
Please do it.

1025
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,200
Do it.

1026
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,340
Now, I'm going to count to four.

1027
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,520
When I count to four,

1028
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,080
when I reach four,

1029
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,780
you will think of the most dirty,

1030
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:14,800


1031
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:14,800


1032
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:14,800


1033
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:14,800


1034
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:14,800


1035
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,180
the dirtiest,

1036
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,600
the sickest,

1037
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:21,600
the most perverse sexual experience

1038
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,560
you have ever had in your life.

1039
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,800
You have probably never experienced

1040
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,620
this sexual experience,

1041
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,100
this fantasy.

1042
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:40,720
But you will at the count of four experience.

1043
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,240
I'm saying,

1044
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:44,840
I'm saying this.

1045
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:45,940
One.

1046
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,000
I'll give it another one.

1047
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,080
One!

1048
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,020
Two!

1049
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:57,960
Thirty.

1050
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,160
Four.

1051
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:11,940
I want you to experience orgasm.

1052
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,880
I want you to climax.

1053
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:21,080
I want you to climax with my voice

1054
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,660
and what I am saying right now.

1055
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,720
And the church of the subgenius is dead.

1056
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:30,860
It's dead.

1057
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,900
Bob is dead.

1058
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,520
The whole church is dead.

1059
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,140
It's dead.

1060
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,920
Why is it dead?

1061
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,000
Oh, you're all crying and weeping

1062
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,800
and all this sort of trash.

1063
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:56,500
Oh, it's dead because you've made it dead.

1064
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,160
You are a killer.

1065
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,460
You're a killer.

1066
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:03,560
Each and every one of you,

1067
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,520
you've killed.

1068
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,620
You kill so much.

1069
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,900
I get, I, I, I masturbate to you.

1070
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,240
You're murder.

1071
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,140
You are monsters.

1072
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,580
And I love it.

1073
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,860
And I want you to get,

1074
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,360
oh, I want, I, I, I, I want you to guarantee

1075
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:30,560
that you will murder.

1076
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,120
Murder Bob.

1077
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,460
Murder Bob.

1078
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,220
That's what you gotta do.

1079
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,360
I'm telling you.

1080
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,380
There's no other way

1081
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,860
to really understand the church of the subgenius

1082
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,520
is to murder Bob.

1083
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,260
Man, I'm telling you,

1084
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,160
it took me four years

1085
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,560
to understand

1086
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,420
that Bob had to be killed.

1087
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:01,360
Well, I certainly killed him.

1088
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:09,300
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

1089
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,480
and, and, and, and.

1090
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:22,620
Oh, you damn people.

1091
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,180
My friends,

1092
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:29,700
you don't know how hard it is.

1093
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,680
You know what it's like.

1094
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:38,480
You know what it's like to be the Sheik.

1095
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,000
The Sheik has many friends.

1096
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,100
He has his buddies.

1097
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,620
He has his friends.

1098
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,500
But he has more.

1099
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:50,240
More.

1100
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:55,440
He has people who care.

1101
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,540
And they want his guidance.

1102
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:09,820
And I, I, I swear and I bleed out of my eyes.

1103
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,960
That I cannot guide everybody.

1104
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,500
Each body must guide itself.

1105
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,380
Please.

1106
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:47,880
I have nothing to offer.

1107
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:50,640
Nothing!

1108
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,560
Nothing!

1109
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:54,660
Nothing!

1110
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,240
You fucked him!

1111
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,680
You fucked him!

1112
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:01,680


1113
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,460
You've stayed like dogs!

1114
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:10,260
And now I give you the ultimate treat.

1115
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:15,200
I give you what you should have gotten long ago.

1116
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,640
Five years ago.

1117
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:22,120
I give you your God.

1118
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,780
I'll give you your God.

1119
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,180
Here he is.

1120
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,040
Here he is.

1121
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,940
Here he is!

1122
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,420
Here he is!

1123
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,900
Here he is!

1124
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,320
Right.

1125
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,600
Nothing.

1126
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:40,540
Nothing.

1127
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:41,540
Nothing.

1128
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:43,540
Nothing.

1129
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:43,880
Nothing.

1130
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,940
Be quiet.

1131
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,360
Be quiet, my children.

1132
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,340
My children.

1133
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,560
Be quiet.

1134
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,180
Try and be quiet.

1135
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,560
Love me.

1136
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,360
Love me.

1137
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,640
Love me even though you hate me.

1138
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,380
I want your hate.

1139
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,200
I want you to hate me.

1140
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:17,120
I want you to hate me.

1141
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:21,160
I want you to hate me.

1142
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,740
I want you to hate me.

1143
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:29,000
I want you to hate me.

1144
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,000
I want you.

1145
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:38,660
I am the greatest, the most powerful.

1146
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:49,120
You and your kind can never, never see.

1147
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,720
Something very strange.

1148
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,020
Something very important to happen.

1149
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,680
Beginning of this week.

1150
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:13,440
Gigi Allen, the greatest of the great, died.

1151
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:22,700
I want you to bow your heads.

1152
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,780
I don't give a if you liked them or you didn't or you won't.

1153
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,760
You know, whatever.

1154
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:29,940
You know.

1155
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:30,900
You know.

1156
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,640
If you didn't, that's too bad.

1157
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,920
I'm pretty upset myself.

1158
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,300
I want you to bow your heads.

1159
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,700
I want you to understand that.

1160
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:59,440
There was a man who did something that nobody else ever did.

1161
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,800
He was unique.

1162
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,600
And the word unique means original.

1163
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,960
And that man was original.

1164
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:16,380
And for him to be dead to me is ultimate tragedy.

1165
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,920
Why do you think?

1166
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,000
Do you think I want Led Zeppelin?

1167
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,240
Those stupid, burned out bastards.

1168
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,140
Those uncut mother.

1169
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,200
What's that?

1170
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:38,980
What's that?

1171
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:39,780
You know.

1172
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,800
Please give me a break.

1173
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:47,340
You know.

1174
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:52,160
It sounds normal, but

1175
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:52,280
I'm sorry.

1176
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,660
Please.

1177
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,360
I apologize.

1178
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,520
I give you something.

1179
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,480
I give you something to dwell on.

1180
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:08,020
I give you something to suck on.

1181
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,640
I'm sorry.

1182
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,960
It hurts.

1183
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,600
I'm sorry.

1184
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:14,600


1185
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:14,600


1186
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:25,760
Gigi Allen was the greatest, he was the greatest rockstar of all time.

1187
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:36,860
If you don't understand or you don't like him, that's your problem.

1188
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:47,960
Why don't you just go like your stupid Led Zeppelin albums, man?

1189
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,400
I'm telling you.

1190
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,960
The Sheik loves people.

1191
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:59,240
The Sheik loves all the subs.

1192
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:03,400
And the subs know who they are.

1193
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:06,840
And the subs, they know.

1194
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:06,840


1195
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:07,120
They know.

1196
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,560
I don't have to tell them.

1197
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,740
Man, I don't have to tell them.

1198
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,200
The Sheik knows.

1199
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,160
And they know who the Sheik is.

1200
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:24,560
Shut down.

1201
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,520
Oh, I'm not shut down?

1202
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,540
Oh, okay.

1203
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:35,260
No, no, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me go down.

1204
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:36,840
All right.

1205
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,760
I know, I know, I like it.

1206
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:43,760
Go on, go on, go on, go on.

1207
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:50,560
I love all of you.

1208
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,780
I love all of you.

1209
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:59,240
I love all of you.

1210
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,200
I love all of you.

1211
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:13,600
And I thank Pastor Craig, who has made this possible.

1212
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:17,320
He's a hell of a nice guy.

1213
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:27,100
And I thank his wife, because, and Jesus, my wife would never let me do this.

1214
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,180
we're going to play some

1215
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,500
Gigi and

1216
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,720
I hope you like it

1217
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,480
and I'm sorry if I

1218
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,780
did anything

1219
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,400
