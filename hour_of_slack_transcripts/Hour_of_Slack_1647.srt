1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,860
THE POWER OF SLACK

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,180
THE POWER OF SLACK

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,160
Bom bom bom bom bom bom som

5
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,140
Thank you.

6
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,080
Thank you.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,840
Yes, dear friends.

8
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,460
It is another hour of slack.

9
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,360
Slack.

10
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,440
Slack.

11
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,060
Being recorded in an unusual time zone tonight.

12
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,900
What would normally be the second hour of radio synesthesia.

13
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,380
And perhaps it is that.

14
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,720
While it is also hour of slack number 1,600.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,800
And keep a track of that now.

16
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:12,500
We have in the studio the esteemed Dr. Howland Owl.

17
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,140
Greetings and salutations.

18
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,000
And Princess Wee Ardo, queen of all the UFOs.

19
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,380
Greetings and salutations.

20
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,060
And we finally got rid of that Dr. Sinister guy.

21
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,520
Boy, they don't call him that for nothing.

22
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:27,780


23
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,040
Well, he was...

24
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,420
He...

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Is adjusting to new conspiracy job.

26
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,540
Woods and pastures new.

27
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,540
Something that we don't have to adjust to because we paid our dues.

28
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,380
As Princess Wee put it, I pretended to like those people for 29 years.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,840
That takes a lot out of you.

30
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,460
And, uh...

31
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,860
Yeah, and then in my case, I...

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,980
I mailed out subgenius membership packs for 39 years.

33
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,260
Well, not quite. Almost.

34
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,280
And they're still selling like hotcakes, folks.

35
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,080
Yeah.

36
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,080
The market for hotcakes is not what it used to be, but it's still there.

37
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,120
At least they're hot and provide chi energy.

38
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,320
And in the same way the subgeniuses are flocking toward the church.

39
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,420
Buying a new membership every time you turn around.

40
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,000
And receiving the...

41
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,540
The membership packet with all its multifold treasures, benefits and pleasures.

42
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,260
Well, the main thing is that when you're a minister, you can do ministerial duties.

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,020
You're important.

44
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,180
And they pay you for that.

45
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,840
You make back your 35 bucks the first time you marry some poor couple.

46
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,480
Yeah.

47
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,640
I've lost count of how many people I've married.

48
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,560
I've done...

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,300
Most of the ones I've married are still together, too.

50
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,780
That's awesome.

51
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,500
I would say it's about a half and half for me.

52
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,380
I did marry one who broke apart about five minutes later.

53
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,040
But anyway, for the most part...

54
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,320
I've done three transgender weddings.

55
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,020
Transgender? You mean same sex or transgender?

56
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,700
Both partners were originally classified as the other sex?

57
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,640
No.

58
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,140
In every case, one partner had originally been classified differently.

59
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,560
But by the time I married him, they were both pretty gals.

60
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,860
How about that?

61
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,380
Oh, everything's changing so fast.

62
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,680
Whirling around.

63
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,220
I can't keep track.

64
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,040
Things have changed a little bit during my brief lifetime.

65
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,520
A little bit.

66
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,420
They had already invented black and white TV.

67
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,340
And color TV wasn't that big of a change.

68
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,660
And putting men on the moon wasn't...

69
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,940
Didn't amount to much besides Tang.

70
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,500
It wasn't anything anyone wasn't expecting.

71
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,800
But what they weren't expecting was...

72
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
The Internet.

73
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,560
And how wonderful it would be.

74
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,880
Well, actually, they did expect it to be wonderful.

75
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,940
What I don't think a lot of people were expecting was how terrible it would be.

76
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,740
I kind of did expect that.

77
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,300
Even when...

78
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,300
I do feel that the Internet has brought not knowledge, but disinformation.

79
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,500
Well, yes, it's large and democratic reach.

80
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,240
Hey, should I try this collar?

81
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,260
Sure.

82
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,820
I'm gonna try this collar. Okay, who's this collar?

83
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,340
It's Sloan.

84
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,160
Oh, it's our Jay!

85
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,600
He's back.

86
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,480
Okay, good.

87
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,120
I just wanted to remind you guys that sometime you gotta take Dr. Howe to the West Side Market...

88
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,000
...to look at the ceiling made...done by the WPA artists...

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,420
...and all the budding young German expressionist type crazy guys from the 30s.

90
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,160
Maybe someday.

91
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,840
My time has almost run its course.

92
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,240
That's a great idea, Dave.

93
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,780
I'm sure that Howe would love seeing the West Side Market.

94
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,480
Yes, sir, I'd be happy.

95
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,060
Well, maybe there's all kinds of goats from the various mini-cultures there...

96
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,580
...all chopped up looking really macabre looking.

97
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:14,840
Goats?

98
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,300
Goats?

99
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,380
But...but...

100
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,120
Well, you see, I come from San Francisco and there's...

101
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,060
...Chinatown where they have the carcasses of all sorts of things hung up right in the street.

102
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,960
They've got whales hanging on the street in San Francisco.

103
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,060
Displayed for your...

104
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,100
...inspection.

105
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,000
You can get bush meat there.

106
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,720
Who are they hanging up in Glen Rose?

107
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,260
Wasn't it Mr. F...

108
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:41,840
Dinosaurs.

109
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,740
It's nice.

110
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:50,760
You can...they'll chop them up for you and you point to one, they take it down and they chop it really rapidly into...

111
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,980
...edible chunks.

112
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,020
That's puppies you're talking about?

113
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:02,760
I was talking about ducks, but they also have the goat, the turtle, all these animals ready to prepare.

114
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,740
Ready to chop?

115
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,500
Chop, chop.

116
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,020
Chop, chop?

117
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,420
Presto di mangiare.

118
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,540
Per mangiare.

119
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,180
Meaning fast.

120
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,180
Listo a comer.

121
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:20,740
We haven't gotten to take Dr. Howell on many Cleveland touristy things because we...we...we hit the...

122
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:20,740


123
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,480
...the ground after X day. We're exhausted.

124
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,900
We've got serious church business.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,220
We don't have time to go to no natural history museum.

126
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,880
Oh God, I really want to go there.

127
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,920
And...and...

128
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,780
Well, but a lot of people go to this rock and roll hall of fame.

129
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,160
That's a big deal here in Cleveland.

130
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,100
It is surprising...

131
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:50,500
...it is surprising how...how...how little distance you have to go into the hall of technology to see the things that...

132
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,920
...that we started recording with ourselves.

133
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:59,000
Right after the Edison wire recorder, there's the little reel-to-reel decks that we had.

134
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:05,680
And you also get to see how tiny those giant rock stars really are.

135
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,480
They have human dimensions.

136
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,900
It's only their fame that is large.

137
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,380
Um, Prince, for instance, was a teeny little guy.

138
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,240
Mick Jagger.

139
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,600
I don't know.

140
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,260
He looked like a giant up there on stage that time I saw him in Fort Worth.

141
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,740
Napoleon Complex.

142
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,460
Uh, I've had...

143
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,920
And he was a very complex individual.

144
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,280
Well, now, let's think of it...

145
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,380
...at least give him that favor, right?

146
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,200
Who's a huge, hulking, giant rock star?

147
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,860
Anybody ever heard of one of those?

148
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,680
Are they musical? Enormous?

149
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,060
Like Meat Loaf, I guess, is a rather large person.

150
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,220
Well, he's large compared to the others, but I'm not sure.

151
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,440
I'm not sure he's any kind of a goliath.

152
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,400
I never got to stand next...

153
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,140
Oh, and Girth is as well as in Swilth.

154
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,640
If he's like 12 hectares tall, what would he have to be in Girth?

155
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,940
Oh, I can tell you about some giant rock stars.

156
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,080
Well, let's hear it.

157
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,840
The members of GWAR.

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,760
Oh, GWAR.

159
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,200
The late Odorous Erungus was nine feet tall.

160
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,880
Beefcake, the bass player, must have weighed at least 400 pounds.

161
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,800
Like a human rhinoceros.

162
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,820
But that's in full costume.

163
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,340
Well, what costumes? Those guys performed in the nude.

164
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,600
They just happened to be creatures from outer space.

165
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,280
Yes, unsightly beings from beyond the stars.

166
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,980
Reverend Angry Larry, the roadie for the amino acids is a pretty big guy.

167
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,280
Yes, well, we weren't talking about no roadie.

168
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,560
We were talking about the performance...

169
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,460
Giant rock stars.

170
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,580
Yes, giant rock groups that...

171
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:55,440
Well, they would counteract this feeling that rock stars were actually little squinty, small, mean looking guys.

172
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,420
Village of the Giants, that was a great band.

173
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,480
Named after one of Bert I. Gordon's most famous...

174
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,420
Well, that did have a rock and roll scene with giant teenagers rocking in kind of a slow motion effect.

175
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,460
To show how big they were, yes.

176
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,700
As if...anyway.

177
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,260
Rocking?

178
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,280
What story was that?

179
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,240
Village of the Giants.

180
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:28,100
Supposedly an adaptation of H.G. Wells' Food of the Gods, but I can hardly credit that.

181
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:35,040
There's about 20 things that are half-assed adaptations of that interesting novel.

182
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,260
But never good.

183
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,160
Well, the novel itself gets a little Ayn Rand-ish towards the end.

184
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,340
Well, you...

185
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,840
Where are you going to go with the Giants?

186
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:56,320
But I did like the fact that once they could make everything big, they made the rulers of each nation into giants.

187
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
And then there were problems.

188
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,960
Star-crossed romances between giant princesses and princes.

189
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,740
For am I not Trump the Conqueror?

190
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,480
Huge.

191
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,880
I've never heard him referred to as the Mango Mussolini in the great street drinking.

192
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,880
This incredible shrinking man.

193
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,900
The amazing, colossal, ego-ed president.

194
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,160
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

195
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,520
The Cyclops.

196
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,080
That's what you guys do every morning. Get up at like maybe 5.30 and start tweeting ridiculous comments.

197
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,740
And that would really love you so much.

198
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,800
How we can get interns to do that. To get up at 5.30 and all of that.

199
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,460
Somebody made me a Twitter account.

200
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,180
Somebody made me a Twitter account.

201
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,000
Just so nobody else would have the Ivan Stang Twitter account.

202
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,180
But I don't think that Ivan Stang ever twits.

203
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,460
Well, it's like a domain name. You just own it so nobody else can.

204
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,900
Some people, I guess, subscribe to it, but they must wonder why there's only one post.

205
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:08,540
I think it's me saying, I don't know what I'd have to say in 140 characters, frankly.

206
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,540
Yeah, that's not much.

207
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,160
Most of my thoughts go on that.

208
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,100
I've gone for paragraphs.

209
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,680
Now, do those count spaces as characters and punctuation as characters?

210
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:18,980
I think so.

211
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,340
Oh my God.

212
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,700
I don't know. I never asked.

213
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,560
No wonder they yak in such an abbreviated pigeon.

214
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:34,940
Well, you know, as the great subgenius Carter LeBlanc wrote me recently and said,

215
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,820
I learned a lot from the Church of the Subgenius.

216
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,500
Especially that alt.slack forum on Usenet.

217
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:50,600
Because now political discourse has taken the form of Usenet flame wars.

218
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,360
And that's it.

219
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,100
That's political discourse now. Internet flame wars.

220
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,420
That's what goes for it.

221
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,120
Trolling.

222
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:06,320
It's just, I mean, that's, instead of government proclamations, you get government 25 character trolling.

223
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,880
The triumph of the trolls.

224
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,660
Mm-hmm.

225
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,740
The revenge of the caveman.

226
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,980
What have you seen recently, Stengo, that illuminates this?

227
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,920
Because this sounds fascinating to me.

228
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,020
The news.

229
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,060
That's what I've seen that illuminates this.

230
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,140
By the way, I don't watch the news.

231
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,420
I don't hear the news.

232
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,940
I only read the news.

233
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:35,700
And I actually often go straight to the comments because I want to know what the great unwashed is thinking.

234
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:35,940
Me too.

235
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,640
And I can tell you, they have a greatly unwashed mind.

236
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,000
I can tell you, they have a greatly unwashed stench to them.

237
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,520
Well, when I read the newspaper, first I go to the editorials.

238
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,220
And then I read the letters column, too.

239
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,260
Then I flip over to the comics and I read those.

240
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,060
And then and only then do I go through the paper picking out tidbits of news.

241
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,900
I am bulk spaced.

242
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,220
I am bulk spaced by a right-wing website.

243
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,620
I get like 50 spams every day.

244
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:08,620


245
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:08,620


246
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:14,060
I have been trying to get involved in some way or another for a couple of weeks.

247
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,080
Oh, I get all kinds of stuff.

248
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,040
I ended up on this man that makes me wonder.

249
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,300
I don't know what to do.

250
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,440
Oh, I get all kinds of crazy stuff from extremists on both sides.

251
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,480
It comes at you from all directions.

252
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:28,900
Yeah.

253
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:36,340
I set my little email program to shuffle certain material off into a special folder labeled

254
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,480
Kooks and Jesus.

255
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:45,240
There are some people who probably think that I'm eagerly reading their every right-wing

256
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,380
political discourse when actually if I really want to read them, I look in my Kooks and

257
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:58,620
Jesus folder, which is probably must weigh a ton, even though it's all made of tiny computer

258
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,140
bits.

259
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,040
Yeah, you do attract them like flies, you know?

260
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,580
Yes.

261
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,660
The Church of the Subgenius is in fact kook flypaper.

262
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,180
Among many other things.

263
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,800
A monster magnet.

264
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,120
Yeah, but well, that's the good part.

265
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,960
We've got some cool monsters in the book.

266
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:23,460
I think monster in that adjectival sense simply means a very large magnet that draws all to

267
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:23,740
it.

268
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,560
Oh, I would thought you meant one between monsters.

269
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,760
Well, that would be a good thing to put on.

270
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,900
You draw monsters pretty good, Dr. Howell.

271
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,380
You've got a lot of your monster drawings in our books and things.

272
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,240
Oh, yeah.

273
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Oh, that's right.

274
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,280
They're in the books.

275
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,080
Yeah.

276
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,220
Well, they're not really monsters.

277
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:50,180
They're the noble Yeti and mighty Exus and the fist of Jehovah and things like that.

278
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,680
They're only monsters to the unsaved.

279
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:00,240
Well, you see the word monster comes from the Latin monstrum, which means something

280
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,260
shown.

281
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,460
A monster is something people want to see.

282
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,220
Monsters are undeserved.

283
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,420
They're not really monsters.

284
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:06,420


285
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,440
Yeah, demonstrate.

286
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,800
Yeah, demonstrate.

287
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,900
Right, exactly.

288
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:19,460
And so, for all the opprobrium that we seem to treat monsters with, without them, why,

289
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,880
we'd have nothing.

290
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,440
Nothing, I tell you.

291
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,960
Certainly no Church of the Subgenius.

292
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,160
Twould be a pale and drab world.

293
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,640
Pickle the skyward to that bird flying up there.

294
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,960
Doesn't remind you of Freedom of Liberty or of Bob?

295
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,660
Well, well.

296
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,400
Arcing across a cloudless sky.

297
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,920
All I want to do is listen to this music.

298
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:53,860
Yeah, it reminds you of real scary stuff like the armies of Saptor, the magnificent

299
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,780
are crossing the borderlines of Hades and, you know, like it's a real bad game that you're

300
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,480
losing and you actually die if you lose the game and stuff like that.

301
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:02,480


302
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:02,480


303
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,440
Push off.

304
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,880
That's the reason why you picked it, isn't it?

305
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,680
And sitting well in order, smite the sounding furrow.

306
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,920
For our purpose holds to sail beyond the sunset and the bath of all the western stars.

307
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,320
It was a quiet evening off Iwo Jima.

308
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,560
Three hundred people decided to wash their underwear in one slow rhythmic motion, sending

309
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,440
off a wave of ripples across the entire Pacific Ocean.

310
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:32,460


311
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,440
I don't remember the spot.

312
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Dr. Howell, I know you recognize this music in the background, Jason and the Argonauts

313
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,400
theme by Bernard Herrmann.

314
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:44,660
Yeah.

315
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,120
It is Bernard Herrmann.

316
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,360
When I was, when did this movie come out?

317
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,200
1963.

318
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,700
Okay.

319
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,300
Then I would have been in third grade.

320
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,040
But nobody remembers.

321
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,160
No, I'd be ten years old.

322
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,440
How, what a dead period it was when nothing like that.

323
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:02,440


324
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:02,440


325
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:02,440


326
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,480
It was like this was appearing and then suddenly that was there.

327
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,460
But it seemed like the whole idea, this was before everything busted loose in the 60s.

328
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,600
It was like everything was being nailed down.

329
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,140
Buildings were constructed from the heroic materialism out of the Bauhaus.

330
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,560
Everything was abstracted and reduced.

331
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,420
And there was nothing like Jason and the Argonauts until its, I don't know, it was

332
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:32,420


333
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,560
suddenly was there.

334
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:39,560
When I was, I saw it in the theater when I was ten.

335
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,060
Thanks Pappy for taking us.

336
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,240
That's really good of him.

337
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:52,080
I love that musical theme, but tape recorders for ten year olds had not been invented yet.

338
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,820
And I thought, how can I remember that music?

339
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:01,080
I had the music in my head, just that dun dun dun dun dun dun.

340
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,400
How can I remember that?

341
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,020
I invented musical notation.

342
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,500
That's how you could remember.

343
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,260
I actually had some idea of how that was done.

344
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,440
I'd had a week of piano lessons.

345
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:20,720
And I wrote on a piece of paper stripes that were low for the low notes and high for the high notes.

346
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,080
And all I had to do was look at that piece of paper, dun dun dun.

347
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,020
I could bring it back.

348
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,400
It would be, it wasn't long enough.

349
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:39,700
It was long before I was on the rare occasions that they would show one of those Ray Harryhausen movies on TV.

350
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,020
We didn't have videotape.

351
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,260
I would point my eight millimeter camera at the TV.

352
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:46,640
Me too.

353
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,200
Got some good results.

354
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:54,120
And that was like at grandma's house in front of the TV set was like watching Sinbad and all of Harryhausen's Harry.

355
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:02,380
The curious thing about the Jason and the Argonauts music is that Herman usually was the main character.

356
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:02,380


357
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,520
He was the master of the strings of the violins to produce his tritone effect.

358
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:15,120
But for Jason and the Argonauts, he deliberately restricted himself all to wind instruments and percussion.

359
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,240
Because back in the ancient world, they didn't have violins.

360
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:29,680
See, so this whole musical score that we're listening to now is all brass and timpani and harp occasionally.

361
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,540
And Celestina come in.

362
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,000
So the ancient world could have produced such sounds.

363
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,560
And only Greek warriors were allowed to be musicians in this orchestra.

364
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,360
They had to have conquered at least one lion.

365
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,900
I think that's fascinating.

366
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,800
That's fascinating, man.

367
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,240
Wow, that is totally wild.

368
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,740
Just to think that they are.

369
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Yeah, man.

370
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,660
Herman was very careful in approaching Argonauts.

371
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,100
He didn't want to do any project with his music to accompany it.

372
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:10,140
But he respected Harryhausen and had respect for him as an artist.

373
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:19,660
So he would go ahead and score these movies, which were not considered A pictures by most in Hollywood.

374
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,100
No, but Herman did score a lot of A pictures, like Hitchcock.

375
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,320
Like Citizen Kane.

376
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:26,940
Yeah.

377
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,280
Like all of Hitchcock's movies.

378
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:29,920
Yeah.

379
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:36,620
And it was until Torn Curtain, where Hitchcock threw away Herman's score for Torn Curtain.

380
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,180
He didn't know that.

381
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,420
Yes, they had a different composer.

382
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:48,560
His split with Hitchcock came over this, the Paul Newman movie, Torn Curtain.

383
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,900
Hitchcock didn't like his score.

384
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:59,660
But Herman also experimented with electronic sounds and the birds' soundtrack, though non-musical.

385
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,100
It was put together out of bird noises by Bernard Herman.

386
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,800
Then there are Beneath the Twelve Mile Reef and things like that.

387
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,600
White Witch Doctor.

388
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,980
All sorts of movies that used to be on Saturday night at the movies.

389
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,060
We'd all watch them.

390
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,460
Five Fingers, that's another one.

391
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,560
And The Magnificent Ambersons.

392
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,140
Oh, look, a cookie.

393
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,760
The score for Psycho is all strings, right?

394
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,900
Well, that's how Herman preferred to use it.

395
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:45,040
But I always thought it was interesting that he restricted himself for Jason to produce a score with these earlier instruments.

396
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,820
And it really works with the film.

397
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,220
The story behind his score for Taxi Driver is interesting.

398
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,320
Apparently he knew he was going...

399
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,480
Which resembles his score for Chinatown a little bit, which is weird.

400
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,180
He must have known he was about to die.

401
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,180
Because...

402
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,020
Oh, did he die?

403
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,900
He was finishing up the score for Taxi Driver.

404
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,500
And he inexplicably insisted that all of the musicians show up.

405
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,400
It's like Christmas Eve or something.

406
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,380
Right?

407
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,080
And nobody could figure out what was this guy's deal?

408
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,180
Why is he in such a hurry to get this thing done?

409
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,160
And he conducted the score and then died.

410
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,020
The next day.

411
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,220
I could have this all mixed up and...

412
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,020
No, you're right.

413
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,440
The score has concluding chords in it which were not actually used in the movie.

414
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,220
So the end has an unresolved feeling.

415
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,020
There's no musical conclusion.

416
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,540
But the actual music has that.

417
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,980
And it was a good capper on a long career.

418
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,140
Herman also wrote operas and other pieces of symphonic music.

419
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:04,500
He wrote all the music in the CBS library which was used for Twilight Zone soundtracks

420
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,180
and for soundtracks of other TV shows.

421
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:17,920
Bernard Herman was to music what Richard Matheson was to scripts on television about the same time.

422
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,480
His stuff is everywhere.

423
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,320
And in short story collections.

424
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,940
It has a psychological feel to it.

425
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,940
Of the time you mean?

426
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,700
Of the period of the...

427
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,420
When that was all going on.

428
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,060
Like when all the people used to go and work on Twilight Zone in New York City together.

429
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,120
And Harlan Ellison came from Painesville, Ohio.

430
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,140
That figures.

431
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,860
Everybody I know who knows Harlan Ellison hates him.

432
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,640
I know a lot of people who know him and they really...

433
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,160
He's apparently not a very pleasant person.

434
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,500
He's not that lovable but he's not totally not fun to be...

435
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,140
I went out to dinner with him.

436
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,480
Once when I was working on the TV show I was associated with.

437
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,080
In fact I think they made me go out to dinner with him because nobody else wanted to.

438
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:13,040
But he's fine as long as you don't try to tell an anecdote or a story yourself.

439
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,380
He has to do it.

440
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:21,700
But then he's perfectly affable if he can just seize the conversation and carry it through the night.

441
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:27,340
Right. As long as he can totally dominate everything he's a real friendly, polite fellow.

442
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:27,880
Just so.

443
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,940
Yes, he must be able to hold forth.

444
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:39,100
Yeah, well I don't want to gossip about science fiction writers that this generation's never heard of.

445
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:45,480
But I do want to gossip about the greatness of Bernard Herrmann and Richard Matheson and some of these people that...

446
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,400
Charles Beaumont.

447
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:52,840
Yeah, you the listener owe more to these old farts than you can even guess.

448
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,840
If you're listening to this show anyway.

449
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,900
And let's include Rod Serling.

450
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,980
Among the pantheon of the gods he is the Zeus.

451
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:09,400
You see these writers were mentioning, were not all that pleased with Mr. Serling.

452
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:15,600
They felt that he was, you know, muscling in and taking their credit and not treating their material correctly.

453
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,480
And Ray Bradbury got mad at him and so forth and so on.

454
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,700
But he was the whipcracker, the guy who made it happen.

455
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,360
And he did have a feel for the material.

456
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:33,100
So maybe Matheson and Beaumont and the others were a little too close to it.

457
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,080
Gotta have a mo.

458
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,180
Serling wrote the original...

459
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:41,960
He wrote the original, uh, Planet of the Apes.

460
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,840
Yes, Night Gallery unfortunately was written by various script writers.

461
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,180
Serling just was in the middle of it, you know, at the beginning.

462
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,180
Smoking a pack of cigarettes.

463
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,600
But still.

464
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,900
But still he gave it some, uh, some pizzazz.

465
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:04,920
Now this here is a Bernard Herrmann piece which is intricately composed in an 18th century style.

466
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:11,180
And even in an English 18th century style as opposed to the Baroque of other lands.

467
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,660
For the movie Three Worlds of Gulliver.

468
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,040
One of the ones I saw when I was a wee shaver.

469
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:23,580
That's the only adaptation of the Gulliver movie that goes past Langevin.

470
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,560
And Lilliput, if I recall correctly.

471
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,740
And none of them have made it to the country of the...

472
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,200
The Whinhams.

473
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,080
The Whinhams.

474
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:31,720
Yes.

475
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Well, it's, uh, too bad.

476
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,920
But today they could do it.

477
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:43,360
And that's why I wish somebody would actually, you know, make a giant Gulliver spectacle.

478
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,400
Because it would be endlessly entertaining.

479
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,760
I trust...

480
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,940
You tickled my interest in Bernard Herrmann again.

481
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,560
Because you said that he was written in this style of work.

482
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:53,560


483
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,120
Well, I was thinking about the style of the English Baroque period.

484
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,220
And it certainly was.

485
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,740
And I was thinking about all the restrictions he made on his...

486
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,460
Yeah.

487
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,760
Well, he was able to write in different musical styles.

488
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,060
But, uh...

489
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,140
Yeah, but it seems like he was having so much fun that...

490
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,480
Like, when you go and chase something around like that.

491
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,820
And you get so focused and involved in something like that.

492
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,840
That's really...

493
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,560
That's really nice, you know?

494
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,240
Well, it has the form of the Baroque music.

495
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,180
But it also is perfect instrumental.

496
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:31,720
Accompaniment music with light passages that prefigure romantic music and so forth.

497
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:38,140
But Gulliver's story is perfectly in match with that time.

498
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,320
Of course, Gulliver wasn't in Europe during the time of his adventures.

499
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,080
But the music seems appropriate to describe it.

500
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,380
In the Columbia Morningside picture, the three worlds of Gulliver were...

501
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,280
Lilliput, Brobdingnag, and England.

502
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:02,100
So they never got to the flying adamantine island of Laputa or the Whinims Land.

503
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,980
Uh, Hal, I hope you haven't seen the Jack Black version.

504
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,200
I'm afraid I did.

505
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,400
And I went to people who liked it.

506
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,680
So I had to screw my mouth closed and not spoil their fun by saying,

507
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,380
What a wretched piece of horse.

508
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,540
I mean, I...

509
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,360
I'm the biggest tenacious person.

510
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,360


511
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,720
I'm the biggest tenacious D fan in the world.

512
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,920
And I think Jack Black can be a really good actor.

513
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,080
Well, the tenacious D movie was wonderful.

514
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,660
The one where he, you know, has the wager with Satan.

515
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,400
The Pick of Destiny.

516
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,060
Yes, the Pick of Destiny. That's a great film.

517
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:44,960
But, yeah, I was really sad to see him wreck Gulliver.

518
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,940
I'm not sure that he is to be thoroughly blamed, but rather the people who set it up.

519
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,420
You know, they, uh...

520
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:56,300
He should have put his foot down.

521
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,680
As far as Lilliput...

522
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,040
And crushed the entire country of Lilliput.

523
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,940
Oh, wait, he did. Only he...

524
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:08,820
That's the one version of the Gulliver's Travels movies where he pees on the flaming palace.

525
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,600
He peed on the palace to put out the fire.

526
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:11,960
Right.

527
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,540
Because he could.

528
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:20,180
Because the fire was quick and he was there and he drunk the Lilliputian wine, which goes right through you.

529
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:26,420
But he was never forgiven for pissing on the emperor's palace.

530
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,140
Ever.

531
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,440
And the empress particularly never forgave him.

532
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:36,360
And his fall from the court of Lilliput began from that time.

533
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:45,140
Eventually they were going to put out his eyes and do other things to him, so he had to flee to the neighboring realm of Blefescu.

534
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,080
Hey, this reminds me that portions of the following broadcast may be objectionable.

535
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:55,440
To certain members of the listening audience and therefore WCSB advises listener discretion.

536
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,620
And you know what? We almost forgot your other song, Dr. Howell.

537
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,720
Is it time? Well, we better get it out.

538
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,480
I was, of course, in the Harryhausen movie.

539
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,740
He didn't pee on the fire but blew out wine from his cheeks.

540
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,620
But today they could do it.

541
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,180
Right, it was much more tasteful.

542
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,620
And now the one more song.

543
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,160
Well, constrained by the moral of the story.

544
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,520
The one that's not the moral of the time.

545
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:31,040
Okay, we're going to take this opportunity to make a clean recording of yet another of an unrecorded Dr. Howell song.

546
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,800
Dave, you can stay on the phone, but I'm going to pull your volume all the way down.

547
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,560
Be glad it's not your pants.

548
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,000
Okay, there goes Dave.

549
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,020
Now I'm going to pull me all the way down and try not to squeak this squeaky chair.

550
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:46,760
Squeak.

551
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,200
And...

552
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Dave is lighting up his pipe.

553
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:57,140
Endless, endless, endless slack.

554
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,640
For he knows the time is ripe.

555
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,540
Endless, endless, endless slack.

556
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,000
On the saucers we shall rise.

557
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:14,240
Endless, endless, endless slack.

558
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,460
To orgasm in the skies.

559
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,140
Endless, endless, endless slack.

560
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,040
Endless, endless, endless slack.

561
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,380
Now the day of doom approaches.

562
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,900
Endless, endless, endless slack.

563
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,400
To kill the pinks like scuttling roaches.

564
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,280
Endless, endless, endless slack.

565
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,520
Just the elect can get on board.

566
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,840
Endless, endless, endless slack.

567
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,420
Where all treasures shall be stored.

568
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,040
Endless, endless, endless slack.

569
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,620
I'm paid up and here's my ticket.

570
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,860
Endless, endless, endless slack.

571
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,760
Now I'll tell the boss to stick it.

572
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,760
Endless, endless, endless slack.

573
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,700
Since I can't get it.

574
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Endless, endless, endless slack.

575
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,340
Endless, endless, endless slack.

576
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,820
Because of what I get from Bob.

577
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,400
Endless, endless, endless slack.

578
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,660
Yet he's spirits joined together.

579
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,280
Endless, endless, endless slack.

580
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,520
Now prepare for stormy weather.

581
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:51,020
Endless, endless, endless slack.

582
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,720
Joy shall follow with no grieving.

583
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,960
Endless, endless, endless slack.

584
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,720
For what we are about to be receiving.

585
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,800
Endless, endless, endless slack.

586
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,880
Endless, endless, endless slack.

587
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,160
Endless, endless, endless, endless slack.

588
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:32,880
What we are about to see here,

589
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,680
Our only question left,

590
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,240
Can anything be thatFor what we stand in our midst?

591
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,200
But all the more will attracting

592
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:38,200


593
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:38,200


594
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:38,300
Have you ever seen any

595
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,560
Even a single ITU

596
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,340
Or, or, or a show

597
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:46,500
Show you they sing?

598
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,560
are by internet.

599
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,620
And this is quite a long list.

600
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,520
And in fact,

601
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,380
it's listed in terms of who

602
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,500
has been connected the longest.

603
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,420
The list that I'm looking at

604
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,460
right now. Does it say so many

605
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,320
number of viewers, peak so many?

606
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,740
I mean, that's what we have.

607
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,340
Well, this one's different,

608
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,000
but I'm seeing

609
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,780
the one at the very top.

610
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,480
Okay. Well, most

611
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,420
of the listeners here have been listening for 30

612
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,400
minutes or an hour and a half or two

613
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,940
hours and 50 minutes.

614
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,320
Then there's somebody who's been listening

615
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,360
for nine hours. Somebody in the United

616
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,420
States has been listening for two days.

617
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,080
But

618
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,300
in the region of

619
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,680
Saxony in the country of Germany,

620
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,380
in the city

621
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,740
of Leipzig,

622
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,460
there are two people

623
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,660
who have been listening to WCSB

624
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,000
for 12 days,

625
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,440
seven hours, 53 minutes

626
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,800
and 53 seconds.

627
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,060
I didn't

628
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,700
deliberately put on this

629
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,740
background music

630
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,180
for them.

631
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,700
I put it on and I just now realized

632
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,700
that the composer of this music in the

633
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,760
background worked across

634
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,600
the street from where our

635
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,060
friends in Germany live.

636
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,940
The eminent Herr Bach of Leipzig.

637
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,360
Yes.

638
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,280
Right across the street from

639
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,500
Bucky and Tanya's place.

640
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,240
And we must say praise

641
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,420
to Bucky and Tanya.

642
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,560
What was it?

643
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,100
Scribble, scribble, scribble, eh, Mr. Bach?

644
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,740
Make the money to support

645
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,440
your numerous progeny.

646
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,680
Anyway, yeah, they're

647
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,540
right there across the city.

648
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,720
It's such a, we'd wake up in the morning in their

649
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,480
guest room, throw

650
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,740
open the windows and you could see the big church

651
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,340
down there where

652
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,540
often there would be a quartet or

653
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,460
something outside whipping

654
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,660
out all of this

655
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,720
very same tune that we hear in the

656
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,640
background from the Brandenburg Concerto.

657
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,300
It's my favorite. Although this is

658
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,420
Wendy Carlos performing.

659
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,340
The Moog synthesizer.

660
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,080
The wave of the future.

661
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,600
Yeah, so, uh...

662
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,440
No one listening in Berlin, I suppose.

663
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,700
Um, everything...

664
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,660
Well, there's British Columbia

665
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,200
and Victoria.

666
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,780
Somebody's been listening for nine hours

667
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,420
there. Nine hours.

668
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,340
They must have died by the radio.

669
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,460
If anybody can identify

670
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,680
how many kids J.S. Bach had,

671
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,580
then they win a special

672
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,820
prize from WCSD for listening

673
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,220
to the radio for nine hours.

674
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,520
If they would just slow down and stop moving

675
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,180
around, it would be easier to count them.

676
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,900
I believe

677
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,600
that was said in a contemporary

678
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,080
account.

679
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,320
I'm trying to figure out which...

680
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,540
There were the sons of Bach. There was

681
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,240
C.P.E. Bach and

682
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,380
all those other... P.D.Q. Bach?

683
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,140
Yeah, they were all composers.

684
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,660
That was not a real name.

685
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,940
That was a joke.

686
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,780
Well, that's a guy who called...

687
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,540
He called himself that.

688
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,020
He did produce music.

689
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,460
Not actually a relative, but

690
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,680
C.P.E. Bach was one

691
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,860
of the celebrated sons

692
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,440
of Bach.

693
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,480
Apparently, Bach would have been

694
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,460
completely forgotten, except

695
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,980
for... Was it Mendel?

696
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:03,880
Mendelssohn?

697
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,160
Mendelssohn, yeah.

698
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,560
Discovering ancient musty

699
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,520
manuscripts. Right.

700
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,140
There's a big statue of Mendelssohn

701
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,740
in Leipzig.

702
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,440
But in the Third Reich,

703
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,420
one could not listen to the

704
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,300
Jewish music of Mendelssohn.

705
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,360
And one could not use the Jewish

706
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,780
inventions of Einstein.

707
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:24,620
No.

708
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,580
But you see, you lose

709
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,320
a lot that way.

710
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,580
Yeah, you lose a lot

711
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,640
when you start picking on

712
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,580
weirdos and immigrants.

713
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,020
You lose a whole

714
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,780
lot.

715
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,040
So let that be a lesson

716
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,720
to you.

717
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:42,820
Yeah.

718
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,360
Exactly.

719
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,420
I was wondering if I could ask one question.

720
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,060
If anybody, perhaps

721
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,140
Dr. Howe, who's

722
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,540
a wizard, knows all kinds of things

723
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,520
and stuff, if he's ever seen the

724
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,600
final scenes of

725
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,100
Birth of a Nation, where the guys with

726
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,320
the Ku Klux Klan-looking

727
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,660
Teutonic Knights thing, and it looks almost the same

728
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,040
as the one propaganda picture

729
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,440
of Hitler, who also had the cowlick

730
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,020
and the mustache

731
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,500
20 years beforehand.

732
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
You know, stuff like that.

733
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:17,020
Well, they put it together in the same way, but Mr. Griffith

734
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,780
was first in creating the montage, which creates

735
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,360
an emotional connection.

736
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,380
That nasty old racist did invent some stuff.

737
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,800
He invented movies, more or less, and he couldn't

738
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,820
understand why is everybody so upset?

739
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,340
Why am I only being historical here?

740
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,440
And so many people thought so, like Woodrow

741
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,560
Wilson thought that it was absolutely historical, but

742
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,780
Griffith was disturbed, and so he made his next movie, Intolerance,

743
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,960
his masterpiece, which lost everything.

744
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,980
It was a huge financial flop-a-roo.

745
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,400
We saw a four and a half hour restored version of that.

746
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,100
I mean, they...

747
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,240
Was it tinted?

748
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,080
They restored it using stills.

749
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:12,660
It flips through time, through various ages, so you have ancient Babylon, but you also have...

750
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:20,040
Huguenots being exterminated, and then there's the 20th century story, and so they showed pictures.

751
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,120
So after the birth of the nation, there's this intolerance, which is against intolerance, right?

752
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:32,260
Well, intolerance is supposed to be, yes, about the phenomenon of intolerance throughout human history.

753
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:42,500
But there's no way he couldn't figure out that African-Americans and Huguenots could, you know, be kind of the same thing.

754
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,560
Native Americans and Huguenots, you know...

755
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,060
Very Eurocentric view, and I just...

756
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:59,960
Yes, it's a shame that our precursors in the past weren't as hip and aware as we were,

757
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:05,760
and we're so sluggishly tied down by their outmoded and harmful beliefs.

758
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,720
And lots of people want to make those days come back.

759
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,900
Yes.

760
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,120
Yes.

761
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:12,740
Especially now.

762
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,680
They want to bring them back and make the new version of Birth of a Nation.

763
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:24,380
Actually, there was, to add confusion to this topic, a recent movie called Birth of a Nation,

764
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:30,460
which had nothing but nothing to do with Griffith's original film.

765
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,860
But there you go.

766
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,140
You know, nothing is perfect.

767
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,900
No period is perfect.

768
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,080
And we do advance with great difficulty.

769
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,000
But that advance shouldn't be given away.

770
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,380
I think we're in a two-steps-back period right now.

771
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,320
Yes, the reactionary period.

772
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,420
Especially they didn't like having a black president, and so now those...

773
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,240
I think the woman bosses bothered quite a few people.

774
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:01,740
Yes.

775
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,320
Including a lot of dumb women.

776
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,980
But what we were going to do right was to wipe out a republic which was a very liberal democracy.

777
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,060
I said something...

778
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:16,800
When I was in Arkansas having dinner with our old friends,

779
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:23,100
I said something that visibly disturbed our old friend Papa Joe Mama.

780
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,380
Ah, that would not be too difficult to do.

781
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,240
I think it was something blunt like,

782
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,460
The stupid ones won this time!

783
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,040
It was pretty blunt.

784
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,840
Well, he was...

785
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,700
And it's an unfair overgeneralization of...

786
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,980
Well, still, with a certain element of accuracy that...

787
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,780
That's the problem.

788
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,700
Yeah, that is a problem.

789
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,260
But, you know, if you're going to hold onto those beliefs,

790
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,400
you're going to have to be prepared to defend them,

791
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,400
as I understand Papa Joe Mama will,

792
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:08,960
like our own Philo and others who are sure that this worldview is just right for them.

793
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,260
Well, it may be,

794
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:14,300
because they've been using the same lines for 25 years now.

795
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,420
But let's not get into that.

796
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,900
We usually don't.

797
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,120
There's room for everyone on this planet, except for pinks.

798
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,140
Yeah, that's right.

799
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,120
The subgenius church is a big tent,

800
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,480
but let's not get out of proportion here.

801
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,440
Look, somebody has to clean up after those elephants.

802
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,440
That's right.

803
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,600
It's a big tent, and it's hard to have a cat circus...

804
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,560
That's your elephant.

805
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,200
...as we maestros of the cat circuses,

806
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:50,900
if you are the ringleaders of the kitty cat circus called Church of the Subgenius.

807
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,960
Well, it's just a herding...

808
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,920
And don't wag your stinky pointed finger at me,

809
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,200
because my father was a policeman.

810
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,400
If you don't believe me, then...

811
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,740
I thought your father was Comptroller of something.

812
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,560
He was a public executioner,

813
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,540
and he was also a fried egg boy.

814
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,580
He was a whitch hunter.

815
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,460
He was a witch hunter, Dave, Luca.

816
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,880
He was a diner, yeah.

817
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,940
Witch finder, general.

818
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,820
He was like, what do they call it?

819
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,320
Yerubus or Santeria or something like that.

820
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,580
They talk about poulet, bass, and all that stuff.

821
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,860
And they waved him around, too.

822
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,920
Like, it's gonna make some difference.

823
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,820
Like if you were to pick up a snake and mumble a bunch of words

824
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,400
and walk around in a room,

825
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,320
and with your eyes crossed,

826
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:37,980
and your...

827
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,820
You know, trying to eat part of a mango at the same time

828
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,320
and keep the snake from biting you.

829
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,040
That's funny. He just described my first star work.

830
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,360
Well, from this snake handling and speaking in tongues,

831
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,660
some people go and leave the ceremony

832
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,940
and put on their four-star general's uniform

833
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,940
and go to their job at the Pentagon.

834
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,520
Uh-huh.

835
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,060
Yes, indeed.

836
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,840
I'm richer than them,

837
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,920
because I don't have to get up that early in the morning.

838
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,300
That's right.

839
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,820
I can get up whenever I want.

840
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,820
To be power...mad power brokers,

841
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,380
you have to work all the time.

842
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,380
There's no lazing and taking the hobo's easy way.

843
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,300
I'll take the hobo's easy way.

844
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,220
There's always somebody behind you

845
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,340
nipping at your hind end.

846
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,420
Actually, I'm probably one of the most emergentile

847
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,320
of art bums and hobos,

848
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,160
so I'm not sure if I really fit into that category.

849
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,260
Well, it's an honorific.

850
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:36,740
Um...

851
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,660
Yeah.

852
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,640
It's like a plasticine area degree

853
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,040
from the University of Arizona, or state.

854
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,200
Okay.

855
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,020
A lot of people went there.

856
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,660
Some of them took suturifics,

857
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,640
some of them took pause machines

858
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,480
and held them lightly to their breasts

859
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,700
and began to pray.

860
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,540
Dr. Howe lived in Arizona for a long time.

861
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:58,620
Yes.

862
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,180
In fact, I am a graduate of the University of Arizona,

863
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,120
which is at the moment ahead

864
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,640
in the field of science, geochronology, space, etc.

865
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,060
I've been doing a lot of research,

866
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,660
exploration, and all sorts of developing things

867
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,920
on the frontiers of science.

868
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,180
Which is now against the law, by the way.

869
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,880
Yes, the subgeniuses always were about

870
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,940
the forbidden sciences.

871
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,140
Well, now all science is forbidden,

872
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,460
so our role has expanded considerably.

873
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,360
Yay, us!

874
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,880
Hey, man, who do you believe?

875
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,400
A meteorological scientist who's been studying

876
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,820
for like 12 years?

877
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,620
Or a talk show guy?

878
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,480
Or a TV host who's claimed to fame

879
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,440
that he might want to be a weatherman

880
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,560
when he was in high school?

881
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,460
Everybody believed that guy.

882
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,400
Well, you don't need one of those

883
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,900
to tell which way the wind blows.

884
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,140
Naked fuse! Naked fuse!

885
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,580
Oh, no, I mean faked news!

886
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:54,580
Faked news!

887
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:55,540
Yes.

888
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,320
Or both. Why not both?

889
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:57,780
Why not both?

890
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,440
Fake news is a naked fuse.

891
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,420
It's designed to blow things up.

892
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,520
To blow up your rage, your moral outrage.

893
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,940
A trigger, if you will.

894
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:12,080
Yeah, some people love to get their moral outrage triggered,

895
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,300
because that's the juiciest feeling.

896
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:19,900
When they say that insult without using any shift key

897
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,780
or punctuation at all, and then they hit send.

898
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,880
They feel so smart.

899
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,680
They feel righteous to indulge in the sin of wrath.

900
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:31,880
Mmm.

901
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:38,280
I'm simply sick of this earthly existence of such a plastic...

902
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,560
Well, you have to wait another year.

903
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,900
But maybe not a full year.

904
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,780
Maybe not a whole year, maybe just till May.

905
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,220
Yes, there could be that.

906
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,680
Well, maybe you could have it, maybe you feel like...

907
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,460
As you go along, as you feel like.

908
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,160
Like, hey, we're gonna have one December, you know.

909
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,080
Hell, we'll have one every week.

910
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,320
Hey, every day's X day if you have a gun.

911
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,660
Now you're talking.

912
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,520
Yeah, unfortunately.

913
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,560
I don't know what the hell he's saying, but he's talking.

914
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,140
Well, I'm trying to remember which Arkansas subgenius said that.

915
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,540
It may have been the late Dreloyd.

916
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,340
I'm pretty sure it's somebody late.

917
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,140
Dreloyd is no longer with us.

918
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,500
Dreloyd was...

919
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,860
Yeah, he was the keyboardist for Doctors for Bob.

920
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:29,640
He had diabetes so bad that he basically ended his own life

921
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,580
at the...

922
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,940
age 25 or something like that.

923
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,140
I know he was under 30.

924
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:44,280
He went around nonchalantly asking friends to hold on to certain of his possessions.

925
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,040
For instance, he sent me some artwork.

926
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:50,240
He said, oh, I've been meaning to send you this artwork, collages I did for a long time.

927
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,660
And he got this other friend to say, I'm gonna be out of town for three weeks.

928
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,540
Can you keep my synthesizer? I'm afraid it'll get stolen.

929
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:57,820
Stuff like that.

930
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,720
And then after three weeks, he didn't come back.

931
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,020
And it became a police case.

932
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,680
And I'm just remembering this now.

933
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:11,780
In the Little Rock newspaper, it said that the police were looking into this missing individual

934
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:19,320
who was associated when they found documents in his room associated with a cult

935
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,400
called the Church of the Subgenius.

936
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,780
Wouldn't you know it.

937
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:25,580
Yeah.

938
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,480
That must have something to do with his disappearance.

939
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,860
Actually, it had to do with him staying alive as long as he lived.

940
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,560
I believe that.

941
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,060
But, yes.

942
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:43,060
Well, if you like wearing neo-Nazi lingerie and you go to a Republican birthday party and stuff like that,

943
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:50,740
it doesn't necessarily mean that you're auto-fileting yourself while you're being coronaled by Satan or something.

944
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:55,160
You just described most of my summer jobs in the early 80s, Dave.

945
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:55,980
Goodness.

946
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,740
Not suitable for airplay.

947
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,400
No.

948
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,860
I had to work for the police.

949
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:06,920
I had to work for the rich folks of Dallas as a wedding videographer.

950
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,780
Back then, only specialists had video cameras.

951
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,840
They were called Betamax cameras, believe it or not.

952
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:22,000
And I filmed, I was hired on Saturday nights to film the debutante parties, the coming out balls.

953
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,640
The debutante's ball, huh?

954
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,380
Of rich Dallasites.

955
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:29,620
And that was how I learned that the most deadly creature on the planet

956
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:35,980
is not a virus, nor a great white shark, but a drunk rich person.

957
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,120
Oh, yeah.

958
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,520
They can do more damage than anything else on the planet.

959
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,460
And I think we may see proof of that coming up soon.

960
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:50,260
Did I tell you the one time I was attacked by rich people on horseback?

961
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:58,300
I'd gone too far on a road where they thought they owned the road, even though it was publicly announced and stuff.

962
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,800
And I got out there and they surrounded me.

963
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,140
This drunk husband and drunk wife.

964
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,580
Rich people.

965
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,140
On horseback.

966
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,020
That's scary.

967
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,100
That is terrifying.

968
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:08,800
Made me stop the car.

969
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,440
And, what are you doing here? What are you doing here?

970
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,260
What do you mean, what am I doing here?

971
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,980
This is a private road. Get out of here.

972
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,400
Dave.

973
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:23,200
And their faces were bright red and they were drunk as hell and I wanted to run them over, but that would hurt the horsies.

974
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,660
And that would feel real bad.

975
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,280
I don't let red face die.

976
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,800
Drunks tell me what to do.

977
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,960
Oh, well, I mean, this is...

978
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,900
Oh, I'm sorry, officer.

979
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:40,140
Excuse me, I didn't realize your naturally ruddy complexion threw me off for a moment.

980
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,120
Well, we've got five minutes coming down.

981
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:45,900
Five minutes?

982
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,580
Yep, until next show.

983
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,520
Normally it would be crap radio here.

984
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,440
Jays.

985
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,160
And perhaps it shall be.

986
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:55,880
Oh, yeah?

987
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,260
I don't think it'll be crap radio.

988
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:58,260


989
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,240
That's a subjective judgment.

990
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,280
No, it's not crap radio.

991
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,300
You mean Radio KRAP?

992
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:09,580
No, that's actually the name of our buddy Keith's show.

993
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,360
But Keith is already at Wisteria.

994
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,740
Yes, Keith drove the truck of all of the Starwood equipment.

995
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,520
These are confusing times.

996
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:25,400
Well, there's a lot of crossover between WCSB and the Starwood Festival.

997
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,100
We wouldn't have a Starwood Festival.

998
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,640
He drove all the equipment down to make it a big party.

999
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,060
And you rented the truck.

1000
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,220
Yes, I did.

1001
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,580
Yes, it's a team effort here.

1002
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:43,620
And, uh, yep, yep, yep, we're gonna have to head down there tomorrow.

1003
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:53,380
And so I'm going to, uh, I'm gonna say one more time, friends, if you want more information about the Church of the Subgenius,

1004
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,080
or its associated, uh, website,

1005
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:05,040
friends and, and, uh, festivals, such as, uh, Dr. Hal at AskDrHal.com.

1006
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,220
That is a URL, AskDrHal.com.

1007
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,060
Or StarwoodFestival.com.

1008
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:16,520
You can find all those at Subgenius.com.

1009
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,400
Easy to remember.

1010
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:25,780
And I'm going to, uh, just turn up this, this is one of my favorite pieces of the Brandenburg Concertos,

1011
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,540
performed by Wendy Carlos.

1012
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,020
I'll just let that take us out.

1013
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,180
And good night.

1014
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,200
Good night.

1015
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:38,280
Thank you, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1016
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,980
Thank you, Dr. Hal.

1017
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,380
And thank you, Princess Wee.

1018
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,640
And my mother thanks you.

1019
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,800
And my father thanks you.

1020
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,060
And, uh, thank you.

1021
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,580
Thank you.

1022
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,180
Thank you.

1023
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:47,500
Thank you.

1024
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:48,280
Thank you.

1025
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:48,840
Thank you.

1026
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:48,840


1027
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:49,080
Thank you.

1028
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:49,340
Thank you.

1029
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:49,700
Thank you.

1030
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:52,840
Thank you.

1031
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:23,360
Thank you P

1032
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:25,640
stick.

1033
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,780
で

1034
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,060
Thank you.

1035
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,220
Thank you.

1036
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,220
Thank you.

1037
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:02,740
Thank you.

1038
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,240
Thank you.

1039
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,780
Thank you.

1040
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,980
Thank you.

1041
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,300
Thank you.

1042
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,160
Thank you.

1043
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,660
Thank you.
