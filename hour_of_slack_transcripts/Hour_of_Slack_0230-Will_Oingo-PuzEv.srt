1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,120
Ah, friends, you ever get a song in your head that you just can't get rid of no matter how hard you try?

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,460
And you just keep thinking about it and it just won't go away. I have some like that.

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,920
A human puppy is in the club.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,080
A nude is club has a certain sense of moral decency.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,420
What hypocrisy, what rampant evil and undisguised form raging like a giant monster.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,500
Hypocrisy.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
We're going to buy you a magazine.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,100
There's got to be a certain amount of hypocrisy.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,700
And a certain number of callers. And if you call 848-442-5128, you'll be able to talk to me.

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,500
The lower archivist of Dini Church.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,520
I don't get much lower, friend.

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,820
Where who's talking?

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,660
Because they call 848-442-5128.

14
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,260
He's up there.

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,480
Northern County.

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,480


17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,480


18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,480


19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,480


20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,480


21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,480


22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,480


23
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,480
Oh

24
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,180
Oh

25
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,020
Oh

26
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,160
We're all sitting around in a circle and I see that they're all like waiting for something really to happen

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,800
So then my aunt grace does something to my aunt Ruby

28
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,680
and all of a sudden she's talking with other voices and

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,660
Tell them things that nobody else could know if they was normal

30
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,680
And all of a sudden Aunt Ruby points right at me and says that Aunt Grace has to give me

31
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,320
13 guardians to take care of

32
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,620
They're gonna protect me and tell me things nobody can know

33
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,440
It was it was strange

34
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,460
Everything that was going on, but I couldn't do anything about it

35
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,020
It was like I was tied to the chair only

36
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,420
There wasn't any

37
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,340
Holding me there

38
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:37,640
She says these guardians are the spirits of 13 of my dead ancestors. I

39
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,900
heard it most of them before

40
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,800
they were kind of

41
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,780
honey heroes like

42
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,880
Some have been hung for murder and things like that

43
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,400
And whenever I'm in a tight spot

44
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,780
They help

45
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,160
They really do. They're in your mind Bob

46
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,260
The only help they're giving you is straight to hell

47
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,340
Don't start talking about your

48
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,280
Loving words

49
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,260
And your loving ideas

50
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,240
Permanent

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,980
Bob's

52
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,840
Black wine

53
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:07,440
Raining

54
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,860
His glitter

55
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:09,600
Death lines

56
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,400
All of these

57
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,840
Don't like

58
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
X or Y

59
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,800
The meaning of

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,480
What works

61
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,260
Is what

62
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,840
Do this

63
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,060
Where we're wrapped in a

64
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,340
Fossil

65
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,200
Because of

66
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,300
I know what it feels like when she comes

67
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,820
She said never to tell about her

68
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,960
She doesn't even want me to talk to you

69
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,820
You're a

70
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,380
You're a

71
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,520
You're a

72
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:32,520


73
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:32,520


74
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,780
Listen to me

75
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,040
Try to grasp what I'm saying. She can't touch us your Bob

76
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,020
We're sleeping here. We have the protection of Almighty God

77
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,980
To listen to me

78
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,420
She isn't here. She doesn't exist

79
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,580
Look at me

80
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
I'm not scared

81
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,440
I'm not staying

82
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,240
I'll talk about it like that

83
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,460
You don't know her. You don't know what she can do. You don't know the power she has.

84
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,600
I know the power Jesus Christ has, Bob.

85
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,500
I know the power.

86
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,520
I guess it goes for a day or a night.

87
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,360
He doesn't know how to sing.

88
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,920
He doesn't know how to rock.

89
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,420
They speak in different languages.

90
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,220
Well, you know, there's a little of both.

91
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,400
There's a little of both.

92
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,120
There's a little of both.

93
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,040
There's a little of both.

94
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,020
There's a lot of one of them.

95
00:05:53,640 --> 00:06:00,460
Well, dear listeners, we had a lot of calls from people who weren't expecting to hear the Hour of Slack this time of night.

96
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,800
And I can understand that.

97
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,080
You know, you tell them, what is this? What is this? Hey, hey, hey.

98
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,940
Well, this is the Hour of Slack.

99
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,800
Oh, I should have known, they keep saying.

100
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,600
And that's right. You should have known the second you heard it.

101
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,320
Well, another song now.

102
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,920
And this is by that group that I play way too much.

103
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,940
But this is a special one because this is one that's helped me out a lot this year.

104
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,200
Not to get too personal or anything, but when things go wrong, and they so often do,

105
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:36,140
I would just reflect upon the message of this song and feel better.

106
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,900
So here they are. Hope you like it.

107
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,800
I'll go let somebody in.

108
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,260
I don't know why I feel this way.

109
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,800
I don't know.

110
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,200
I don't know if it's right or wrong to laugh at this fortune.

111
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,780
Darkness can never last too long.

112
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,680
And every time I think I fall, there's nobody around to hold me up.

113
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,060
And it seems like the world has come to an end.

114
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,160
I look before my eyes and try to face this crisis.

115
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,060
And I don't know if it's all or nothing at all.

116
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,440
And every hole is a raging fire.

117
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,740
I try to come.

118
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,040
I try to fall.

119
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,320
But there's no way.

120
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,640
And next thing I know, I go down.

121
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,820
It doesn't matter.

122
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,200
It really doesn't matter.

123
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,960
It doesn't burn.

124
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,340
And I don't feel a thing.

125
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,060
It doesn't sting.

126
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,020
It doesn't hurt.

127
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,520
It really doesn't matter.

128
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,280
It doesn't burn.

129
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,580
And I don't feel a thing.

130
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,840
And when I find myself falling, and I hit the body.

131
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,440
It only makes me laugh.

132
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,960
It only makes me laugh.

133
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,200
When I go down the hall and I hit the body.

134
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,540
And I still met a fellow.

135
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,400
And love is not the honey but the mountain sour.

136
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,260
The woman became a monster.

137
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,900
And everyone I knew had become a stranger.

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,020
Then the roof went black and I loved the worst thing.

139
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,720
Floor opened up.

140
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,120
Down I went.

141
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,040
It doesn't hurt.

142
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,720
Ooh.

143
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,520
It really doesn't matter.

144
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,240
It doesn't burn.

145
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:10,880
Oh.

146
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,680
I don't feel a thing.

147
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,420
It doesn't sting.

148
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,180
Oh yeah.

149
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,920
It really doesn't matter.

150
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,580
It doesn't hurt.

151
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,260
Ooh.

152
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,080
I don't give a damn.

153
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,780
It doesn't burn.

154
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:19,900
Ooh.

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,800
It only makes me laugh.

156
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:39,660
You give me down.

157
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,700
Oh every time I play.

158
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,880
When I fall, I would die.

159
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,240
It doesn't matter.

160
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,100
If I fall, I would start fryin' that I ate.

161
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,100


162
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,900
Yeah I feel like a phase out of nowhere.

163
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:49,900


164
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:49,900


165
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:49,900


166
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:49,900


167
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:49,900


168
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:49,900


169
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:49,900


170
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,100
Just a little pain

171
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

172
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

173
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,100
Remembering when I was a young man

174
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,700
Everything seemed to turn against me

175
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,760
I didn't know solar was an alien place

176
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,700
The sun was covered by a dark cloud

177
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,760
Though I tried, I couldn't find a way to escape

178
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,100
The only way to go straight down

179
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,480
Doesn't hurt, oh, it really doesn't matter

180
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,940
Doesn't burn, oh, no

181
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,180
I don't feel a thing, no, it's the same, oh, yeah

182
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,040
It really doesn't matter, doesn't hurt, oh

183
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,760
I don't feel a thing

184
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,060
When I find myself falling and I hit the ground

185
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,320
It only makes me laugh, only makes me laugh

186
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,340
When I go down the hall and I hit the ground

187
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,780
It only makes me laugh, only makes me laugh

188
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,840
Only makes me laugh, only makes me laugh

189
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,300
I don't know why I feel this way

190
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,320
I don't know if it's right or wrong

191
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,660
To laugh at misfortune

192
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,040
Darkness can never last too long

193
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,320
When you laugh in this place

194
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,520
Oh, yeah, when you laugh in this place

195
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,700
I don't know why I feel this way

196
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,500
I don't know if it's right or wrong

197
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,840
To laugh at misfortune

198
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,460
I don't know why I feel this way

199
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,220
Darkness can never last too long

200
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,600
When you laugh in this place

201
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,960
Oh, yeah, sorry.

202
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,560
That was Oingo Boingo with Only Makes Me Laugh.

203
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,080
And it does.

204
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,320
It only makes me laugh when I think of all the people

205
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,860
that are tuned in unexpectedly to this.

206
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,180
Oh, and they don't like it either.

207
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,120
They'd rather be listening to something else.

208
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,680
Well, you'll hate this too, then.

209
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,780
Paradise you try to attain.

210
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,800
And the wind's coming up.

211
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,080
Oh, there's a storm a-coming.

212
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,840
Hurricane Bob batting down the hatches.

213
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,780
Keelhaul the porthole.

214
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,440
I don't like the looks of that cloud there.

215
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,660
There's a storm a-coming.

216
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,680
It looks like a big pipe sticking out.

217
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,600
Run for the cellar!

218
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,020
Into the storm cellar!

219
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,920
Popo, Popo, where are you?

220
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,120
Get in the house.

221
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,920
Oh, my gosh, we're being carried up.

222
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:19,960
Carried away.

223
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,180
To a land of giants.

224
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,340
Oh, oh, oh.

225
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,500
Have some more church air.

226
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,000
Hmm, Bob.

227
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,200
Look, we landed right on that man.

228
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,880
Where are we?

229
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,040
I think it's the corner of Grundoon and Simoleon.

230
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,040
It's the corner of Breadbasket and...

231
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,320
Who is that man?

232
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,320
I would like to shake his hand.

233
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,760
He made my baby fall in love.

234
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,380
That's right.

235
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,460
We landed right on that man.

236
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,600
He's right on top of him.

237
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,240
Oh, no.

238
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,600
And he's still smiling.

239
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,020
Ping-pong the bobbits.

240
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,340
We spare no expense on this wonderful show to bring you the finest in audio techniques.

241
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,800
Why, yes, we have our one record and one speed and one turntable.

242
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,780
And one brain between the whole six of us in here.

243
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,320
But I figure that some music is better than no music.

244
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,000
And, uh, we, and Wellman's gotta get here eventually.

245
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,980
And so now let's move to the next, uh, topic on our, uh, discussion.

246
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,600
Um, should, uh, bicycles be allowed on the other side of the road?

247
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,400
That's right.

248
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:36,540
Let's, uh, open the discussion with, uh, Dr. Yagrundis Quimby, president of the Armenian

249
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:42,920
Bicycling Association and for a long time a charter member of the Velocipedes Against Racism.

250
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,780
Dr. Yagrundis, uh, he broke off in his bicycle.

251
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,780
Oh, yes, that's right.

252
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,080
Uh...

253
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,220
He had to go back to, uh, Nebraska to get a new one.

254
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:50,880
It's true.

255
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,760
We're not able to have Dr. Quimby speak to us directly, but perhaps by a phone hookup,

256
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,560
even through this terrible storm...

257
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,480
We can channel him.

258
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,100
And if we can't do that, let's go ahead and run this film.

259
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,080
Oh, that's not working either.

260
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,020
Oh, we have massive sprocket damage here.

261
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,680
The projector blew away in the storm.

262
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,980
Oh, well, the audio visual aids department...

263
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,600
Here, we...

264
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,640
Try down the...

265
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,720
Instead, let's play this old cassette.

266
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,400
Oh, that old log blew away with the cassette strapped to it.

267
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,340
Well, let's think of something to say.

268
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,840
It reminds me of...

269
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,140
No, there went all the words.

270
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,240
What can we say, friends, that hasn't been said already?

271
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,640
Yes, you're listening to the subgenius radio program and...

272
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,440
Uh, uh, uh, uh...

273
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,540
Sure, it's more than an hour.

274
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,620
And this morning, it's certainly less than a radio program.

275
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,780
Well, you know, we try to do what we can to bring you, the listeners,

276
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,120
the type of broadcasting that you especially abominate and love.

277
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,140
That's right.

278
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,420
Now, I noticed we received some mail this morning,

279
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,080
as I looked into the old subgenius box, and if it's not too evil and...

280
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,880
I'm sure I'm glad we're in this other room with a couple of pieces of shielding

281
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,020
between us and him opening those letters.

282
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,160
Oh, ignore that ticking noise.

283
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,840
It's just my epizootis.

284
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,600
I snap, you know, when my fingers are on the ground.

285
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:15,600


286
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,260
Okay, put the cassette on of the letter being opened.

287
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:27,540
Yes, this is from a little, uh, Elmer Quigley out in Ferndale.

288
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,940
Born in Brule in 1891, present place of residence Cologne, just beginning his 30th year.

289
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,640
A fine presence, very intelligent.

290
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,480
Pants not so...oh, paints not so much for art's sake as from laziness and millinery tradition.

291
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,600
His coloring is sometimes perforated, sometimes tubular.

292
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,180
His concretions are full of vestiges of plants and animals, dehumanized.

293
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,840
His nickname is Pointed Buttercup.

294
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:00,440
The gouty, the impotent, and the shipwrecked can always apply to him for details of the depths of the sea and the Arctic currents.

295
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,900
Well, uh, what's your interpretation of this, Dr. Stang?

296
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,780
I don't know, I'd, uh...

297
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,040
Oh, if I stanged through the...

298
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,820
Take him out and shoot him, I'd say.

299
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,780
Well, that's one thing that can...one thing that can be done.

300
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,580
Well, that's one thing that can...one thing that can be done.

301
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Yes, that's true. If you seek him by night, he is in the light.

302
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,560
If you seek him by day, he is asleep.

303
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,640
Moral, let us not be afraid of falling into the...

304
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,480
He was once a little green dab of clay.

305
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:39,960
Gumby!

306
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,400
But you should see what Gumby can do today.

307
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,040
Gumby!

308
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,480
He can walk into any book with his pony pal, Pokey, too.

309
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,480
And he'll find fun where there's none, if you'd like him to.

310
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,780
And if he likes, he can change into something new.

311
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,120
Gumby!

312
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,280
He makes toys, too.

313
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,620
He can do things they could never do.

314
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,140
Gumby!

315
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:28,360
What you see is a mystery, but he makes it all come true.

316
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,460
If you've got a heart, then Gumby's a part of you.

317
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,700
Gumby!

318
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,280
Gumby!

319
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,940
Gumby!

320
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,760
Gumby!

321
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:02,720
What you have is a road in which gumby and cucaシ can aqua free natuurlijk lumor REPORT When you read the story of Keanu Reeves Partners,

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,340
you're on the right track.

323
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:12,760
You'll have so much fun today up here.

It's just a question of faith.

362
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,240
I don't know.

363
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,540
Can we all say...

364
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,360
I think we should all believe in a flow of love.

365
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:47,640
Instead of B-O-B, maybe F-O-O-V.

366
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,140
A crying child became a gallon.

367
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,220
The infant child was snatched away from mom to him.

368
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,260
He was becoming a pigeon.

369
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,100
You know, there's so many stories.

370
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,000
It's hard to tell which one of the two.

371
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,780
I suppose one of them is the best.

372
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,980
You know, the one that only the one who knew.

373
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,200
It's not the one.

374
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,220
Everybody loves King Corkus.

375
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,520
But who is B-O-B?

376
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,940
Who is Bob?

377
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,600
Who is Bob?

378
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,660
Did you ever stop to think for a second that Bob spoke backwards?

379
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:32,440
Bob?

380
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,400
I think that's very interesting.

381
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,180
I think that probably compared to McWally.

382
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,380
It's easy to see why.

383
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,380
Why did Bob get some of his faces as a music agent?

384
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,940
Obviously, it's because he's a castaneta.

385
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,600
Yeah!

386
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,480
I'm famous.

387
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,500
I'm a man who's got a man who's established himself.

388
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,700
I'm a man who's got the juiciest joke.

389
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,700
I'm a man who's got the manual!

390
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,080
Woo!

391
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,020
To touch the eternal.

392
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,420
To understand the mysterious.

393
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,200
To find out who we are.

394
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,340
It sometimes takes several hours to get a word out.

395
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,480
Meaning for life.

396
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,280
I don't judge.

397
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,460
I'm a gentle nature.

398
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,640
The game is only just the answer.

399
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,100
You listen to the answer.

400
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,640
You're alive.

401
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,140
You're alive.

402
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,440
You're alive.

403
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:22,460
You're alive.

404
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:22,460


405
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:22,460


406
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:22,460


407
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:31,700
so that the life-spirits of Omni will have resonance within,

408
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,060
that are those of our own inmost being and reality,

409
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,140
and so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.

410
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,460
That's what it's all finally about,

411
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,840
and that's what these clues help us to find within ourselves.

412
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:56,480
Myths are clues to the spiritual potentialities of the human life,

413
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,260
what we're capable of knowing within and experiencing within.

414
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,280
I'd like you to change the definition of the myth

415
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,240
from the search for meaning to the experience of meaning.

416
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,740
Yes, and Joseph Campbell changed that definition even later.

417
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,340
It wasn't even experiencing the myth.

418
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,960
It was experiencing that man.

419
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,540
That man, I've had to explain him to a lot of people.

420
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,340
A lot of new, either new listeners or, you know, one-time listeners,

421
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,440
and this may be the only time, but they want, who is Bob?

422
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,480
Well, I hope you know by now.

423
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,100
But if you don't know, well, what's my theme here?

424
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,260
I didn't understand it at all.

425
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,720
I didn't understand it at all.

426
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,460
What's he doing? What's the message? What's he trying to say?

427
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,800
I heard this so many times tonight.

428
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,820
That's the message, that he's not trying to say it.

429
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,340
And that's what I told them all.

430
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,000
That's my theme.

431
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,180
Will's theme.

432
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,480
What was the theme of the show?

433
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,620
You got me.

434
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,500
We always figure the theme out when we're listening to him later.

435
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,900
Well, gentle listeners,

436
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,900
and those of you who'd rather be listening to someone else right now,

437
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,420
tonight you've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hours of Slack.

438
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,680
We did two of them tonight.

439
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,520
We made it through virtually unscathed here at the radio station.

440
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,980
Apparently, we scathed a few people out there in the listening audience,

441
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,620
which is apparently a lot bigger than it used to be.

442
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,380
We got a real nice call from Arlington, as a matter of fact,

443
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,660
and we don't get a lot from there.

444
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,360
So, for all of you who have never listened to the show before

445
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,520
and just happened to catch it tonight by accident,

446
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,060
what an accident it was,

447
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,920
I hope that your appetite has been whetted,

448
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,220
or if nothing else has been whetted,

449
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,460
I hope your appetite at least was whetted tonight

450
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,460
for more of this kind of stuff.

451
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,960
And believe me, there is more of this kind of stuff.

452
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,940
More than we could even begin to...

453
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,140
I don't even have time to tell you all about the Stark Fist of Removal

454
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,860
or Book of the Subgenius or Three Fisted Tales of Bob

455
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,140
or High Weirdness by Mail or Bob's Favorite Comics

456
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,720
or Arise, the Subgenius video, the movie.

457
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,660
I just don't...

458
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,320
I don't have time.

459
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,200
Nowhere near.

460
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,980
There's only four minutes left.

461
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,900
But if you want to find out a whole lot about

462
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,940
the Church of the Subgenius

463
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,180
and that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

464
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,280
there he is

465
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,740
on camera two.

466
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,740
Bring it up, okay.

467
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,820
And fade to...

468
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,340
two.

469
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,680
No, no, no, no.

470
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,700
Close up, zoom in.

471
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,360
Ah, there he is.

472
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,420
If you could just see his face,

473
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,580
those of you who spent the money,

474
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,780
you can see his face.

475
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,540
Nope, nope, no.

476
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,340
Well, he's gone.

477
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,780
That's Bobby for you.

478
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,520
If there's anything else about him you want to know,

479
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,360
I think it's been a fairly self-explanatory show tonight,

480
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,920
as they all are, really.

481
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,160
But if there's anything else you want to know,

482
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,580
feel free to write to the RPO box

483
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,500
and we'll send you some free information.

484
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,920
Every bit as free as the radio show you've been listening to.

485
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,220
Except it's not free, friends.

486
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,620
How about those pledges, huh?

487
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,220
Get them things.

488
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,940
And some of you have.

489
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,600
I'm happy to say.

490
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,580
And those of you that pledged your $60,

491
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,260
we've got the videos in as of today.

492
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,220
So those of you who pledged $60 and over,

493
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,180
we're going to be sending those videos out to you real soon.

494
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,640
And if you haven't paid that $60 or more or less pledge,

495
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,660
get it now, man, because we got the videos.

496
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,460
And if you want to pledge now,

497
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,380
if maybe you weren't listening to Pledge Drive Night,

498
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,220
if you will pledge $60 or more to this show,

499
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,160
we will send you a copy of Arise, the subgenius video,

500
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,680
the movie, a pristine cherry copy.

501
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,820
So be aware.

502
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,200
Oh, and that address.

503
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,400
Write to Bob at P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

504
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,940
And the zip code is 75214.

505
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,620
I may have said that too fast for some of you.

506
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:13,920
Please write to Bob at P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

507
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,140
And the zip code is 75214.

508
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,500
Thanks a lot for listening tonight, friends.

509
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,640
Hope you enjoyed at least some of the two hours.

510
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,580
I enjoyed just about all of it.

511
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,700
So thanks a lot.

512
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,360
Stay tuned to KNON for an excellent show or a cart.

513
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,520
Yeah, stay tuned for the cart,

514
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,660
which following the cart will be a fine show.

515
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,860
So thanks a lot.

516
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,480
Praise Bob.

517
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,000
His promise rings true.

518
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,000
Thank you.

519
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,580
Thank you.

520
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,360
Thank you.

521
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,360
Thank you.

522
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,220
Thank you.

523
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,780
Thank you.

524
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,400
Thank you.

525
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,200
Thank you.

526
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,940
Thank you.

527
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,860
Thank you.

528
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,040
Thank you.

529
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:22,920
Thank you.

530
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:56,640
Thank you.

531
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,900
Thank you.

532
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,280
Thank you.

533
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:23,860
Thank you.

534
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,080
Thank you.

535
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,520
Thank you.

536
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,740
Thank you.

537
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,260
Thank you.

538
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,620
Thank you.

539
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,640
Thank you.

540
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,440
