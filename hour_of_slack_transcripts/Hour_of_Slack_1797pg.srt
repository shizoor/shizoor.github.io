00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:12,000
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:20,320
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, Sacred Scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius.

3
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:29,260
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack and saint of sales on planet Earth.

4
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,220
Insert a thumb under the upper lip.

5
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:49,160
Oh yes, dear friends, this show, Hour of Slack number 1797, is in actuality Hour of Slack number 5 from the year of 1985.

6
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,580
Has this ever happened to you?

7
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:59,980
Why, I should have been there, Ted. It was great. There was free booze, great music, one of the best parties I ever went to.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Where were you that night?

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,180
Oh, I just kind of stayed home and watched TV. I guess I should have gone, huh?

10
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,720
Didn't you feel stupid? Didn't you wish you could go back to that night, that party?

11
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,200
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn how to do that very thing.

12
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:22,060
Introducing Bob's School of Time Control. At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time, slow time, and make time run backwards.

13
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:22,820
Backwards.

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,280
But most importantly, you'll be learning how to make time work for you.

15
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,600
How, you may ask?

16
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,980
Well, just ask this man here.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,040
An actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.

18
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,700
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck. Blango. My dog was dead.

19
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:51,440
Was I sad till I met Bob. Bob showed me how I could go back, get the registration number for the car, do a slip job on the brakes, and wouldn't you know it, that truck went off into a ditch and burst into flames just exactly a block before he could hit old Booger. Ain't that right, fella?

20
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,280
Yes, just imagine the horrible things that could be undone tomorrow if you had only gone to Bob's School of Time Control today.

21
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,780
Courses start yesterday, but you can catch up. Just right. Bob's School of Time Control. The universe.

22
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,280
Bob's School of Time Control. Division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited.

23
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,780
All right, count me.

24
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,580
Okay, launch area's clear.

25
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,180
All right, look at those.

26
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,900
Central control processor on.

27
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:21,940
Thank you.

28
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,720
Air locks closed.

29
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,160
My air lock's closed.

30
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,800
Recon vessels, well, this is base control. Commence free departure, Jack Stegman.

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,920
Show is starting up.

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,360
Life support systems functional.

33
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,760
All right, I think we can begin to broadcast. Oh, we're already broadcasting.

34
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,540
Primary and secondary circuit tests commencing now.

35
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,120
Ah, yes, dear friends.

36
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,380
Nice green lights across the board. Yes, the show is warming up.

37
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,560
Yes, and you can see your radio light up, and if you look inside the speakers real close, you may be able to see the picture.

38
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,940
Free departure check sequence completed.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,720
Thank you.

40
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,020
Awaiting navigational input interface with base computer.

41
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,220
Okay, here we go.

42
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,900
Open phone lines tonight, please.

43
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,800
Phone lines are open.

44
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,580
All right.

45
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,420
Energize the caller, please.

46
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:20,940
Ah, yes, dear friends. Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

47
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,500
Praise Bob.

48
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,320
Praise Bob, and we'll be orbiting your area.

49
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,920
For the next hour.

50
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:36,540
Carrying the message, the seed word of the faith of Bob. The faith in Bob. FIB, we call it.

51
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,340
Can you keep up the FIB, friend?

52
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,600
You want to dump the main shunts? Thank you.

53
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,580
All right.

54
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:45,820


55
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,140
Somewhere over there.

56
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,640
Show is, uh, show is right up on the green lines, doctor.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,500
Okay.

58
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,280
Show is fully on the line.

59
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,040
We will be landing on another show.

60
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,940
We will be docking with another show tonight. Pardon me.

61
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,340
You can't land on another show.

62
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,860
We've caused a nuclear explosion.

63
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,500
We'll be docking with show four from San Francisco tonight.

64
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,800
And, uh, hold onto your seats and...

65
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,380
Oh!

66
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,980
Oh, my God!

67
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,740
Oh, my God!

68
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,220
Dump him!

69
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:18,980
Dump him!

70
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,460
No matter how much you shake and dance,

71
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,900
the last few drops go down your pants!

72
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,220
Hit me!

73
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:26,840
Hit me!

74
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,380
The world is getting rougher day by day

75
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,940
If you think it's gonna get any better

76
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,060
Just keep dreaming away

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,800
You've got to hold your head up high all day and night

78
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,820
Cause you're probably the only weapon you need

79
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,160
To settle up a fight

80
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,560
No matter how much you shake and dance

81
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,060
The last few drops go down your pants

82
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,460
No matter how much you scream and shout

83
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,880
Ain't nobody gonna try to help you on out

84
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,460
No matter how much you piss and moan

85
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,580
Ain't nobody gonna go and leave you alone

86
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,380
No matter how much you whack your head

87
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,720
You're better off living than being dead

88
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,600
Hit me, hit me

89
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,720
Society pushes harder on you every day

90
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,500
You've got to get what you make

91
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,440
And you're here to learn

92
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:52,440


93
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:52,580
Say

94
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,980
Oh, you get what you take

95
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,700
And even do you know

96
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,140
There ain't enough to go around

97
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,620
And it's starting to show

98
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,800
The planet's getting fuller all the time

99
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,720
The man in your brain

100
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,600
Just like the grape turning to wine

101
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,440
We've got to destroy the forces

102
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,780
That are still in your sack

103
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,880
Scare all them mothers

104
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,340
Give them one big heart attack

105
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,200
We've got to regain control of our destiny

106
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,460
Cause they want to take it away from you and me

107
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,440
But we've got to stop all this fighting amongst ourselves

108
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,160
Cause that just keeps them confused

109
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,880
And they think that's swells with

110
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,700
Stand up for your rights

111
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,520
And soon you'll win them back

112
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,700
Or else they'll barbecue you

113
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,360
While you're lying there on your back

114
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,440
Ah, man

115
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,960
No matter how much you shake and dance

116
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,320
The last few drops go down your plans

117
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,720
No matter how much you scream and shout

118
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,240
Ain't nobody gonna try to help you on out

119
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,840
No matter how much you piss and moan

120
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,000
Ain't nobody gonna go and leave you alone

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,780
No matter how much you wipe your head

122
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,060
You're better off living than being dead

123
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,580
Hit me, hit me

124
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:15,700
Ah

125
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,480
Yeah

126
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,320
Well, that was Brother Cleve

127
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,740
Cleve Duncan

128
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,260
Slackmaster Cleve and the Spurious Drive

129
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,380
Doing that lovely old hymn

130
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,660
No matter how much you shake or dance

131
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,340
The last few drops

132
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,380
And you know the rest, boys

133
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,280
Maybe you

134
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,560
How'd these kids get into the station?

135
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,020
This is the children's mission, Doctor

136
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,660
Yes, this is the children's hour

137
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,620
For the Church of the Subgenius

138
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,520
Kids for Bob

139
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,700
Say, kids!

140
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,040
Kids!

141
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,400
Tevis, come over here!

142
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,980
Tell us what you think about Bob, Tevis

143
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:57,760
Nothing

144
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,300
A wise answer

145
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,540
There is wisdom

146
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,640
I know about him, about spaceships

147
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,820
You know about spaceships and Bob

148
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,300
And that's all you need to know, friends

149
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,060
Praise Bob

150
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,160
Bob and the spaceships

151
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,580
Ah, thank you

152
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,060
You're welcome, Bob

153
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,140
We'll see you in the next episode

154
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,940
See you then

155
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,180
Bye

156
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,440
Bye

157
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,540
Bye

158
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:39,540


159
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:39,540


160
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,740
Bye

161
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,600
Bye

162
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:44,600


163
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:44,600


164
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:44,600


165
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:44,600


166
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:44,600


167
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:44,600


168
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:44,600


169
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:44,600


170
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:44,600


171
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:44,600


172
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:44,600


173
00:08:44,600 --> 00:09:14,600


174
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:44,600


175
00:09:44,600 --> 00:10:14,600


176
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:44,600


177
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,140
Wow, чтобы

178
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,520
They tour

179
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,040
this

180
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,320
on here

181
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,980
I'm gonna reveal something about that.

182
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,420
I'm gonna write that and stay in the house.

183
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,880
When some geniuses came in, they took all my furniture

184
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,320
and sold it to buy me this neck brace that I can't take off now.

185
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,860
And they said it was a living being and that...

186
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,300
Oh, the hell.

187
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,600
Ah!

188
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,660
Bring the upper lip down below the upper teeth.

189
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,540
Be sure to keep it down until the fingers are in position.

190
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:40,100
At each corner of the mouth, insert a thumb under the upper lip.

191
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,720
Now slide the thumbs along the inside of the upper lip

192
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,260
until they are positioned just below and to the side of each nostril.

193
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,620
Okay.

194
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:50,500
Those boys.

195
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,360
These shows.

196
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,560
These incredible shows.

197
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,580
Well, we're still beating it to you.

198
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,020
100 million gigahertz of hydrogen line fusion powered radio.

199
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,560
We're stars of the stars.

200
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,580
Yes, indeed, friends.

201
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,760
We've got 143 solar systems on 11 different galactic quadrants

202
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,960
all tuned in at this very moment.

203
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,020
We've been known to work one sidereal day for every Earth day.

204
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,360
And you know they're slightly longer.

205
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,660
Well, yes, here's part of our guest.

206
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,280
Hello.

207
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,100
Yes, this is our...

208
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,000
This is the guest yeast for the evening.

209
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,040
He's a nice little job from Antares 4 and a half.

210
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:34,400
We picked up his signal last week and were able to tune him in.

211
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,920
And this is all he does.

212
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:43,440
He sits in his little trans-dimensional box and broadcasts this message to all of us.

213
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,420
Bob loves you.

214
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,600
Bob loves you.

215
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,880
Bob loves you.

216
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,040
Bob loves you.

217
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,680
Bob loves you.

218
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,920
Bob loves you.

219
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,540
Bob loves you.

220
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:51,580
Bob loves you.

221
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:51,580


222
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,540
Bob loves you real illegal in a real way.

223
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,380
Bob loves you.

224
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:54,620
Bob loves you.

225
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:54,820
Bob loves you.

226
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,300
Oh, yes, dear friends.

227
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,540
Welcome back to the show The Subgenius Div Nit.

228
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,240
Yes...

229
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,640
This is Doctor G. Gordon Gordon.

230
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,680
And Reverend Ivan Stang.

231
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,260
We're sitting her to bring you the word of God.

232
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,980
And don't you feel divine now?

233
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,740
And don't be afraid.

234
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,680
It's just a little radio show and...

235
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,980
And don't you be afraid.

236
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,140
It's.....

237
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,660
The radio show 다음에

238
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:19,660


239
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:19,660


240
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:27,900
scary. Yeah, it's scary, friends. Scary show. It could get scarier depending on what whatever

241
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,480
parakeet mixes we drop in. That's right, but remember one thing, it doesn't matter what

242
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,920
life cycle you belong to and whether your basic metabolism is carbon, silicon, or plasma,

243
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:46,120
we're broadcasting to you because this is the first intergalactic church of dogs. Yes, friends,

244
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,900
this is the church for every form of life that knows how to snicker. Yes, indeed. Every life

245
00:13:52,900 --> 00:14:00,580
form that can enjoy and appreciate slack, dear friends. Yes, and the mysteries, those who

246
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:08,560
appreciate the mysteries. Ah, the mysteries, yes, that sweet, sweet burning mystery of slack.

247
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:15,140
Yes, and when finally they learn the answer to the mystery of why on that great day,

248
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:24,640
that one day, the sound of the slack goes rippling. This is what it sounds like, friends.

249
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah, listen to that slack rippling long, it did a lovely sound. Oh, yes,

250
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:38,780
receive the splendor of that slack sound, friends. Ah, yes. Ah, doesn't it drip through

251
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:43,640
your frontal lobes or depending upon your metabolism, of course, sometimes your back

252
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,000
lobes. Sometimes it just runs down there.

253
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,400
Sometimes it just runs down your spine and dribbles out. Sometimes it just dribbles through

254
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,260
their cells and oozes through the pores. Oh, we know that somewhere out there you're listening

255
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,460
to the sound of slack. We can't give you too much of this air slack because. Nay, nay.

256
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,420
No, no. We can't let you get all hooked. You'd just be sitting by your radios from now on.

257
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,800
You wouldn't be able to do anything. Wait until next week when the subgenius hour of slack

258
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,820
comes back. Ah, but. So that you can soak up some more of the healing power that

259
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,460
can be mysteriously broadcast. That's right. So put your, put your appendage, your pseudopod,

260
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,860
your flipper, your hand, your manipulator, your chela, your mandible, whatever you got,

261
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,440
friends. It doesn't matter if it's a scaly, horny carapace or a squamous druid mollusk-like

262
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:42,820
mucus secretin' skin. Just, just place your little sensory appendage upon your transmitter

263
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,680
receiver unit and you will receive.

264
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:52,160
The benefit of this slack, this air slack. And when finally you discover the mystery,

265
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,640
the answer to the mystery of the slack, why, on that day you will be killed and re-killed

266
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:06,720
and re-killed again in the scalding and scathing acid love of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

267
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,840
Hallelujah. Praise Bob.

268
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:15,420
E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I. Ah, yes, friends. Well, well, Dr. Stang, I think perhaps we oughta. We oughta.

269
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,020
Turn the slack.

270
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,300
Turn the generator down a little bit. Let these pour.

271
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,180
Just soothe them out with it. Don't drop them off sudden now. Just there you are. Yes, friends.

272
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,040
Just a rug. A rug of slack underneath.

273
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:32,040
That little tiny layer that separates you from the hard, cold floor of reality.

274
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,940
Well, we'd love to get you hooked, but we wouldn't be able to supply it.

275
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,560
That's right.

276
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,200
It'd be like Dawn of the Dead all over again. Shambling zombies for Bob.

277
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,960
Shambling slack zombies.

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,100
Trying to get some more of that great stuff that they're selling.

279
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:58,640
That beautiful, that beautiful essence, that vital secretion of the heart, soul of Dobbs, that one thing that he possesses more than any other entity in the universe.

280
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,780
And, friends, we're talking about slack.

281
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,960
Don't you wish you had it?

282
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:14,780
Don't you wish you had that sound with you all the time? Don't you like to wrap yourself up in that slack, that big, warm, fuzzy, woolly slack, and just snuggle into it and say, ah.

283
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,800
Ah.

284
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:21,040
You had just one Bob pill, like this one in this little vial.

285
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,500
This one.

286
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:32,880
And we have one, listeners. We have one. And this one pill would be enough to impart into you the essence of the Stark Fist of Removal.

287
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,680
You would become Vishnu the Destroyer, friends.

288
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:43,680
That's right. You would dance upon the helix of the ever-changing quantum universe, shifting your eigenstatt.

289
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,240
Yeah.

290
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,720
Dogs have always been my friend.

291
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,460
And we've had many dogs during these years.

292
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,040
Now we have you.

293
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,140
And I think he, I think they saved the best of the last.

294
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,380
He is the friendliest and the smartest.

295
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,920
And the most confident in his attention of all the dogs that I've known.

296
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,500
Best for the last.

297
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,740
He is the friendliest.

298
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,160
He is the wanderer and adventurer of peace.

299
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,660
He is the friendliest and the smartest.

300
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,520
And the smartest in the world.

301
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,360
Yeah.

302
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,860
And the most confident.

303
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,860
He is the friendliest of all the dogs that I've known.

304
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,360
And the most and the most confident.

305
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,340
The man told her he didn't belong there anymore.

306
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,340


307
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,340


308
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,340


309
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,340


310
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,340


311
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,340


312
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,340


313
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:57,580
one in Johnson City that he must have just wandered in here, or jumped out of someone's

314
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:05,020
car, or we have always thought maybe he was with a circus.

315
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,260
And Ricky's been here ever since.

316
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,180
We like to worry that if the owner ever

317
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,060
asks about him, to direct him here.

318
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,700
But I'm glad that the owner never missed him,

319
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,600
because I surely would if he left me.

320
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,400
Me.

321
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,660
If you don't get some flea powder in the bath,

322
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,900
he wants to go in the car.

323
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,780
You want to go on a ride?

324
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,960
You want to go and see the cattle?

325
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,820
You want to go see them?

326
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,540
Will you?

327
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,020
You want to come?

328
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Well, got it, Ruggers.

329
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,320
But got to.

330
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,480
å

331
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:26,500
. . . You.

332
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,560
Thank you.

333
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,300
Thank you.

334
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,060
Thank you.

335
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,320
Thank you.

336
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:38,240
Hey, that new church air is just great.

337
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,780
The new screen excitement you've been waiting for.

338
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,340
Rated PG.

339
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,360
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.

340
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,340
Your doorbell rings and there's a chaplain standing quietly.

341
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,420
He tells you...

342
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,240
...repeating liberation right around the world and will die to do it.

343
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,240
That's amazing.

344
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,400
Tape recorders, tape all over there, buddy.

345
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,780
Before making any additional statements about my subject,

346
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:15,780
I'd like to make it clear that in any reference I make to the church on today's broadcast,

347
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,360
I'll be speaking in broad and certainly not specific terms.

348
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,140
That is, I will be referring primarily to the institutionalized church.

349
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,240
Everyone uses...

350
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,220
Now to continue with the tape recording.

351
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,960
We're going to see...

352
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,560
Get ready.

353
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,340
What I'm talking to you about today is the most up-to-date thing that I could talk to you about.

354
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,240
We're living in the closing moments of this dispensation.

355
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,760
So, housewives, take this tip from the growers of Idaho potatoes,

356
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,560
whose potatoes make delicious French flies.

357
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,700
And as we watched, my friend...

358
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,380
My friend...

359
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:56,520
My friend...

360
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:56,520


361
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:56,520


362
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,920
...is suddenly and violently vomiting.

363
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,200
Who's going to listen to that?

364
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,840
And when they do, how are they going to feel?

365
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,520
Well, I don't have to think about that.

366
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:09,900
You do.

367
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,720
Whoever you are.

368
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,080
Wish you were a genius but feel like only a sub-genius?

369
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,660
Have a kisser Darth Vader's mom would expunge?

370
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,220
Tired of gorge-clogging crypto-wimpism?

371
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,020
I have a solution.

372
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,740
Stay tuned in the weeks to come for exciting lectures such as...

373
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,360
Drink Your Way to Happiness.

374
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,600
And a special tour of the Roy Rogers Museum,

375
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,960
where InBod will prove the trigger has moved again.

376
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,580
All this and more on your favorite soundtrack for a crumbling society,

377
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,580
Food Fights of the Gods.

378
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,960
All great things are happening.

379
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,740
God is showing people things.

380
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,480
Many of you are hearing verses.

381
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,760
You're tormented. Your mind is tormented.

382
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,500
You're foaming. You're...

383
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,100
Some of you husbands and wives.

384
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,640
You mumble, grumble, complain, falsify.

385
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,960
A few demon powers has tried to destroy your marriage, your home.

386
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,640
So you need to come.

387
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:11,040
If you can't, man, you ought to get these tapes anyhow on Demonology.

388
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,920
Tape 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

389
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,760
And they're on right on up till we get through.

390
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,820
And we'll be offering the tape on,

391
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,100
Can a Christian be demon-possessed at the end of the program?

392
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,140
But we're going to take you into that service right now.

393
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,320
We're going to take you now into that service.

394
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,700
First in progress, what we are sharing on this subject,

395
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,860
Can a Christian be demon-possessed?

396
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,360
Tape 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

397
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,800
And they're on right on up till we get through.

398
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:37,840
And we're going to take you now into that service right now.

399
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,320
Hundreds of New Yorkers at a religious revival

400
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,880
chanting the name of a modern-day prophet, Bob.

401
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,000
Bob's teachings are the foundation of a church

402
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,200
that does little more than parody cults and American consumerism.

403
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,780
It's called the Church of the Subgenius.

404
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,840
Tom Battelli has this report.

405
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,220
You will pay to know what you really think.

406
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,100
But if you give us money, we will tell you what to think.

407
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,860
And not only have you paid to know what you really think,

408
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,880
but once you will get value for your dollar.

409
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,880
Americans will buy anything, and they're getting sold short.

410
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,040
That's the message of the Church of the Subgenius

411
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,060
as delivered by the Pope of all New York, David Meyer, at a recent revival.

412
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,000
Meyer also instructed the enthusiastic crowd in how to get slack,

413
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,920
how to get right with Bob, and how to pull the wool over your own eyes.

414
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,620
For they shall see God.

415
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,240
It's still true.

416
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,440
God still speaks in special ways to each of us today.

417
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,920
But my feelings toward him are still so brittle and sour.

418
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,960
I don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care anymore.

419
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,320
Tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired.

420
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,860
I can't tolerate it. I can't live with it.

421
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,960
And that's how I became a subgenius.

422
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,680
Children, the great St. Lenny Bruce said,

423
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,100
American society cripples you and arrests you for limping.

424
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,960
Here in the Church of the Subgenius we say,

425
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,460
Cast off those crutches and crawl with pride!

426
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,820
You can crawl again!

427
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,320
You can crawl again, children.

428
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,420
And this is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

429
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,980
We've been playing media barrage tapes on these shows,

430
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:35,800
which are edited primarily by Puzzling Evidence in Oakland, California,

431
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,660
Dr. Byron Werner in Los Angeles, California,

432
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,100
and me, Reverend Ivan Stang.

433
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,520
Of course, what I mainly do is just take the stuff that people send in and rip them off to the max.

434
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,120
And now this side of the show is about to end, listener,

435
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,420
and you're going to have to flip this show over in order to hear the rest of it.

436
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:02,600
Now, if you're tied up and can't get to the radio to do that,

437
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:07,420
why, let's just hope that you've got auto-reverse as we...

438
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:17,500
Welcome back, friends, to the Hour of Slack Radio Ministry on K-N-O-N, the non-station...

439
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,480
This is for admirable people.

440
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,560
Let it out, let it out.

441
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,100
Aren't you worried? Don't you want to get out?

442
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,980
Now, we need to be grabbed on a mix of dots.

443
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,540
Okay, Fred, Fred Hood?

444
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,660
Yes, we dare you. Try it.

445
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,180
Okay, right now, try it right now, Doc. Here we go.

446
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,700
Bob hung up on us. He is dead.

447
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,580
It's true.

448
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,420
Good morning, caller. What happened?

449
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,280
Could it be a big cover-of-the-mandate thing at all?

450
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,580
No, we're not going to cover anything.

451
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,460
Poor girl. She's in that bubbling vat of jokes.

452
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,600
I'd be here to hear your question, but we're going to throw a tarp over it and protect it from the elements.

453
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,700
Yeah, we might throw a tarp over it. That's all we'll cover.

454
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,340
This young lady has the jokes.

455
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:48,700
All day?

456
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:48,920
All day, yeah.

457
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,080
But if you come down to the station right now, we're going to use them.

458
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,940
We'll cover you up with something soft and warm, too.

459
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,180
We're going to have to reverse the charger.

460
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,720
I don't like it. I'm in the dark.

461
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,080
You've been in the dark a long time, Doc.

462
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,180
I do like it. I want to go home.

463
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,540
I don't like the ridges. You can feel the ridges on the other side of the road.

464
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,260
This is the most miserable thing I've ever seen. It's joyous.

465
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,920
It's too late. You joined the Church of the Subgenius.

466
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,060
That's too bad, boys.

467
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,320
Now you know what subgenius hell is really like, yes?

468
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,860
Forced to do the show that you can't say it's ever going to be.

469
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,280
Listen to how they're in hell.

470
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,060
We can view their dead souls in hell.

471
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,060


472
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,380
And they still can't quit doing the show.

473
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,580
I have heard that in a brown-winged bay.

474
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,180
And if you don't know what happens, you can't admit it.

475
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,940
Or if you do, they just call them out and you can't keep the endless show.

476
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,360
Blibbit, blibbit, blibbit.

477
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,120
Blibbit, blabbit, and blubbit.

478
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,140
I bet you can't say something.

479
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,080
You can blubbit or you can bliebit.

480
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,000
I can't blab such blibber blubber.

481
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,780
You'll have to listen very, very carefully.

482
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,340
I have your son.

483
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,360
And you can see possibly.

484
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,560
You know that you can't do it.

485
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,640
What do you think you are anyway?

486
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,640
You're going to rot.

487
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,120
You create problems that you can't possibly be able to come up with.

488
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,380
If my demands are not met, I will kill a few of your parents.

489
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:09,900
A nun or a funny thing.

490
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,660
There's the little head in his little head coffin.

491
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,580
That's right.

492
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,460
And one neck bone.

493
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,700
And one neck bone.

494
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,400
Moving to the large pit to be buried with the rebar.

495
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,140
I think that they run the show.

496
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:30,600
But little do they know that they have put so much of their energy into the show that the show is now a great shambling entity within itself.

497
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,320
The hideous show.

498
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:41,060
And they are mere organs within this great hideous, drooling, rugose squamous sesquipedalian show.

499
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,420
No kidding.

500
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:47,840
And our listeners of our show must suffer the same way.

501
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,540
Because it's their show that's our show.

502
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,120
That's right.

503
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,980
This is the easy bit.

504
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,740
You can't keep track of it.

505
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,580
But it's following you all the time.

506
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,160
Go ahead.

507
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,460
Try to turn it off.

508
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,500
We'll keep hearing it.

509
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,840
The endless show.

510
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,180
The show of shows.

511
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,400
Yes.

512
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,280
Hell on earth.

513
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,860
Oh yeah.

514
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,060
You think, well it's funny.

515
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,360
I'm on radio personality.

516
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,280
I'm just going to have me a show.

517
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:12,980
Yee-haw.

518
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,600
Yes sir.

519
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,000
E-bob.

520
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,700
And then you've been on that show and you've been on that show.

521
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,300
And you look at your calendar watch one day and you realize.

522
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:20,520
I'm on radio personality.

523
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:20,520


524
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:25,320
It's just that the last half an hour has taken a little over 143 years.

525
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,300
Ha ha ha.

526
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,700
And you begin to wonder?

527
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,960
You begin to wonder?

528
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,220
You begin to wonder, what is the deal with this Bob Dobbs character?

529
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,480
And what is this time control?

530
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,280
And these subgenius characters on their radio shows.

531
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,020
What's this this Dobbs drone signal they constantly speak of?

532
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,520
Yes, what is the Dobbs drone signal?

533
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,500
The thing that locks in to their very innermost self.

534
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:50,500


535
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:50,500


536
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:50,500


537
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,640
and draws out that which it desires.

538
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,100
Ah, yes, dear friends.

539
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,480
Makes the gland grow.

540
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,800
And it's too late now.

541
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,820
Even if you unplug your radio,

542
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,820
when you can't hear the show,

543
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,200
the show can hear you.

544
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,620
This is the show that listens back, friends.

545
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,880
Face it, 1984 happened a year ago.

546
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,880
We were doing the implementing of the big eyes,

547
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,760
the eye of taxis, dear friends.

548
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,420
Remember the eye of every year here in Texas.

549
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,940
The eye of taxis.

550
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,640
It watches.

551
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

552
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,720
Ever been kicked in the taxis, my friends?

553
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,040
Anybody ever got you around?

554
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,400
You're your Blancas lately?

555
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,200
Yeah.

556
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,080
What kind of a show do you think this is?

557
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,520
Just your average little rock and roll music show?

558
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,560
Your average.

559
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,700
Comedy talk show?

560
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,100
Your average satire and social comment and parody show?

561
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,560
It's a squeaky show is what it is.

562
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,820
That's right, dear friends.

563
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,520
It's the dead subgenius in the middle of the road hour.

564
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,460
The dead subgenius in the middle of the road hour?

565
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,140
I could forget all that stuff now.

566
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,060
It wasn't important anymore.

567
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,660
The time when those who sleep are deep in their dreams.

568
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
The hurry and the people who...

569
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:18,740
I feel better.

570
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,900
I can't figure out why their hands are in their...

571
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,500
Mom, mom, mom!

572
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,620
Mom, mom, mom!

573
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,800
On the church of the subgenius radio show...

574
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,940
The doctors of the air operate without warning.

575
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:30,660
Warning.

576
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,440
We will operate soon.

577
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,040
Warning.

578
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,420
Warning.

579
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,020
Warning.

580
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,820
We must warn.

581
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,640
It doesn't have to be true.

582
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,560
Well, here we are again.

583
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,000
It just doesn't have to be true.

584
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,400
Because we're always here.

585
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,760
Your final instructions?

586
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,540
I may sound like a Bible-beater yelling up a revival at a river crossing camp meeting,

587
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,740
but that don't change the truth, none.

588
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,960
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

589
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:55,020
I want to see if one person, one single person,

590
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,080
will have the courage of their conviction

591
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:01,560
and come down here and open up to Bob and give them, give me their wallet.

592
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,240
I don't just want your money.

593
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,380
Don't just want your credit cards.

594
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,260
We want your library cards, your voter registration.

595
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,700
Give it all up now, okay?

596
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,380
One person, that's all we need.

597
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,000
Actually, Bob doesn't care.

598
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,720
Bob is the richest man on earth.

599
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,520
He doesn't care.

600
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:18,860
He doesn't care.

601
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:18,860


602
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:18,860


603
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:18,860


604
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,200
He doesn't care.

605
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:19,720
He doesn't care.

606
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:19,740
He doesn't care.

607
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:19,740


608
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:19,740


609
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:19,740


610
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:19,740


611
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,080
All he wants is souls.

612
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,720
He wants you to have slack.

613
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,020
He wants you to fight the conspiracy.

614
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,300
And it is going to take some fighting because they are everywhere.

615
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,000
The conspiracy is everywhere.

616
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,780
The television shows you watch, the rock and roll songs that they play over and over and

617
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,780
over and over again.

618
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,180
Of course, this station excluded.

619
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,140
President got me excluded.

620
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,900
But J.R. Bob Dobbs is here to spread abnormality.

621
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,680
Yes, the seed of Bob is yours.

622
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,580
abnormality potential.

623
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,880
We're not talking about this consumer abnormality.

624
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,280
No, sir.

625
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,320
We're not looking for a hip audience.

626
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,080
We're not looking for a sophisticated audience.

627
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,140
We're looking for an audience that is willing to believe everything.

628
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,920
An audience that cannot escape because only then does it stop being an audience and participate

629
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,480
in the isness of Bob.

630
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:13,640
The last thing that we want is a vast stadium full of geeks, 80,000 strong, waiting for

631
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,400
us to come on stage and entertain them.

632
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,880
We want them to found their own church.

633
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,940
Get on the streets and entertain themselves.

634
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,540
Bob preaches short-duration personal saviors.

635
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,220
You should skip from one personal savior to the next.

636
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:25,960
It could be a wine bottle.

637
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,980
We live in a consumer society, ladies and gentlemen.

638
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,300
Planned obsolescence.

639
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,380
Things wear out fast.

640
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,180
Not our fault.

641
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,860
That's the way it is, and we understand.

642
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,720
Because Bob came.

643
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,280
Bob doesn't care about your sins.

644
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,780
Bob won't die for your sins because Bob's not the son of God.

645
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,260
Bob won't die for your sins.

646
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,680
Bob won't forgive you for your sins.

647
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,980
All Bob cares about is that Bob will justify your sins.

648
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,140
He'll justify your sins and make them part of his plan.

649
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,000
The lights have gone down just slightly.

650
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,260
The Mr. Science Lecture Series.

651
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,000
Volume 1, number 1.

652
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,640
The.

653
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,400
Neutron.

654
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:23,540
Delivered by the Reverend Seth Deitch, First Church of Mr. Science, Boston.

655
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,540
Outside the realm of conspiracy science and in the clear light of the so-called forbidden sciences,

656
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,520
we will find we have a far greater chance of understanding the true nature of the universe.

657
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:43,100
What the conspiracy feeds us under the guise of the most advanced system of natural philosophy

658
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,460
is nothing but a complex sham.

659
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,720
A decoy to hide from us.

660
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,980
A true fact of how much bigger and more complex and nut-wrenchingly frightening a place the universe really is.

661
00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:02,300
We are told about matter and energy and space and time as being either consistent realities governed by laws

662
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:11,680
or as foggy abstracts that have no particular being outside of that of being convenient linguistic aids to make the whole thing easier to swallow.

663
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,780
We at the Temporal Management Research Facility of the Church of Mr. Science of the Subgenius,

664
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:24,520
have through rigorous probing through mountains of existing and full-known works on the subject of time and its methods of control,

665
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,180
have discovered the key for blowing the whistle on the whole fraudulent twaddle that is modern science.

666
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,900
This key is the neutron.

667
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,360
The truth must now be told.

668
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,300
How it was covered up for so long would make a story intriguing enough for a separate book,

669
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,500
but it's too involved to be told here.

670
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,760
The actual issue at hand is the neutron and its pivotal role in the mutron's life.

671
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:47,760


672
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:47,760


673
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,380
The neutron is the

674
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:56,440
In order to properly understand the following, it must first be made clear what actually constitutes an elementary particle.

675
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:05,180
The first of these basic particles is the electron, which has no mass but possesses a charge that is commonly described as possibly infinite,

676
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,840
thus making it the fundamental unit of energy.

677
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:17,300
It and other related particles, i.e. positrons, photons, gravitons, etc., acting in concert, make up the Yakutismic field,

678
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,560
which is responsible for holding everything that is anything together.

679
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:26,740
The second is the much rarer infinite mass particle, commonly called a black hole.

680
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:34,880
These particles, like the electrons, occupy no space, but the influence of a single particle can be felt at a much greater distance.

681
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:40,620
They often have event horizons many miles wide, beyond which not even light can escape.

682
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,020
The third fundamental particle is the neutron.

683
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,740
The neutron is the electron that is responsible for holding everything that is anything together.

684
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:56,360
The neutron carries with it an infinite temporal capacity that makes it alter the rate and intensity and general quality of the passage through time of anything it touches.

685
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,440
The neutron is very likely the rarest particle in this universe.

686
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:09,420
As far as we know, there might well be only one of them, though there could be as many as a few dozen without generating a dangerous concentration of neutron phenomena.

687
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:17,740
The first segment of this report will deal with the general implications of the neutron in regards to existing ideas on the work in progress.

688
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:27,500
The second will concern the incredible potentialities of using the potent forces of the neutron in time control research and in practical time control.

689
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,660
Section A. Just how fucking big everything really is.

690
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:44,740
What we know is the universe can be envisioned as a giant atom with the black hole acting as the nucleus and the neutron or mutrons acting as the electron cloud,

691
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,720
with the electrons providing the energy for the neutron to move.

692
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,620
The system can be explained as a neutron in the form of a neutron that is a particle that is in the form of a neutron.

693
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:02,940
The neutron is a particle that is a neutron.

694
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:02,940


695
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:09,460
The neutron has a corresponding anti-particle known as the tachyon, which travels through time in a direction which we perceive as backwards,

696
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,880
so that to someone who is not in the know it will appear to exceed the speed of light.

697
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,700
The simple fact of the matter is that tachyons are extremely powerful,

698
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,740
universal mutrons impinging on our universe at a different temporal angle.

699
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:28,680
These are the mutrons of atom universes that ours is in compound with. After this

700
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:39,900
the atomic metaphor breaks down. No atom of mere matter divides itself into

701
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:45,180
alternate cells almost constantly, but our universe does. All the time the

702
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,880
universe splits in order to express every alternative open to any phenomenon transpiring

703
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:55,720
within no matter how small or seemingly insignificant. This is the only way our minds

704
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,860
express the perception of the fifth dimension, or more properly the second dimension of time.

705
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,100
So this introduces the concept of time viewed as a plane, rather than a line.

706
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:11,120
But there's another dimension of space, and so is the case with the time there is also

707
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,740
a corresponding up down time. This is the direction in

708
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,160
which our computers are menuing. We have one and two dimensions each of the given

709
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:15,160


710
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:15,160


711
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:15,160


712
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,320
mental eyes exist. In this direction we find alternate time tracks similar to the

713
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,560
sidewise ones, with the difference being that theirs is oriented in the

714
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,940
direction opposed to temporal gravity, so that elements of those other selves are

715
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,800
constantly falling into our awareness from above.

716
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:39,660
The neutron passes through all these spaces with equal ease and is modulated

717
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,600
by them much like the photon is modulated by bouncing off or passing

718
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,640
through matter. Thus information of a very subtle and distorted nature is

719
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,940
conveyed to us from our other universes on the neutron Express. We call this

720
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:59,600
information Gnosis and its influence has been felt by mankind time and again for

721
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,960
as long back as we have records and no doubt back to our very genesis and

722
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,520
before. The earliest known neutron impact on Earth occurred in the era of the dawn

723
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,500
of life. The primordial sea teamed with the most

724
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:13,580
powerful meteorites in the universe, the C-1 and the C-2, and the C-3 and the C-4. The primordial sea teamed with the most powerful

725
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:17,960
primitive of bacteria. Their genetic material was a simple molecule shaped

726
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,780
like a lumpy ladder. It was very chemically stable. The neutron passed

727
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:26,900
through Earth and spewed out a wake that left each and every molecule of DNA

728
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:33,020
twisted beyond recognition. In this state its stability was ruined and any force

729
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:37,800
or random glitch that Mother Nature had to offer changed it somehow. Thus

730
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:43,500
evolution had begun. Another notable neutron impact occurred about 60 million

731
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,960
years ago at the end of the age of the dinosaurs. The particle struck and its

732
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,300
wake left the intelligence of the dinosaurs increased a million fold. They

733
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,400
promptly sat down, figured out how to teleport, and promptly took off on

734
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,180
around-the-universe vacation. Presumably they will someday return.

735
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,000
Another notable neutron impact only about five million years ago was

736
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,360
responsible for the division of the human and yeti races. The vast majority

737
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,780
of these events however affect individual beings or objects. One such

738
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,400
example is Great Britain's Stonehenge Monument which was not man-made as is

739
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,540
popularly presumed but is merely the material evidence of a rather minor

740
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:31,920
neutron splash. Certain great sages of the past and present have actually had

741
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,280
neutrons pass directly through their crania. A partial listing of these select

742
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,380
people will give an idea of the effects that may be expected of such an

743
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,120
encounter. Gautama Buddha,

744
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:49,760
the Prophet Enoch, Ankh-Natan, Leonardo, William Beckford, Alistair Foley, Marcel

745
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,920
Duchamp, R. Buckminster Fuller, Antonio Gaudi, Arnold Palmer, the list goes on.

746
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,500
It's interesting to note that J.R. Bob Dobbs is the only known human being

747
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,740
through whom a neutron is passed twice. After going through the back of his head

748
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,520
it was reflected by the mystic pipe of Dobbs back through his head for a

749
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,700
double dose of gnosis. In the light of this particular view one might ask what

750
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,320
about the Big Bang and all that stuff. Well it seems that matter does not play a

751
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,760
very big role in the actual nuts and bolts operation of the universe. In fact

752
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,380
we find that it is the case in about half the universe's sample that there is

753
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:32,600
no matter at all. Section B. What we must do about all this. It is well known that

754
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,920
the electron can be pressed into service for all kinds of uses. It might be less

755
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,920
well known that alien civilizations of a level only slightly more advanced than

756
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,680
ours routinely use the enormous amount of energy that we have for the purpose of

757
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,620
power made available by tapping into the gravity fluxes of quantum black holes.

758
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,940
It's also possible to use the time potentials of the neutron to our own great advantage.

759
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:57,980
The neutron is not subject to the same methods of coercion that we use to bend normal subatomic

760
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:04,080
particles to our will. They're oblivious to matter and energy alike. The power of pure thought,

761
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,100
because of its intimate relationship with time, does have some small effect.

762
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:14,280
Mutrons are attracted to areas of concentrated slackful enlightenment. A neutron container

763
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,860
accelerator could be charged with a neutron if enough slackful minds concentrated their energies

764
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:26,300
around a scoop entrance to the neutron accelerator. Once contained therein, it would take relatively

765
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:32,120
little effort on the part of these minds to maintain it in a circular path. One purely

766
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:38,080
technical problem facing this proposal is the size of the accelerator needed. There is a property of

767
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:38,080


768
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:41,200
of the neutron that it will only travel in the most gentle of curves.

769
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,660
The minimum diameter of a circle to be traveled by a neutron is approximately 1,000 miles.

770
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:54,600
Fortunately, we have easy access to an extraterrestrial body more than three times that size, Earth's

771
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:54,840
moon.

772
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:00,700
The accelerator can be built in a ring completely circumnavigating the lunar sphere about 100

773
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,080
feet below its surface.

774
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,360
Because of the mental effort that would run it, it would be known as the psychotron.

775
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,600
The psychotron would be a valuable tool in the use of practical time control.

776
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,820
By accelerating the neutron in one direction or another, the entire moon could be induced

777
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,980
to follow it in whatever temporal direction it might be directed, forward, backward, sideways,

778
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:22,760
or up-down.

779
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,020
Having this ability opens amazing possibilities.

780
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:32,200
It is my proposal that this device be constructed for use in a major project to concentrate

781
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,260
high slack wisdom in this universe.

782
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,340
The single most rare and highly effective device in the universe is the Psycotron.

783
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:39,180
The most radiant personality among modern man is J.R.

784
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,240
Bob Dobbs.

785
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,560
There are other alternate Bobs existing on other alternate time tracks.

786
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,300
Not all of them are as prominent as our Bob, but still are privy to the same great gnosis.

787
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,400
Others are already the rulers of their respective Earths.

788
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,980
All though are truly Bob.

789
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,900
Imagine if we could travel to those alternative time streams and convince all of those Bobs

790
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,120
to return to our world.

791
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,320
This is exactly what I am seeing.

792
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,500
suggesting the formation of the Congress of Bobs.

793
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,160
Yes, my friends, this is our mission.

794
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,740
Those who wish to donate to the Psychotron Project

795
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:19,220
will be given a free ride to the alternate world of their choice

796
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,860
once the project is complete.

797
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,360
Thank you.

798
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,620
The preceding has been a Plepo Abernathy production.

799
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,460
No, the audience is not far away.

800
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,680
The Master Control Show here in the Master Control Program

801
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,640
is controlling the show.

802
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,140
And this show will be the show that you'll probably never hear.

803
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:57,520
And this show will go off to another subgenius show in another land.

804
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,800
And that will be a third show layered upon this show.

805
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,100
And after that show, it will go on

806
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,320
and continue spreading like a fire.

807
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,840
A virus layer upon layer upon layer

808
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,200
fading in and out from one another.

809
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:11,840
It doesn't have to be changed.

810
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,820
Well, here we are again.

811
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,500
It just doesn't have to be changed.

812
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:17,780
That's right.

813
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,200
And if you are a nice listener,

814
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,900
we're going to read the whole phone book to you.

815
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,840
Everyone's in the phone book.

816
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:23,700
That's right.

817
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,180
Remember something I mentioned this morning.

818
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,280
Behold, the bowels of the heavens

819
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,260
shall be opened to smite and trump the earth with strangeness.

820
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:31,700
You, look.

821
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,920
It's the colon of the earth.

822
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,700
Let's pretend like we have a contest going.

823
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,320
We'll just call it.

824
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,620
Call people in the phone book and say,

825
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,240
You, what?

826
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,880
A little bit farther up the colon.

827
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,580
Yes, there it lives, flapping in the wind.

828
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,340
Like hideous worms of reincarnation

829
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,640
in a hell spirit world

830
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,200
that you don't even know about

831
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,500
because you're too ignorant.

832
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:56,180
Ignorant because you're just a listener.

833
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:56,680
That's all.

834
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,900
Just a mere listener.

835
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:02,100
Oh, the pathetic fool.

836
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,440
The earth fool.

837
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,680
Oh, ye stiff-legged,

838
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,920
ye, ye pathetic,

839
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,860
third-dimensional creatures.

840
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,140
If you could but know,

841
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,460
could but dream for an instant

842
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,220
of that which could await you,

843
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,900
were you good enough

844
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,500
to...

845
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,020
Friends,

846
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,040
there's no escape.

847
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,860
Literally, no escape

848
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,300
from the show

849
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,080
that never ends.

850
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,000
Oh, wasn't there some

851
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,320
rock and roll song about the show

852
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,160
that never ends?

853
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,060
The tape machine and the

854
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,620
bulk eraser and the Jerry Jeff preacher

855
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,880
and that little collar

856
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,240
calls up Genial Security

857
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,160
on your priority code channel.

858
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,740
This message will not repeat.

859
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,100
Thank you for your attention.

860
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,020
Please, make a note of it.

861
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:49,540
I get a joke.

862
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,600
How did Jerry Jeff Collar get the chicken fried steak

863
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,460
out of his armpits?

864
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,760
The trick of picking chicken

865
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,040
is picking what chicken to pick.

866
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,980
You can't get it out of your armpits

867
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,320
once it's put in the way he does it.

868
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,220
Arms for defense.

869
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,400
Those arms are the pits.

870
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,240
Yes.

871
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,040
Keep on arming.

872
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:02,920
Well, Jerry Jeff,

873
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,440
we armed the world tonight.

874
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,760
You'll wind up in the pits, yes.

875
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,060
The basic message,

876
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,380
if today's a military environment.

877
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,720
It's quiet out there.

878
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,740
We're going to take you

879
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,460
to a piece of tough rib eye steak.

880
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,280
He's a flibberty jibber

881
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,020
and a hick to mimic

882
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,840
a Honda Sock-to-loo rib tickler.

883
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,780
That's stuff too, yes, right.

884
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,940
Let's call it a necessary,

885
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,520
completely unauthorized,

886
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,080
and overextended military operation

887
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,560
in a completely virgin environment.

888
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,920
The zickering of a thicket

889
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,920
of gigantic crickets.

890
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,260
Yes, the zickering of the thicket.

891
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,160
Don't just turn that down.

892
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,100
We don't want any of that stuff

893
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:29,660
happening here.

894
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,620
In the swamp

895
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,720
bongs the gongs

896
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,720
of a throng of frogs

897
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,680
while a knee-deep sheep

898
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,040
bleats in a sliver

899
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:36,560
of slippery stream

900
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,520
where slimy snakes

901
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,720
whisper sinful secrets.

902
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,380
Let's go back to the

903
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,060
knee-deep sheep dip, okay?

904
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,500
The knee-deep sheep dip

905
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,840
dipped deep down below

906
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,500
the steep and chilly waters

907
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,320
of the deep stream

908
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,420
floats on the surface

909
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,900
like the ancient Egyptians

910
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,140
floated on the current

911
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:52,840
of their belief.

912
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,860
For they thought

913
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,800
they would never die,

914
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,160
but be reborn

915
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,000
as gargling sarcophagi,

916
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,280
horrible mummies

917
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,780
to march across the earth

918
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,880
and wreak and spew vengeance.

919
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,960
Give me the pyroflagellate.

920
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:05,860
All of the little

921
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,260
tiny dead deities

922
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,400
marched down the side

923
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,460
of the subgenius church

924
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,820
and now it is at night.

925
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,240
Within the great pyramid

926
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,840
the secret chamber

927
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,880
of the subgenius.

928
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:14,940
My God.

929
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,420
What light and steam

930
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,920
come from the special effects department

931
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,220
located below the pyramid?

932
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,040
Here, inside the heart

933
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,080
of the mighty structure,

934
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,160
puzzling evidence

935
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,160
broadcasts

936
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,560
from the inner chamber

937
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,560
of the great pyramid.

938
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,220
Yeah, I'll teach you all

939
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:28,900
how to talk on the radio.

940
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:29,440
Come on down.

941
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,380
Yes, these giant pyramids

942
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,640
are actually radio stations

943
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,840
of a primitive nature

944
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,740
which broadcast

945
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:35,340
by the subgenius church.

946
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:35,700
I'll play radio.

947
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:35,800
I'll play radio.

948
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,200
I'll play rock and roll

949
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,240
until every race falls apart.

950
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:37,960
I'll copy that old

951
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,840
Brock and Bergman movie.

952
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,240
Then they would show

953
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,280
the strange films

954
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,980
to the walls of the...

955
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,920
Come on, let's watch G-Man.

956
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:44,520
I don't want to learn

957
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,420
how to talk like that guy

958
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:45,840
in the movies.

959
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,780
...mummified kitty cats

960
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,000
in their canoptic jars

961
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,960
would ever view

962
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,000
these great epics.

963
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,560
Oh, why did they have

964
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,160
to pull kitty's brain

965
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,360
out through a nostril?

966
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,540
The cat as well as

967
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,260
the diggy dog

968
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:56,960
was a mysterious

969
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,700
and powerful god

970
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,100
that had to be placated.

971
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,500
What a powerful god.

972
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,420
Let's placate him.

973
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,020
No, I ran.

974
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:03,900
They would have

975
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,040
chopped kitty's

976
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:05,840
nostril open.

977
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:06,800
...out through her brain

978
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,580
with a little machine

979
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,080
they've invented.

980
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,260
Yes, they drew your brain

981
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,280
out through your nostrils

982
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,180
with silver hooks.

983
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,440
This I learned

984
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,600
at the house of my father,

985
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,760
the brain extractor

986
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,380
by the Nile.

987
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,420
But I haven't finished

988
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:16,960
with that brain.

989
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,760
That is all right,

990
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,180
said Hue.

991
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,480
You may have the brain

992
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,480
of the next traveler

993
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,440
who passes by.

994
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:23,820
Ah, my son,

995
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,600
there are many brains

996
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,600
for us to work on.

997
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,200
For the land of Egypt

998
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,200
is mighty and rich

999
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,460
and the Nile Belt...

1000
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,200
Brain after brain

1001
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:30,960
was passed

1002
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,640
from one listener

1003
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:32,340
to another.

1004
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,260
And they would call

1005
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:34,700
the show

1006
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,780
and fight the show.

1007
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,700
Suddenly,

1008
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,780
they saw a little brat

1009
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,940
in the bulrushes

1010
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,360
in a basket.

1011
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,380
I see you down there,

1012
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:41,820
little caller.

1013
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:43,880
How can so many people

1014
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,100
be without one brain?

1015
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,680
I have only one brain

1016
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,920
to divide amongst all these.

1017
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,060
And so,

1018
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,040
little Sinue learned

1019
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,860
of head-launching

1020
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,740
and how it was done

1021
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,660
by the mighty river.

1022
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,400
Like Vic Morrow

1023
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,560
and, uh...

1024
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,720
Ah, the holy Vic Morrow,

1025
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,000
the only true head-launching

1026
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,420
done here in California

1027
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,340
by a professional crew

1028
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,560
filmed the right way.

1029
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,700
Not this false armor

1030
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,520
or Palmer garbage.

1031
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,280
No, I don't want to.

1032
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,080
It would have made it worse.

1033
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,020
Make better golfers.

1034
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,520
But we can't talk about that

1035
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,200
because it would leave

1036
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,180
this station live,

1037
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,120
open to libel

1038
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:14,580
and slander.

1039
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,120
That's our lawyer now.

1040
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,260
Oh, my God, he heard us.

1041
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,160
That guy's gonna sue us

1042
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:20,980
about the bleeding handle

1043
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,100
that is

1044
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,660
subliminal message.

1045
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,960
...station KXCI

1046
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,960
in Tucson, Arizona.

1047
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,320
Station KABF

1048
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,320
in Little Rock, Arkansas.

1049
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,000
As Hal falls back

1050
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,160
on reading the list of stations

1051
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,420
that don't play any of this stuff

1052
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:33,000
ever again.

1053
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,240
They don't anymore either.

1054
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,200
We wonder,

1055
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,500
if we want it all in the notes.

1056
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,060
We hope you enjoy our program.

1057
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,160
He calls in all the time.

1058
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,380
And continue to provide us

1059
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,760
with valuable callers

1060
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,400
and channel messages

1061
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,140
just to tell us

1062
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:42,960
how we're doing.

1063
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,380
What kind of thing is this?

1064
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:45,780
...programming.

1065
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,240
What kind of song

1066
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:47,780
is this?

1067
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,360
What do they know of life?

1068
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,160
On the Church of the Subgenius Show.

1069
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,600
...virtually all of the subgenius funds

1070
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,000
and absconded and lived in luxury

1071
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,860
for many years thereafter.

1072
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:56,720
Hi, little caller.

1073
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,780
And now it's showtime.

1074
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,060
Time for the subgenius hour and a half.

1075
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,280
The show that dare not even exist.

1076
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,640
The sun comes up

1077
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,260
over northern central California.

1078
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,620
And we wonder why we're awake.

1079
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,040
It's only four on Friday afternoon.

1080
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,040
We're finishing the last tape

1081
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:16,700
of the show now.

1082
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,360
In 24 hours,

1083
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,740
people will hear this show

1084
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:20,160
on the radio.

1085
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,540
And they'll think it's loud.

1086
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,880
And they'll call up

1087
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,000
and pretend.

1088
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,740
...the first church of life.

1089
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:26,880
No, no.

1090
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,840
This caller.

1091
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:28,320
This.

1092
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:28,760
No.

1093
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:29,080
Me.

1094
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:29,500
Kill me.

1095
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,220
No.

1096
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:30,680
No.

1097
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,300
He's a tough ribeye state.

1098
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,280
He's a...

1099
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,600
Let's know show story.

1100
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,040
We all going?

1101
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,200
Oh, yeah.

1102
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,680
That show's still running

1103
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,400
endlessly,

1104
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,000
mindlessly,

1105
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,820
reasonlessly,

1106
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,500
like most,

1107
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,700
most lives nowadays.

1108
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,500
No guidance,

1109
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,900
no center.

1110
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,520
Yes, yes.

1111
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,420
Hear that sound,

1112
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,620
dear friends?

1113
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,580
Do you hear that

1114
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,360
low, mournful sound?

1115
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,540
That's the sound

1116
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,940
of a normal soul

1117
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,440
floating off,

1118
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,320
uh,

1119
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,900
unhinged,

1120
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,140
and, uh,

1121
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,460
its anchor raised,

1122
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,140
leaving,

1123
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,540
leaving its body

1124
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,460
and floating off

1125
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,980
to join the other

1126
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,980
normal souls

1127
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,540
in the great syrup

1128
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,840
where they're all

1129
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,840
stirred together

1130
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,800
to be reborn again

1131
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,000
all exactly alike.

1132
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,040
...

1133
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,400
...

1134
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,260
...

1135
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,740
...

1136
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,120
...

1137
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:37,740
...

1138
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,420
...

1139
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,060
And here,

1140
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,200
high atop the inner

1141
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,320
first bank building

1142
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,820
in Dallas, Texas,

1143
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,180
we broadcast

1144
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,060
this news

1145
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,980
of the final truth,

1146
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,500
the ultimate punchline

1147
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,460
of the end of the universe

1148
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,240
to you,

1149
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,320
the mere listener.

1150
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,180
Ah, yes.

1151
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,880
The show comes in

1152
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,320
for a landing once again.

1153
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,160
Hi, Bridget.

1154
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,980
Okay, can you take it from here?

1155
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,240
Because, uh, run the old computer on 7th.

1156
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,520
I've got to go over there again.

1157
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,000
Oh, you're gonna play with the,

1158
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,280
the beast again, eh?

1159
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,460
No, the beast's been programmed.

1160
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,680
It's, it's, it's,

1161
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,740
it's doing the squid run right now.

1162
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,580
But I have to get some more

1163
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:21,800
of that frock, Doctor.

1164
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,760
Oh, oh, wait, uh, there's,

1165
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,160
the, good lord!

1166
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,840
You've got, you have,

1167
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,500
you, Doctor, have consumed

1168
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,020
an entire bathtub

1169
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,040
full of the sacred,

1170
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:33,920
Tibetan herb,

1171
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,320
habor frock, zip you off.

1172
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,480
Wait, wait a minute, listen.

1173
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,520
Listen.

1174
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:37,760
What?

1175
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,200
It's Recon Metal 12.

1176
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:39,840
Oh, no.

1177
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,420
Shh.

1178
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,140
Launch base,

1179
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,780
hey, we've got a,

1180
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,520
um,

1181
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,260
Well, hold on.

1182
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,020
We'll be back after this message.

1183
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,700
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1184
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,620
And so we find our time running out again,

1185
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:00,760
as I say, this,

1186
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,100
the same way every show,

1187
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,620
it all ends, uh,

1188
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,740
the same way.

1189
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,540
I recommend reading prescripture 16, 14, 17, 18,

1190
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,100
and you can write for information

1191
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,660
on how to receive these precious subgenius tapes,

1192
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,100
because friends,

1193
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:17,900
we need blankets and contraceptives

1194
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,920
for those boys and girls in the home

1195
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,120
for slackless children.

1196
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,380
Your contributions also keep those we hate

1197
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:25,840
starving to death.

1198
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:28,780
I command you to spill your gift seed pledge

1199
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:32,900
of 100 pounds of dollar bills in my lap,

1200
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,560
as this will buy modeling clay,

1201
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,180
and transformer toys for those poor children's dogs.

1202
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,500
We'll bless you for planting this seed,

1203
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:40,980
faith,

1204
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:41,760
ah, yes,

1205
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,140
uh,

1206
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:42,980
amen.

1207
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,740
And now our announcer will give you our mailing address.

1208
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:56,360
That's the Church of the Subgenius,

1209
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,540
P.O. Box,

1210
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,200
807,

1211
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,760
Glen Rose,

1212
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:01,620
Texas,

1213
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:04,380
76043.

1214
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:09,360
Thank you. This is Reverend Ivan Stanks,

1215
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,180
and conscribed to the Church of the Subgenius,

1216
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,240
this time with Dr. G. Gordon Gordon

1217
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,180
from the Brazilian clench, Pope of all South America.

1218
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,880
Praise Bob, my friends, and let there be swag.
