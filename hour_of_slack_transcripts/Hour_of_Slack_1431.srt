Hey Bob, we're all going to the creek tonight, it's gonna be a gas, you're coming, right?

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,400
You're stupid.

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,640
S-T-U-P-I-D.

00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,500
S-T-U-P-I-D.

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,520
See you at the disco tonight.

16
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,080
It's nice to break your ankle.

17
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:23,800
You're stupid.

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
S-T-U-P-I-D.

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,040
You're stupid.

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,220
S-T-U-P-I-D.

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,800
S-T-U-P-I-D.

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,400
S-T-U-P-I-D.

23
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,160
Oh yeah.

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,960
I like around the glasses.

25
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,320
Make you look real cool.

26
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,060
Make you look real clever.

27
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,500
Yeah.

28
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,200
I like dungarees.

29
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,980
They're full to the brim.

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,680
But you're not very clever.

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,720
I bet you're a real interesting person.

32
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,100
I bet you like to read and talk a lot about politics.

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,440
Oh yeah.

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,340
But most of all,

35
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,660
you're like me with big bodies.

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
I make brick hot blood.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,040
Six plus batter.

38
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,140
Extra stupid.

39
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,340
S-T-U-P-I-D.

40
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,260
Second lucky number two.

41
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,660
The same as your ID.

42
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,580
You're stupid.

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,720
S-T-U-P-I-D.

44
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,760

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,140
S-T-U-P-I-D.

50
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,240
You're stupid.

51
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,540
S-T-U-P-I-D.

52
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,120

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

62
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're stupid, S-T-B-I-D, stupid, S-T-B-I-D, stupid, S-T-B-I-D.

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,880
See for yourself, a dog with two bodies and one head.

64
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,380
They're all on the inside right now.

65
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:02,780
A pig with hands and feet, just like a human, just like yours or mine.

66
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,620
A gruesome, ugly sight, but an educational one.

67
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,960
Come in now.

68
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,300
They're all on the inside right now.

69
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,240
The world's largest collection on tour.

70
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,000
And you're just in time.

71
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,640
Come in now.

72
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,400
Alive, alive, a cow with six legs.

73
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,680
Look, look at the doorway.

74
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,980
The six-legged cow is standing up in there right now.

75
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,360
You're going to see the zonkey, half zebra, half bulldog.

76
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,580
A midget horse standing, only 27 inches tall.

77
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,400
Look, look through the doorway.

78
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,920
They're in there right now.

79
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,780
Smell the aroma, and you know they're alive.

80
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,600
Alive, alive.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,200
They're on the inside right now.

82
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,020
A raccoon with two heads.

83
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,620
A pig with two heads.

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,420
A rabbit with two heads.

85
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,920
They're on the inside right now.

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,800
Two complete heads on the same body, and they're on the inside right now.

87
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,800
Don't miss.

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,180
The amazing fish.

89
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:57,580
Is she girl?

90
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,440
Is she fish?

91
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,540
Or is she girl?

92
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,080
You judge for yourself.

93
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,760
And you're just in time.

94
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,540
Come in now.

95
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,220
The first thing that's going to happen is we're going to allow Andrew the Impaled to

96
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,780
finally finish his set with electricity.

97
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:20,360
So before he was only causing himself pain, and now he will cause us pain.

98
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,600
All right, this is going to be great.

99
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,600
You're not going to know what to think.

100
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,060
I hope you get to enjoy this very, very painful moment.

101
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,280
I hope you get to enjoy this very, very painful moment.

102
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:35,520
Where I do things to you with this machine and my mouth.

103
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,880
Yeah, it sounds hotter than it is.

104
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,240
The first song that I have for you is called I'm Free.

105
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,520
It's alternately titled this weekend as The Pink's Delusion.

106
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,120
The Pink's Delusion.

107
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,400
The Pink's Delusion.

108
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,400
Get a job.

109
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,520
Go to church.

110
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,820
Find a mate.

111
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,240
Hope it works.

112
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,500
Say big.

113
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,760
Going fast.

114
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,440
By now, it won't last.

115
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,420
And who's the better dancer on that?

116
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,980
Who's the better dancer show?

117
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,940
And which team going to bring the trophy home?

118
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,860
You want to look at臣

119
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,140
But what would you do if the overcoat you were wearing dejОg fе CEOs maid me hanى?

120
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:45,620


121
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,740
He needs to go.

122
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,120
You Chàp.

123
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,360
I don't know if you've ever seen me?

124
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,360


125
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,360


126
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,360


127
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,360


128
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,700
free. I said repeat after me. I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free.

129
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Now we all know you need a home. So find a bank and get a loan. Pay it back threefold. And if you

130
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:24,020
don't, out in the cold. You always can refinance if there comes a rainy day. Unless of course the

131
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:32,620
value drops, then no way. I said repeat after me. I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I said repeat after me.

132
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,020
I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free.

133
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:48,860
Now go to school for your degree. To get a job, that's what you need. When you're done, you'll be

134
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,760
prepared for what's available out there. And if nothing is available,

135
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,120
I'll tell you what you get.

136
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,520
Now go back in with mom and dad.

137
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,760
And let them struggle with your debt.

138
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,560
I said repeat after me. Спасибо.

139
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,880
I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free.

140
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,660
I said repeat after me.

141
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:15,860
I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free...

142
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,040
I'm free, I'm free...

143
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,720
free money

144
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,460
free

145
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,300
those are some

146
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,560
now none of you try this at home right now

147
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,040
okay

148
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,860
go to someone else's house and try it there

149
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,560
yeah

150
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,300
because you don't want to offend

151
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,100
anybody

152
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,280
in today's new

153
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,180

155
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,240
the show's on top of him

156
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,100
he can't get up

157
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,160
the show's on top of me

158
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,040
that's a funny thing

159
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,600
get off

160
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,700
get off of me

161
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,320
did you ever see Great Lakes, Illinois?

162
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,360
that's where I was stationed

163
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,580
get off of me Paul you're crushing the smokes

164
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,260
that's where boot camp is

165
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,300
my A school was across the street my friend

166
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,180
no in fact

167
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,480
I was 19

168
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,160
19

169
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,160


170
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,160


171
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,160


172
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,160


173
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,160


174
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,160


175
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,160


176
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,160


177
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,380
I stayed in the west and went out west

178
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,380
and came back west

179
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,420
it was cool because while we were going through boot camp

180
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,160
they would talk about the cannonballs that were off the shore there

181
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,120
from the war of 18

182
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,900
in fact John Shirley was

183
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,160
many years ago writing

184
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,260
something to do with

185
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,500
the ship at the bottom

186
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,300
of one of the Great Lakes and it's so cold

187
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,360
that the ship was in pretty good shape

188
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,740
preserved yeah that's true

189
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,680
it's so cold down there

190
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,780
I'm going to reinstall animode

191
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,980
it's true

192
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,940
I've seen it

193
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,340
I've seen it

194
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,620
well I watched a documentary about it

195
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,080
so it's true

196
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,480
so yeah any documentary makes it true

197
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,680
no I mean

198
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,180
I mean this one was legit

199
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,240
it had all the people that were involved in

200
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,780
and looking for it and everything else

201
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,860
and it was a video of it

202
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,840
it was very well preserved

203
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,720
earlier you stated that Dave and David are one person

204
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,140
uh oh

205
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,020
that's weird

206
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,660
that's just weird man

207
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,200
Philo are one and same person

208
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,840
oh really

209
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,260
who and Philo

210
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:19,380
Philo

211
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:19,640
Philo

212
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,060
Philo

213
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,160
Philo

214
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,660
Philo

215
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,360
ível

216
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,840
The

217
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,660
The

218
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,900
Actually

219
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,200
the

220
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,500
Majuran's

221
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,000
Ghost

222
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:39,560
Because they both go way back, you know, in the olden times in Texas, you see.

223
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,400
Yeah, it's not really like six people or even three people.

224
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, I've been misled, hopefully.

225
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,240
It's not six people or three people.

226
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,140
I have some ghost milk in my fridge now.

227
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,320
If there is normal ghost milk and fat-free ghost milk,

228
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:02,900
well, then in the creamier, fuller, tastier, thicker, fat-containing ghost milk,

229
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,220
look, it's the fat actually from a ghost.

230
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,040
So you've actually been milking these ghosts yourself,

231
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,140
or is this just the ghost milk you would buy in the stores?

232
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,640
It's a machine.

233
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,480
I have an automatic machine, a fully automatic machine.

234
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,460
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

235
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,960
It does all the work, the dirty work, I like to call it, the ghost work.

236
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,140
You don't actually want to touch those ghost mammary areas or anything?

237
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,140
I want some.

238
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,080
The machine has a dial, you know, a knob.

239
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,300
I turn it to the right.

240
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,140
Is it really creamy?

241
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,760
Yeah.

242
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,660
Ghost style.

243
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,340
Is the ghost still creamy?

244
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,980
I've heard it's thin and insubstantial.

245
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,060
I'm turning on the pump now.

246
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,860
Just wait a minute.

247
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,640
Is it kind of...

248
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,700
Now, have you run into any trouble with the authorities coming down on you for ghost abuse?

249
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,060
He's got the machinery running, I think.

250
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,880
Yeah, I can hear the machinery.

251
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,680
The machinery is starting up.

252
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,440
Is it actually...

253
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,180
Actually, ghost fat.

254
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,540
Don't you put a little, like, some pads in there to keep the ghost comfortable?

255
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:22,020
Do you let the ghost imbibe in some type of intoxicant before you latch onto their breast area?

256
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,200
Is the ghost milk pasteurized?

257
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,420
I hope it is.

258
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,340
I hope we can get the pasteurized...

259
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,820
Although, I'd like to get some whole ghost milk if you have some of that.

260
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,460
Or some raw milk.

261
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,040
Raw ghost milk?

262
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,820
Raw ghost milk.

263
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,860
Yeah, raw ghost milk.

264
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,080
Raw ghost yogurt.

265
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:45,780
That's the best.

266
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,100
The only kind of milk I will drink from this moment is bastard milk.

267
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,040
Oh, yes.

268
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,160
Bastard milk?

269
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,320
You get bastard...

270
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,440
Bastard ghost milk.

271
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,520
...by Mr. John O'Connor.

272
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,180
Not related to the boy from Terminator.

273
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:02,660
Movie.

274
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,520
Yeah, not J.C.

275
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,000
You're right.

276
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,060
Mm-hmm.

277
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,220
Mm-hmm.

278
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:07,540
Mm-hmm.

279
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:07,880
Mm-hmm.

280
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:08,620
Mm-hmm.

281
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:08,800
Mm-hmm.

282
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,180
Mm-hmm.

283
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,360
Mm-hmm.

284
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,800
Mm-hmm.

285
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,300
Mm-hmm.

286
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:10,500
Mm-hmm.

287
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:10,740


288
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:10,800


289
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,020
Mm-hmm.

290
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,160
Mm-hmm.

291
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,400
Mm-hmm.

292
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:12,400


293
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:12,400


294
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,520
Is that why Casper is fat now?

295
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,160
Because you've been feeding him ghost milk?

296
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,640
Have you been feeding a fat man lately?

297
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,240
Well, no.

298
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,280
Well, maybe he's got a ghost girlfriend.

299
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,520
Do you have chocolate ghost milk?

300
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,940
Well, I hate that.

301
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,020
Can I get some chocolate ghost cottage cheese?

302
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,560
Mm-hmm.

303
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:31,560


304
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,620
Yeah, chocolate ghost cottage cheese.

305
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,440
That sounds like ghost cottage cheese, ghost ice cream.

306
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,440
I think we're going to bring down the wrath of the authorities with this ghost abuse that's going on here.

307
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,460
Unless we make sure that they're comfortable while we're depriving them of their fluids.

308
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,420
You know, some planets, those fluids are very, very expensive.

309
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,680
And we can make a lot of money.

310
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,480
We've got to give this some careful consideration.

311
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,460
I think we need a five-year business plan, net present value.

312
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:18,500
Extrapolate the cost reduction over the long term.

313
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,380
Add the scissors to the camper tools.

314
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,480
Have you ever had any breast milk cheese?

315
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,980
Can you imagine?

316
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,200
Cheese made from the old

317
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:50,120
If the light I was through, I wouldn't be alive.

318
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,440
When you told your best friend when the lean I was your only guy.

319
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,360
Your sophistication makes me feel so paranoid.

320
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,760
Kick me with your leather boots, the way that I enjoy.

321
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,260
Please, my dear, kick me with your leather boots.

322
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,500
I'm sincere, kick me with your leather boots.

323
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,700
Please, my dear, kick me with your leather boots.

324
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,860
I'm sincere, kick me with your leather boots.

325
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,420
I snarkatize and choke and hurrah really very nice.

326
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,380
換 되 рад, I'm delighted and you said it right twice.

327
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,640
Your stomach's closed and conscience has me running around the bend.

328
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,080
Kick me with your leather boots, kick me hard again.

329
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,240
Please, my dear, kick me with your leather boots.

330
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,820
I'm sincere.

331
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,140
Kick me with your leather boots, please my dear

332
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,300
Kick me with your leather boots, I'm so chill

333
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,160
Kick me with your leather boots

334
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,980
You took me to your bedroom and I got such a thrill

335
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,940
It was like a sequel to The Boys from Brazil

336
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,180
When we wear our leather boots, it's so much fun

337
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,500
You're smashing like a volley, send the flash of my brain

338
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,720
You say, yes, he was the greatest of them all

339
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,880
In mapping and putting up a bit of old control

340
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,000
Your stunning social conscience had me banging on the wall

341
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,240
Kick me with your leather boots, kick me to high four

342
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,820
Please my dear, kick me with your leather boots

343
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,040
I'm so chill, kick me with your leather boots

344
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,220
Please my dear, kick me with your leather boots

345
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,380
I'm so chill, kick me with your leather boots

346
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:16,780
Yes!

347
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:18,300


348
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,840
Listing is a function of the mind

349
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,980
Foggy Fedex Mendel said it's well before my time

350
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,960
Your sonic social content has made me inside

351
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Kick me with your leather boots

352
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,360
Kick me in the brain

353
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,960
Please my dear

354
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,860
Kick me with your leather boots

355
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,820
I'm sincere

356
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,000
Kick me with your leather boots

357
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,300
Please my dear

358
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,180
Kick me with your leather boots

359
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,320
I'm sincere

360
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Kick me with your leather boots

361
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,040
You took me to your bedroom and I got such a thrill

362
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,100
It was like a sequel to The Push from Brazil

363
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,420
Where we were all like the bricks they sell on the sign

364
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,540
It's passing by football, except the black tonight, right?

365
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,420
It's passing by football, except the black tonight, right?

366
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:41,420


367
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,580
Oh, I gotta do this one quick.

368
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,840
That song and Stupid Kid were by the Sultans of Bling by way of The Large,

369
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,640
who also brought about half of this show, including the Puzzling Evidence show clips,

370
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,280
with Doug Filo, Phineas Narco, and Callers.

371
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,980
The other half, such as Andrew,

372
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,300
The Impaled, is from X Day Drill of Aught 16.

373
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,280
The music in the background right now is my air conditioner.

374
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,200
And now this.

375
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,540
From PR News in Washington, I'm still being investigated.

376
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,740
The victims were not immediately identified.

377
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,320
PR News trying to escape Southern police.

378
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,460
President Obama has PR News.

379
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,520
That has not helped to create new jobs.

380
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,760
Economist Hugh Johnson says it was two-tenths of a percent.

381
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,620
It's still a pretty number.

382
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,980
For Wall Street, 64887.

383
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,720
307.

384
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:27,920
11.

385
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,420
Officials are now confirming the five-foot sections say they are not listening to PR.

386
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,800
Film and photography company Kodak is confirming it'll sell its human remains for $650 million billion.

387
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,960
President Obama has chosen PR News in Washington.

388
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:52,640
One starred night, Prince Lucifer arose.

389
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,180
Tired of his dark dominions.

390
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:03,720
Swung the fiend above the rolling ball in cloud parts screened.

391
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,880
Where sinners hugged their specter of repose.

392
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,440
Now upon his western wing he leans.

393
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,860
Now his great bulk o'er Africa's sands careens.

394
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,300
Now the black planet shadowed.

395
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,000
Arctic snows.

396
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,180
Soaring through wider zones that prick his scars.

397
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,440
With memory of the old revolt from awe.

398
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,740
He reached a middle height.

399
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,200
And at the stars which are the brain of heaven.

400
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,560
He paused and sang.

401
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,500
Around the ancient track stood rank on rank.

402
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,140
The army of unalterable law.

403
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,160

Factory womans awoke in long platforms from a doormat.

407
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:45,920
Thank you.

408
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:14,820
Thank you.

409
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,080
Thank you.

410
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,240
Thank you.

411
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,280
That's why we don't play surf rock.

412
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,920
Well, no, actually it is.

413
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,180
Thank you.

414
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,400
Thank you.

415
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,300
Thank you.

416
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,180
Thank you.

417
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,180


418
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,080
Thank you.

419
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:40,900
Thank you.

420
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:41,820
Thank you.

421
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,100
We're going to do one song and then we're going to bring up a couple of special guests.

422
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,180
This one is originally entitled, Gandhi Lives.

423
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,280
But I don't worship Gandhi.

424
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:59,700
And I don't really worship Bob either, but I do appreciate everything he's done for me.

425
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,660
So if you know this song, please sing along.

426
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,120
And everywhere you heard the word Gandhi before, just change it for the next song.

427
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,120


428
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,580
And I'm going to sing the word Bob.

429
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,720
If you don't know the song, you know I've got CDs for sale.

430
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,460
They're only $10.

431
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,840
And I promise you I will only spend the money on wine, women, and froth.

432
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,060
Are you ready?

433
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,680
Oh my God, aren't they adorable?

434
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,620
Oh my God, they're very single too.

435
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,400
Bob Dob lives.

436
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,120
And Bob Dob lives.

437
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,860
And Bob Dob breathes.

438
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,040
But only if you so believe.

439
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,300
You act as if you were a saint.

440
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,560
Well, tent is and you just ain't.

441
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,440
Bob Dob lives all night and well.

442
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,840
He's living in a big hotel.

443
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,280
Don't tell us so.

444
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,680
Alive or dead.

445
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,280
It might not matter as Mr. Dead.

446
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,100
Shake a bob, shake a shake.

447
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,100

00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,960

You do the Bomb Dance.

461
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,000
You do the Bomb Dance.

462
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,060
You do the Bomb Dance.

463
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,300
You Do the hundreds of factors.

464
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,720
Turbo rises uncomfortable situations, passengers cross roads deixa.

00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,640

Now here's Ernie Ford and the whole Hee-Haw gang singing the great old gospel song,

473
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,780
Jesus, hold my hand.

474
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,900
Jesus, hold my hand.

475
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,180
Jesus, hold my hand.

476
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,740
Jesus, hold my hand.

477
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,740
Jesus, hold my hand.

478
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,980
Jesus, hold my hand.

479
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,760
Some of you might be thinking,

480
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,680
Sing it if you know it.

481
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,500
It's been played a few times.

482
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,860
It is.

483
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,120
It is.

484
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,780
It is.

485
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,340
From the piglets to the billowing pack

486
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,840
On your life, a warping dark

487
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,840
Walk away

488
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,520
There's a hole in your soul

489
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,720
That's burning you alive

490
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,080
Where's life?

491
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,400
You'll never be paid

492
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Walk away

There's a hole in your soul

That's burning you alive

00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,740
There's a hymn-telling man

Who lives by your side

And up in heaven

00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,020
There's a hymn-telling man

Who is beckoning with his day

00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:22,520


551
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:22,520


552
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:22,520


553
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:22,520


554
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:22,780
Because that's how I ride

555
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:22,780


556
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:22,780


557
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:22,780


558
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,560
When the dreamed

559
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,600
Go in time

560
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,240
I'll shape projects

561
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,240


562
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,800
your tax, coffee, turtle, snack, from the pinch to the billowing pipe.

563
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:44,200
Triple bob for your money back, from the pinch to the billowing pipe.

564
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,200
We're going to ascend to our native stars, a brighter and better world than this one.

565
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,120
Gleaming in glory.

566
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,340
After a night of dubstep and partying.

567
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,600
After a night of filth and imbecility.

568
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,080
Actually, the dubstep is tomorrow night, which can go on forever.

569
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:12,620
I thought it was tonight.

570
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,760
No, not tonight.

571
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:21,420
It was going to be tonight, but I said, it was me that said, I need to sleep before 7 a.m.

572
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,540
You changed the schedule then?

573
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:23,960
Huh?

574
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,140
You changed the schedule?

575
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:25,760
Yeah.

576
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,780
Well, no, it's in the schedule.

577
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,760
It's written in there.

578
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,500
The all-night long dubstep, which, by the way, you'll be interested to know,

579
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:38,880
the Starwood, the early Starwood people complained bitterly about that last year.

580
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,240
I mean, real bitterly.

581
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,520
So they couldn't take it, huh?

582
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,280
Oh, they come in early on Saturday.

583
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,660
Panty waste.

584
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:51,760
To get, you know, set up their witchcraft stills.

585
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,020
Wimpcraft.

586
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,520
Yeah.

587
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,560
Would they prefer, like, an all-night acoustic yodeling?

588
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,240
They drum all night long.

589
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,980
Oh, the drums.

590
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,460
They drum all damn night long.

591
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,220
The hideous drums.

592
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:03,740
What's the difference?

593
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,180
The beating of those hideous drums.

594
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:06,740
The drums.

595
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,260
The drums.

596
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,020
The natives are restless tonight.

597
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,660
But apparently the dubstep was too loud and went on.

598
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,900
Oh, that is sad.

599
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,960
So the pagans weren't able to rest in bowers of this.

600
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,520
They don't appreciate bass drops.

601
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,240
Yeah, really.

602
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:31,620
You know, if you can't suffer a little bit of discomfort for your so-called faith,

603
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,000
then what good are you?

604
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,620
It only works when the sun shines.

605
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,420
And why would you can't hear the stage at a place where they've advertised

606
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,360
they're going to be making noise all night?

607
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,360
What kind of a fair-weather sailor are you, anyway?

608
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,800
Oh, the kind that wants to get a...

609
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,640
Just a minute of sleep, please.

610
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,540
No.

611
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:50,820
Try going to Burning Man.

612
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,640
Can you just shut up for a minute?

613
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:59,220
Try going to Burning Man, where they set enormous speakers pointed right at you from across the street.

614
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,340
And yet they don't complain about the giant dick-eating spiders.

615
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,800
That's because nobody out here really has that giant of a dick.

616
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,160
They're silenced by the horror of it all.

617
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,740
From PR News.

618
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:13,740


619
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:13,740


620
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:13,740


621
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:13,740


622
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:13,740


623
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,420
In Washington, I'm to become the 18th Afghan civilian arrested in connection with Vietnam.

624
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,200
President Obama today announced he'll be stepping down July the 1st.

625
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,600
President made the announcement today in the White House Rose Garden.

626
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,620
I am conducted to a special release.

627
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,300
I don't shit.

628
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,520
Not clear with or without the possibility of parole.

629
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,760
The Commerce Department says factories that sold banned performance-enhancing drugs

630
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,580
rose 1%, a 1.2% increase.

631
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,940
The Dow Jones 2649643.

632
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,140
Investigators say it could take several months to determine what caused PR News in Houston.

633
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:55,760
Law enforcement officials in the U.S. and the U.K. say you're listening to what they say was a $200 million PR News in Washington.

634
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,300
Okay, friends, I think it's time to end the hour of slack.

635
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,940
It's now become completely slackless, unless you guys want to keep going.

636
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,320
Wait, I did have one more thing that I wanted to ask you guys.

637
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,600
I didn't know if you guys had talked about this yet.

638
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:13,520
Have you guys heard about on Facebook how they succumbed to the pressure and now you can get banned and have things?

639
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,540
It's completely ruined if you make any rape jokes at all.

640
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:23,780
I'm a little worried about the state of the slack hole.

641
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,100
We've got three Facebook pages that are nothing but.

642
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,960
And it's filled with the pink and the unsaved and the unwashed and unclean.

643
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,640
And I think it's probably only a matter of time before it gets reported again.

644
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,400
And I worry about it.

645
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,640
God forbid that there should be pornography on the Internet.

646
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,980
Well, but now if we even make jokes about rape bears,

647
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,500
which are awful,

648
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,920
they're obviously a favorite on the slack hole.

649
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:55,080
It's the most insidious form of censorship is when the government can do nothing,

650
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:59,420
but they can't stop people from censoring you who aren't with the government.

651
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,660
So they come up with a way that you can all communicate together

652
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,520
and then let somebody else make the rules.

653
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,440
And they'll decide what you can say and can't say.

654
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,960
And usually it'll be the government agreeing.

655
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,360
Well, you can or can't say.

656
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,800
Yeah, you can read my note there.

657
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,700
That's my rant note.

658
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,280
A serendipitous quote at the end of these rant notes is,

659
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,180
rape isn't funny.

660
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,120
It is the way we do it.

661
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,200
That's what's funny, the way we do it.

662
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:29,480
Yes.

663
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,620
But you'll have to be careful.

664
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:38,300
Don't be surprised if the whole Facebook comes crumbling down on our ears.

665
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,100
We're here overnight off face crack.

666
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,520
Oh, well.

667
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,420
Oh, well.

668
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,020
We'll just have to go to Scrub.

669
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,800
Yes.

670
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,320
Well, there you go.

671
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,520
The nice thing about it, you can't get into Scrub unless you get past old gatekeeper Stang.

672
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,880
You have to answer the riddle about when and exactly how you paid your 35 bucks.

673
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,400
We should just make the front butt book.

674
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,780
There you go.

675
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,020
Isn't that a common thing?

676
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,740
People say, well, no, I don't have any.

677
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,640
No, certainly not.

678
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,620
Are you sure?

679
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:12,800
Sure.

680
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,460
And because they don't recognize what's actually happening.

681
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,040
We should end it now.

682
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,940
We've upset you.

683
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,400
I'm sorry.

684
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,920
Oh, she gets upset.

685
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,960
She's so sensitive and sweet.

686
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,080
I'm so mean.

687
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,960
Well, at least she's sensitive.

688
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,340
Most people around here are about as sensitive as a power shovel.

689
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,840
That's me.

690
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,380
I've been working on that for years, building up a good shell.

691
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,140
Right.

692
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,000
Many, many butt cheeks.

693
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,120
I've got your sensitivity.

694
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,080
Right here.

695
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,160
I think I'll be hearing that a lot later tonight.

696
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,820
Okay, well, I'm going to fade this out.

697
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,300
Well, Ivan Stang, what is the theme of tomorrow's ball?

698
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,180
How about that?

699
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,600
You want to put that in the list?

700
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,040
Simple.

701
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,000
What was it again?

702
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,180
Day of the Dead.

703
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,200
The Day of the Dead.

704
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:11,720
I actually have a sack of skull masks of different kinds in my car.

705
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,580
Oh.

706
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,780
A whole sack of skull masks.

707
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,520
Dear Day of the Dead.

708
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,560
Attention, subgeniuses.

709
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:34,040
There will be a human fight and accu-beating clinic at the top of the hill at Camp Hypercube before the pig roast.

710
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:41,300
So get your third nostrils unclogged and meet us at the top of the hill for...

711
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,160
Possibly the bloodiest of the blood orgies to about to begin.

712
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,120
There will be nothing but tits.

713
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,440
At what time?

714
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,560
We shall begin in a few moments.

715
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,740
We were going to start a little later.

716
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:09,760
But if we can get a few subgenius volunteers to tie up some other subgenius volunteers and drag them kicking and screaming to Camp Hypercube,

717
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,600
we will flay and disperse.

718
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,540
We will dismember accordingly.

719
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:18,300
And we will be supervising and documenting quite heavily.

720
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,500
So, praise Bob.

721
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,280
Indeed.

722
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,300
I thought we were going to start all the flaying and torturing tomorrow, but that's okay.

723
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,060
Practice makes perfect.

724
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:33,660
My testicles are actually connected to my body most of the time.

725
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,420
But which body are you talking about?

726
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,200
The undescended testicle of Jesus Christ.

727
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,880
No, no.

728
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,600
If anybody sees a spare unclogged...

729
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,260
Unconnected testicle...

730
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,220
Please send them on home.

731
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:46,900
Drop us a line.

732
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,640
Okay.

733
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,160
Send them on home now, y'all.

734
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,140
That's a remote orbiting ball.

735
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,140
Send it home.

736
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,340
Send it, the homeless testicle tossed to me.

737
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,280
I lift my lump before the golden door.

738
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,680
You know, childhood innocence is now gone,

739
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,560
and we are left as cynical adults to weather the...

740
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,760
bitter winds that are blowing our way from X-Day,

741
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:21,400
from the launching platform area where the great saucer ship will descend.

742
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,860
Now, that was a large spaceship in eight and a half, too, wasn't there,

743
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,360
that never got off the ground?

744
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,700
Well, you didn't see it.

745
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,800
It wasn't on camera.

746
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,880
It took off after the movie was over.

747
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,120
I thought there were actually scenes where they were trying to construct that,

748
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,580
and they...

749
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:37,900
Oh, yeah.

750
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:42,200
They built a huge spaceship set under construction.

751
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,620
That was the set, an under-construction set of a set under construction.

752
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,360
And when the movie was finished, they could complete it and take off.

753
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,580
But it was important that it not fly during the movie.

754
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:01,880
Actually, I understand that that whole spaceship set ending was kind of an afterthought.

755
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,580
The movie was going to end a completely different way.

756
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,860
And just as the subject matter of the movie would indicate,

757
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,560
everything's fake and unpredictable and unplanned,

758
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,220
and you can't fit it all into a formula.

759
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,940
There's nobody at the controls.

760
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,720
And that's...

761
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,100
We like it that way.

762
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:23,660
It's fun.

763
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,420
It's organic.

764
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,960
It evolves on its own.

765
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,160
And slack comes dripping down from the heavens.

766
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,180
You'll get the best slack that way.

767
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,440
It's revolutionary.

768
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,160
There's no status.

769
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,900
There's constant movement.

770
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:38,660
Movement.

771
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,260
But aren't we closing in on the magic?

772
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,980
It's getting near the hour when we get to go home.

773
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It's getting near the hour.

774
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,180
When the church lights yawn.

775
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,880
As El Duce would say,

776
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,120
it's near the hour.

777
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,860
Yes, it's time.

778
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,800
It's the time, girls.

779
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,140
Make the trains run on time.

780
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,640
And organize...

781
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,280
Oh, not El Duce.

782
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,460
I'm talking about El Duce.

783
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,440
Bob never made the trains.

784
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,960
I think that's one of the greatest things that you could say about Bob,

785
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,000
was the trains never ran on time when he was in charge.

786
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:12,600
I don't remember.

787
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,100
Oh, no, it was more than that.

788
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,540
When Bob was in charge,

789
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,060
it's not that the trains ran on time or didn't run on time.

790
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,140
It's that time ceased to have any meaning on the trains.

791
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,300
When railroads reorganized time,

792
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,700
our system of time was created by the American Railroad.

793
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,420
The trains ran on time.

794
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:30,900
Literally.

795
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,980
Instead of stopping at fueling stations with big bins of coal or diesel fuel,

796
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,020
there would be big bins of time that they would put into the fuel tanks of the trains.

797
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,900
The trains literally ran on time.

798
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,340
They would pour in from the hopper by the side of the tracks,

799
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,780
all those seconds, minutes, and pulped hours that had been crammed in by the service railroads.

800
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,000
In the summer, they would switch to daylight savings time,

801
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,620
which has a much lower octane.

802
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:54,860
Daylight savings time.

803
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,260
Nobody could ever really understand why they did that seasonal switch.

804
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,280
I think it had something to do with California regulations.

805
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,060
I don't know.

806
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,640
And in the winter, it was back to the fungus and the berries that their grandmothers had given them.

807
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,940
They looked out the window and knew that the time was nigh.

808
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:10,920
Praise Bob!

809
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,720
Praise Bob!

810
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,040
Praise Bob!

811
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,920
And praise Tommy Amoeba, the next entertainer on this Pittsburgh cabal.

812
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,840
Praise Bob!

813
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,760
They're our subgenius in Pittsburgh, and sadly, this is what we look like.

814
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,580
That made me salute my pants.

815
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:28,980
Woo!

816
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,160
Woo!

817
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,720
mean

818
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,640
yeah

819
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,300
you

820
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,920
yeah

821
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,200
Yeah, Lord

822
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,980
I'm a hero

823
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,460
I'm a hero

824
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,900
Like Captain Kirk in Star Trek

825
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,900
Aboard the Enterprise

826
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,880
Surrounded by your high tech fantasy

827
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,720
You went out surprised

828
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,640
While jacking your tic-tac

829
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,700
You listened to these lies

830
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,800
And fizzled like fuck

831
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,420
Oh, take a look at this

832
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,760
What is this?

833
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,560
This is my

834
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,660
Lord, make way

835
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:37,460
I am here to pay

836
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,280
All the money

837
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,080
To me

838
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,580
You want me

839
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,080
Hey

840
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,700
I will stop the rain

841
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,440
You will stop the rain

842
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,240
Tell me what we did

843
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,300
Are you

844
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,260
You know the pain

845
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,180
You know the pain

846
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,860
It's not supposed to be

847
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,280
It's not supposed to be

848
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:22,280


849
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:22,780
Rain

850
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:22,800
Rain

851
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,240
Rain

852
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,700
Rain

853
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,920
Rain

854
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,200
Rain

855
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,260
Love

856
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,180
Don't you know

857
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:49,040
That we stonk

858
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:49,240
gig

859
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,820
Down our

860
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:50,820


861
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,100
He adds

862
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:51,400
New

863
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:51,740
Here's a woman

864
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:51,740


865
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:51,740


866
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:51,740


867
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,360
Come back

868
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,240
Say

869
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:55,940
I am

870
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:55,940


871
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:56,540
Angel

872
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,260
I am

873
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,400
unplugged. In fact, everything was unplugged that night at X-Day.

874
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,080
Lee Murr did PR News and

875
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,200
Jesus, and thanks to Dr. Sinister for

876
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,040
letting us on his show at WCSB Cleveland.

877
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,100
We'll hear a little more from that, but otherwise

878
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,340
all the rest is by and large by The Large.

879
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,180
Thank ya.

880
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,100
Yes! You know the...

881
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,400
And I think

882
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,820
it's hilarious when he yells out,

883
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,500
BOMBS!

884
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,700
And it took a while, like

885
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,980
months afterwards, and then I

886
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,620
watched the video again, and I was like,

887
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,460
nothing happened, and I was just very

888
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,240
interested in the video.

889
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:57,800
And that was it.

890
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,280
Actually, maybe a year later,

891
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,100
I started saying, BOMBS!

892
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:04,920
And then

893
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,740
everyone burst out laughing.

894
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,820
Everyone was like, BOMBS!

895
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,220
It's very funny.

896
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,920
To say BOMBS,

897
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,840
I thought in the video that it was hilarious

898
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,640
because it's not actually a swear word,

899
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,480
it's just his name.

900
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,220
I like BOMBS.

901
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,780
So that was funny.

902
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,740
And then, you know,

903
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,060
it evolved.

904
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,160
What did I get from other people?

905
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,360
Well, when I watched videos

906
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,160
that I'm a thon,

907
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,880
I'm a thon,

908
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,860
for example,

909
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,360
I'd start doing what they're doing,

910
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,720
or, you know, just do what I usually do.

911
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,980
So, yeah, it definitely

912
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,580
does get picked up.

913
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,220
I'm gonna see if I missed any questions here.

914
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,380
Pick up new ones and old ones go away,

915
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,440
or do old ones never go away?

916
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,480
Some old ones never go away.

917
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,240
They can be kind of...

918
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:57,820
kind of classics.

919
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,160
BOMBS!

920
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:13,920
BOMBS!

921
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:14,740
BOMBS!

922
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,340
BOMBS!

923
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:16,400
BOMBS!

924
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:17,160
BOMBS!

925
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,000
BOMBS!

926
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,160
BOMBS!

927
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:19,460
BOMBS!

928
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,300
BOMBS!

929
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,140
BOMBS!

930
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:21,140


931
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:21,880
BOMBS!

932
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:21,940
BOMBS!

933
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,480
BOMBS!

934
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:22,500
BOMBS!

935
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:22,580
BOMBS!

936
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,920
We're going to take one last call.

937
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,060
I can't wait to hear what this is.

938
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,960
I want to hear about the RNA trials.

939
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,320
I want to eat this.

940
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,420
I want to hear about the RNA drops.

941
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,460
Hello, you're on the air.

942
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,120
And join me.

943
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:00,880
Hello.

944
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:01,820
Hi, guys.

945
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,580
Are you on the air?

946
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,240
I want to know about the LSD drops.

947
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:06,720
MST drops.

948
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,680
Man, we're doing it, and we're just about out of time.

949
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,620
Yes, we are.

950
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,880
We could have done something here.

951
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,920
I just figured I'd try one last time before you all went home.

952
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,680
Well, thank you so much.

953
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,720
It's glad to hear from you.

954
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,820
I'm glad to hear from you.

955
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,780
It's good to hear from you.

956
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,680
It is good time.

957
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,100
It is good to hear.

958
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,820
I wanted to say I'm going to miss you guys because I wasn't going to be there for X days this year.

959
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,140
You know what?

960
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,240
No, I won't be there either, Janice.

961
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,040
That makes two of us.

962
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,820
The saucers will find you where you are.

963
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,300
What the hell are you doing?

964
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,900
Man, what the hell have I been doing for the last year?

965
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,360
I don't know.

966
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,280
What the hell do you think you're doing?

967
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,160
I suddenly find myself without the means.

968
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,960
I suddenly find myself without the means.

969
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,220
Dragging your butt through the day.

970
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,280
Selling body and soul to a bunch of bad normals?

971
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,540
My daughter was tired of getting...

972
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,500
No, seriously, the conspiracy.

973
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,380
Oh, man.

974
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,440
You know what's really messed up?

975
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,420
You know what's really messed up?

976
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,720
There's a guy in a supervisory position who works on the same floor in my building.

977
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,580
His name is Bob.

978
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:01,760
And there's a Dobbshead sticker on his wall.

979
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,480
Dope.

980
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,820
And I'm afraid to bring it up.

981
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:05,700
I would be.

982
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,080
Yep.

983
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,020
Old Bob Cyclops.

984
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,940
Old Bob might take offense at...

985
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:12,920
Do they know?

986
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,560
Or did they just find a t-shirt in a thrift store somewhere?

987
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,740
Yeah, you never know where that came from.

988
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,000
As long as it doesn't actually say Bob, you have to suspect the worst.

989
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,260
That full knowledge is there.

990
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,700
And the...

991
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,780
What a day of reckoning.

992
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,780
Oh, here's what you can do, Dr. Sinister,

993
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,840
to determine if the guy is a for real subgenius.

994
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,900
See how he spells Bob.

995
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,180
That's it.

996
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:37,640
Yes.

997
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,940
I know for a fact that in correspondence that has been addressed to him and from him,

998
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,860
there are no quotation marks in his name.

999
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,760
Well, I don't mean his name.

1000
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,380
I mean J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1001
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,280
The actual Bob.

1002
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,020
Yeah.

1003
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,300
That is important.

1004
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,880
This is important as drawing the pentagram right

1005
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,700
when you're performing a magical operation.

1006
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,200
What?

1007
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:57,940
You just have to...

1008
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:58,660
You have to draw...

1009
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,220
Oh, no.

1010
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,740
I got to go home immediately.

1011
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:03,040
You have to put those quotes there.

1012
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:03,940
You better get down that basement pretty quick, buddy,

1013
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,480
or the whole house is going to start exploding.

1014
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,020
Those amusing chalk drawings.

1015
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,040
So, now we come to an end of another session.

1016
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,100
If you think Bob's trains ran late,

1017
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,900
wait till you see his saucers.

1018
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,140
I mean, wait.

1019
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,040
He has saucers as big as eyes.

1020
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,700
No, the sky will be full of...

1021
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:25,800
Full of ships.

1022
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,560
And flame will illuminate the night

1023
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:34,700
as the giant saucers the size of entire U.S. states

1024
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,820
make a landing.

1025
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,200
So, until next time, folks,

1026
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,640
this is the last time we'll speak to each other on planet Earth.

1027
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,160
It's been good knowing you.

1028
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,400
Thanks for all the fish.

1029
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:52,060
Thanks for all the $35 checks, everybody.

1030
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,780
See you in the next world.

1031
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,180
See you later, suckers!

1032
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,840
See you later, suckers!

1033
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,960
It's the last time we will speak to each other on planet Earth.

1034
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,100
Staying off again.

1035
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,260
Listen to them yowling and howling

1036
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,960
in the agony of their own creation.

1037
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,640
Well, we tried to warn them.

1038
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,380
Anyway, it's been good to be on your show.

1039
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,140
Yes, now they are...

1040
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,100
And now they are doomed.

1041
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,200
They didn't...

1042
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,340
We will watch them burn.

1043
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,240
...get with the program.

1044
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,100
We tried and tried, you know.

1045
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:21,160
I don't know if a professional propaganda ministry

1046
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,680
could have really solved the problem.

1047
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,460
You can lead a horse...

1048
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,260
...to water, but you can't make him drink.

1049
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,780
But you can waterboard it.

1050
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,600
Well, you can lead a pink to the truth,

1051
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,980
but you can't make him think.

1052
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,720
And so, now they have to take it.

1053
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,860
They have to roll over and take it.

1054
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,780
Take their medicine.

1055
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:44,400
And we, the subgeniuses, will snicker and laugh from afar,

1056
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,580
sipping effete cocktails from the observation platforms

1057
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:52,080
of the giant globe-spanning saucer ships.

1058
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,100
We'll look down on the tossers from our seats

1059
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,000
and the saucers.

1060
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,780
Well, folks, I think this is as good a time as any

1061
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,020
to end the program.

1062
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:01,680
Ope.

1063
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,700
This has been a special edition of Synesthesia.

1064
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,660
If I manage to get the transmitter onto the saucers in time,

1065
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,800
then I'll be broadcasting this time next week from Planet X.

1066
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,440
If not, then Bob help us all.

1067
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,620
X the Unknown.

1068
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,020
Until whenever that next time is, whatever planet that's on.

1069
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,960
Thank you, Dr. Hal.

1070
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,360
Most welcome.

1071
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,280
Thank you, Reverend Stang.

1072
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,140
Aye, aye, sir.

1073
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,200
Thank you, Princess Wee, even though you're in the other room right now and can't hear me.

1074
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,260
Thank you, anyway.

1075
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,680
And thank you to the callers who put up with all this.

1076
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,500
Until next time, keep it surreal.

1077
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:00,640
Thank you.

1078
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:10,660
Thank you.

1079
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:23,240
In matters of money, it's never wrong.

1080
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,080
But in this case, it's complete.

1081
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:25,080


1082
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:25,080


1083
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:25,080


1084
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,600
And he's never wrong.

1085
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,480
Completely wrong.

1086
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,760
And we were moving furniture around.

1087
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:39,520
And somebody said, a woman said, and I wasn't even looking in that direction,

1088
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,040
but popped into my head.

1089
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,060
And he said, why, I happened to, yes, it happened to be.

1090
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,200
And I said, Bob.

1091
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,320
And he said, fantastic.

1092
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,780
And so I had, and just be looking right at the camera.

1093
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,100
No idea at all.

1094
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:52,720

Stop.

00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:55,060


1101
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:55,080
Stop.

1102
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:55,080


1103
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,160
Stop.

1104
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:58,860


1105
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:58,860


1106
00:54:59,120 --> 00:54:59,640

Stop.

1118
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,600
You're not a dirty old slob

1119
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,700
When you are praising the boss

1120
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,060
You're not acting up like a snob

1121
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,560
When you are praising the boss

1122
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:36,140
You're not a dirty old slob

1123
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,000
When you are praising the boss

1124
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:46,380
You're not acting up like a snob

1125
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:52,160
When you are praising the boss

1126
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:57,180
You're not a dirty old slob

1127
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:03,580
When you are praising the boss

1128
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,120
You're not acting up like a snob

1129
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,540

You're not a dirty old slob

You're not acting up like a snob

1133
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,460
When you are praising the boss

1134
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,620
You're not acting up like a snob

1135
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:29,620


1136
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,280
You're not a dirty old slob

1137
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,320
When you are praising the boss

1138
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,360
You're not acting up like a snob

1139
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,120
When you are praising the boss

1140
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:40,220
When you are pricing by, you're not a dirty old slob

1141
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,020
A dirty old slob

1142
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,300
When you're pricing by, when you're pricing by

1143
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,620
Brothers keep on pricing by

1144
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:49,140
You're not acting like a slob

1145
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:52,300
You're not acting like a slob

1146

You're not acting like a slob

1147
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,140
Don't listen but the time you're down

1148
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,420
You know what you're doing with your life

1149
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,780
Do what you want to do with it

1150
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:02,740
Do with it

1151
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,140
You're not acting like a slob

1152
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,280
Acting like a acting like a slob

1153
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,880
You're not acting like a slob

1154
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,320
Never acting like a slob

1155
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,400
You can't even act like a slob

1156
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,540
You're so stupid you can't even act like a slob

1157
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:16,480
Robot, pro crime freak, broken back, older fool

1158
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,220
They're doing what they wanna do

1159
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,280
They don't go to school

1160
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,980
But you and Bob Bree you're a sucka

1161
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,940
You're not a slacker, sly sucker

1162
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,560
But you're a sly, yeah, wild, wild, yeah, yeah, yeah

1163
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,120
Wow, wow, wow, wow

1164
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,680
This is all about Bob

1165
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,160
Wow

1166
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:40,000
We like to praise people. This is like a godlike thing.

1167
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:44,520
You read to us all the consistence and dots.

1168
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,140
It doesn't matter.

1169
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:51,980
Maybe even Bob doesn't give those things to you that you want to have.

1170
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:58,260
But maybe Bob cracks open like Faberge's egg and something comes out from there.

1171
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:04,600
Something that really reflects the innermost truth behind the man-made words.

1172
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:08,220
You know what I'm saying. The man-made words.

1173
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:15,560
We're just making things worse with our codes and premeditated stuff.

1174
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:20,300
And our norms and... you know...

1175
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,400
Everything is so normal. Pink.

1176
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,020
Reditude.

1177
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,300
Unoriginal.

1178
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,560
Uninspiring.

1179
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,320
Unintelligent.

1180
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,840
Not even as sexy as it used to be.

1181
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,020
But let's still praise Bob for a while.

1182
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:51,160
We're the funny weirdos making fun of the bad weirdos.

1183
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,380
Thank you, The Large.

1184
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:09,820
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

1185
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:26,420
For free information, write to P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1186
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,080
Or see...

1187
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:32,560
www.subgenius.com

1188
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,760
Praise Bob!

1189
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:42,340
Believe me, your unpaid job doing data entry for Facebook will still be there when you get back.

1190
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:47,820
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1191
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:54,120
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1192
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,240
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other radio stations.

1193
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:06,300
And if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1194
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:13,760
you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages

1195
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,100
and help out financially as best you can.

1196
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:25,100
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1197
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,080
But some of you still have jobs.

1198
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:34,960
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1199
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:37,320
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1200
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:45,820
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay dogs.

1201
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:51,580
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1202
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:57,020

Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1204
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:09,320
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
