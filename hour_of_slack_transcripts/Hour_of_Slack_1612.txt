Yowl Slack
I hear a phone ringing.
What could it mean?
Is there like a zero sound in your head?
I hear it now.
The zero sound.
No, I hear the hero.
He's there.
You hear the zero sound in your head?
That's not a zero sound.
That's just a knocking on a wake-up door.
That means you're going to become an El Pisco,
real smarty pants, real soon.
I'm going to become a smarty pants?
But I'm a subgenius.
I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
That's what it's all about.
It's happening in the sport.
Squirty pants.
Oh, squirty pants.
That's not Eskimos wear.
Squirty pants.
Squirty pants.
Squirty pants.
Oh, squirty pants.
Squirty.
If you're out in the desert for five or seven weeks
to half an hour, depending on which regimen you're smoking,
you may find you're very chafey.
Chafey?
Chafey.
You know, you'll chaff easily.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I would imagine so.
Sounds like...
I'd rather throw rag in some soap
and argue with the rest of the denizens of the darkness.
I didn't know denizens of the darkness argued over soap.
Oh, no, you did already?
I didn't know that.
Oh, I thought you said...
I'm just completely confused.
Denizens of the dark argue over soap?
Yeah.
Uh, sure.
Okay.
That'll help make us famous.
Just remember it.
Okay.
Don't ever forget.
All right.
Well, we're here at Stang Ranch without Dave,
who is in Cleveland,
and yet he is with us by the miracle of radio technology.
Does it sound like the technology's real bad?
No, it sounds fine.
Sounds great to me.
Sounds like you're right here with me.
Yeah, you sound just like a robot.
You sound like a well-oiled machine, Dave,
which I know you're not.
I know you're a very badly-oiled human flesh pod.
Substantive.
Not subgenius, you know, just substantive.
Absolutely.
I can't even stand...
Meat.
I love meat.
It's a good thing, because you're mostly made of it, Dave.
Yeah.
You've got to keep on eating your meat
every other daily basis if you want.
See, if you wanted to have an iron deficiency like I had,
the first thing you'd do would be flunk algebra.
Eat nails.
Or some other math sciences courses.
And then you'd get put in the technology class,
and then they would put you in like a wood shop.
And then you find out that you were one of the AIs all along.
Yeah, unfortunately.
You were one of the ghosts.
Or one of the AI, AI, I-I-Is.
Hey, that's pretty good.
Hey!
The AI.
AI, AI, AI, AI.
Is that what the subgenius...
Oh, no, that's terrifying, man.
That's bad news.
Yeah.
Skynet is Genesis.
Genesis is Skynet.
AI, AI, AI, AI, AI, AI.
Don't forget.
Say that again?
Don't forget.
When you stub your toe in Spanish, too.
I, I, I.
Man.
The rabbit hole just gets deeper and deeper.
It does.
Well, it's not...
It's not a secret name like, like Joe, Joe Hoover or Satan's underpants.
He said, he said both of them.
He said them both in one sentence, man.
I'm going to have to cut those out of the broadcast version.
Oh.
It's okay if you say Jehoshaphat on, on underground internet radio.
It's just if you say, or Elder God's name or something like that.
You can say, you know, Nyar Thoth-Tap or anything like that.
If you say their middle names.
On the broadcast radio.
You'd be really pissed off.
Yeah.
It's some instead.
Of the creatures.
What if you say Nigi?
Shh.
But, okay, I look, I'm going to have to cut all of these from the broadcast radio because
it summons them only on broadcast radio, not on internet underground radio.
But we're doing both.
You see, we have to do both.
Don't forget that they put the address to the wrong suspenders.
They see.
They see.
They see.
Suspending.
They see.

Like when you have to do that.
When you go to a movie, you have to suspend your animation.
You're just leaving in hunger.
Dave, when was the last time you went to an actual movie in a theater?
I think it was, um, 2-0-1-1.
Is that a year?
That was more recently than me.
I think we, the last movie we saw was the last movie that we did.


saw was Peter Jackson's King Kong in 2005, and probably the next one we'll see will be
Kong Skull Island, which I don't expect to hold a candle to Peter Jackson's, but what
the heck.
It's monsters.
Gotta check it out.
Except that I'll bet you we'd check it out instead of check it out at the last minute
on account of, doesn't it cost like $50 to see a movie now?
Something like that, yeah.
Yeah, it's really expensive.
Besides, it smells, it always had that strange, familiar smell.
It's got a different smell now.
They must be using new cleaning equipment, and it smells like Faberg√© took a poop or
something like that.
In movie theaters?
There's a blend of odors that disguises something.
You don't know if it's that old popcorn plus rug smell.
I wouldn't know, because when we stopped going to that movie theater near our house,
it was like, oh, it's a movie theater.

It was closed.
We were the only customers anyway.
Yeah.
We never saw anyone else in there.
They had Monopoly pictures of you guys standing at the front doorway waiting for your tickets
and no line going around the block.
Yeah, the only way I can see movies now is we just walk by people's houses and hope that
what they're watching on TV is the same thing the last guy was watching.
Yeah, but sometimes you have to wear stilts, you know?
Well, that's...
Most people don't have their TVs up on the second floor, so it's not a...
It's amazing if you go creepy crawling in the suburbs at night how much of other people's
lives you can see just from the sidewalk.
What if you were like a Spring Hills Jack type character?
You had, like, springs on your heels.
Well, the sad thing is there's nothing...
While you were jacking around.
What you see your neighbors doing is them watching television.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're peeping.
You see a glow in their eyes.
It's only as exciting as whatever sports show they're watching, which is usually what it is, I've noticed.
So, you know, it's like, I guess we just have to spend money to go see Kong Skull Island in 3D
and then be horribly disappointed at how somehow incomplete and unsatisfying...
Smallest amount off.
If you look at it from just the smallest angle outside and stuff like that,
you can't see anything.
You can see how many changes.
Camera angle changes.
Man, are they ever quick in NFL sports and NBA sports and everything else.
It's just like going from camera angle to camera angle.
It's just enough to mesmerize you.
And I think that's what the purpose of it is.
I hate to sound like a flatulent old PhD of historical reasoning or something like that.
Are you talking about fast cuts on television?
I'm talking about television.
We were just recanting the glow of the television.
And somebody else's third story window and stuff like that.
And also, I just noticed that or not remembered that if you're just a little bit off camera,
if you're just, you know, you're not seeing the actual television set.
You're seeing the light from it.
You can see like a change every half second.
The quick cuts are now so much quicker than they used to be like 10, 20 years ago.
You know what bothers me is fire does that to that flickering thing.
Fire goes.
It goes faster than it used to.
It used to have this slow, lethargic flicker.
Now fire just burns real fast.
The kids just they can't they can't watch a fire that an old fashioned fire that licks slowly.
They have to watch those flames flicker in just about 30 frames, 60 frames a second.
And 3D has to be 3D fire.
The flat fire is not good enough.
Black and white fire.
Forget that.
That didn't matter how great a fire it is.
If it's black and white.
They won't even warm them.
If they could be freezing to death and they won't warm themselves on a black and white fire.
These kids, they just don't get it.
They they they've had everything handed to them.
Three dimensional fire at 60 frames a second.
And it's three times hotter than it used to be.
And the pot is stronger.
We got cheated.
They're the ones that saying we boomers ate up all of the environment and left them nothing.
But we're the ones getting cheated.
They get all the flying saucers and the vermin.
And we're the ones getting virtual porno and everything.
We're lucky if we get a radio shot mixer and some old microphones that somebody left behind after a band played.
Well yeah, especially if your working for EMS real late in the morning or something like that.
And one of those huge, real huge ladies in stuff with bad breath decides she's going to start humping on your leg like a little dog named Susie or something like that.
I wish that would happen for me.
I'm sure you do.
You're on a mission.
I'm jealous.
You should try every night, buddy.
Try to get some work done.
You know what I mean?
You're bragging.
He's just bragging now.
You're trying to make the rest of us feel bad because we don't have those things happening to us on our legs.
No, no.
I'm not trying to reinforce any feelings of inferiority that you might have.
It's so hard for me to work with.
Every night, same thing.
And you don't do anything about it either.
It's your problem to solve.
You can take care of it for me or we or somebody away from here.
Yeah, but see, we don't even know what your problem is.
I told you.
There's a semi-elderly, poof, poof, 300-pound lady.
Every time I go on third shift, while I'm waiting to clock in and stuff, she's waiting there for me.
And he calls that a problem.
She starts off just by BS and then talk about, you know, typical office talks.
And next thing you know, she's trying to.
That shit on my head.
That means she loves you, Dave.
That means she likes you.
That's their way of showing affection.
You should pick up on it.
Ask her out.
I see.
That's what she's trying to get you to do.
That's dangerous.
Listen to her in the background.
She's singing a love song to you, Dave.
You can't hear her, but she's singing an operatic love song.
You know, like mixed music.
Yeah, mixed Lydian mode.
Isn't that workplace harassment?
Yeah.
Look, she's singing how Dave is so.
This is Italian, so I'll translate.
He's so handsome.
He's so tall.
His craggy nose like an Indian makes me fall.
I love Dave.
He's such a cowboy.
But if I was with him, he would not be lonesome anymore.
That's the lyric.
The translation of the Italian.
Right.
This is after Dave left her.
He wouldn't let her hump on his leg anymore.
And she's this is her aria where she's decrying her fate.
But she's going to hump him even harder next time.
Exit states left wearing a sword and swearing that he will disavow the honor of the Honorable Jim Mernemina.
She.
General.
And he's going to slay her.
His brother.
And the Duke is.
Well, it changed to a different scene now.
But yeah, the.
Now she's going to start the aria.
Dave, I don't know what you're complaining about.
That old lady is built.
She has a huge lung capacity.
Those opera singers, you know, they have to be that way.
Did you hear a balcony?
You could do Shakespeare from.
Of course.
The Mud Shark or Mudlark.
You see.
Mudhead.
Because you say you didn't see any movies, but did you hear the movie with Meryl Streep called What's Your Face?
Florence Henderson, Jenkins or whatever it is.
Yes.
Of course.
Opera singer.
No.
Yes.
What?
You know about that movie.
Which one?
Say it again.
Say it in English.
She has basically an unpronounced.
Unpronounceable name.
And it's three words.
And she was.
Jenkins is the last one.
Jenkins is the last name of her three names.
And it's Florence.
Florence something Jackson.
Jenkins.
Jenkins.
Are you guys on Jenkins?
No.
Because are you talking about a movie?
Yes.
Oh, OK.
That's good.
Yes.
A movie with Meryl Streep.
Yes.
And it's not the movie with the soundtrack I'm playing.
It's called Background Now by Bernard Harmon.
No, it is not.
No.
No.
So what about this movie?
Well, it's a woman singing.
She thought she was the greatest opera singer in the world.
And she was one of the worst.
She would pick these really difficult arias, which are hard for even a regular good opera singer.
And she was just a regular person.
But she'd rank halls and stuff and put on performances and make all these people come to them.
I don't know why they'd come there.
And she couldn't tell that they were laughing at her for a long time.
It's actually a really sad story.
Well, she was married to Citizen Kane, right?
And he was so rich, he put her on stage.
What's his name?
Mangrove.
Mango Mussolini or whatever they call him.
Trump.
Remember when Trump's acting career before when he was not famous yet?
Yeah, actually, I do remember before he was famous.
Unlike everybody else, apparently.
Yeah.
Well, I deeply remember the insinuations, too.
It was very hurtful.
Well, yeah, Trump wanted to be an opera singer originally.
And he got up out there.
He bought his way onto the Carnegie Hall stage.
And he was doing the Barber of Seville.
And it sounded like...
It sounded like Gomer Pyle doing it.
Only Jim Nabors really could sing opera.
But it was like Jim Nabors trying to sing opera badly.
As Gomer Pyle.
Jim Nabors was actually an opera singer.
And Trump, then, there were some, of course, reviews where they mocked him and laughed at him.
And he paid a whole army of people to write glowing reviews of his singing.
In fact, there were more reviewers than there was capacity in the theater for people.
He hired...
The theater could only have held about 200 people.
And yet, there were...
There were 5,000 glowing reviews of that one performance by Donald Trump that appeared the next day.
And it was always the Barber of Seville, too.
And he'd go up there and he'd pretend like he was going to give somebody a shave.
Instead, he'd show, like, it would be a colomask, kind of like a little drill or something that they use in releasing the water.
Sometimes it's even more difficult than that.
But I don't understand how they do it.
Well, I mean, I admired his attempt to be an opera singer.
And I admired his attempt to be a president, too.
Especially now that he's been reduced to gibbering insanity, talking about how the last ten presidents are reading his mind.
And Hillary Clinton, he said, was mind-controlling him with her white pantsuit.
And making him say things and misspell words like tap.
Let's assign.
Let's assign that he's the fabric of reality that he lives in no longer supports his realism.
You know, it's like one of those early Sanskrit poems.
He's become too real for the world.
He's too truthful for the rest of reality to support such great truthfulness.
That's why they have the Sarad and Sitar soundtrack.
And Gomer Pyle still sings the X-Park moments.
At least we're happy to do so.
You know, unlike some other production company.
I just want to get down in the mud and do it like a dog.
This reminds me of that show we did with the grandchildren.
Don't you think?
He sings like Elias.
Hey, can you sing Everybody Dance Now?
Everybody dance now!
Can you do that?
Boom-da-boom-ba-ba-boom-foo.
I think I'd like to have my snakes lathered up and probably.
Clean my teeth for a little while.
Maybe have a huge snack of escarboles or green pudding, whatever.
Some of that delicious.
Green pudding?
That sounds like a monster.
He wanted to get his snakes lathered up.
It's salty.
We saw the snakes lathered up today.
Yes, we did.
We went to the Rattlesnake Roundup in Walnut Springs, Texas today.
Yeah, but they kill all those poor snakes.
A lot of them are not the same dead.
They're not the only snakes that bite everybody.
They're the ones that just like trying to avoid human beings.
No, these are all deadly rattlers that want to kill you.
Because they know that you want to kill them.
That's just built into being a rattler.
You can get rattlesnake heads in jars of formaldehyde or alcohol or something for only 10 or 12 bucks.
Yes, nice little clear mason jar.
Just like a jelly jar.
With a decapitated snake in it.
I'd like to try some.
Someday, perhaps.
You can get snake balls.
But you didn't even know that there were such things as snake balls.
But they sell them in pairs.
Yeah, I didn't either.
They told me they were baboon balls.
I started arguing and I realized they were also primates like the rest of us.
No, honestly, I have pictures of the snake balls to prove it.
And they're definitely snake balls.
I've got a hairband.
It's like a mountain oyster.
It's more like a moth.
It's like a prairie diaphragm or a didgeridoo.
Dino nads. Those are the best.
Juicy dino nads.
Hey, Princess Wee, look, the music is at 420.
You know what that means?
That means the music's been playing for 4 minutes and 20 seconds.
20 seconds?
What the hell?
What are you talking about?
Princess Wee just wandered away from the studio.
She's gone.
Just wandered away.
The vortex took her.
Just took her away.
Well, you know, if you can't be understood when you make a pronouncement,
you should expect people to walk away from you.
You have to at least keep one little hair, one little miniscule thread of reality
going between a shared concept.
You can't just walk up to people and start babbling nonsense to them
and expect them to sit down and say,
Oh, oh, oh, that was really you.
Yeah.
I'm surprised to hear you say that, Dave, that last sentence that you said.
I'm despised to hear you say it.
That's what I personally, it's a figment of our imaginations.
That's all it is.
Did I hallucinate?
Fake news.
Was Dave just singing, I don't want to be buried?
No.
Oh, okay.
Man, that was intense.
You were singing, you sound just like Joey Ramone.
You don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery?
Yeah.
Pet cemetery.
That's what I thought you said.
That's what I thought you were singing when I first came back.
You have to say it like pet cemetery.
That's what I thought you thought, that you had thought before anybody sang anything.
Pet cemetery.
Cemetery.
Yeah.
Cemetery.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't want to live my life again.
Again.
Again.
Again.
Again.
You have to have a pound and a half of snake balls.
I could be a rock and roll singer.
I know how to do inward singing too.
You have to have a pound and a half of snake balls?
Yeah.
You could be a rock singer?
If he had snake balls, he could be a rock singer.
Yeah.
What kind of snake balls?
Mick Jagger had snake balls.
That was a secret to his power.
Really?
They're a very valuable source of protein too.
I'm sorry.
Well, these are just novelty spheres covered with snake skin.
But they're magic.
That's the thing.
They're cool looking.
Well, that is the thing.
They're very cool looking.
They could give you power.
Yeah.
That's what your border does.
It holds your population there under 300,000.
Do you want power, Dave?
Power?
Power?
Over others?
Do you want power?
Untreamed of power.
Over the week.
You can't knock a bowels or continent.
It's not a different language.
It's a part of our own understanding.
Or do you want pleasure?
Which do you choose?
Power or pleasure?
Pleasure.
Pleasure.

Pleasure.

Pleasure.
Pleasure.

Pleasure.
There's nothing to do with us.
He can't make up his mind.
Why not both, Dave?
Go for power and pleasure.
You told me I'm not gonna make the deal much later.
I don't even know what the hell I'm waiting for.
There's nothing to do with our barbecue flavor or special section on the mango Mussolini
or any of the other pirates.
Where's eat me?
There's nothing to do with us.
There's nothing to do with us.
There's nothing to do with us.
There's nothing to do with us.

Dave. I see. Dave changes the subject. I see. It's weird. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. You just had,
you just had a chance to sell your soul for great, vast rock stardom, and you, you blew it.
You missed your chance. You changed the subject. You weren't really even listening. Satan just made
an offer to you a second ago with cool background music, and you missed it.
That was your one big chance to be like Mick Jagger and have the snake balls.
You could have had the snake balls, Dave. You could have been the snake balls,
but instead, you're snack balls. Cheesy puffs of life. It didn't rotate very far from the center,
Captain.
Captain Roger Weisshauser, Von Heider. Everything's just, just the way you planned it.
You thought that breaking up the snake ball stick was going to have some kind of
reintroductory time where you'd need to be a transition or something like that.
There's not necessarily anything in this board. We, we don't.
We, uh.
It's just what we've come to. It's just what we're reducing.
What's the word you're used to? Braying.
Where we're heading and where we just landed.
A braying jackass. Hey, you should run for president.
I couldn't tell if that was Dave.
A braying jackass.
Dave, you sounded crazy. You should run for president.
A braying jackass.
President cowboy. Well, we've already had one of those, and he wasn't, he wasn't a real cowboy,
though. Reagan. Or was that Bush? They were both cowboys.
Reagan.
Reagan.






Reagan. It was Britney Spears.
President Spears.
And after Britney Spears, I think it was Unguash, the Deer Slayer.
President Michael Jackson was a short lived president.
He slept on the job a lot.
Hiding at Neverland instead of administering the country.
Yeah, he was a capitalist.
I mean, a real one. He had different companies and stuff.
But, you know.
He owned a...
President Jackson.
He named his 2020 barbeque.
President Michael Jackson. Not Andrew Jackson.
No, Michael. Yes.
President Michael Jackson.
The least understood president.
Who?
I read that a lot of movie stars and rich people are thinking of running for president now,
because they're going, oh, well, hell, I could do that.
I've known more about it than that guy.
I could do a better job of it than that guy.
I'm even richer and better looking.
Much better looking.
So, you know, I mean...
And nobody is. They're all a bunch of spaz dicks.
It's going to be President Oprah Winfrey.
She's going to run and she's going to make some difference.
And she's going to clean up the swamp in Washington.
Yeah, right.
Did you know that was prepared?
Well, you use Goldman Sachs bankers as mops when you clean up.
The swamp, right?
I was going to clean up the picnic table and the baskets in the whole area.
Nobody volunteered for the toilets, did they?
No.
Let's drain the toilets in Washington.
No, no, no. Let somebody else do that.
Let the janitor drain the toilets in Washington.
We're going to be busy draining the swamp.
I hate manatees.
We'll drain the swamp and they'll be flopping there, suffocating.
Well, manatees.
Manatees actually are air breathers.
They won't suffocate.
But then I'll drown them.
We'll drown them then.
We'll fill the swamp.
We'll fill the swamp and kill the manatees and the whales.
Drown the whales.
Nuke them and drown them.
All you got to do is drive around in an outboard motor long enough and you'll kill a manatee if you're in the right spot.
Thanks, Obama.
Thanks for reading my mind.
Thanks for tapping my phone.
Thanks for recording everything I ever said, Obama.
And using it against me.
How dare he?
See, we're caught with a sickening self-consciousness resolution.
Oh, it's hard.
Our memories have been implanted by previous memories.
We always dreamed there would be a day we'd wake up in hell and Donald Parsons would be humped.
We'd be dumped in Stumper.
You know, what's his name?
Mango Mussolini.
You like that word mango, don't you?
No, I like mangoes.
And it is a description of the color of his hair, which is like, well, is it like a yellow thing or is it like a pink thing?
How can they be both in either one of each kind?
Yeah, it's pink all over.
It's kind of like, you know, the room, your daughter's room, you paint.
The color you paint your daughter's room.
It's really pretty, you know.
That's what we should paint our room.
Pink.
Yeah, daughter pink.
Trump sold pink.
The color that you would paint your daughter's room, you know, because you thought it fit a little girl's personality.
It's kind of pink.
It's kind of yellow, golden color.
But, you know, it's mango, you know.
Mango.
Yes, mango.
It doesn't make one lick of sense to me.
Our room has been pink.
I mean, that would be traditional to paint it pink.
Well, Dave's suggesting we paint it the color of the president's real, real, real hair.
Oh, mango.
Yeah, mango.
Mango man.
Pancakes.
That's got man in it.
That's because he's a man.
Oh, yeah.
I'm a weak man and he's my idea of a strong man.
I'm a stupid man and he's my idea of a smart man.
I'm a poor man and he's my idea of a rich man.
That's me.
Okay.
A dumbass.
Yep.
Yep.
And I'm not alone.
And you built like a 53-year-old woman, too.
And we're going to fill that swamp so high, you're all going to drown.
Mm-hmm.
We're going to fill it up.
We're going to refill that swamp like it's never been filled before.
You'll be swimming in an ocean of Goldman Sachs bankers.
You'll be walking on the shoulders of giants of industry.
Because they'll be the swans.
The swamp will be full of nothing but rich men.
Yeah.
Rich men.
There'll be a swamp.
Instead of manatees, there'll be men in business suits.
Yeah.
But men, the poor white men of this world, they're such victims.
Such victims.
It's so hard to be a white man these days.
I feel so sorry for them.
It's so hard because the sissies pick on us.
The girls pick on us.
Everybody just picks on us.
It's not fair.
We're victims.
Some people talk funny languages and stuff.
I can't understand.
I know they're making fun of me, and that's why I want to...
Yeah.
To me, they sound pompous and faggy.
Like tomatoes, yeah.
They understand me, but to me, they sound pompous and faggy, so I beat them up.
I got that word from that movie, Idiocracy.
I know what that means.
That means people in offices are stupid.
I work with my hands because I'm smart.
Really?
I can't...
I work...
Well, they put...
They fired...
They laid us off at the Kaiser blade factory because they hired a bunch of Vietnams.
That's why.
And because I showed up drunk all the time.
I'm a victim.
I'm a victim.
It's Obama's fault.
He was reading everybody's mind.
His wife was reading their mail.
The consul.
His wife was...
Moose Shell was reading their email, and Obami was reading their minds.
And stole Don Trump's brain.
And then he had to hit it under the bed somewhere.
And now he won't give it back.
We'd have to keep it in like a weird container with fluids in it and stuff.
And we could communicate psychotronically with it.
Just go to the window.
Bring me a hamburger.
That's how politics works, man.
Huge.
Bring me a huge hamburger.
Or something like that.
That's how it's done.
Huge.
A huge hamburger.
Huge.
Huge.
Huge.
Huge.
Huge.
So you gotta pretend like you're out in the middle of the wilderness without any clothes on.
Damn.
Well, I didn't say nothing different than when you're making certain things.
You know what I'm talking about.
Pretend.
Pretend I'm out in the wilderness while I am out in the wilderness.
Yes, you are in the wilderness.
And I know about your little deal with staying here to wear underpants while you're doing the show.
Because you think like nobody will see through the windows because the nearest other house is 12 miles away.
Or 100 miles away. I don't know.
Actually, the nearest house is pretty close.
But there's a lot of trees in between.
We can't see them.
They can't see us.
So we're doing the show, as he said, without no pants on.
Free. Free to do the show without any pants on.
Oh, we didn't have to drive to a radio station with pants on.
No, we didn't have to go up into the elevator to the WCSB radio station.
Wearing pants.
No!
We didn't have to do any of that.
We can run up and down the stairs wearing no pants at all.
Free. Free. Free. Free.
My life's dream has come true.
I can run pantsless through my own radio station.
...my nature intended you to live with no panties or poo-poo shoes on you.
No poo-poo shoes.
I always have those.
No poo-poo shoes?
My poo-poo shoes if I'm going to wear no pants.
What kind of a show is this?
I don't know.
We used to talk about how the conspiracy held down the mutants.
And this is now like the absolute...
This is the age of the conspiracy.
The bullies won the election and they're going to pick on all the nerds forever and ever and ever.
That's the idea.
And are we going to sit back and be silly and let this happen?
Probably.
Probably, yeah.
Because until the revolution comes, subgeniuses are going to party and bulldada and party and bulldada and party and bulldada.
Mm-hmm.
Until the cows don't come home.
In that order. In that package.
That's a sad prescription there.
That just makes me want to use some of these alternative cuss words.
Yes, Dave, I'm looking at a sheet of paper that says,
alternative cuss words field tested and mother approved.
And it's got things like,
shut your pie hole,
Judas Priest,
heavens to Betsy,
dad gummit,
kiss my grits.
I thought there were going to be silly absurdist names like Quentin Fisbrill and the eyeball poppers.
What the hay.
Shucky darn.
Dad blame it, dad gummit, dad blast it.
Dog gone it.
Con sarn it, con found it.
Dad burn it.
Dad burn it and dag nab it are next to each other on this list, Dave.
I was reading dad burn it just when you said it.
Dave is awesome.
Here's the son of a series.
Son of a biscuit eater.
Son of a Baptist preacher.
Son of a nutcracker.
Son of a motherless goat.
Now we're understanding things better with motherless goat.
He leaves you.
Horse hockey, horse pucky, horse feathers, horse pitutti.
Sometimes when they talk about hockey, they go, let's get the puck out of here.
That's what it says right here.
For heaven's sake, for the love of Pete, for Pete's sake, or best of all, for crying out loud.
They forgot horses.
How about Cripes?
Always one of my favorites and I worship daily.
Cripes is in line here with criminy, creps, doo-doo, and caca.
Caca?
Yeah.
Well, that doesn't make a damn lick of sense.
Good gravy, good grief, gadzooks, jack wagon.
What is that?
Fiddle faddle.
What the hell is that?
Fiddle sticks.
Cotton picking malarkey.
Bucket head.
Malarkey.
Malarkey.
Knucklehead.
Shucks.
Rats.
Gosh.
Shizzle.
Toot.
What does toot have to do with shizzle?
Well, that's like if you belong to one of those special Korean supper clubs and stuff,
you have to wear that thing right on your nozzle.
And you have to make yourself available like to four-foot tall sailors and stuff like that.
It's not an easy work for anybody, especially if you've got like bloated eyes,
or if you just have an arm.
I know it's a tough time when your sockets are dry.
That's why everyone needs three times a day, just to sit back and relax and smoke one or
drink one.
Or have a couple of them.
Because you know it's going to be a long wait until the movie stops.
Hey, where are we?
Here's the lamest one on the alternative.

Alternative cuss words list.
H-E double hockey sticks.
Everybody loves that one.
H-E double hockey sticks.
That sounds like something Kimmy Schmidt would say.
Yeah, that is.
She says, what, the ham sandwich.
Right.
What, the ham sandwich.
And shut the front door.
She actually says that?
No, she doesn't.
Oh.
No, I said that.
That is a good one.
And it has the positive qualities of swear therapy.
Yes.
They say that if you swear enough, you feel relieved and won't have hypertension and slavery.
They makeotic lungs in different regions.
Wow.
At least I'd give it a try, but I'm on a different plan.
I'm on plan X from planet nine.
No, I'm on plan nine from outer space.
Yeah.
That's the way I don't have to play.
I don't have to play as much as I should.
The men from planet X have a plan for nine o'clock Sunday nights.
And that's to listen to The Hour of Slack on WCSB and insert station name here.
Because it's on nine o'clock Sundays everywhere.
Yes.
Forever.
Everywhere in the world.
The Hour of Slack.
Nine o'clock at nine.
Nine.
On channel nine.
That's a horrible, horrible thought.
But mine's so planned.
Little tiny babies and children will be struck asunder, sir, by such civility and stupidity.
Their minds laid waste.
But that evil Reverend Ivan's dad, who cares not a whit for any child he knows.
He can...
He can...
He can...

He just can't...
That's not him.
Who the hell is that?
I'll just light my ten million dollar cigar using this baby's head for a match.
For I am Ivan Stang, the most powerful cult leader since Jim Jones.
I can get 903 people to kill themselves.
I can get 903 people to kill themselves.
I can get 903 people to kill themselves.


And three of them cheated.
Hey, wait a minute, Stang.
I don't think you've had anybody...
You haven't had a heavy list of fatalities.
I mean, I know there's been some...
Not that we've advertised.
No, we haven't advertised the...
Yes, Pete, for sure.
No, we keep that on the DL.
Actually, Dave, X-Day two years ago, there were...
There were...
Some pretty serious, horrifying crimes.
However, the perpetrator got away with them because the perpetrator's name happened to be J.R. Bob Dobbs,
living avatar of Slack, luckiest guy in the whole world.
He made a million dollars every time he killed one of those jerks, accidentally.
I'm so happy about him.
He thought he was making sweet love to them.
Or their car, as the case may be.
The car got better mileage.
Under a running car, yeah.
Yeah, after he did their car, the Nostrils car, the car got better gas mileage.
Huh.
Go figure.
After Bob had had his way with it.
Using the exhaust pipe, apparently.
Uh-huh.
I'm surprised he could fit.
You mean they were actually consummating their solar eclipse?
Yep.
In the bassoon of a front-league bar?
In front of...
In the front...
In the front seat of a car, but Bob was in the back rocking it.
A car that was parked in the middle of a campground.
Yeah, but Bob was in the back rocking it.
He was attracted by the noises.
They were lucky because they kept the car door locked.
He didn't get in there and kill them with his love.
Reverend...
Reverend...
Oh, God, I can't even say his name on the radio.
He wasn't so lucky.
He ended up like that little dog, Snuckles.
Yeah.
Yeah, boned.
And I mean literally boned.
I don't mean euphemistically.
I mean his bones were removed from his body.
There was nothing there but blood and clothing.
And thanks, Bob.
Thanks, Bob.
Bob's been tapping my phone.
I noticed that.
He seems to know things he's not supposed to know.
And it's not true.
None of it's true.
I didn't say any of that, but he heard all of it.
Yeah, you have a teaching career.
So it can't be held against me.
Because Bob tapped my phone.
So if you hear recordings of me saying things that are reprehensible and horrible,
it doesn't matter because it's Bob's fault.
It's been rigged.
Yeah, it's been rigged.
It's all been set up.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's a set up.
Bob's been connecting his lines and putting a wiretap in his telephone for the last...
his cell phone for the last six and a half, three, seven, last few minutes right now.
Not shortly, but, you know, pretty soon.
Trump.
Did you know that Trump listens to this show and has a transcript made?
I know.
That's why he has these tirades at six in the morning.
That's a sign of dementia.
Right.
That he caught it from the hour of slack.
Dementia is contagious.
And this show is the primary host for that parasite.
And you'll see when you get hour of slack.
And he's like, he thought he was a disciple of Reagan and they were going to teach him
trickle down theory.
Trickle down Alzheimer's.
And actually it was yellow, golden showers and stuff.
Right.
Trickle down theories.
And indeed.
Trickle, trickle down Alzheimer's contagious because Reagan was in a band with me and Philo.
I don't know if you knew that.
No, I didn't know that.
Oh yeah, of course.
It's in Book of the Subgenius.
He was in Doctors for One Pan.
Oh.
Yeah.
He was in a band with, actually I wasn't in the band when Bob was in Doctors for One
Pan.
But Bob and Reagan and Philo all used to jam.
Wow.
Yeah.
And Tim Crane, that one guitar player.
Wow.
So yeah, you just never know.
One minute you're a successful underground happy, frop smoking beatnik improv jazz musician.
Yeah.
And then the next thing you know you're president who's completely unqualified.
I had to keep coughing.
One minute you're in a doctor band and the next minute you're president.
Go figure.
Go figure.
It's crazy.
I mean, it's crazy.
The whole world's upside down.
He was also an extra.
Remember Jason and the Argonauts with Hans Harryhausen and the music by Bernard Herrmann?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, I can recite that thing.
You know the Harryhausen film there with Captain Sinbad and the eight-time champion?
















It was like one of those tiny reptilian dwarfs from Alpha Centauri, remember that one?
Do you remember one where you're in state panties and first three-quarters of the way
out in the middle of the ocean and yet standing right on shore there and about ready to elaborate
on everything.
I don't know what you're talking about, but yous brine, man.
It toughens the skin.
Think, Dobbs.
No one understands.
Think.
Thank Dobbs.
Thank Dobbs.
Just think what a heck of a position we'd be in.
We'd definitely be on the receiving end of the storm.
We'd be a magnet, you know?
Thank Dobbs this show is only an hour long.
Thank Dobbs for all the bounty he has given us.
Oh, you don't like Faldi at all, do you, Mr. Stang?
Oh, think of the 23 hours a day that Bob grabs us.
We don't have to do this show.
In his kindness, Bob gives us 23 hours out of each Sunday
when we don't have to do or hear the hour of slack.
Uh-oh, what's beeping?
It's Philo Drummond calling your phone.
Call me.
Hey, wait a minute.
Hold on.
I'm going to have Holden accept.
Hello?
Hey, man, what's happening?
You're on the hour of slack, Dr. Drummond.
You're on the hour of slack.
I had to put Dave on hold.
You happened to call while we were doing the hour of slack.
Hey, listeners, this is Dr. Philo Drummond who just accidentally called in.
Say hi, Philo.
Hi, Philo.
How's it going?
So, yeah, man, are you going to come to Austin and we're going to party with the girls and Paul Mavridis?
Yeah, I guess as much as we can, sure.
The listeners don't know this.
By the time they hear this show, theoretically, we will all have been partying at South by Southwest with Johnny Depp and Neil Young and the Devos and Talking Heads and Jonathan Demme and Terrence Malick and Richard Linklater and all those Austin...
So I should bring my autograph book, I guess.
Huh?
I should bring my autograph book.
Robert Rodriguez will get to party with all those famous Austin movie people.
Because they're making a movie about us because we're famous.
Do we get to rub their elbows?
We get to rub their elbows and...
Hey, what do we rub their elbows with?
And inspect their children because we are doctors.
Arnica gel.
Rub their elbows with arnica gel.
Hey, I left Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, on the other line.
Yeah, he's on hold.
I guess we have to call...
I don't even know how to do this.
I don't know how to go back.
Should I...
Drop off?
Would that bring him back if I dropped off?
No, I don't want to bring him back.
I want to kill him.
We've been trying to keep him dead for years.
He just keeps coming back.
No, we love Dave.
We don't want to kill Dave.
I honestly don't know how you go back and forth on this phone.
The show's almost over, though.
That's the blessing.
That's the most wonderful thing about it.
Dr. Drummond, tell us about the Roku channel.
OSI 74.
Well, you know, it's a good thing that it's perfect timing
because I just posted a new not director's cut
with bonus super double secret footage.
Unseen footage of Night of Slack.
I just posted that on our OSI 74.
The Night of Slack, the famous devival where J.R. Bob Dobbs was shot?
Right, that's the one.
And it has now...
Legendary unseen outtake footage never before seen by human eyes
that for now will be seen for the first time.
Does it have glass madness?
In the world.
In the world.
Does it have...
No, I've seen it.
It has glasses.
It does have glasses.
No, glass madness.
It's glass madness performing.
It does have glass madness.
If I recall correctly, it has glass madness with a deaf sign language interpreter.
Right.
And it has...
Negative Land.
And has the weatherman doing 52 card pickup with the crowd.
That's right.
That was Negative Land's second live show, was it?
Yeah, there was David Wills.
A subgenius devival.
Shut the front door.
No, it's true.
Famous Reckless was there on stage throwing cards at the crowd.
And it really had them worked up.
They were all laughing really hard during their performance.
Wow.
So that's up there now.
We're getting ready to post...
The second edition of Negative Land's Our Favorite Things.
We posted the first one last month.
And we're going to be posting the new...
This is the bonus features from that same DVD.
It's going to be up there with some subgenius stuff peppered in there.
We also are working on the new Ministry of Slack episode.
Reverend X is working on that.
And he's got some of that new footage that you worked on.
From the last X-Day.
Yes, he told me that he's planning to do a special treatment of some of that footage.
Yeah, he wanted some of the kind of raw footage of the camera walking around saying hi to people.
We don't do that.
Stuff like that.
Because the only person that runs any cameras there is me.
Yeah, so there's no reason to do any of that.
Well, it's all...
No reason at all.
Yeah, who's going to film me if I'm doing all the...
You're filming, so why film anything?
That's what I said.
Why would you care about that anyway?
What are we going to do about Dave?
Dave is like...
It's like we can't...
It's not at a real radio station.
Everything's going through my iPhone.
Oh, so you're at the radio station, huh?
Yeah, I'm at the radio station in Glen Rose, Texas.
Oh, the one on the hub of Stang Ranch?
Yeah, the one on my dad's old table.
Yes, the hub that we created, yes.
The radio station in your mind.
In our minds.
In all of our minds.
You know, I've been missing my radio show.
I haven't been on the radio show in a month.
Man, it must be terrible.
I've just been working so hard.
Poor Dr. Drummond.
For the children.
For a greener, brighter future, though.
Green, that's good.
That's better than a red future.
Building a bridge into the future.
Oh, that's great.
That's the kind of guy I am, though.
I try to do it all for everyone else.
You're famous for that.
My magnanimity.
Well, this stupid show is almost over.
We have to deal with Dave at some point.
So do I?
Should I drop off?
Yeah, but you called with such serendipity.
I hate to let it go.
Yeah.
We weren't...
That TV show that Philo's talking about is on Roku television,
which you have to have a little Roku dumaflachi.
Right.
But then you get millions and millions of channels
that you can't get any other way, and they're quite good.
Some of them.
Some are quite bad.
And then there's the subgenius channel on OSI 74.
It's not all subgenius all the time,
except in the subgenius section.
It's a subgenius subsection.
It's a subgenius section subchannel on OSI 74,
which also hosts a lot of other...
I would say it's subgenius-like material.
Yes.
In the way it's presented, as well as its content.
It's all bulldot-ish.
Yeah.
Yeah, anybody would appreciate the nostalgic aspect of it, I think.
Even if they aren't even old enough to know what nostalgia means.
They'd still love it.
Hey, I just thought of what we can tell Dave.
What?
Tell him I had another heart attack.
No, no, no.
That's a great story.
It's not funny.
That's a bad luck story.
No, man.
You would not believe I'm the rock star of the cardio rehab.
Well, maybe you had a hard attack.
Man, I had a hot attack.
It just made me...
Once they cleared out that blockage and Rhoda rooted me,
that gave me superpowers.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I can do anything.
That's the kind of powers I normally have.
Well, see, I've been wondering...
Just from being alive.
Okay, they have a defibrillator at the cardio rehab place in case one of...
For some reason, it's all old people, Dr. Drummond.
Really old people.
I don't know what I'm doing there.
They're old and they're fat.
I don't know what I'm doing there.
But I thought...
I asked the nurse this.
It's like, okay, if I'm dead and the defibrillator brings me back to life,
if I'm normal, will the defibrillator give me mutant powers or give me super strength?
And she said no, but I think she just said that to prevent me from trying it.
Probably.
Probably.
Because that's what I'm going to do.
Hey, you know, Reverend Stang, if everybody in the listening audience goes to...
Even if they don't go to their Roku device to watch the new special non-director's cut
of the Night of Slack, which includes the double super secret program,
called Probationary Unseen, Never Before Seen by Humanized Footage, if they would just
go and watch that, they would see Reverend Stang the way...
When I think of Reverend Stang in my mind and I visualize him, that's what he looks
like.
Well, that's what I look like again now.
I'm still the...
With a green jacket, with a green jacket, ranting at the crowd.
That's you.
That was Paul Mavridis' green jacket.
Because I didn't have anything that nice.
It's an awesome jacket.
I didn't have anything that nice.
I didn't have anything that nice.
Whose tie was it?
I don't know.
Somebody else's tie.
Somebody else's tie.
Is that when they...
You're destroying watches right now.
Is that when they grade your time?
Say, look at what...
You're controlling time.
What's the whole distinction?
You're giving a demonstration, the whole demonstration of time control right now.
Well, folks, all I can say is that Night of Slack show was the high point of our career.
It was, what, 20...
No, 35 years ago now.
So...
Yeah.
It's been going downhill ever since.
Praise Bob.
The people should go out there and watch it so that we can get millions and millions
of hits and views on our Roku channel, which will drive billions of dollars towards the
church's coffers, mighty coffers that need to be constantly filled.
Yeah, we need lots of hits.
Lots of hits and views.
Because we like to...
Those translate to real dollars.
...every, like, five minutes.
Those translate to real dollars.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's...
Real dollars.
...subgenius.com.
The first sentence on subgenius.com, well, after becoming ordained minister, the next
sentence is about the Roku channel, and there's a link to it.
So you can actually watch it on your computer.
Yeah.
Sort of.
Because it goes...
Well, it goes to Vimeo.
We have all of our content is linked in Vimeo.
That includes all that extra stuff.

All of the X Day stuff that I put out.
It's uncensored, by the way, right?
The raw X Day footage?
It's raw X Day footage.
Not safe for work or children.
Ah.
Twelve short subjects.
Unless they're children that are older than 21.
That's right.
There are 12 X Day short subjects on that Vimeo thing.
Also on RevStang YouTube.
I noticed there wasn't a whole lot of...
It wasn't as overly gratuitous in its nudity content this time, although...
Oh, that's because I'm saving that footage for the 30-minute documentary.
Oh, good.
Good.
The really hot...
All the stuff that you're going, well, where's the real juicy, super juicy stuff?
That's in the 30-minute documentary.
That's the triple X-rated stuff that always happens every X Day uncontrollably everywhere.
Yeah.
Out of control.
Nobody can stop it.
Totally out of control.
Nobody can stop it.
It looks a lot like the orgy scene at the end of that movie Sausage Party.
I thought it...
I think...
If I hadn't known that it had happened so many years ago, I would have thought that
that's what that scene in Caligula was based on, the movie Caligula.
Well, that was based on the parties that Bob used to throw before they were called
X Day.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
You were at those.
I wasn't.
They invited you.
Oh, yeah.
You got to go.
They never invited me.
Well, I had so many drugs.
I had so many drugs, it's wiped that portion of my brain out, though.
I can't really remember it, except for the sex.
Hmm.
Well, I hate to say it.
But this show is pretty much over.
And poor Dave was left in the lurch.
Yeah.
Poor Dave is dead.
Poor Dave.
He doesn't even know what happened.
So, Dr. Drummond...
Say hi to Dave.
All right.
Well...
Like everyone else, we'll be listening to your show, The Puzzling Evidence Show, from
Berkeley on KPFA.
Yeah.
And...
When I make my glorious return this next week.
Okay, Dr. Drummond.
We'll see you.
See you, Dr. Drummond.
See you.
Praise Bob.
See you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
See, he knows how to do the yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, don't I?
Because he invented it.
He showed Mel Blanc how to do it.
Now, what happens...
I don't...
I can't even unlock my phone.
Okay, that was the hour of slack, friends.
Subgenius.com.
Now, what happened to Dave?
Did we hang up with him?
We killed Dave.
Oh, no.
Dave's dead.
I'll try again.
I have to do things.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.






Dave, I'm sorry.
We had a little accident there.
You had an accident?
Yeah, I had another heart attack.
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
We...
I got another call, and I picked it up, and it was Dr. Drummond.
And we hadn't had him on the show ever, and it was such a serendipitous moment that we
got carried away.
And we ended up talking and doing a bunch of promos for his Roku Subgenius TV show channel,
which there is one.
That's why you were in the mood.
Well, we were doing the show, and the whole time we kept talking about, what do we do
about Dave?
And I didn't know how to make my phone switch back and forth between the two calls, because
I've never had two calls at once.
And I still don't know how to, actually.
What happened on your end?
Did you just wait and wait and wait, and it finally hung up?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Well, that's all right.
But it was one of those crazy things where it was the unexpected.
It sounded like it worked out poise-ically.
But then we used up all of the show.
Except for this part.
What?















Oh, which doesn't have any background music.
Maybe I should start that up.
We can still do the ad part of the show where we tell people off the broadcast radio, only
on the internet.
We can tell them that, really, if you want to be a cool subgenius and know what's really
going on, you want to be a member.
Want to be a member.
And it's only 35 bucks, and you get a huge package of really cool stuff, including decals
and a decoder pin.
And you're an ordained minister.

And you can eavesdrop and tap our phone and look at the scrubgenius secret members only
forum, which has the good pictures.
Much better than Facebook.
Mm-hmm.
They're pretty.
So there's that.
Pretty stupid.
Well, you don't know.
Well, no, of course I don't know.
I don't know anything.
But I'm acceding to this.
It's like a response for the moment.
They are pretty stupid, though.
Yeah.
I thought they were.
I posted a picture of a fossil.
I would have volunteered another comment, like, they have 12 tits apiece or something, you
know, like a dog.
I posted a photograph of a fossil ghost skeleton today on scrubgenius forum that we just discovered.
Every time we make a new discovery, I post it there immediately.
The fossil robot.
Dave, you probably don't know about the fossil robot skeleton we found.
A fossil prehistoric...

Robot.
Skeleton.
Laying on the ground, broken up, it was sproinged or something in its death throes, and its
spine was all real, real long and sproingy, like a bad spring.
And it was a robot.
It had little red buttons on its chest.
Of course, they'd fossilized, turned to stone.
And one of those sort of perpetually surprised robot expressions that they tend to have.
And...
Yeah.
It was made of stone.
The metal had converted to stone, and it was a fossil robot that we date at around 110
million years B.C.
The ghost skeleton is kind of, who knows?
You can't date those.
They don't have carbon.
Now, these are actual rock formations in the plunderers of your hacienda town?
Yeah, yeah.
We, yeah, we discover these fossils all the time.
You know, we're opening a museum.
And we've got a devil skeleton.
Prehistoric devil, of course, not a modern one.
Yeah, you're gonna have like, kind of like a mammoth cave going down, kind of thing,
going down there.
We have caves.
Take gondola rides through the middle of the Stangler Rancho and stuff.
Right.
Yeah, that's called the murder run.
It's like, run for your life ride.
Well, as long as you can see the top of the Cinderella wheel, you know you're not gonna
pass by that quickly.
And there's the, uh, the snake nest ride.
Yeah.


Where you go down into the snake nest and then run back out real fast.
Because we don't tell them that it's a snake nest.
We tell them, hey, you want to see our final attraction, man-eating chicken.
It's down there in that cave.
And they go in the cave and of course it's full of rattlesnakes.
And, and they, they get a thrill.
That's a big thrill.
I would like to buy some land.
Any land.
And we got dinosaur, ghost dinosaur tracks.
They're kind of blurry.
But that makes them special.
You know, because they're left by ghost dinosaurs.
Yeah.
And, uh.
Just a little, little flavor, a little essential flavor of, of, uh, hey, how come you keep
on using the word mango and Mussolini all the time when you're talking about dis, disallowing
and disaffection and stuff.
I was about to ask you that.
Dave, you've said that phrase mango Mussolini about 10 times on this show.
I thought it was at least 25, 30, 33,000 million times.
You know, some really substantial number, not just some kind of cockamamie, uh, reportage
has nothing to do with reality.
I, I'm sorry.
I'm just sickened.
And, and hey, what are they?
What's petards?
Is that like under, that's like leotards or something?
Petards like hoist upon thine own petard.
Hoisted by one's own petards.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, that's actually, that's, that's, that's a rude way of talking that exploits, uh, petarded
people who wear petards.
See, yeah, that's one philosophy.
One theory was petard people.
Petards.
He's wearing a petard.
Hey, petardo.
Don't play petards.
Yeah.
He's hoisted on his own petardo.
Yeah.
It's okay.
Cause Trump's president now.
We can say that now.
It's okay.
Cause Trump's president.
Yeah.
Retard, petard.
See, I could say that Trump's president now.
So that's the real etymology of the, of the erection.
That's the reason why you can't go all the way back into the future.
There weren't exactly what you were talking about because there's a, I don't know, there's
a big block against people studying the ancient wisdoms or, uh, uh, you know, the, the, the

So that's where these bad, uh, these, these works are tied.

And we, uh, we were like, I garnered the basics of science and knowledge.
It's, um, it's something like that.
Is it something like that?
Well, there's a block against science, knowledge, and truth these days because it gets in the
way of the agenda.
The beautiful agenda which rises up around us like a flowering garden.
Aww ÿ∂ÔøΩ
Things will be back the way they used to be.
I love the flowery agenda.
With feudal landowners, and I will be like an English lord, l l lording it over
my feudal serfs in their
futile lives of
servitude.
Because Trump's president now, so I
can say that.
Yeah.
Go cry, snowflake.
I call them snowflakes.
You got a cooler with that,
man. You trying to hurt me or what?
Jeez.
I'm trying to be president.
The plane goes up and down my spine every time
you do that. I'm thinking about running
for president.
I'm stupid.
Vote for me, because I'm
the best.
You can't interrupt
the flow of the
disgorgement all at the same time
because then everybody
loses their noodles, so to speak.
They'll just forget what
they're doing there for.
That sells now. That's what sells.
That's what the kids want.
That's all they'll listen to.
Any 52-year-old
kid could understand that, that's
for sure. Especially if their
hair was on fire.
I don't know if we can get
away with that on the air, though. Do you
want to try it, or should we leave them
out of the argument, so to speak?
Well, first I have to ask you
this, Dave. Would you
as a friend, as a friend,
would you tell me if my face
was on fire?
Um, yeah.
You would? Of course.
You're a mensch.
Thanks. I'm a true mensch.
There's some people, it's like they're talking to their
friend and the friend's face is on fire
and they'll go, well, sir's him right if he doesn't
know. I'll just let his face
burn. I'm not even going to tell him.
How do you live with people like that?
Especially if your yacht's
broken up and it's different tiny little
small pieces floating around the harbor.
Nobody can get to it and you just realize
you lost one
peahole of a lot of money.
Yeah, well, but it's
yeah, there's other yachts.
Yeah, Buffalo.
You lost one yacht. You can get
another yacht.
Yeah, you
want to make sure the passage is
smooth like the...
What's that movie, Tristan?
They sold it by Shakespeare or something, right?
I never saw that
and they didn't have a classic
illustrated of it, so I'm not
familiar with it.
I thought, sure,
you would know of all people.
Of course, a lot of times you don't like to
refer to yourself as a people.
I've
actually read a lot of
Shakespeare, but I've read
a lot more science fiction.
One of my favorites was
A Midsummer Night's Dream
when they had the orchestra
was, I forget, who was
the one guy who was the opioid addict?
He's shooting right in his brain.
Dr. Morpheus.
Dr. Morpheus.
Dr. Morpheus.
They named that for the strip, right?
That was like the days of burlesque halls and stuff like that.
Yeah, that drew
the crowds.
He handled
underpants.
They joked about
calling it the cheesy part, but that was just
a slogan...
Gildan Stern and Underpants?
Gildan Stern and Morgan Stern are dead.
Underpants.
Yep.
I try to forget it, you know what I mean?
The first thing
I asked in freshman English
was if we'd ever heard of that.
I know you don't want to talk about that.
You're having a talk about something
substantial, has some meaning,
you know.
I don't know.
I don't want to talk about things that
trigger me.
Those are triggers.
I don't want to think about things
that are bad.
I only want to think
about things that are good.
Like her.
She's singing again, Dave.
That giant woman
that humps your leg at work.
She's singing again.
She's singing about love of you.
She's singing about you.
She doesn't love me.
She loves you, Dave.
They all love you.
I know.
She's singing.
In heaven, everything is fine.
Well, in Italian.
In heaven, everything is fine.
You got yours and baby, I got mine.
Yep.
That's the way I remember it.
That was that movie about your life
called Eraserhead.
Mm-hmm.
They made a documentary about
Lonesome Cowboy Dave
in the 80s.
80s?
Around 1980 or so, was it?
Called it Eraserhead?
I think it was 1980.
Maybe it was even 79.
It could have been.
If you were a hipster,
it could have been 79.
Right.
And if you were, you know,
It was just before.
ate a lot of frozen TV dinners
and stuff, it was probably 1981.
Yeah.
Yeah, I identified with that movie.
I was a young man
who had just gotten married
and had a first kid.
And the kid had a,
was like a worm-headed snake being
with no limbs.
Yeah, yeah.
I love to make you that.
Yeah.
Make this horrible noise.
Yeah, that was my,
I was that guy.
Yeah.
I mean, I was feeling,
that's why I was so popular,
especially among the bird people.
Remember those guys
that used to shoot up the meetings
and everything like that?
And one time they clipped his honor,
the great, you know,
the big pooh-wow,
what's his name?
I don't know.
I never worked in Hollywood again
after that.
They made sure I'd never work
in Hollywood.
They would after that.
Yep.
No more fight kicking for you,
you know?
Ha, ha, ha.
I mean, I guess you're supposed
to try and keep from regurgitating
like you're chasing a dolphin
or something.
Oh, man.
I don't know where to get
or where to leave off
or where to start, you know?
That's the human condition.
It's what's wrong
with our country today.
Yep.
Yep.
It's the human condition, man.
I believe what I need to believe.
Yep.
It's called cognitive dissonance.
It's when things don't line up
in your cognition areas.
Bob sold it.
I smoked it.
That settles it.
I'm going to keep these...
You were dissonant too, wasn't he?
I'm going to tighten these blinkers
even tighter around my eyes.
I'm going to see a 10-degree
field of view.
That way I only see
what I aim my head at,
what I want to see.
I don't need to see
some damn other things
that are trying to show me
different.
Screw that stuff.
I'm going to see
what I'm going to look at.
I'm only going to see
what I want to look at.
You can't blame me for that,
now can you?
That's a man's right
to see only what he wants to see
and believe only
what he wants to believe.
It's the pulling of the wool
over one's own eyeballs.
That's it.
That's what Bob taught.
Break thinking.
You just stop.
You just quit thinking about it.
You don't use your mind
to think about your religion.
You just believe.
That's it.
Yep.
That's why I'm going to be
crying in my beer.
That's why I like fake news,
like the Bible,
the Koran,
or the Holy Book of the Subgenius.
I love the fake news.
Fake news gives me hope,
hope for the future.
The real news fills me with
fear, loathing, terror.
I like the fake news.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Yeah.
These are not scientific.
Wonder like some of them are.
All right.
Well, Dave, you know what?
I'm going to have to go
because of the simple reason
that my tape recorder
is running out of tape
or battery, actually.
It's a digital recorder.
It's running out of battery.
So I'm going to have to make it stop
or I'm afraid it won't save.
OK.
An hour and 17 minutes.
All right.
All right.
That gets me off the hook.
Well, I don't know about that.
Well,
we'll have to do it again
next week,
except we're not going to be here
next week,
but we'll have to do a rerun
next week
or run this five times.
That's what they do at some stations.
Ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.
OK.
Nighty-night, Dave.
We have to go now.
I'm going to try to send you
them illustrations
if you feel like doing that
and so forth.
Yeah, yeah.
You better send them.
OK.
And friends,
the place to send
your illustrations is
Post Office Box 807
Glen Rose, Texas
76043.
Isn't that amazing?
Yes.
Ha, ha, ha.
I'm sorry.
Well, we'll be back
in Cleveland in May.
And until then,
we must fade out.
Fade away.
It's better to fade away
than burn out.
Oh, he's gone.
Well, so are we.
