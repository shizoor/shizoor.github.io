1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Destiny awaits us.

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,600
Chapter 5

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,260
Ye have heard that it hath been said,

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,500
Thou shalt hate the

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,960
SOUL GENIUS

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,780
POWER OF SQUADCH

7
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,540
Which will live in infamy.

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,240
Last night Japanese forces attacked

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,440
The SOUL GENIUS

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,300
POWER OF SQUADCH

11
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,260
SOULICATION

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,260
SOULICATION

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,100
SOULICATION

14
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,800
SOULICATION

15
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,660
SOULICATION

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,420
SOULICATION

17
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,160
SOULICATION

18
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,900
SOULICATION

19
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:50,540
Bob came here and did something to all of us.

20
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,180
fit the

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,180


22
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,180


23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,880
the

24
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,360
his

25
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,180
that

26
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,440
it

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,240
is

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,240


29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,260
more

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,720
tiet

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,120
me

32
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,360
hello

33
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,960
are here from the

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,520
Hello, friends, and welcome.

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,820
The theme for tonight is deconstructing rock band cliches,

36
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,240
and this won't be a typical episode of Hour of Slack.

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,820
The first song you'll hear, by Andrew the Impaled, is a regular type of song,

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,500
but after that we'll be hearing excerpts from other subgenius bands,

39
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:49,220
all recorded live at 18X Day, but all involving much rock band member patter

40
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:54,120
that is, if not of a completely sarcastic and satirical nature,

41
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,540
actually very sincerely dumb and horrible.

42
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,540
It's an exploration of what we call doctor music.

43
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:09,960
Not always easy on the ears, but always revealing of the sheer vanity inherent in any real rock band.

44
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,400
We'll hear arguments between members,

45
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,340
of Doctors for Wotan, that's me and Philo and our two wives,

46
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,240
and Six-Fisted Tales of Connie, with some actual music included.

47
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:29,360
We'll even hear Reverend Angry Larry of the Amino Acids teach the band Coming of the Giant Germs

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,820
his trick for remembering chords for rock songs by spelling out words

49
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,920
with the letters representing each note.

50
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,940
Finally, and perhaps climactically,

51
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:47,960
we'll hear some off-the-cuff improvisational parodies whipped out between songs and rants

52
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,380
by our MC, Priestess Pisces.

53
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,940
But first, live from 18X Day at Wisteria, St. Andrew the Impaled.

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,140
This next song is called Sapiosexual Way.

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,660
Now a sapiosexual is a person that gets off on intelligence,

56
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,380
a person whose turn on is, you know, smart people.

57
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:10,920
Smart people.

58
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,160
There's gonna be a lot of letters come flying at you.

59
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,080
They're just a DNA sequence.

60
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,600
You don't need to memorize them.

61
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,560
There will not be a test.

62
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,400
C, D, G, A, I got some fresh DNA.

63
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,020
I got it for you.

64
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,720
A, T, C, G, why don't you come get with me?

65
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,200
Got nothing better to do.

66
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,860
Your C, C, T, G, A, C, T, G, A, A, C would go nice

67
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,180
with my C, C, T, G, A, T, A, T, my advice.

68
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,940
Let's get down today in a sapiosexual way.

69
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,200
My kind of girl, she's a sapiosexual.

70
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,160
Yeah, I know what that means.

71
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,180
And that's hot, hot, at least to her,

72
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,820
because she digs intellectuals.

73
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,340
Yeah, she likes the geeks.

74
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,160
Well, you're new to the scene.

75
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,380
You might be kind of keen.

76
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,680
Do you know what I mean when I say I like them genes?

77
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,900
Oh, C, T, G, A, I got some fresh DNA.

78
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,480
I got it for you.

79
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,900
A, T, C, G, why don't you come get with me?

80
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,340
Got nothing better to do.

81
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,900
Your C, C, T, G, A, C, T, G, A, A, C would go nice

82
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,240
with my C, C, T, G, A, T, A, T, my advice.

83
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,980
Let's get down today in a sapiosexual way.

84
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,100
Sometimes girls take all the time to prudy up,

85
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,540
but they're just for today, and it's gonna fade.

86
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,660
So other girls, they're gonna fade.

87
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,280
They only wanna shake it up, get drunk and laid.

88
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,260
Well, that ain't for me.

89
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,880
The woman that I seek, she might be up till three,

90
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,940
but with a book of poetry and my C, T, G, A, I got some fresh DNA.

91
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,560
I got it for you.

92
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,920
Yeah, A, T, C, G, why don't you come get with me?

93
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,400
Got nothing better to do.

94
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,920
Your C, C, T, G, A, C, T, G, A, A, C would go nice

95
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,180
with my C, C, T, G, A, T, A, T, my advice.

96
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,840
Let's get down today in a sapiosexual way.

97
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,220
Let's get down today in a sapiosexual way.

98
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,860
You saw that I got under your subtle reference

99
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,440
to a movie that not more than 10,000 people have seen

100
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,520
among there and there and there.

101
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,880
Well, I know the difference.

102
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,700
So how'd you like to mix it up with me?

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
At my C.

104
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,180
Let's see how you are at saying how I properly

105
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,180


106
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,180


107
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,180


108
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,660
not of high Huejeprißtighc music.

109
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:07,660


110
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,840
He wants you because of the mind you have.

111
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,540
Now can you empathize?

112
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,220
To be perfectly fair, you should be aware.

113
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,480
We'd make a nifty pair.

114
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,420
If you have the MC squared.

115
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,920
For my C, T, G, A.

116
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,960
I got it for you.

117
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,560
A, T, C, G.

118
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,820
What you can get with me.

119
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,220
Ain't nothing better to do.

120
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,660
Your C, T, G, A, C, T, G, A, A, C would go nice.

121
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,920
For my C, T, G, A, T, A, T, my advice.

122
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,780
Let's get down today in a sapiosexual way.

123
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:44,160
I said let's get it down today in a sapiosexual way.

124
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,520
Alright, thank you so much.

125
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,440
How you guys all doing tonight?

126
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,060
You having fun?

127
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,000
Having that duck is for WOTAN, man.

128
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,440
I fucking hate following talent.

129
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,220
Fucking.

130
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,480
Piss me off.

131
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,980
Dr. Drummond and I were the first Bobbies.

132
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,840
I noticed St. Faltimus had a song about the Bobbies.

133
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,060
It was a nice song.

134
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,140
Some people use Bobby as a dirty word.

135
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,000
You know, I guess Philo knew Bob personally before I did.

136
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,120
So I guess you can't say he was really a Bobby.

137
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,280
But I was maybe the first Bobby.

138
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,220
I used to say Bob slack, Bob slack all day long.

139
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,080
And then I was taught that it was cool to say kill Bob all day long.

140
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,500
I noticed other people have been taught that it's cool to say kill Stang a lot too.

141
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
But that's not cool, man.

142
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,840
But yeah, there's nothing wrong with being an obsequious, ass-kissing Bobby,

143
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,300
unoriginal, just quoting, misquoting the same old stuff and spelling Bob's name wrong.

144
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,300
It's a stage, you know.

145
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,200
And you'll probably get through it.

146
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,120
Or else everybody else will make fun of you so much you'll get butt hurt and quit.

147
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,940
It's a harsh...

148
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,160
Subgenius society is a harsh mistress.

149
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,320
And a frigid mistress for a lot of people.

150
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,360
Oh!

151
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,120
I'm behind the time.

152
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,720
She got so into it.

153
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,080
Now she needs to be mic'd better.

154
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,320
Or it, whatever.

155
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,740
She's got a mic right here.

156
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,160
I'm gonna get...

157
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,100
You're back in my queefing, no?

158
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:43,400
The best mic placement in a Wotan thing is right in the middle of the damn band.

159
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,480
Even if there's sound coming out of the speakers.

160
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,100
Because you're gonna pick up a...

161
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,860
Princess Wee isn't even mic'd at all.

162
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,580
And she refuses to come forward.

163
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,640
But this band is sort of a, you know...

164
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,860
Why are you standing there?

165
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,080
Why are you...

166
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,840
Where is Princess Wee?

167
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,540
Because the flute is a piercing sound and you don't need to be mic'd.

168
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,160
This stage's right.

169
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,740
Yes you do.

170
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,920
I can't hear you usually.

171
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,420
No.

172
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,160
Roughly.

173
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,020
This rough area is fine.

174
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,220
Okay, so we'll share this area.

175
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,440
Yeah, yeah.

176
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,480
It's a rough area.

177
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,740
Like a communal band, you know?

178
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,120
Share it, Sherry.

179
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,660
Are we doing a communal band thing?

180
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,580
The one by the podium?

181
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,400
Oh no, no, we mow!

182
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,280
Moooooooooo!

183
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,460
There we go.

184
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,120
That was another thing we had to do.

185
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,720
We had to do a mow.

186
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,000
Before you could really...

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,080
Get down.

188
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,580
Oh, we're doctors...

189
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,540
For Bob.

190
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,320
For Bob!

191
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,980
Doctors for Bob!

192
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,820
And everything real in my life!

193
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,160
Oh, we're doctors for Bob!

194
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,860
That damn pick-up doesn't run over my wife!

195
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,080
We've been working for like 10 or 20 minutes, man.

196
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,740
And I'm getting a little bit tired.

197
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,420
I need to take a little break, I think.

198
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,920
Well, that's the Rockstar Life, man.

199
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,980
It's costume change you didn't put on your doctor's suit.

200
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,620
And where's the blood?

201
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,680
Where's all the fake blood?

202
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,060
The knives and the chainsaws?

203
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:10,720
The smoke machine?

204
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,040
And the beach towels?

205
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,180
And the beach balls?

206
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,520
And the suntan lotion?

207
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,260
We're just gonna have a beach party!

208
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,260
Some genius beach party!

209
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,500
I'll bring the heroin if you bring the suntan lotion.

210
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,220
I'll bring the frappes up lip gloss.

211
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,280
I'll bring the neutron howitzers if you bring the big umbrella, the shade umbrella.

212
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,620
Big giant...

213
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,900
I'll bring the toxic Bob vomit for lip gloss.

214
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:32,900


215
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:32,900


216
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:32,900


217
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:32,900


218
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:32,900


219
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:32,900


220
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:32,900


221
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:32,900


222
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:32,900


223
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:32,900


224
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:32,900


225
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:32,900


226
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,180
I'll bring the

227
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,620
What else do we need?

228
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,100
Your woody!

229
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,200
Can you bring your woody?

230
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,040
Can we carry it here?

231
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,540
Your woody?

232
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,640
She's doing things with that that I don't think it was intended.

233
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,500
Or many of them.

234
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,860
How do you know it's a she?

235
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,760
Why do you keep calling that thing she?

236
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,340
Well, it doesn't...

237
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,920
Look at that!

238
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,000
It's not a she at all!

239
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,960
She's rubbing its appendage, its masculine lance.

240
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,440
Hey, that's my wife!

241
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,240
You can't do that to my...

242
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,780
Stop fucking his wife!

243
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,480
Oh, wait!

244
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,040
Oh, now that's better.

245
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,160
Give him a reach around.

246
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,380
Now, yes.

247
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:05,900
Keep...

248
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,320
Yes, fuck me!

249
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,020
That's a good thing.

250
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,540
I'll give you a reach around.

251
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,160
Don't fuck you.

252
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,400
Don't fuck my wife.

253
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:11,900
Fuck me!

254
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,080
You know, that's not...

255
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,140
Fuck me!

256
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,540
You really tell a good friend like that.

257
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,200
They'll give you that reach around and finish it off.

258
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,920
Why do they use fuck as a bad word?

259
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,340
Like, I'm a fucker!

260
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,340
It sounds good.

261
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,700
It's more like a sweet word.

262
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,220
Fuck you.

263
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,220


264
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,220


265
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,220


266
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,220


267
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,220


268
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,220


269
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,220


270
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,220


271
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,220


272
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,760
I don't know.

273
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,300
I don't know.

274
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,620
I don't know how to...

275
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,100
I don't know.

276
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:32,500
I don't know how to...

277
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:32,500


278
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,900
Oh, here's a song called Cooking.

279
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,800
Remember Cooking?

280
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,620
That was one where...

281
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,560
We were actually cooking.

282
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,440
It was really good.

283
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,540
We were actually cooking.

284
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,440
We were going fast.

285
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,580
We had a song that had a beat that was going fast.

286
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,040
Yeah, yeah.

287
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,080
It had a melody and some harmony, you know?

288
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,160
Right, right.

289
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,960
And then suddenly that new guy, that kid, he goes, stop, stop, stop!

290
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:50,700
Yeah.

291
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,820
And we go, why?

292
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,440
We were cooking.

293
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,380
He goes, yeah.

294
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,180
That's what's wrong with it.

295
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,780
I'd already told him that story.

296
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,220
He was like, I don't know.

297
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,480
That was a song called Cooking.

298
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,480


299
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,480


300
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,540
Oh, it did?

301
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,100
Yes.

302
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,880
The all-sign.

303
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,800
And this in particular?

304
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,460
That's a signed all-sign.

305
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,400
And in this particular X-day, or...

306
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,980
About 10 minutes ago, during our first song.

307
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,400
Yeah.

308
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,600
But you thought it was a tune-up.

309
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,360
Or a set chec.

310
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,860
Chec, chec.

311
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,280
What about Steve Kock?

312
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,700
I think I want to do a sound check.

313
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,040
Chec.

314
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,120
I think it's actually the first song.

315
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,500
How about Inna-gada-davidah?

316
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,020
I can't remember the lyrics, though.

317
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,060
I think it goes...

318
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:26,280
Inna-gada-davidah, baby Don't you know that I love it

319
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,220
I'm loving you.

320
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,240
In a God of the Vita, baby, don't you know that I'll always be true?

321
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,420
Okay, we just did it.

322
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,380
We just did it in God of the Vita.

323
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,400
Dance through the doctors or die.

324
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,760
You have to dance through the doctors or die.

325
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:52,780
I'm doing it.

326
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,700
Get your Moog synthesizer.

327
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,900
See, I've already done the lyrics.

328
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,480
And they can, Pat, you can mix it in later, right?

329
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,200
I'm going to fix it in the mix.

330
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,120
You'll fix it in the mix?

331
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:05,560
Yeah.

332
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,680
Yeah, that's the way.

333
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,020
Fix it in the mix.

334
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:15,240
The way we did overdubs and stuff, we did the vocals first and then dubbed the music to the vocals.

335
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:22,200
Originally, Doctors for Wotan was done with children's toy instruments.

336
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,680
And kids.

337
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,480
Kitchen utensils like spoons and coffee cans.

338
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:39,600
The original drummer was a wind-up chimpanzee with cymbals, which Philo stuck in a box so that it would have a back beat.

339
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,280
It would go, boom, boom, like that.

340
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,980
But he forgot our drummer.

341
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,500
Philo forgot the drummer again.

342
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,000
So now we have this.

343
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,640
We have to use drum machines or percussion instruments.

344
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,700
Watch, kid.

345
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,280
Watch.

346
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,640
Let me see.

347
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,300
She needs a mic while she tunes up.

348
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,620
I'm tuning up.

349
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,600
This is the tune up.

350
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,920
This is actually what you're hearing now is possibly the best song you're going to hear tonight.

351
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,020
In a car to defeat a baby.

352
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,960
Don't you know that?

353
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,380
There's real musicians that are going to play.

354
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,660
Andrew is here.

355
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,260
Andrew the Impaled.

356
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,020
He sings.

357
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,460
He's like Tom Lehrer.

358
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,680
You can understand.

359
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,780
You can understand the lyrics just like country music.

360
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,700
He's sophisticated.

361
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,000
He's sophisticated like a Harvard math professor.

362
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,640
And his music is actually pretty good.

363
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,600
Andrew the Impaled.

364
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,460
Andrew the Impaled.

365
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,460
Andrew.

366
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,400
Andrew.

367
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,260
Andrew.

368
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,200
The Impaled.

369
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,400
Andrew.

370
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,140
Andrew.

371
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,240
Andrew.

372
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,940
The Impaled.

373
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,480
Impaled.

374
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:51,960
Impaled.

375
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,620
Andrew.

376
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:52,940
Andrew.

377
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,580
The Impaled.

378
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,840
Do you know what impaling is?

379
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,560
When I was a kid I used to think impaling was like sticking somebody in the stomach with a stick.

380
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,940
Or they have a spear poking out of the ground and they just stick you on it through your stomach.

381
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,340
Because they don't tell little kids what impaling really is.

382
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:18,180
Which is that you send a guy, the criminal or victim or whatever, on a rather blunt sharp mistake.

383
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,600
Not all that super sharp.

384
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,060
And the person's late.

385
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,060
The one who's late would drive the stake up in their buttock.

386
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,580
Slowly up through their buttock.

387
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,580
Kill them, really slowly.

388
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,740
And Andrew the Impaled.

389
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,640
Now, this wasn't part of the original Doctor Squirrel Wolf man.

390
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,700
Andrew the Impaled.

391
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,320
Andrew the Impaled.

392
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:39,320


393
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,100
This green thing.

394
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,700
The kids said, now, we're going have a wedding tomorrow.

395
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:51,020
Those young, that young couple needs to be instructed in how to consummate their wedding.

396
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,040
And what we're doing is we're going to have a couple that are bright and healthy and that's

397
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,560
What we're watching here is how to make little subgenius children.

398
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,360
Now the weird guy could probably give him some advice.

399
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,180
I can, Dr. Drummond can.

400
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,260
You know I was in Amsterdam once and I paid $20 to see that.

401
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,720
That's right you did, you paid $20 to see that.

402
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,480
I paid $20 to see that.

403
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,600
You owe us $20.

404
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,380
Everybody here owes us another $20 because Philo had to pay to see that.

405
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,700
That one time in Amsterdam.

406
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,100
Enter the Impale.

407
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,020
Enter the Impale.

408
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,640
Enter the Impale.

409
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,340
Enter the Impale.

410
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,040
Is he going to impale himself?

411
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,100
He comes on next right?

412
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,140
After us?

413
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,660
He's going to get impaled.

414
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,160
Enter the Impale.

415
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,540
He's going to get impaled.

416
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,980
Enter the Impale.

417
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,980
This is a new song.

418
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,060
That's a new song.

419
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,800
We just made it up tonight.

420
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,680
This is a new song.

421
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,380
It's our worst song.

422
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,540
After 31 years.

423
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,720
It's probably our last song.

424
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,760
For now.

425
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,180
We still got it.

426
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,420
Yeah we still got it.

427
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,400
Still sounds stupid.

428
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,120
Still sounds doctor.

429
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,600
These fart pianos aren't loud enough.

430
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,740
We need a real fart.

431
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,140
These fart pianos aren't nearly as good as the...

432
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,880
First by Frank Style Bean.

433
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,920
You know when I was a kid we had fart pianos that were much better than this.

434
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,600
You know back in the old days.

435
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,220
Our fart pianos actually had real asses producing real farts.

436
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,120
And they were in smell-o-visions.

437
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,940
You could actually smell the silly fake farts.

438
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,040
They were much louder.

439
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,480
Fart pianos.

440
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,900
Logos up with several dozen people.

441
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,780
These modern digital fart machines.

442
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,640
They don't sound as pure.

443
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,620
They don't sound as real.

444
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,260
You know when you have that big old bladder and you just pump on it.

445
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,540
And you need them beads and you just kind of...

446
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,380
The pedimane your way through it.

447
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,860
You can really get a good song going.

448
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,480
You know.

449
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,240
God has like the rest.

450
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,300
The rest of the sample.

451
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,580
I think we just ruined this song.

452
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,240
I didn't mean to ruin this song.

453
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,620
I used the wrong sample.

454
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,080
Sam Fred's low.

455
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,120
He needs his shoulders.

456
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,680
I think we should have rehearsed this.

457
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,040
And the drum and the monkey.

458
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,400
I'm glad you left the drummer at home.

459
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,140
Who's rapping?

460
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,800
Do you think that's a much better drummer?

461
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,980
He's a much better drummer.

462
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,980
He doesn't wind down.

463
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,700
You don't have to wind him up all the time.

464
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,740
And Chaos McBobcat goes wild on the Moog synthesizer.

465
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,540
That's not a Moog synthesizer.

466
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,240
It's a Moog synthesizer.

467
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,080
It is?

468
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,420
Really?

469
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,560
I know it's not.

470
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,580
But Fred.

471
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,620
Fred Moog?

472
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,680
Ma Moog.

473
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,900
Oh.

474
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,300
Well, whatever.

475
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:53,960
Okay.

476
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,000
I think that song's over.

477
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,240
I think that was our worst song.

478
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,900
But as I was saying, Drugs for Wotan started out as a.

479
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,020
Well, Philo is a music expert.

480
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,240
And he knew about 12 tone high fluting classical stuff.

481
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,420
And avant garde things like the resident.

482
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:17,560
And he knew about the

483
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,560


484
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,560


485
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,560


486
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,560


487
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,560


488
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,560


489
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,560


490
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,560


491
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,560


492
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,560


493
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,560


494
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,560


495
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,560


496
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,560


497
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,680
I didn't know about any of that stuff.

498
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:26,420
But he convinced me that it was authentic music if you just started making some kind

499
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,120
of noise.

500
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,300
He made the choice.

501
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,760
JHHHHHHHHH

502
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,680
JHHHHHHHHHHHHH

503
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,460
JHHHHHHHHHH

504
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,620
JHHHHHHHHHD

505
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:52,880
I didn't know any good bass sound on that, and mistakes in melodics, which is

506
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:52,880


507
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:52,880


508
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:52,880


509
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:52,940
And finding the attitude is what makes a good bass sound is really good.

510
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,000
And coffee makes sounds kindness.

511
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,000


512
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,000


513
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,000


514
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,020
You ever hear heard of an absolutely especial bass sound?

515
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,020


516
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,260
You know, coming from the

517
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,260


518
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,100
I don't know.

519
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,100

568

575
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,600
¶¶

576
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,220
I'm here to fight

577
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,120
We're going fast, folks

578
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,240
Rocking back and forth

579
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,020
But the bass is getting stolen

580
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,120
But the bass is getting banned

581
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,220
But the bass is getting stolen

582
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,160
Oh, the bass is getting banned

583
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,720
Oh, the bass is getting banned

584
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:24,720


585
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,160
Oh, the bass is getting banned

586
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,960
Oh, the bass is getting banned

587
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,920
The next thing you know, it takes an hour to set up.

588
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,220
But that never was a problem with the children's toys.

589
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:45,000
But Doctors for Bob would get together with Doctors for Wotan

590
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,580
and the band that Darren's in.

591
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
They could not speak its name.

592
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,620
And even Doctors for Dinosaurs, briefly.

593
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,380
At Doc's Dock.

594
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,300
And a guy, at one point, I swear,

595
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,500
they must have spent six hours getting the audio system set up.

596
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,160
Their friends and relatives were standing around going,

597
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,440
Boy, this must be going to be really good.

598
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,800
They're so persnickety about getting set up.

599
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,740
Then when it started, it was just a horrible wall of noise.

600
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,600
For about an hour.

601
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,400
And all those innocent friends and relatives and people who'd been waiting all that time

602
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,480
just were scratching their heads.

603
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,800
And that was when I said to myself,

604
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,640
God damn Philodrumon for convincing me

605
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,240
that this anti-music shit was somehow good!

606
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,160
For years, for thirty years, I've been bombarded with tapes from amateurs.

607
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:46,040
Like playing ten records and synthesizers and flushing toilets all at once.

608
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,240
But with no beat. Couldn't dance to it.

609
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,720
I hate anti-music.

610
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,680
So this is my anti-music tune that I'm playing right now.

611
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,660
So no music at all in it.

612
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,840
Clean.

613
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,840
Pure.

614
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,820
Nothing but the one thing I love.

615
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,360
The sound of my own voice.

616
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,600
We used to record, we'd jam and record these Doctors for Wotan things.

617
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:22,020
Usually about every hour, out of every hour of tape, we would get a five minute piece.

618
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,520
That really kicked ass by accident.

619
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,660
But then somebody would always go,

620
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,280
Hey stop, stop the music, stop the music!

621
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,440
You can hear this on the tapes.

622
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,000
Why? I thought we were cooking.

623
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,760
Yeah, that's the problem!

624
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,800
It got good for a second.

625
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,560
So we'd take that five minutes

626
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,040
and stick it on the album.

627
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,760
Now since I was editing the first album,

628
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,880
those little five minute chunks tended to be the ones where you could hear me the loudest.

629
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,200
If Philo was editing them, it'd sound completely different.

630
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,500
It'd be a completely different album.

631
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,920
In fact, you can get your Philo albums from QuiveringBrain.com.

632
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,420
But they're about what you'd expect.

633
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,060
Because Philo's louder than me on them.

634
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,000
So how could they possibly be

635
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,080
as good as the ones where I'm louder than Philo?

636
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,820
You see, we have these band dynamics down.

637
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,660
I've observed a lot of bands.

638
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,860
I don't really play in many bands.

639
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,320
You ever see that movie, Frank?

640
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:35,040
That's the perfect portrait of band psycho interaction.

641
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:41,840
And it's kind of loosely based on a real Frank and Captain Beefheart.

642
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,980
Who apparently was rather hard to get along with.

643
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,720
That's why he's more famous than us.

644
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,660
Because he was mean.

645
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,060
See, if you're really mean, you get rich and famous.

646
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:57,080
If you're just humble and kind and nice and Gandhi-like,

647
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,900
like Dr. Drummond there and me,

648
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,120
you just remain, you know, a fringe band.

649
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,320
The kind of band that can come up with better band names

650
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,200
than any other band.

651
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,980
It's not necessarily a good band, but it's a good band.

652
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,640
But it does have good names.

653
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,740
The Vegas is falling.

654
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,520
Oh, the Vegas is falling.

655
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,580
The Vegas is falling.

656
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,200
One more time.

657
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,020
But the Vegas is falling.

658
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But the Vegas is down.

659
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,460
But the Vegas is falling.

660
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,560
Oh, the Vegas is down.

661
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:55,780
But the Vegas is falling.

662
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,380
That was our latest song called The Basis is Sullen.

663
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,940
No, no, no, that was a different song.

664
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,800
No, no, no, that was the bass of the song.

665
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,500
Everything smells like Taco Bell.

666
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,640
And that reminds me.

667
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,440
That was the other thing.

668
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,180
The first thing was,

669
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:16,400
thank you to all those artists and weirdos that have given us anything at all,

670
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,780
including the ticket to Agstay.

671
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:27,360
Because believe me, it's been on a kind of a hand-to-mouth, shoe-string thing since 1980.

672
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,480
But the good news is it proves you can do that

673
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,840
and probably be happier than poor old Robin Williams.

674
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:45,220
And we can think of another million other weirdos and subgeniuses who got famous and rich,

675
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,580
but it backfired.

676
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:53,360
So, you know, thank you for keeping us poor, but not too poor.

677
00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:02,820
However, if any of you are secretly insane millionaires, this would be a good time, you know.

678
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,080
But I was going to also shame on you people for cussing.

679
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,820
In front of my...

680
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,800
my sheltered 187-year-old mother-in-law.

681
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,680
I've heard terrible language up here.

682
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,820
And you've been a bad influence on her because then she started talking that way.

683
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,500
She sounds like a sailor now.

684
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,460
Now I'm the one who's getting embarrassed.

685
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,120
Oh, well.

686
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,540
Honestly, we're so proud that people mess with Bob's head

687
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,260
because that...

688
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:38,600
that...

689
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,140
that sure mess...

690
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,320
it messes with my head.

691
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,500
And I love having my head messed with that way.

692
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,140
Thank you, everybody, just for even making it, you know,

693
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,940
because we don't make it easy, that's for sure.

694
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:53,800
But being in a campground in the middle of nowhere makes it memorable.

695
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:54,920
Mm-hmm.

696
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:02,300
You might not remember any of it if we did this in a motel in Atlanta or something.

697
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,020
Because I don't...

698
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,900
I've been to a bunch of conventions in motels in Atlanta.

699
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,180
I don't remember any of it.

700
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,660
So I didn't...

701
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,260
it didn't...

702
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:16,740
I was never terrorized or threatened or inconvenienced or...

703
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,580
and all of...

704
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:26,600
or bitten by poisonous spiders, tarantulas, water spiders, snakes, bears, and worse,

705
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,760
which is going to happen to all of you in the next few days.

706
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:37,860
And just remember, it's, you know, that which does not kill you injures you very,

707
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,160
very much.

708
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:38,920
Very badly.

709
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,080
So there's one trail that takes you past the lair of Old Sequa.

710
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,020
And every X day, Old Sequa takes one subgenius.

711
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:58,820
And usually it's one of those people, you know, who's kind of lame, wasn't that funny?

712
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,160
And nobody misses him, you know.

713
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,340
But you don't want to be that subgenius.

714
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,820
So be careful walking down.

715
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,100
Down them trails at night.

716
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:14,620
We had some strange things happen out here at Wisteria last X day.

717
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,160
Oh, yes.

718
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,900
It could happen to you.

719
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:22,640
Late at night on those trails, you'll hear sounds in the woods.

720
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,880
And you'll see footprints and things.

721
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,660
And suddenly you lost your bearings.

722
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,680
You don't know, wait, was I going this way down that trail?

723
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,080
Oh, that way.

724
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,080
Is that the trail?

725
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,980
Or is that just a brook, a little stream that looks like a trail?

726
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:35,800
Oh.

727
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,520
What's that?

728
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,620
What's that weird pipe smoke I smell?

729
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,400
Oh, no.

730
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,700
I hope Bob ain't coming to judge me now.

731
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,600
So anyway, like I say, have a good time walking down the trails.

732
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,600
It's good exercise.

733
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:53,680
And during the night, it's slippery and treacherous.

734
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,040
I almost broke my coccyx a couple of years ago doing that.

735
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,820
But really, during the day, kids, you know, last year when Bob killed all those people

736
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,080
and we had to go save Philo from him.

737
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:14,620
I managed to get 20 subgeniuses not just off their butts but into the woods a little ways

738
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,200
for like 10 or 15 minutes.

739
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:26,920
So I'd love to see when people take that huge brave step of going into the woods

740
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,580
and smelling the roses.

741
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,180
Not even coffee.

742
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,240
It's really roses.

743
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,840
And the poison ivy.

744
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,580
You know, it's natural.

745
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,500
It's organic.

746
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,900
It must be good.

747
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,040
What's that noise down there?

748
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:49,740
It sounds like horrible, ugly, large subgeniuses are playing rock and roll instruments.

749
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:22,540
Um, yeah, maybe that was

750
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:22,880
it?

751
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:23,540
Molly?

752
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:23,800
Did you want a bell, maybe?

753
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,840
Maybe she needed to wait until she...

754
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:24,840


755
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:24,840


756
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:24,840


757
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:24,840


758
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,100
Little bit of this, little bit of that.

759
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,100


760
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,100


761
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,100


762
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,640
Say no more.

763
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,700
I can't.

764
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,540
Why would I?

765
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:32,540


766
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:32,540


767
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:32,540


768
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,040
Obamaknicle.

769
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:35,820
We're all in there.

770
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:35,820


771
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,900
Thank you.

772
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,060
Thank you.

773
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,700
Thank you.

774
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,200
Thank you.

775
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,300
Thank you.

776
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,700
Oh, actually, there's a...

777
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,060
I've seen the bass player.

778
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,820
There's a song that's really...

779
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,960
It's called Fag Beef.

780
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,060
Fag Beef.

781
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:15,260
Yeah, because it's an F-A-G-B-E-F.

782
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,960
Deaf bag.

783
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,000
Deaf?

784
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:21,880
Bag.

785
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,140
Dead beef.

786
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,820
D-F-B-A-G.

787
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,160
That would probably sound pretty horrible.

788
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:27,880
Try it.

789
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,260
No?

790
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:28,820
All right.

791
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,600
I have to remember how to spell it.

792
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,020
Music.

793
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,480
Music.

794
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,080
One, two, three, four.

795
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
One, two, three, four.

796
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,240
One, two, three, four.

797
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,740
How about dead beef?

798
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,520
Dead beef.

799
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,020
Like D-E-D?

800
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,240
Yeah, D-E-A-D.

801
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,120
Oh, D-E-A-D.

802
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,540
Okay.

803
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:32,860
See, I came up with Fag Beef, which you just play F-A-G-B-E-E-F.

804
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,780
And then we did...

805
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,620
Fag.

806
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,480
Fag Cage.

807
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,940
Yeah, we did Fag Cage, and now we're doing Dead Beef.

808
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,400
Aren't you giving away all your secrets?

809
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,320
Did you say Fag Beef?

810
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,380
There's no secret here.

811
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,580
Oh, no, it's still a secret, because no one here will ever remember.

812
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,800
That's true.

813
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,080
There's no shame in this game.

814
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,520
I think Fag Beef.

815
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,060
If you steal this idea, you are dead beef.

816
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,320
Yeah, you're dead beef.

817
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,680
There's too many letters.

818
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,660
Yeah, you're dead beef.

819
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,740
Dead Beef.

820
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,480
Dead Beef.

821
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,400
Dead Beef.

822
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:28,400


823
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,760
You got it.

824
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,760
Dead Beef.

825
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,960
You got it.

826
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:33,980
Dead Beef.

827
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:33,980


828
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,120
Dead beef.

829
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,180
Bob said stop.

830
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,280
Bob said stop.

831
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,900
Bob said stop.

832
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,520
I can only yell dead beef so many times.

833
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,900
You guys have a lot of notes.

834
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,540
Too many notes.

835
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:08,840
Yeah.

836
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,680
Too many notes.

837
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,700
Listen, there's...

838
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,460
We could just do like less than a sentence.

839
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,000
We could just do a word, like cage.

840
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:16,700
Yeah.

841
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,420
We could do Gaga, but that's real easy.

842
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,060
It's just...

843
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,740
What happens if you play Bob Dobbs?

844
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,780
What's the O note?

845
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,120
There really isn't an O note.

846
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,020
Yeah, you got B-O-B.

847
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:36,540
I know.

848
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,360
That's boring.

849
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,920
Bob Dobbs would be boring.

850
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,020
Well, that would be if we were just going.

851
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,400
Well, what if you go B-O.

852
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,440
Well, what if you make the O random?

853
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,040
Oh.

854
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,600
Oh, so in other words we can do...

855
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,220
Be something be.

856
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:52,880
Right.

857
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,900
D something B-B.

858
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:54,560
Oh, it's like an L.

859
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,740
That's something L-O-L.

860
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,580
I don't know.

861
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,040
I mean, what if the O was a G?

862
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,280
Some of the...

863
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,220
Oh, that's a good one.

864
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,180
That's a good one.

865
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:03,720
Yeah.

866
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,100
Yeah.

867
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,060
I feel the fuckery

868
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,360
I smell the fuckery

869
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:03,340
I feel the fuckery

870
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:33,340
I feel the fuckery

871
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,640
Yeah, we're all here.

872
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,160
This is our first time in a long time

873
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,120
that we've been together.

874
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,440
Chirp!

875
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:46,920
Chirp!

876
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:50,660
Chirp!

877
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,440
The coming of

878
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,620
the giant. Chirp!

879
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,460
They're on your skin.

880
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,780
They're in your hair.

881
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,200
In your lungs.

882
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,700
They're everywhere.

883
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,500
Chirp!

884
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,920
The coming of the

885
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,780
Chirp!

886
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,940
It's a giant

887
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,920
Chirp!

888
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
From the deep depths of outer space

889
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,920
comes a

890
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,540
alien race.

891
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,620
Chirp!

892
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,680
Chirp!

893
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,300
Chirp!

894
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,900
Chirp!

895
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:47,280
Chirp!

896
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:48,420


897
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,420
Chirp!

898
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,220
They are the giant.

899
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:56,200
Chirp!

900
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,040
Chirp!

901
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,180
Chirp!

902
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:03,340


903
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,320
Chirp!

904
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,720
Chirp!

905
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:09,840
Chirp off.

906
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,460
Chirp!

907
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:14,420
Chirp!

908
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:14,440
Chirp!

909
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:14,440


910
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:14,440


911
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:14,760


912
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,320
Chirp!

913
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:15,620
Chirp!

914
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:16,680
Chirp!

915
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,020
Chirp!

916
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,160
Chirp off!

917
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,420
Chirp off!

918
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:25,940
Chirp!

919
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:26,580
Chirp off!

920
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:26,760
Chirp!

921
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:26,840
Chirpff!

922
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,120
Chirp, Chirp!

923
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,100
Chirp off!

924
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,300
Chirp!

925
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:30,680


926
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,160
And Earth.

927
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,640
My music every Friday night at the Bulls on a Catholic.

928
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,640
Bulls on a Catholic.

929
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,800
That was the Bulldada Cafe advertisement.

930
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,020
Bulldada Cafes are opening all over the universe right now,

931
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,260
and we encourage you to free refills of slack

932
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,280
at every Bulldada Cafe location.

933
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,420
Thank you very much.

934
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:25,980
Thank you very much.

935
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,580
The Bulldada Cafe is actually really, really hard to find.

936
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,960
It's one of those hole-in-the-wall places.

937
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,760
You guys have heard me do other parody songs,

938
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,260
so let me explain a few things.

939
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,380
And you're probably going to hear

940
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:00,660
another one of my parody songs.

941
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,740
There's another one later that's worse than this.

942
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,660
So Suds and I have a game.

943
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,500
And basically, he'll text me at work,

944
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,620
and he'll give me a song,

945
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,380
and he'll say,

946
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,220
make a Bob song out of it.

947
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,940
And I'm really bad good at this,

948
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,120
which is kind of sad.

949
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,700
Either I don't have anything better to do.

950
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,740
Well, yeah, that is what it is.

951
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,080
So I have tons of these.

952
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,760
So this one, I can actually do acapella.

953
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:30,560
Busted.

954
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,740
Flattened Carolina

955
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,360
Standing in the rain

956
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:38,800
And I was feeling just as burnt out as my bull

957
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,580
Bobby showed up with a pound

958
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,260
And a little blow

959
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:47,900
And he rode us all the way to Ohio

960
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,200
Well, I pulled my wallet out

961
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,320
Of my big old black bag

962
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,180
And I gave him 35 to tell the truth

963
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,160
Yeah

964
00:50:59,160 --> 00:50:59,440
Yeah

965
00:50:59,440 --> 00:50:59,940
Yeah

966
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,660
Yeah

967
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


968
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


969
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


970
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


971
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


972
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


973
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


974
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


975
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


976
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


977
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


978
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


979
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


980
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


981
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


982
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


983
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,660


984
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,540
His words hit me right on time

985
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,880
I was feeling so slack divine

986
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,540
It was something like I had never knew

987
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,480
Cause you see

988
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,140
Sometimes slack's another word for

989
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,820
Nothing left to lose

990
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:20,020
And nothing, nothing's all the comments gave me

991
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,500
And feeling good was easy, Lord

992
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,960
When Bobby spoke the truth

993
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,180
You know, feeling good is good enough

994
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:30,660
For me to be happy

995
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,860
For me to be happy

996
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,600
For me to be happy

997
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:32,600


998
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:32,600


999
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,200
Good enough for me and Bobby, see

1000
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,060
So from the Kentucky coal mines

1001
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,240
To the California sun

1002
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,960
Well, Bobby met lots of others on the road

1003
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,240
No matter the weather

1004
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,680
No matter what we've done

1005
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,480
Hey, Bobby, baby, get me from the cold

1006
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,300
One day in San Francisco

1007
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,660
Oh, Lord, we'll be back

1008
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,800
And let him slip away

1009
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,360
We've been looking for him since

1010
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,220
And I hope we find him

1011
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,860
But I'd trade all my tomorrows

1012
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,460
For one single yesterday

1013
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,680
To have Bobby pass the pipe around one more time

1014
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,240
Sometimes slack's another word for

1015
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,900
Nothing left to lose

1016
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,000
Nothing, nothing's all the kind he gave me

1017
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,240
And feeling good was easy, Lord

1018
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,600
When Bobby spoke the truth

1019
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,700
You know, feeling good was good enough for me

1020
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,120
Good enough for me and Bobby, see

1021
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,220
La la la, la la la la

1022
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,380
La la la, la la la la

1023
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,200
La la la, Bobby, I see

1024
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,740
La la la, la la la

1025
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,920
La la la, la la la la

1026
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,320
La la la, la la la la

1027
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,220
La la la, la la la la

1028
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,400
La la la, la la la la

1029
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,000
La la la, la la la la

1030
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,560
Hey, it's Bob, you know it's Bob and me

1031
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,340
Yeah, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lord

1032
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,100
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lord

1033
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,860
Hey, you know it's just Bob and me

1034
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,120
Yeah, Lord, I call him my savior

1035
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,700
I call him my friend, yes

1036
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,320
I call him by any other name I can, you know

1037
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,620
Come on, Bob, no

1038
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,160
I know where you bought me, yeah.

1039
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:38,080
Lordy, lordy, lordy, lordy, lordy, lordy, lordy, lord.

1040
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:44,720
Why, why, why did Bobby leave me?

1041
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,440
80.

1042
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,060
Go over there and pay him $20.

1043
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:57,280
80 bucks.

1044
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:58,920
80.

1045
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,180
I'm calling you on your back.

1046
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:01,140
Go pay Sting 20 bucks.

1047
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:08,220
Oh Bob, won't you buy me a ticket to space?

1048
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:14,520
I've paid all my money to your smiling face.

1049
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:22,820
Slacked off all my lifetime and waited for X day.

1050
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,620
So, oh Bob, won't you buy me

1051
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,640
a ticket to space?

1052
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,260
Let me go on.

1053
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:55,240
Like a blister in the sun, let me go on.

1054
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,880
Let me go on.

1055
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,040
Let me go on.

1056
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:57,480
Let me go on.

1057
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:58,840
Let me go on.

1058
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,200
Let me go on.

1059
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,480
You don't know the famous song about masturbation.

1060
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,880
Oh yeah, all right.

1061
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:18,440
Feels good tonight.

1062
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,220
Saying it's so.

1063
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,040
So nice to meet you.

1064
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:27,040


1065
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:27,040


1066
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:27,040


1067
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:27,040


1068
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:27,040


1069
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,440
Your slack is a false figure

1070
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,800
Say it ain't so

1071
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:44,680
Your lies are a slack figure

1072
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,940
What got me into doing the Bob Song stuff was that

1073
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:52,740
Years ago, I'm from Lynchburg

1074
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,100
I don't know if you know what that is

1075
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,800
Okay, it's the home of Jerry Falwell

1076
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,580
So there was a little coffee shop called the Drowsy Poet

1077
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,980
That was owned by all the crazy Christian people

1078
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:03,200
And so we would go in there and rewrite songs

1079
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,480
Until we got kicked out

1080
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,040
So we'd sing songs about penises and shitting

1081
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,820
Until they kicked us out of the coffee shop

1082
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,280
I must have gotten kicked out of that coffee shop

1083
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,420
40 or 50 times before they permanently banned me

1084
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,340
Last train to Clarksville

1085
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,220
House of the Rising Sun

1086
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:25,640
House of the Rising Sun

1087
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:25,780
House of the Rising Sun

1088
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:35,500
There is a house in Downsondon

1089
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:41,140
They call the Rising Sun

1090
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:49,280
And it's been the home of me for a while

1091
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:55,240
And I'm in love with you so much

1092
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:13,260
There's no way you know me

1093
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,960
I still can't believe

1094
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,680
There's never been a song boy

1095
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:16,900
That is as angry

1096
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,700
Your story is a shame

1097
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,900
I sometimes don't think it's real

1098
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:19,900


1099
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:19,900


1100
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:19,920
God successful

1101
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:19,920


1102
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,500
I try to stop this

1103
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:20,500


1104
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:20,500


1105
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:20,500


1106
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:20,500


1107
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:20,500


1108
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:20,500


1109
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:25,220
Done shit wrong

1110
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:31,500
From the church of the subgenius

1111
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,940
and the old out of time control labs

1112
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,940
Orally transmitted

1113
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:36,680
diseases

1114
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,020
At the low price of

1115
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,400
$10 or $1

1116
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,100
per track

00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,800
Worst f***ing excuse for music I ever heard

1118
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,660
Voice in your earlobes with the

00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,200
sweet sounds of

00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,000

00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,900

Well, the Bob Dobbs is a real nice guy

1153
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:08,060
And many many more

1154
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:11,700
Send a dollar to the p.o. box he'll get you high

1155
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,780
Spend money, gain slack

auditorium

1157
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:18,120
Spend money, gain slack

1158

Praise Bob!

1166
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:06,180
And there on the distance is the greatest emerging tile of all time.

1167
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,980
The emergent tile that without him, none of this would be possible.

1168
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,980
The emergent tile, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1169
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:28,120
Brothers and sisters, if you could just give, just spare, just a drop of slack, perhaps it is just a few hundred dollars in your wallet.

1170
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:34,200
Perhaps it's just a little bit of something, a little bit of your soul, a little bit of slack.

1171
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,960
If you could just offer that to the Reverend.

1172
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:44,620
He has worked his dick to the nubs, trying to, all of his dicks, in fact, he has worked all of his dicks to just bloody stumps,

1173
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:50,820
trying to make sure that Bob's word has been given out there, that Bob has reached every one of you.

1174
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:57,740
And just, if you could find it in your heart of hearts, just to send Reverend Stang just a little bit of your slack, brothers and sisters.

1175
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:02,800
He so needs it. He cries at night, thinking of all the work he has to do.

1176
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,740
All the work that his slaves...

1177
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,440
Master J.R. Bob Dobbs throws upon him.

1178
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:13,700
He is, he has the worst and the best boss in the world in J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1179
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:20,660
But Dobbs is the hard taskmaster and poor Ivan Stang, poor Ivan Stang is trying so hard.

1180
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:27,160
So if you could find it in your hearts, brothers and sisters, come down to the main stage right now and grant Ivan Stang

1181
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,140
just a little bit, just a little bit of your spare slack.

1182
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:35,040
Please brothers and sisters, just a little spare slack. Maybe it's a beer.

1183
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:35,940
Maybe it's a free beer.

1184
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:43,460
Maybe it's something, but poor Ivan Stang may not make it through the night without your slack love, brothers and sisters.

1185
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,860
And still you damn rewardians just sit there.

1186
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:52,620
Look at him. He's begging for your help.

1187
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:58,620
He's a broken man. Broken like Bob's pipe.

1188
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,420
Grant him some slack, brothers and sisters.

1189
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,760
Yes and praise Hazel.

1190
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:12,540
It appears that Hazel is going to do the right thing and she is going to grant Ivan Stang just a little bit of her slack.

1191
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:19,860
Brothers and sisters, follow the lead of Hazel. Follow the lead and go the right way and grant, grant Ivan Stang slack.

1192
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,740
Please brothers and sisters, keep in mind, keep in mind, let me just say this.

1193
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:29,080
If you don't want, if you have something where you don't feel like, like Ivan Stang deserves your slack,

1194
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:34,060
just remember that Ivan Stang is a conduit for J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1195
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,300
He may only be,

1196
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,160
just a little conduit.

1197
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:41,220
And in fact, brothers and sisters, I should add, every one of you are a part of Bob.

1198
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,460
We are all just a section of Bob.

1199
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:44,600
A small section.

1200
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,440
Perhaps, perhaps you're just the pinky nail of Bob.

1201
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:51,680
Perhaps, perhaps you're just the very tip of Bob's penis.

1202
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,740
But brothers and sisters, I have a sad story to tell you.

1203
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,900
Because poor Ivan Stang,

1204
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,720
Ivan Stang is the asshole of Bob.

1205
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:05,220
And feel sorry for Stang, for he is stuck as being the asshole of Bob.

1206
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,420
And he needs your assistance.

1207
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,920
Cause Lord help us when Bob gets a hemorrhoid on the asshole of Bob.

1208
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:15,320
Please, don't let Ivan Stang become Bob's hemorrhoid.

1209
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,880
Please, please see it in your heart to help out Ivan Stang in his time of need.
