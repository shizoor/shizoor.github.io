1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
You say, what about your host? I don't want to delve into that, but I want to give you something that blesses my heart.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,760
Here's Bob.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,340
Ow!

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,480
What the hell do you think you're doing?

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,800
Superior mutants.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,540
Repent!

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,560
Quit your job.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,360
Take off!

9
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,380
The world ends tomorrow.

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,040
And you may die.

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,280
Well, no, probably not, but whatever you do, just keep listening.

12
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,560
The Church of the Subgenius could save your sanity with...

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,880
Are we controlled by secret forces?

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,040
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

15
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,560
Do people think you're strange?

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,420
Do you?

17
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,080
Then you may be on the right track.

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,260
Are alien space monsters bringing a startling new world?

19
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,280
Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet.

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,060
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,420
This is it. The only faith that promises action.

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,280
Thrills!

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,380
Success in sex and business.

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,520
Get all your slack and more.

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,800
Reverend Ivan Stang presents...

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,460
The Hour of Slack.

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,080
Slack.

28
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,400
We, the jury, find the defendant guilty.

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:11,500
Guilty.

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,140
Guilty.

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:12,940
Guilty.

32
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:13,680
Guilty.

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,520
Guilty.

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,660
No! No!

35
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,180
Guilty!

36
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,160
I'm not me, I'm...

37
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,800
The Subgenius.

38
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,160
The Hour of Slack.

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,060
Click.

40
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:24,820
Click.

41
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,580
Click.

42
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:33,580


43
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:33,580


44
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,440
Click, click, click, click...

45
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,660
...click.

46
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:35,920
Take off.

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,060
For a proceso ol XXIX you have no Euro.

48
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,880
Switch with yours.

49
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,380
Problem.

50
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,900
Ruins.

51
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,700
Super- beam.

52
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,760
Cow ï¿½ Hoff Maid.

53
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,680
What?

54
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,440
Got anything in it?

55
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,280
Too fat?

56
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:54,700


57
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,980
You soon realize that they lead you inexorably toward the suspended waffle iron,

58
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:14,040
where butter melts across burn grates which penetrate the moist batter of buckwheat and julienne.

59
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,040
The game has begun.

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:28,120
Projecting your tongue into the crevices to soak up the savory enticements of public restaurants

61
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,720
where hobos stare through windows into adjoining boutiques,

62
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:41,460
you spot a man in a clown suit making popping and clicking sounds

63
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,720
on the roof of his mouth.

64
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,100
Would you go on, please?

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,980
You shouldn't have asked if you knew how to operate the game in silo,

66
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,920
because it was apparent and you've been paying any attention.

67
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,440
But you refuse through obstinance and recalcitrance,

68
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:11,900
and a general inability to comprehend that which does not contribute to the satisfying afterglow of your most recent bowel movement.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,740
And...

70
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,760
And yet, you persist.

71
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,000
My slave, Anna Schwa, a salesman,

72
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:23,420
who forgot to bring his watch and who asked for these nuts over and over again until you forced his sweaty goddamn face

73
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,200
down into the scalding toilet over the edge of a back of his morning.

74
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:29,880
You ranted,

75
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,140
petripped down the cross-horset chain,

76
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,980
poked at your grandmother's forehead,

77
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,500
and she screams of mercy.

78
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,960
I can't get enough of Super Golden Creme.

79
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,580
From the very same God who promised salvation of Jews only,

80
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:49,720
you must at least prostrate yourself before them and roll around in the stench of your own despair.

81
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,400
Neighbors pointed and laughed over the big event, sir.

82
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,220
Then made a baseless insinuation about the large, rubber fist that burst out of the driveway

83
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:09,880
and rose to a vantage point which permitted its unfunly zones to rain down anguish and pain.

84
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:16,800
And whatever shreds of decency remain in the world of plywood nailed irrationally to the genitalia

85
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:25,580
of those who might protect you from a fungus that grows in the minds of anyone who has ever held down a high-paying job with a solid benefits package.

86
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,580
You never asked for directions,

87
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,780
and nobody knew you were lost.

88
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:39,240
Why did you expect to find anything besides a horribly disfigured clone?

89
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,980
Walter Mondale!

90
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,700
Despiculating Porta Cavern where genocide was once celebrated by the party hat people?

91
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,160
You've answered the question that nobody asked.

92
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,120
You've slept with the women who had no other choice.

93
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,520
You've entered the realm in which you thrive,

94
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,480
requiring no skill, initiative, or imagination.

95
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:14,600
You have become adjacent to the latex gerbil.

96
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,020
You are, you are, adjacent to the latex gerbil.

97
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:28,360
You are, you are, adjacent to the latex gerbil.

98
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,680
It's too late to stop, Bend the

99
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,000
You are, you are, adjacent to the latex gerbil.

100
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:05,380
You are, you are, adjacent to the latex gerbil.

101
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:05,560


102
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,460
You are, you are, adjacent to the latex gerbil.

103
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:25,760
The Rudy Schwartz Project, adjacent to the latex gerbil from the album of the same evocative name.

104
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:34,040
Tonight, the music is all new and the yakery is all old, puzzling evidence from KPFA Berkeley

105
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:47,540
with Philo, Hal, and Puzzling, and the late Don Joyce, and from WCSB Cleveland with Lone Cow Dave, Chaz Smith, Dr. Halla, and Dr. Sinister, as heard here.

106
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,760
We are back. We are back. Going strong. We got our guests here in the studio.

107
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:03,360
We've got Sacred Scribe number, I don't know what the number is.

108
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,020
273.

109
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,400
273. It's always either 273 or 278.

110
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,080
I'm Sacred Scribe number 273.

111
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:21,000
The prior 272 actually came to pretty bad ends, most of them.

112
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,060
I've lasted longer than most.

113
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,600
I don't know exactly what to attribute that to, except for the fact that J.R. Bob Dobbs was killed during my watch.

114
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,020
So maybe it's been easy.

115
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,540
Easier on me.

116
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,280
He's been killed a few times, though.

117
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,760
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. He came back.

118
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,500
It's like killing Daffy Duck, practically.

119
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,660
He can't be done.

120
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,980
Those Christians talk about how their savior died and rose for them.

121
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,960
Jesus only died and rose once.

122
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,080
Right, right.

123
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,100
Well, that's a lot.

124
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,600
I mean, we don't mean to demean his achievement.

125
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,520
I mean, somebody has to come first.

126
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,860
True, but I mean...

127
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,080
And he wasn't really even the first, but he had the best publicist.

128
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,800
Definitely.

129
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,600
Yeah.

130
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:04,600


131
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,260
Apollonius of Tyana did it.

132
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,960
Yeah, who knows about him?

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,640
If you haven't seen Seven Faces of Dr. Lowe recently, you're out of the loop, dude.

134
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,260
This is also with me Dr. Howell.

135
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,240
That's right.

136
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:25,960
Dr. Howell and Owl, the toast of stage, screen, and radio, and that game Half-Life.

137
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
Oh, yes. I recognize your voice immediately, actually.

138
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,780
I keep waiting for you to say, I'm waiting here for my colleagues.

139
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,920
Why do we all have to wear these ridiculous ties?

140
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,520
Those must be lines from the game.

141
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,360
Yes, they are.

142
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,280
Yes, yes.

143
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:46,240
The secret passwords of those who know them, signifiers of a special and hidden bond.

144
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,460
Yep.

145
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:57,440
Well, we went to a devival in the neighboring state of Indiana, in the town of Indianapolis.

146
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,760
There weren't no Indians, there weren't no Apples.

147
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,120
I don't know what the hell they're talking about.

148
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,300
Just sprawling.

149
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,480
Just a plain, dreadful, urban waste.

150
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,700
Well, and the club.

151
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,780
Well, yes, and the club, yes.

152
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,920
And it was full of girls.

153
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,760
And the girls, yes. The girls.

154
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,200
And those beasts. Lots of beasts.

155
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,920
True. Beasts in Hoofhorn and Scalyhine.

156
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,500
The horrendous exemplars of nature gone haywire.

157
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,900
Now, new!

158
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:32,840
For a limited time only in the Western Territories, get a free Mole Man Wiener Whistle with any purchase of a Moley Man brand mole meal,

159
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,020
or squirming dog food.

160
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,360
Or a bounty brand mole man trap.

161
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,660
Offer not valid in Retribution Zone.

162
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,600
Hello, Bob, this is Father Guido Saraducci, formerly Pope Maurice of the People's Catholic Church,

163
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,700
and all of my fellow Popes from the People's Catholic Church.

164
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,860
Salute to the Church of the Sabbath Genius. Carry on.

165
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,360
Are we being controlled by secret forces?

166
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,760
Are alien space monsters bringing a startling new world?

167
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,840
Do people think you are strange?

168
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,360
Do you?

169
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,860
There is an answer.

170
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,020
I've been constantly, and I hope dispassionately,

171
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,980
considering this very problem.

172
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,440
I have come to the unalterable conclusion that man is unfit as yet

173
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,000
to receive such knowledge, such almost limitless power.

174
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,020
An invisible being that cannot be disintegrated by atomic fission.

175
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,620
That is our God.

176
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,980
That is a scientific impossibility.

177
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,340
There's your answer.

178
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,320
It must have been renewing its molecular structure from one microsecond to the next.

179
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,480
Trapped in your cage of only three dimensions.

180
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,060
Take it down now.

181
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,140
Take it down.

182
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,120
We're scoping this entire life through a meddling idiot.

183
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,100
A meddling idiot?

184
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,080
It's always Abe's brain that could contain the secrets of the Krell.

185
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,420
Reason.

186
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,380
As if reason would be the key.

187
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,000
They could hardly have understood what power was destroying them.

188
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,100
As if reason could turn as quickly as a watch can turn the hand of death.

189
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,620
You have got to reason.

190
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,460
That's the reason.

191
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,720
You could hardly have understood what power destroyed them.

192
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,500
You sent force secret media down to murder them.

193
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,460
You know, I just don't think I've ever given me a chance to be more than a man.

194
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:02,460


195
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:02,460


196
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:02,460


197
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:02,460


198
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,260
You're a broken ashes man.

199
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,780
For miles and miles we found a stream and...

200
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,500
Well, like it was all pink.

201
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,440
Yeah, and it was slimy, but we drank and...

202
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:18,880
Where it moved, we cupped our hands and we took as much water as we could in because our gills were already expanding and the mutations were starting to happen.

203
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,020
We knew it wasn't going to be easy, but we tried...

204
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,040
Oh, to have fun along the way.

205
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,780
Any way we could.

206
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,120
Our sensations were expanded.

207
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,280
Not much more.

208
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,380
The pain was more and so was the joy.

209
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,000
And the pleasure.

210
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,680
So we...

211
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,200
We advanced ourself along those lines.

212
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,260
He who thought unpleasurable thought was unfit.

213
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,440
He who thought painful thought was unfit.

214
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,520
He who was painful was unfit and was excluded from us.

215
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,440
Or else we would perish from our own suffering.

216
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,180
Sure, ma.

217
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,000
Sure, pal.

218
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,080
B.

219
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:02,560
O.

220
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:02,880
B.

221
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,600
D.

222
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,100
O.

223
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,420
B.

224
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:04,840
B.

225
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,420
S.

226
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:05,880
S.

227
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,320
Yes, there is.

228
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,920
Y.

229
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,320
Well, if we can think.

230
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,940
As long as we got our brains, we can think.

231
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,500
Oh, they'll get that too, George.

232
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:14,860
You'll see.

233
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,180
I'm actually excited about the new $20 bill coming out this fall.

234
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,000
The ones with the peek-a-boo view of Andrew Jackson.

235
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,060
Oh, yeah.

236
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,600
Isn't that like the fashion 20?

237
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,260
Oh, yes.

238
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:25,260


239
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,380
You can hold them up to the light.

240
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,060
They fluoresce and you can hear a little tune played.

241
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,200
Yeah, I remember that.

242
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,360
To defeat the scourge of counterfeiting.

243
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,160
Mammon comes in pretty colors now.

244
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:41,820
When are they going to come out with those Tamaguchi bills that you have to feed and care for as long as you have?

245
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,080
Oh, Lord, another responsibility.

246
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,120
The future was supposed to be easier.

247
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,600
I don't understand why we have to make everything harder and harder.

248
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,740
Like to operate your telephone, you need an instruction manual thicker than a phone book.

249
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,420
Far larger than the actual telephone.

250
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,980
Well, this isn't the way Hugo Gernsback said it would be.

251
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,840
No kidding.

252
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:08,000
The only thing that really is up to snuff in the future is special effects in movies about the future.

253
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,940
Oh, those are way better than I ever expected to live to see.

254
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,100
I don't agree with that, actually.

255
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,300
I mean, some of them are pretty good, but...

256
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh, you're a kid.

257
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,540
You don't know.

258
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,680
We were weaned on Ray Harryhausen movies.

259
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,440
On the analog special effects.

260
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,240
Depends on how far back you're talking.

261
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,000
You are on the air.

262
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,440
Yeah.

263
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,060
Can you guys play the savage revenge of Helen Keller?

264
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,500
I wonder what Helen Keller would think of that music if she were alive.

265
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,180
She could sense the vibration on her skin.

266
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,560
Well, it might give her a good gut feeling.

267
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,220
Yeah.

268
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,840
Yeah, she was a filthy commie, actually, is something they don't really teach you in history class.

269
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,480
I was aware that she was a very angry child.

270
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,380
Enlightened and progressive individual.

271
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,500
Into polyamory, way ahead of her time.

272
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,700
She could take on whole teams of...

273
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,500
She was very violent.

274
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,980
Had cricket lights.

275
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,220
Had lighters.

276
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,980
But these days...

277
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,700
She liked to break things.

278
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:10,000
Well, it's only records, because, of course, she couldn't hear them.

279
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,920
She would always fall and...

280
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:19,740
But she did learn to communicate and to become a writer whose words reached millions.

281
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,360
People used to trip her a lot.

282
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,680
No, no one would do that.

283
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,120
Because they liked the old girl.

284
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,220
They liked her, you see.

285
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,500
She had that quality of likability.

286
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,640
And so you'd just like her, and that was that.

287
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,800
Unlike some people.

288
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,280
When you see them, well, you have the opposite.

289
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,860
I think I'm one of those people.

290
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,680
With the woeful countenance...

291
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,580
Listen, I hope...

292
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,240
They call it the Mark of Cain.

293
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,360
God's brand.

294
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,680
To show the incipient evil.

295
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,980
I think I got that.

296
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,380
It's written as plain as day, right on your forehead.

297
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,460
As large as life.

298
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,020
As big as a barn door.

299
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,240
And there's no way you can scrub it off, neither.

300
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:12,020
Now, I don't know if I've even come close to answering your question, but you are connected, and you have a chance to ask a question.

301
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,060
Oh, hello?

302
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
So ask if you have the stamina.

303
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,500
Oh.

304
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,880
Well, I guess the caller doesn't want to ask a question.

305
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:26,840
Nonetheless, like a green shoot of a plant that only blooms every 100 years,

306
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:33,820
this brief interval is open to those who want to ask questions and will receive answers.

307
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,720
Of course, I have to say, I don't claim to have any supernatural powers,

308
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,740
but you might be surprised at how I resolve your uncertainty

309
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:51,440
and tell you that the keys that you lost are in the left hand of the top drawer of the chest of drawers in the garage.

310
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,000
We make absolutely no claims to the accuracy of these answers,

311
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,020
but we do have answers.

312
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,820
We have answers aplenty.

313
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:03,000
What we don't got is questioners, so come on, you sons of...

314
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,400
I won't even say what you all are.

315
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,780
You just don't have it.

316
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,020
Who's gonna fight the next war?

317
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,560
By God.

318
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,280
Dr. Howell, where is Uncle Wilbur's real will?

319
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,900
Well, now, I'm glad you asked me that question.

320
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:24,320
Of course, the will that was probated is everyone's idea of the real will,

321
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,980
but just between the two of us,

322
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,360
between you and me and the gate post,

323
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,580
there is an opportunity to retrieve another will.

324
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,880
So I'll see you about that opportunity when we're off the air

325
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,540
and we can do a little bit of private business.

326
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,680
We've heard of your exploits even as far away as Dobstown.

327
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,360
Not the long ways from here, kid.

328
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,040
The hallucinations were externalized.

329
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,520
I might not forsake you for all the slack I must pursue.

330
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,560
You can't be hired cheaper and I know what I must do.

331
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,820
Gain in slack and power.

332
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,800
Every day.

333
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,320
Why won't you slam that look-plate on my way?

334
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,280
We're entering new dark ages.

335
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,820
Won't you come and turn the page and switch off this conspiracy machine?

336
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,700
I'll take an extra dose or two and look to you

337
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,460
and pull me through until that final day of reckoning.

338
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,560
Fine!

339
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,020
Well, that was a close call.

340
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,080
My plan has always been present and unlit...

341
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,080


342
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,120
Your plan is rendered flat.

343
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,120


344
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,120


345
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,140


346
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,180
Are you sure you'd be up for it?

347
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,440
Yes, ma'am.

348
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,440
How grumpy of me.

349
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:49,860
I'm sorry.

350
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,800
Better think about what you are now...

351
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,980
Time may know its worth.

352
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:55,980


353
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,400
I'm not forsaking you for all the slack I must pursue

354
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,500
Get me higher, cheaper, and I know what I must do

355
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,720
Gaining slack and power every day

356
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,300
Why won't you slip and look plain on my way?

357
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,920
We're entering a new dark age

358
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,060
Won't you come and turn the page

359
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,760
And switch off this conspiracy machine?

360
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,560
I'll take an extra dose or two

361
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,720
And look to you and pull me through

362
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,320
Till that final day of reckoning

363
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,600
Thank you, Reverend J. Cobblestone,

364
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,980
for that brand new track, Till We Meet in Dobstown.

365
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,720
Now, back to Radio Synesthesia.

366
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,500
Actually, right now,

367
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,740
we're in what's called Safe Harbor.

368
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,760
We can say certain things so long as we...

369
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:58,900
I don't know.

370
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,740
Somehow, there's some kind of weird distinction

371
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,620
between indecency and obscenity.

372
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,280
We can air indecency, but not obscenity.

373
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:12,020
Dodd-blangit-blag-stabbering-flag-baggin-snag-drag-or-baggin-snag-or.

374
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,740
Shalik-kund-da-la-day-ba-soya.

375
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,820
Hick-da-min-dick-a-honda-sock-da-boom-da-lady-yoo-hoo.

376
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,860
And that applies to each and every one of you out there.

377
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,140
I wonder if that covers all languages.

378
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:23,780
Ma.

379
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,860
Yeah, she wears combat boots and swims out to meet troop ships.

380
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,440
Cut your belly open and make you look at the black stuff you got in there.

381
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,560
Better to throw the food in the street than give the kiddies too much to eat.

382
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,640
But better belly burst and split than good meat spilled.

383
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,840
Well, since nobody seems to be taking the bait

384
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,180
except that same guy over and over again,

385
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,440
once again, that speaks volumes about the character of that caller,

386
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,340
the fact that he keeps taking the same bait over and over again.

387
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,100
They don't want to do anything.

388
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,360
They don't want to think about anything.

389
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,820
They just want to hear some tune.

390
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,060
Pour like water through their wearied brains.

391
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,160
I got a tune we need to play, actually.

392
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,140
A tune?

393
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,700
This is the world premiere of a song called Slackman.

394
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,340
Let me tell you how it will be.

395
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,440
Pleasure.

396
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,840
The saucers drop for free.

397
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,840
Because he's the slackman.

398
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,920
Yeah, he's the slackman.

399
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,680
Bobby Stowe, the Yeti past.

400
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,920
Pig boys, they are all a guest.

401
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,540
Because he's the slackman.

402
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,960
Yeah, he's the slackman.

403
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,200
If you hate your job, then quit.

404
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:04,820
Get slack.

405
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,300
If you got no friends, he's got your back.

406
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,000
If you're feeling down, you don't need to fight.

407
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,520
When you're down to the bottom, hold your mind on track.

408
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,800
Hold your back, slackman.

409
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,320
He's the slackman.

410
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:43,880
The tables, they'll turn around.

411
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,480
Planet X will soon be found.

412
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,540
We'll soon be found.

413
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:53,540


414
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:53,540


415
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:53,540


416
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:53,540


417
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:00,340
Cause he's the slack man, oh yeah he's the slack man

418
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,180
If you must die, here's what to do

419
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,360
Jump in his pipe, let him smoke you

420
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:23,480
Cause he's the slack man, oh yeah he's the slack man

421
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:32,440
But his friends, they know his name is Bob Dobbs

422
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,700
Bob Dobbs

423
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,480
Bob Dobbs

424
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,540
Bob Dobbs

425
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:15,880
Bob Dobbs

426
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,620
Bob Dobbs

427
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,440
Bob Dobbs

428
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,940
You can do this by playing with yourself every night.

429
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,960
I'm playing with myself now.

430
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,180
I wouldn't stop and save it just for the night.

431
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,060
I find if it's good at night, it must be good all day long.

432
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,520
Then, before you go to sleep,

433
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,460
play with yourself some more.

434
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,460
...of what you wish to accomplish following playing with yourself.

435
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,140
Well, I... I... Do I have to...

436
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,920
I've got to play with myself to know what I've got to accomplish.

437
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,660
It's the only way I can wrench it from my memory, so to speak.

438
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,400
And request your subconscious mind to work during the night

439
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,040
playing with yourself to achieve your purpose.

440
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:27,040
And I just pull it out of my self, so to speak, as it were.

441
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,420
And verily, though I say unto ye,

442
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,480
were that in something that I said,

443
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,120
then I say it again,

444
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,780
with that which I said forthwith.

445
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,840
...the victim emitting shrill, agonized,

446
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,640
playing with myself, with my pocket stun guard,

447
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,120
to keep me safe from myself,

448
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,240
because if I get carried away, I could hurt myself.

449
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,080
Well, now, don't run with those scissors.

450
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,660
With this Tennessee toothpick of mine, you can't be too careful.

451
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,560
Boy, don't wave that thing around too close, you know.

452
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,000
That's just...

453
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,440
And notice it's got a deluxe ink pen attached.

454
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,200
Well, okay.

455
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,460
All right. Be a show-off.

456
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,760
I can draw in both black,

457
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:10,840
black,

458
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,260
as well as red.

459
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,780
Well, I never had no education myself.

460
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,100
And look at the way it folds up

461
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,900
and fits in its specially designed pouch.

462
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,160
So smart, so chic, so hip, so pop.

463
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,280
I call it Big John.

464
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,520
How you say?

465
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,060
Incroyable.

466
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,820
It's a legend in steel.

467
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,640
I salute you on both cheeks.

468
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,040
Oh, thank you.

469
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,820
And now one over here.

470
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,980
This shall be your medal.

471
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,820
And one here.

472
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,500
Blackjack.

473
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,900
He wanted me to perform the osculocytosis,

474
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,060
and I was the first to be able to do it.

475
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,280
I had to think fast,

476
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,560
or be forever inducted into his fiendish devil cult.

477
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,620
I don't feel well.

478
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,660
I think I'd better lie down on the sofa over there.

479
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,620
Call it a fiendish devil cult, if you will,

480
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,660
but I call it a birthday party time.

481
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,880
You weren't supposed to hear my inward meditation there,

482
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,580
but I agree, it does have the semblance of a party.

483
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,300
Why, it's a mirror butt fantasy

484
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,680
with a dragon banging your head.

485
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,660
As I said, I think I need to go lie down over there.

486
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,900
I hope you'll excuse me for a minute.

487
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,760
Futuristic fantasy.

488
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,480
Furniture fantasy such as this can't be bought at any price.

489
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,760
David, what would you say if I told you I won $1200 this afternoon?

490
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,920
I'd say you're mighty lucky.

491
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,560
I can tear my lottery ticket up, I guess.

492
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,400
And I'm going out with you tonight.

493
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,660
But you had a theory about luck.

494
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,800
I know you've got some cash.

495
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,320
A little bit earlier, Colonel.

496
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,080
A theory that the concept of fairness is basically unfair.

497
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,960
You know that's sincere.

498
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,760
I mean it that way.

499
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,260
Okay.

500
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,500
Security plus.

501
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,980
Something you can't buy.

502
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,580
A price barrier such as this on these stun guns

503
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,020
is broken by Bud K.

504
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,100
Everything you can buy in a store and a little bit more.

505
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,580
Hey, how about that, Bud K?

506
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,280
Believe it or not.

507
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,780
They sell 11th century Mongolian knives

508
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,300
for less than $10.

509
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,100
Man, they've got some...

510
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,860
Believe it or not.

511
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
They've got some killer...

512
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,880
Look at this thing.

513
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,260
I love this one, man.

514
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,140
What's that, brass knucks or some horrible...

515
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,380
It's a sword with like spiked knuckles on the sword.

516
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,720
Blade at both ends.

517
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,160
Now you know that people who buy this stuff are...

518
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,740
It's just a killing thing.

519
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,040
Really big softies with beards who would never ever...

520
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,580
They walk around, they wouldn't hurt a fly.

521
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,240
If they saw a fly on the end of the knife in such a way

522
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,100
that all they had to do was just impale it,

523
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,320
they would just, you know, let it go.

524
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,820
At least that's what we tell ourselves

525
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,480
for our own comfort and reassurance.

526
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,540
But the other alternative is too awful to believe in,

527
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,580
which is that actual aggressive psychos

528
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,140
buy these dreadful and readily available weapons.

529
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,260
Not big soft...

530
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,080
Why don't...

531
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,660
It seems wrong.

532
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,580
Why don't they market these to the crazy weirdos?

533
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,400
They'd sell more of them.

534
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,620
There's only a few big softies with weapons

535
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,760
that don't want to kill,

536
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,860
but it seems like there's lots of people out there

537
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,540
with weapons that want to kill.

538
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,760
One must have the willingness to use the weapon

539
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,440
no matter how one is armed.

540
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,460
This classic favorite becomes a contemporary fad

541
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,520
to carry around your black razor.

542
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,240
Ew, put it away.

543
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,300
You know, some people are just...

544
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,340
I always like to caress the weapon.

545
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,780
And yet for me, the gas turbo pocket torch

546
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,640
packing powerful heat is the only weapon to buy.

547
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,700
To become more successful.

548
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,680
Well, a different...

549
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,140
I'm powerfully successful as an assassin with my...

550
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,420
Three.

551
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,080
Track down any prey.

552
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,220
It stands to reason an omniscient God,

553
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,540
omniscient God of infinite wisdom.

554
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,420
Would design certain organisms

555
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:52,220
with sets of biodegradable bones

556
00:28:53,280 --> 00:29:00,140
nestled in a soft and pliant dripping frontal hole

557
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,640
which serve to mash the flesh of other organisms

558
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,780
into a soft digestible lump

559
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,580
which can pass through...

560
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,740
Conduits of pulsating tissue.

561
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,060
Here's the new laxative advance

562
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,060
for fast relief of temporary irregularity.

563
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,900
It's new Ceratan Plus in capsule form.

564
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,560
Conduits of pulsating tissue.

565
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,620
Conduits of pulsating tissue.

566
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,640
Which transform the digestible lump

567
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,900
into an excretable bromance.

568
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,460
And it's a new laxative advance.

569
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,280
Riddled with bacteria.

570
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,900
Riddled with bacteria.

571
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,760
Capable of spreading a disease.

572
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,480
Thank you, thank you, omniscient God.

573
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,620
Thank you for this lumpy brown mass.

574
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,620
Thank you, thank you, omnipotent God.

575
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,880
Thank you for these bones implanted in our softened...

576
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,620
...bonded bones.

577
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,340
...bonded bones.

578
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,320
Intelligent Design there by the Rudy Schwartz Project

579
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,960
from one of the two new albums.

580
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,040
The background music here is from his other new album,

581
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,820
Frop Music.

582
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,040
Collages have been mostly by Lemur,

583
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,800
but there was one by Miss Star Sistar.

584
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
And now this.

585
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,860
Oh, uh, someone's at the door.

586
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,380
Dr. Ivan Stang ran down, around and around

587
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,180
the narrow castle tower stairs,

588
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,520
toward the door to let in whoever has just caused

589
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,820
the flashing light to appear.

590
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,140
Dizzying array of things disturbing.

591
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,560
Yeah, those, those things that shoot electrical bolts

592
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,320
that are inside those big glass things.

593
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,560
I don't understand what they do,

594
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,520
but they're very impressive and very high-tech looking.

595
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,680
I had to turn the bottle,

596
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,340
a miniature sitting in the bottle,

597
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,060
or candor or whatever it is.

598
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,520
Oh, so candor.

599
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,180
Yeah, so...

600
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,980
To make your nighttime...

601
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,280
That was why you ran downstairs.

602
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,140
It wasn't because we had a special...

603
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,140


604
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:08,980
It's like, uh, yeah,

605
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,040
it was supposed to be nighttime for them a long time ago,

606
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,860
and nobody had turned the jar away from that.

607
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,920
It's like an egg.

608
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,240
You gotta turn an egg.

609
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,080
Right, exactly.

610
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,780
They won't have any more little baby candorians in there.

611
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,100
You know, if they did come out and get big,

612
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,020
they'd all be, uh, incredibly super powerful.

613
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,960
So, uh, they deserve to be kept on ice.

614
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:28,400
Right.

615
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,960
This college radio station happens to have

616
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,540
the bottled city of candor.

617
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,420
It had to end up somewhere, like Oswald's rifle.

618
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,220
We have that, too.

619
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,680
You know, these things just come, uh,

620
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,860
one way or the other,

621
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,000
and they end up in the collector's room,

622
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,580
trophy room, whatever you want to call it.

623
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,700
That Manlik or Carcano ain't worth a hooey.

624
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,540
No, but it's a historical souvenir.

625
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,940
And, uh, this here is, uh,

626
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,320
supposed to be, uh,

627
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,020
Cardinal Richelieu's pessary, it says.

628
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,660
But it's hard to tell.

629
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,740
This brown, shrunken thing, I...

630
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,580
It's difficult.

631
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,880
The years have not been kind to this artifact.

632
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,980
You know, I understand, uh,

633
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,580
they also had an example like that from Rasputin,

634
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,200
the mad monk.

635
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,000
When he was a monk, I didn't know if he had a pessary.

636
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,140
We've got, uh, uh, Jack Ruby's can opener.

637
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,540
No kidding. We have it.

638
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,840
And John Dellinger's can opener.

639
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,600
Yes, it's, uh, four and a half inches longer than Ruby's.

640
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,900
But, uh, you can see it right here.

641
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,480
It's part of the object collection from the subgenius movie.

642
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:34,540
Oh, God. Keep it in the bag.

643
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,980
Keep it in the bag, man.

644
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,260
Well, that's a church key that has opened many doors,

645
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,220
I want to tell you.

646
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,380
See, we have these things. We collect them because...

647
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,580
It's this Coke bottle that says fatty Arbuckle on the label.

648
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,260
Oh, don't knock that pubic hair off the end.

649
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,060
That was the subject of a celebrated, uh, court case,

650
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,040
uh, Arbuckle versus Arbuckle versus Arbuckle.

651
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,960
But, you know, he was exonerated all three times.

652
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,720
Well, that's not what history remembers, though.

653
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,500
No, because history prefers the sleazy reek of a good story.

654
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,780
You can get more of that here from WCSB.

655
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,520
Hey, you better look out.

656
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,800
Hey, you better look out.

657
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,100
O-O G-O-O-N

658
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,440
Y-Y-G-O-O-N

659
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,620
Y-Y-G-O-O-O-N

660
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,560
Y-Y-G-O-O-O-N

661
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,340
Y-Y-G-O-O-N

662
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,640
Y-Y-G-O-O-N

663
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,040
Thank you.

664
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,120
Thank you.

665
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,580
Thank you.

666
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,520
Thank you, Reverend Squalus Friday,

667
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,060
a brainwasher

668
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,440
called Brainwash.

669
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,820
Now, some ESO Swamp Radio

670
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,440
from Bold Knights of Yore.

671
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,700
Shave where the electrodes go down.

672
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,800
Just shave where we tape on.

673
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,980
Can I connect?

674
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,040
Yeah, tape that.

675
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,580
Turn it up.

676
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,080
Turn it up.

677
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,860
Turn up the electrode.

678
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,180
The...

679
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,600
I like that new knob you've got, Dave.

680
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:29,460
That's gay.

681
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,800
What?

682
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,320
Are you gay?

683
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,060
We're the happiest people

684
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,360
you could ever hope to meet.

685
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,040
That's right.

686
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,740
The plastic inserts

687
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,820
are not only made for body fun,

688
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,560
but for mental fun as well.

689
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,840
Enjoy this geriatric form

690
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,060
of genital sex.

691
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,760
Gay is too square for us.

692
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,820
We're yagged.

693
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,680
That's right.

694
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,380
Three-sided genital sex.

695
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,160
The wave of the future

696
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,080
is here now.

697
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:57,880
Well, today it can...

698
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,280
Well, we're pendrusted.

699
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,700
We're sexuals.

700
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,180
Oh.

701
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,020
We are pendrusted.

702
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,600
Sexuals.

703
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,300
Much the way Dr. Pangloss,

704
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,040
who used to say

705
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,120
everything is fine,

706
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,340
my beloved can eat.

707
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,700
He used to...

708
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,780
Explain that to me

709
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,300
a little bit more.

710
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,780
We can only get off

711
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,940
on another planet.

712
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,380
We're pendrusted.

713
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:14,880
We're sexuals.

714
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,960
We can only get off

715
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,460
if when we get off Earth.

716
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,380
But we also...

717
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:19,460
Speak for yourself.

718
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,040
When I'm a bisexual,

719
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,060
when they buy,

720
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,900
I come and ride.

721
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,540
Well, personally,

722
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,840
I just like cabbage rolls

723
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,160
and like a feisty old lady

724
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,800
down by St. Helen's Church.

725
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,320
Yeah.

726
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,240
I know you have to go see

727
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,880
a cockfight to get warmed up, right?

728
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Well, that's not what...

729
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,960
You can't really get excited

730
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,480
unless you've seen birds kill each other.

731
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,580
What are you guys talking about?

732
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,880
Oh, we have no idea.

733
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,020
Remember.

734
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,240
People watch the line on drinking

735
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,440
to make sure you have alcohol and fire

736
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,740
on every level of your home.

737
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:46,760
Remember.

738
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,440
If someone in your household

739
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,380
smokes under the influence of fire,

740
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,360
you must be aware of Ontario.

741
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,460
Remember.

742
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,480
I'm a dangerous drinker.

743
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:55,840
Remember.

744
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,600
There's more to responsible drinking

745
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,200
than alcohol and fire

746
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,700
on every level of your home.

747
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,100
Hey, yes.

748
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,640
Coming at you.

749
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,120
Bob saves.

750
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,900
Bob saves those who help themselves.

751
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,440
He saves those who help themselves

752
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,860
to the inventory and sell it.

753
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,020
Bob saves the best salesmen of his flock.

754
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,000
Dispensations and indulgences,

755
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,280
papal ships and doctorates.

756
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,020
Forgiveness and blessings dispense.

757
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,120
Bishop Riggs and hay wagons.

758
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,540
Hay wagons and we can have fun out there

759
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,080
at this ingenious film fest.

760
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,600
Drive in, camp out.

761
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,700
Flood, water, and three-step parade.

762
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,820
You said the films were terrible,

763
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,340
but I don't know why we should adapt

764
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,580
these pink critical standards.

765
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,140
Films may be great examples of bulldada

766
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,240
and quite entertaining.

767
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,480
Well, I don't think terrible is a bad term.

768
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,860
Did you enjoy the films last time?

769
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,660
Absolutely.

770
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,340
Have they...

771
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,020
Blood and Guts science fiction monster movie?

772
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,160
Cannibal Holocaust I didn't like that much.

773
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,760
But how about Abbott and Costello

774
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,200
being chased by the monsters and the...

775
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,180
The Cannibal Holocaust was a little unnerving

776
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,580
when they took that turtle apart.

777
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,260
Well, you know, when you turn turtle

778
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,260
it automatically causes a certain...

779
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,160
But Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein.

780
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,360
I love that one.

781
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,320
That's a good one because in it

782
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,220
it shows that the monsters are all in cahoots.

783
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,700
I think we should stick to it.

784
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,520
There is a cabal or conspiracy

785
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,420
of the monsters against the humans.

786
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,140
And of course,

787
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,640
this makes you want to root for the monsters

788
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,040
who were vastly outnumbered by the humans and normals.

789
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,600
I think I'm going to have a moratorium

790
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,460
on animal torture movies at our film festival.

791
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,560
Yes, even though we'll be consuming

792
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,100
edible animal products,

793
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,700
we will not view more animal stuff films

794
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,120
or tobacco films.

795
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,240
That makes them much more palatable

796
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,700
to the modern American...

797
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,400
Which is highly palatable,

798
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,600
particularly when fried and fricasseed.

799
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,220
Let's not beat around the bush.

800
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:57,600
All I know is that...

801
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,060
All I know is that...

802
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,080
All I know is that...

803
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,080


804
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,120
All I know is that...

805
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:58,700
When you fry it,

806
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,520
put a lot of butter and sugar on it,

807
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,220
it's going to taste good.

808
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,500
Oh, no sugar for me, boss.

809
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,940
I got epizootis.

810
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,740
You got epizootis up to maxis,

811
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,880
then you're going to have to have

812
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,340
the crassiest day shack and frack.

813
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,840
And we've got some of that.

814
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,840
We're going to take the...

815
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,460
I got my lumbago.

816
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,260
We took the big syringe

817
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,400
and we extracted the viscous fluid

818
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,200
out of the middle of your lumbago.

819
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,540
You can just put that thing back in its case, Sonny.

820
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,260
I don't need that.

821
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,120
And that's one case where the cure is...

822
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,640
is worse than the disease.

823
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,140
Well, that's what some people say.

824
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,540
Now, let me be sick

825
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,420
if that needle has to come anywhere near me.

826
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:33,640
But wait.

827
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,340
I'd rather not...

828
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,360
Will you be the last, Bob?

829
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,020
Someone has to, my friend.

830
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:39,520
Hi!

831
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,980
And when the last subgenius but myself

832
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,280
has ascended on those pleasure saucers,

833
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,920
I will be in the lead of the end.

834
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,200
Yes, I'll be there in the lead myself

835
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,820
when those packs of untamed subgeni run amok

836
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,080
in this sick gut blowout

837
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,260
party witcher society.

838
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:57,880
That's the only thought

839
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,940
that so many rogue subgeniuses

840
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,080
could be turned loose at any single...

841
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,120
That's the only...

842
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,800
That's only the hierarchics

843
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,980
of the subgenius foundation.

844
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,220
The subgenius foundation is garment.

845
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,280
That's the tip of the rogue iceberg

846
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,580
of real-world apathy.

847
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,160
Many cults require you to wear

848
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,600
special underclothing or...

849
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,420
But not us.

850
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,840
We desire you wear no clothing,

851
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,600
if possible.

852
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,780
Depending on who you are,

853
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,080
I mean, when I initiate certain subgeniuses...

854
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,620
If you've got strange appendages

855
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,040
and gelatinous, corpulent flesh,

856
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,060
we may ask you to leave your clothes on.

857
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:27,620
Exactly.

858
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,940
Now, at subgenius clenches

859
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,440
and other meetings so far...

860
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,440
We'll be clenching freely

861
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,060
in the woods before long.

862
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:34,980
Well, uh...

863
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,340
Clenching and wrenching

864
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:36,660
are butt cheeks together.

865
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,600
The ones who ought to keep

866
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,100
their clothing on,

867
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,440
remove it,

868
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,440
and the ones who everyone

869
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:41,600
would like to see...

870
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,840
Turning water into gasoline.

871
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,540
...sky-clad, as it were,

872
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,180
resolutely keep their clothing on.

873
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,140
Why stop at wine?

874
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,500
We need to shake up

875
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:49,540
these meetings and...

876
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,080
We turn some of the water into wine,

877
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,000
and once we're drunk,

878
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,800
we turn the rest of it into gasoline

879
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,000
and drive away.

880
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,380
...a more satisfactory result.

881
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,240
So that certain, uh,

882
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,440
key subgeniuses

883
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,760
in important executive positions

884
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,280
to be able to view

885
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,800
a parade of young

886
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,300
and comely postures

887
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,400
who would naturally be applying

888
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,920
for the full procedure

889
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,560
of initiation and qualification

890
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,440
in which the day was tied.

891
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,540
The Nazi hell creatures

892
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,040
and other dwellers in the woods

893
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,960
are not only capable of performing,

894
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:22,980
but to...

895
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,520
Think of those special underwear

896
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,080
that you don't have to wear.

897
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,240
Yes, it's true.

898
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,520
That is part of my ordination

899
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,540
as a deacon in the Church of the Subgenius.

900
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,960
Those special phylacteries

901
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,020
that aren't required.

902
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,840
No prophylaxis will be necessary

903
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,320
since the subgenius test is non-methylacine.

904
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,000
Did I say awake?

905
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,360
Fully awake?

906
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,280
In an eighth millisecond of slack,

907
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,280
I said fully awake.

908
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,120
But not much,

909
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,300
because my argument

910
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,000
to educate these said parents

911
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
is often causes the result

912
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,360
to be quicker

913
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,400
than one might have planned.

914
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,600
This is a normal byproduct

915
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,220
of the interchange

916
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,600
and should be enjoyed.

917
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,300
Thanks to the Puzzling Evidence Show.

918
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,040
Dr. Philo Drummond

919
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,580
was a regular on that show

920
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,340
for many years

921
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,000
after he was in the St. Louis band

922
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,140
The Swingin' Love Corpses.

923
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,560
Heard here opening a live show

924
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,280
with their best song.

925
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,780
Gentlemen, you're coming to

926
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,840
The Swingin' Love Corpses.

927
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,240
Woo!

928
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:55,860
Whoo!

929
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:56,240
Gotta say ya'll.

930
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,660
You think this song is silly

931
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,260
Ah-hoo, wah-Ro

932
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,640
Girlin' out and?-t partnership

933
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,460
Come back here

934
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,780
Yeah-he's wearin' JESS

935
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,180
Add-on

936
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,820
All of her like-à¸à¸³

937
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:22,800
Our eminence

938
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,780
Come on now

939
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,340
Come on

940
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,480
Five minutes.

941
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,780
You can't even wait a minute.

942
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,280
It's taking too long.

943
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,000
I mean, you should have finished that business before you got here.

944
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:33,800
I told you.

945
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,820
What are you doing?

946
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,040
You're still dragging your unfinished work behind you.

947
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,660
And it sounds like it's going good.

948
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,560
I tell you, this is really professional.

949
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,440
Sorry.

950
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,360
Sorry about that.

951
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,420
Just forget everything you saw up to this point.

952
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,800
And we're the swinging love corpses, and we're just going to start over.

953
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,880
And as an apology to all of you beautiful fans who came out here tonight,

954
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,120
we're going to start with our best song.

955
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,320
This is our best song.

956
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,740
This is the best song that we do.

957
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,320
Oh, pretty mama.

958
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,700
Oh, baby.

959
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,280
This is our best song.

960
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,660
This is our best song.

961
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,420
Oh, pretty baby.

962
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,080
This is our best song.

963
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,220
This is our best song.

964
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,440
Pretty baby.

965
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,840
Did you know that, Reverend Howell, compared to slack,

966
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,880
nirvana is like having your eyeballs slowly gouged out with a carrot peeler

967
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,440
while receiving electroshock?

968
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,400
I know, man.

969
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,680
It's so difficult to tell and explain to these people

970
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,060
because most humans, or normals as we call them,

971
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,940
cannot conceive of experiences lying outside the ranges

972
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:33,940
set apparently etched in brass by their own nervous system.

973
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,120
It just amazes me.

974
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,800
Ten hours spent basking in the white light of the ultimate

975
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,100
is like ants crawling up your nose and burrowing deep in your sinuses

976
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,960
while you're dying of thirst in the desert.

977
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:47,940
In relation to an eighth of a second, an eighth of a millisecond of slack.

978
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,760
We cannot do because it lies outside.

979
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,860
Outside of our experiential base in this universe.

980
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:59,800
But by imagining that there can be such a thing as a new color,

981
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,420
Now, do you think it's possible for normals to know they have slack?

982
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,320
One has essentially performed a leap of faith,

983
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,820
and this act of faith itself is sufficient.

984
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,280
Do you have to realize slack before you can know slack,

985
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,860
even your own innate potential latent slack?

986
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,380
You notice it gradually, don't you?

987
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,020
This is the way it came for me.

988
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,480
You learn to surf.

989
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,460
On the luck plane.

990
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,160
To be an art mom.

991
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,880
Not to have a job and somehow to get by.

992
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,820
To understand in all things.

993
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:34,600
Well, don't forget the working, the power of working a mindless job for years and years

994
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,840
just to pay for your non-artistic talent.

995
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,880
This is me.

996
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,080
That's me.

997
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,820
For me, I took the other path.

998
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:48,720
I had to work for the conspiracy because my art was one which couldn't be expressed.

999
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,160
You're what they borrow.

1000
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:51,660
You keep gathering up.

1001
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:52,880
Yes.

1002
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,800
We had to trickle down as opposed to bubble up.

1003
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,640
And meet in the middle where we performed our gap analysis

1004
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,900
only to find that we were wanting.

1005
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,360
I bring in a camera and I want to borrow some money on that.

1006
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,480
Well, we'll let you bring...

1007
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,600
If you bring your camera in, we'll let you borrow the money

1008
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,580
while we use the camera to take pictures of you

1009
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:17,820
in compromising positions.

1010
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,140
You are indeed his superior in every way.

1011
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:20,740
Because you are his superior.

1012
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:25,120
You are that elusive being a subgenius.

1013
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,860
While you pay us more money not to distribute said pictures

1014
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,440
to your family and loved ones.

1015
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,980
The answer is incredibly simple.

1016
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,480
I'm sorry we put these tight deadlines on you like that, but...

1017
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,460
A subgenius is what the word subgenius really indicates.

1018
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,620
Don't try your crying. Your crying doesn't work on me.

1019
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:49,320
Therefore, let us pause and parse the word subgenius.

1020
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,380
Okay, well, you gave me the slack.

1021
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:50,720
Subgenius.

1022
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,340
I wouldn't give her.

1023
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:51,600
Genius itself.

1024
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,160
Thank you.

1025
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,160
The first syllable is the common prefix sub.

1026
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,520
India is divided among Hindus, Sikhs, Mohammedan, and Jain.

1027
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,780
This is commonly given to mean under.

1028
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,800
Each picture in God, man, and the universe.

1029
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,920
Just as a submarine goes beneath the surface of the waters.

1030
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:12,420
And to be subhuman or subnormal is commonly considered a defect.

1031
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,200
You know, I'm trying to explain something here,

1032
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,940
and you're interrupting me, but what is it?

1033
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,400
Your name is Steve Wilcox, and you're a pedophile.

1034
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:21,700
I'm St. Louis.

1035
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,820
You're entirely wrong. That's not my name.

1036
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:27,360
I've never been anywhere near St. Louis, and I'll thank you not to interrupt me

1037
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,320
when I'm attempting to make an important categorical distinction.

1038
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,320
Steve Wilcox.

1039
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:35,640
And the second half of the word is newsflash KPFA.

1040
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,120
Oh, my God.

1041
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:38,860
KPFA?

1042
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,820
Someone made the connection.

1043
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:41,600
KPFA.

1044
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,060
Thank you very much.

1045
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:43,620
What?

1046
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:49,100
But you say pedophile as if it's a bad thing.

1047
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,780
This is how rumors get started.

1048
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:54,660
Well.

1049
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,080
But I like this one.

1050
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:01,200
A peddling pedophile peddling his pedicycle by the side of the freeway

1051
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,160
in direct contravention of our society's laws and morals.

1052
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,020
Come on, let's make fun of pedophiles.

1053
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,920
Well, I was just trying to explain what the word subgenius meant.

1054
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,120
Well, same thing, right?

1055
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:13,920
It's real.

1056
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,420
First they say you can't get married, then they say you can't be a pedophile.

1057
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:20,460
There is that sense, of course, and it is a very real sense.

1058
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:20,860
I just don't get it.

1059
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,060
And we will come to that in time.

1060
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,620
Well, when I joined up, they told me.

1061
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,760
That you would have knowledge of those.

1062
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,660
Okay, where's that Steve Wilcox guy?

1063
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,420
We want him to call back right now.

1064
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,760
There was a youth corps.

1065
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,560
A youth corps of subgenius youth.

1066
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,980
We want you to call back right now.

1067
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,720
I've met some of them, and they are the brightest, most well-scrubbed, shining faces in the rising generation.

1068
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:49,620
They are 100% true blue Americans whose red blood pulsates in them.

1069
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,020
I understand.

1070
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,500
The rhythms of John Phillips.

1071
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,520
Let's not make fun of pedophiles.

1072
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,180
I'm not making fun of them.

1073
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:54,860
We won't do it anymore.

1074
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,460
I'm saying that to be a...

1075
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,320
Well, you know, it is getting perilously close to the end of our program,

1076
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:07,540
and perhaps we should leave these distinctions in the theoretical murk in which they are temporarily enshrined

1077
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:16,400
and no longer pick over what a while earlier in a less normal time slot seemed to be wholesome provender.

1078
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:17,560
I agree with that.

1079
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,160
But I only wanted to finish saying,

1080
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,060
what the word subgenius meant.

1081
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,260
I explained the sub part.

1082
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:23,520
Go ahead.

1083
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,200
You have five minutes.

1084
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,400
Now I've got to explain the genius.

1085
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:32,620
You see, everybody thinks that subgenius has something to do with intelligence or stupidity.

1086
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:36,840
And, of course, it has nothing to do with intelligence and very little to do with stupidity.

1087
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:46,380
But what the word genius means in this context is not the measure of intelligence or a supernormal intelligence.

1088
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,800
Instead, it means a spirit.

1089
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,380
As in genius.

1090
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,100
Genius loci.

1091
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:55,880
Or the genie who emerges from the lamp of the Arabian Nights.

1092
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:04,980
An elemental force which is a directing and guiding intelligence in our universe.

1093
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:09,600
And a subgenius is under his own genius.

1094
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:15,120
Not under the direction of the conspiracy, the opposing force,

1095
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,660
which wants the prototypical subgenius to work for a living.

1096
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,300
Yes.

1097
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:24,200
With the money, an illusion, widely subscribed to.

1098
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:29,480
Purchase not true slack, which a subgenius seeks as his birthright.

1099
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,420
But false slack.

1100
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,460
Manufactured by the conspiracy.

1101
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:38,320
Yes, the conspiracy wants him to work in a dead-end job to purchase the false slack,

1102
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,980
which will not produce true slack.

1103
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,960
For with the purchase of every tchotchke, palm pilot, and iPod,

1104
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,020
true satisfaction still darts away.

1105
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,360
Just beyond.

1106
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,040
It's true.

1107
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:56,180
The reaching, questing fingertips, as the grapes offered Tantalus in the underworld.

1108
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:56,980
The reaching, questing fingertips.

1109
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,220
Could never be grasped.

1110
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:03,440
And unless you want to remain a sufferer, just like poor old Tantalus,

1111
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,160
you have to drop what you're doing and become a subgenius and join us.

1112
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,800
Surf the luck plane.

1113
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,540
Be an art body.

1114
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,100
Quit your job.

1115
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:12,720
For Bob.

1116
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,620
Mooch off the world.

1117
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,740
Yes, it does owe you a living.

1118
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,360
And we can offer many varieties of proof.

1119
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,160
Right?

1120
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,500
Then contact us now.

1121
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:25,640
The address of our cult is still the same.

1122
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,980
The old address that it's been for many years in Dallas, Texas.

1123
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,200
And what was that address again?

1124
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:38,120
That address which is known throughout the land by far and wide.

1125
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:46,500
www.subgenius.com is your best and most readily accessible source for all of the contact information.

1126
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,800
Let it echo wild and free.

1127
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,960
And for those of you named,

1128
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,840
Steve Wilcox out there who are from St. Louis,

1129
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,700
I'd like to apologize for accusing you of pedophilia.

1130
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,760
I know, that was a gag.

1131
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,560
I hope you understand.

1132
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,300
I mean, not to be taken seriously.

1133
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:06,060
So, any of you other Steve Wilcoxes of which get confused with the other one true Steve Wilcox.

1134
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,940
Oh, a true Steve Wilcox would never get confused.

1135
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,660
Understand that that was just a joke.

1136
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:16,160
And they don't have to hold it against me later when they have that big whip in their hand.

1137
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,820
Did you see that cool car that was parked outside?

1138
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,540
The Don Gun?

1139
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,040
What?

1140
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,460
Man, that's a real luxury vehicle.

1141
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,900
It is a luxury vehicle.

1142
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,440
The giant fins of the bubble dome.

1143
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,500
It's a GM product, isn't it?

1144
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,620
Yeah, the tractor treads.

1145
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:34,620
That would give you an incredible purchase in any road condition.

1146
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,380
Don't you kid?

1147
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,720
You could drive over the bodies of people with that.

1148
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,360
Eight wheels on that thing.

1149
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,560
Really remarkable.

1150
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,300
Crushing skulls, much like in the Terminator.

1151
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,440
It must weigh a couple of tons.

1152
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,240
And it seems to have an antenna.

1153
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:49,380
There must be a satellite, a TV hookup, a hot tub, a salon.

1154
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,580
And, of course, the smoking room.

1155
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,940
And a barometric pressure reliever.

1156
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,500
The hyperbaric chamber.

1157
00:54:55,740 --> 00:55:03,200
I heard that it gets so large on the inside that it can actually has its own weather patterns.

1158
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,400
Oh, web patterns.

1159
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,220
Weather patterns.

1160
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,080
Storms, clouds.

1161
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,340
Like the Pantheon.

1162
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:08,840
Right.

1163
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:19,840
A tiny hole is in the roof, but no rain ever manages to wet the inhabitants because it evaporates in its long fall from the roof to the interior of the car.

1164
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1165
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:20,840
And look at this.

1166
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,560
Of the Astrodome.

1167
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,980
Rich Corinthian leather.

1168
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,460
That's Naugahyde.

1169
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,080
Stained to a doleful red.

1170
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,840
No, I believe this is actually leather.

1171
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,540
What was that other kind of leather called?

1172
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,440
The fake leather?

1173
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,740
It was Naugahyde.

1174
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:33,740
That was a different car.

1175
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:38,300
He was actually offered several cars, but this is the beauty that he finally chose.

1176
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,340
This is the nice swinging car.

1177
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:48,900
This is the one that has the fringe that goes all the way around and the little doggy head in the back that bobs up and down with the lights go on when he hits the brakes.

1178
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,940
He's got his skirt on.

1179
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:49,940


1180
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:49,940


1181
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:49,940


1182
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:49,940


1183
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:49,940


1184
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:49,940


1185
00:55:50,940 --> 00:56:01,100
Some details of a bow, some details with a Two-anukes diamond,mate.

1186
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:01,100


1187
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:01,100


1188
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:01,100


1189
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:01,580
Very, very old.

1190
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:01,580


1191
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:10,120
And a web...

1192
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:10,220
Badia.

1193
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:10,280


1194
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:10,680
Red.

1195
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:10,680


1196
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:10,680


1197
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:10,680


1198
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,180
You're looking at Verygard.

1199
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:14,440
Yep.

1200
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,360
And I was in a bad even

1201
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,320
with no door to put my watch.

1202
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,940
Don't get me wrong, I'll go somewhere.

1203
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:18,020
I already was.

1204
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:21,260
And just click on the link for some genius film content.

1205
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,780
And as Philo says, there will be gambling in the tents.

1206
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,760
There will be gambling.

1207
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:30,660
In the Lord's tent, we will gamble and frisk as we bask in the divine effulgence.

1208
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,960
Well, it's been great broadcasting at you, and I have to sign off now because I've got a pie in the oven.

1209
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:42,400
Otherwise, if these nosebleeds didn't keep me out of my dark, I'd be here broadcasting 24 hours a day.

1210
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,080
You can take that one to the bank.

1211
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,720
And I'm going to have to eat that.

1212
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:50,920
So, Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships, see, I'd just like to say it's been fine and done.

1213
00:56:53,060 --> 00:57:05,520
Don't let any pint-sized, sawed-off, chin-pot dictator tell you what to do because you're an American citizen of the United States with the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of a total imbecile.

1214
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,440
We interrupt this program to end it.

1215
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,580
It's the only way.

1216
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:24,840
It's been a puzzling evidence show, and say goodnight, Hal.

1217
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,620
Goodnight, my friend.

1218
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,900
Say goodnight, Philo.

1219
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,360
Goodnight, Berkeley and Northern California and the world.

1220
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,800
I'm not going to say goodnight.

1221
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:44,240
And now the children are placing the Merkins on their chests to show that they're grown-up children now.

1222
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,340
It's...

1223
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:45,700
It's...

1224
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:45,700


1225
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,960
You have to live that over again.

1226
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,320
You can't get beyond this.

1227
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,860
I think we've gotten into a loop.

1228
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,940
And now the children's Merkin chest hairs are becoming...

1229
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,360
It's like a 14-year loop.

1230
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:56,140
Much, much larger.

1231
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,520
They're shaving them now.

1232
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:57,840
Shave your knees, man.

1233
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,080
Shave your kneecaps.

1234
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,900
And now they're appearing on the Internet.

1235
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:01,800
Shave your...

1236
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,720
Salvador Dali-Parton.

1237
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,100
Yeah.

1238
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:03,580
Hot...

1239
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,240
Close the...

1240
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,000
Shave kneecaps.

1241
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,500
Tuna cans.

1242
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:06,120
Yeah.

1243
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:06,840
Yeah.

1244
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,160
Turn off the computers.

1245
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,840
I'm waiting for this site.

1246
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,000
Hot shaved knees.

1247
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,080
Babes.

1248
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,620
Babes with hot shaved knees.

1249
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:20,340
Babes.

1250
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,940
I hate that candy-colored clown.

1251
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:25,740
He wear big boots and a big shiny hat.

1252
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:26,840
He think he know everything.

1253
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:28,960
Look, look.

1254
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,180
He never shine his teeth.

1255
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:30,480
Look.

1256
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,280
It's salami all day and you can't see it on him.

1257
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,600
Oh, my God.

1258
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:36,780
He's fetid.

1259
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,500
The metaphor for the conspiracy.

1260
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,000
That's the secret meaning.

1261
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,260
The fetid cowboy.

1262
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,760
A metaphor for the conspiracy.

1263
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:47,840
Into the maddening night.

1264
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,880
Is that a true thing?

1265
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,720
I saw this day.

1266
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,160
Or is Roy Orbison a twisted metaphor for the conspiracy?

1267
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:56,300
A silent prayer.

1268
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,760
Embedded in this song.

1269
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:59,880
If you wish to take the time.

1270
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,680
Play it backwards and forwards if you like.

1271
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,980
Examine it under the microscope.

1272
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,860
The commands are clearly there.

1273
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,540
The commands are clearly there.

1274
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,040
In dreams whispered in your ear.

1275
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,680
You dream of what you need to know.

1276
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:27,360
In dreams I talk to you.

1277
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,400
In dreams you're mine.

1278
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:40,500
All the time we're together.

1279
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,180
In dreams.

1280
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,040
In dreams.

1281
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:47,180


1282
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:50,720
In dreams we've taken each other.

1283
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:50,800
In dreams we'reè§£ä½.

1284
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1285
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1286
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1287
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1288
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1289
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1290
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1291
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1292
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1293
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1294
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1295
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1296
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1297
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1298
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1299
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1300
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:50,780
