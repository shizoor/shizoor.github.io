Now, what about me?
All I want for Christmas is the subgenius power of...
Subgenius Power of...
Subgenius Convention assemblages, collages, epics.
As we delve further into the history of the Church of the Subgenius, the first 100 years,
this is being done initially for the ongoing MaybeLogic.org online course,
but it is also being done for the grander glory of a later book, DVD set, I suppose,
and yes, yes, yes, we've been learning so many things that we forgot,
and so many more that we never knew.
It's interesting and inspiring to hear the fervor of the early doctors,
and in this particular episode, friends, we're going to slide back in time
into an admixture of the 1982 World Subgenius Convention in Chicago,
where the head was launched, where the church was taken over by the women, the Connie Tights,
and in fact, the head was launched onto the roof of the building next door
and then rescued later from the wino's nest by Buck Naked
and some poor retarded girl that he had picked up that weekend.
Friends, friends, it's exciting, it's deadly, it's dangerous.
It actually was dangerous, and it's surprising that so many of us survived.
Quite a few didn't.
And so, let us pull the lever and go backwards.
Back, back, now into the past.
When will you believe?
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.
This tape is copyright 1982 by the Subgenius Foundation.
The first step is that you make the art.
You know.
The second step is that you make the art.
The second step is that you mail the art somewhere.
And then you destroy the art in the mail.
You claim it on your chance.
The K.R. Bob Dobbs.
It's come now to us.
It's given us the true wisdom.
I say, fellas, I say.
Make the art, destroy the art, claim the art.
You will make much more of that art piece than you would have in any other way.
Don't you think it would be a good idea for you to turn the radio on?
If you turn the machine on.
Turn the machine on.
Turn the machine on.
Well, it is a beautiful...
...world out there, all right.
Take, for instance, the city of Chicago earlier this month.
It was filled to overflowing with Wookiees, Warlocks, and Japanese robots as thousands flocked to the annual World Science Fiction Convention at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.
But at the cheaper hotel across the street, a group of people too weird for most science fiction fans to comprehend were holding a little convention of their own.
These wackos call themselves the First Church of the Subgenius.
And they include...
...in their...
...to say the least, eccentric membership...
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
What do they believe in?
Everything.
Who do they believe in?
A mysterious character named Bob.
I'm sorry I haven't time for social obligations.
There is another world.
Who are they winning souls for, Satan or Jesus?
We are not, then, alone in our battle.
Indeed.
The rise and fall of Atlantis, the erections of pyramids and other monuments seen here,
which no slopeheads could build alone.
Oh, here they are now, the miracles of the Old Testament.
And all these...
Bob.
...and more events are so strictly interwoven in the invisible background war between Jehovah and the Exist...
Here we see...
...a man, the Barbarian.
Yes, it's true.
I work at night.
The Subgenius Convention is in a hotel in Chicago at this very moment.
They cannot get into the hotel. It started off as an innocent convention.
It has turned into the last holdout of the Subdini.
We're taking over these mics.
We're taking over.
We've got both heads in custody.
We have both heads.
Both heads.
Both heads.
Can we get these to go?
We're not giving them to him.
This is a patriarchy.
No.
We have to have both heads.
Nine demands.
Until we get all nine demands, both heads are not returned to this room.
No heads for both heads.
Nobody.
Shut that music off.
Put your hands on the radio.
A family doctor says you're just fine.
But you feel so dead all the time.
Well, people, you don't have to worry.
The job is a man.
Send your money and all is over.
Don't worry. It's deductible.
Well, people, you can forget your sins or forget your troubles.
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer has come to redeem us.
And I'm here to say that I don't want any more beer.
This next convention, we're going to have Kia, gin, vodka, mixers.
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer is the only thing that matters.
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer is...
All that we can comprehend.
And there's the head. I can see it now.
A moment of supreme power.
Okay, you're doing great.
We're standing over the head now.
And I just picked it up by the neck.
I'm holding it up.
Would you give it a kiss, please?
She kissed it.
She kissed the forgotten head that nobody else wanted.
All right.
She patted its head, scratched its hair.
We have a forgotten head!
We have a forgotten head!
Ready?
That's up in the city, going up.
Where do you want me, Head selection?
I like it.
Come on.


.

.

Make sure in heaven you have a substance based partner.
One day, as the story told in Bob Ecclesian, verse 3, chapter 26,
Lo, ye shall know that indeed doctors for Bob shall be as one,
and they shall leak their minds, and doctors for Wotan, Sally Murray,
victorious doctors for Bob shall become one and all, and have an all-in-one power.
And the individuals make up the separate alignments which be in the end.
The government doctors for Wotan shall align themselves to become one and all to the body.
The head is getting clear.
It's like seeing these cries.
It's crying, it cries.
What is this man?
While you're defacing the false head, all the time the real head, the original bonds head,
which has been in my bedroom since.
Eighth grade has been here.
You're all damned.
You're not going to burn.
You're going to burn with sparks through your eyes.
You're only the true head.
You've been lost by a non-trivenous, non-steed worshiper.
You ain't going to have the lips of Gabriel Burnett.
You're going to have to lock the head.
The true head.
The true head.
The true head.
The true head.
The true head.
The true head.
The true head.
The true head.
The true head.
The true head.


The problem becomes one of mission.
The sleazy reality of the present subcon has, I'm afraid, sunk the entire group into a
morass instead of a prophecy crusade.
The church of the subgenius was an order of scoffers and blasphemers dedicated to total
slack.
The end of mockery science, state of futuristics, mega physics, scatology, off for a proof of
work.
Got the picture?
No?
Well, let's try it again.
The church of the subgenius is the single most important organization of the 20th century.
Oh, there's one now.
A person asking somebody to kill him now.
Don't forget, the launching scene here of the bleeding head of the World Cup golfer,
a sacred relic long in the possession of Taylor Hypercleave.
Is there something wrong with the machine?
What?
Yes, I know, Doug.
The mega physics temple lodged with...
Sit down, Doug.
Sit down.
The church of the subgenius in Little Rock, the head was temporarily captured in mid-81
by a rival band of Trevinoists, worshippers of the false pretenders of the World Cup,
and the Palmer-Trevinoist war still rages at this very moment.
In fact, we have heard conspiracy rumors that the head might be, at some point during the
convention, kidnapped by rogue subgeniuses.
You think John Kennedy was killed?
Why do you think he went to Dallas?
He needed to join the church and disappear forever and become a part of the world.

He was a drunk living in Dealey Plaza.
It was the only way to gain his freedom.
A small price to pay for losing your groceries in the high noon sun of Dallas.
As my thoughts swing upward and inward...
I was born again and Bob made sure I died again and now I've been born a third time.
Born thrice.
So the rumors were true.
By the women.
By the women.
What you have to do to...
Praise Barbara!
I think, I think he's dead.
He likes to change the prop again.
They're telling what kind of dimension we're gonna find ourselves in when our eyes clear
from all this coughing.
This is the drug, I think.
Yeah, it is. I feel my head expanding.
Try and sit down. We're probably still just in the corridor.
Oh. Where are we?
This is the bathroom.
Yeah, big bathroom.
Who's that?
I can't tell. It just changes.
Look, look at that.

Listen.
It's the Slack Squad.
Hey, that's the Slack Squad, isn't it?
I can't talk. I'm trying to talk. I can't help it.
Bob!
Oh, what's going on?
Are we back down in that control inch thing?
It's the drug.
I know it's the drug.
I can hear that music.
I can't hear anything.
It's all hard.
You don't hear that music.

No, I hear voices.
Focus on Bob.
Try to imagine that your body is made of syrup.
Bob, count backwards from 83.
And then, you may now take your pill.
It reflects what we're feeling. Try to relax.
Okay.
They're not shitting at us.
No.
This is all the drug, right?
Uh-huh. This is the drug.
This is all just the drug.
Are you sure?
I am.
Who, you ask? Who is J.R. Bob Dobbs?
Who is?
J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Well, see, what you gotta understand is, like, Bob is not super intelligent. In fact, he's a complete fuck-up. But every time he fucks up, he makes a million bucks!
This is a restricted area.
You talking about us?
And the man sent some teenagers.
No, it's the drug.
He's speaking of the drug.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
What is that noise?
This is a restricted area.
This is some of the...
Me and Bob.
This is most technicolored problem I've seen in this entire time.
Holy shit.
If you get the Dobbs talent in time, it will happen there, and you won't want to miss it.
Here...
I know that, Frank. We've been singing that song for the last 10 years.
But it can happen here.
In fact, while you weren't looking, it did happen here.
Hi, hi, just go grab the phone. We're going to get it.
Look, we're going to get it.
You may risk becoming a weirdo.
At this point, we go to the subgenius convention.
We are live now. If you'll watch the monitor, you will be seeing Guy Dool.
Doug Smith and assorted other subgeniuses speaking.
We can see them there on the floor.
There have been rumors that the conspiracy wishes to interrupt the proceedings here.
We hope that there will be no such interruption.
The subgenius heads are now answering questions from the floor.
Right, exactly. They're trying to cover...
They didn't want us to know about left and right brain to begin with.
Or the forebrain.
The hindbrain.
These are the assorted holy ducks.
We just recently found out that X's do have four brains.
They have four brains that can work...
This proof is available in the rear of the convention area.
They revolve...
Up and down as well.
That's why they do not sleep.
That's in their physical form, which resides on planet X at all times.
We're not defeating them. We're wheeling and dealing with them.
That's what Bob's for.
Why defeat them when you can't guide them?
He's holding up one of four brains of the X.
He's a alien. He has a brain encased in Lucite that is left of the world.
The left of the screen. That is an alien brain that he has hold on to.
Whatever we want.
There's President Xandy in the background.
Asking for his mother or father, but they're so involved in the present problems that they do not see his home.
Just like the aliens training him in...
Here come the tiny subgenius elves marching around on the back of the stage.
They're the ones in the funny color.
Oh, they're gone now.
They disappeared just like that.
That's it.
Bob has slack.
Answering questions now from the floor.
Bob has slack. And even the Elder God...
Dallas Doug Smith.
...had trouble getting slack.
Yeah, they can't fight that.
We are, in that respect, we are equal to the gods.
Guy Duell using one of his rifles to push a...
That's the part of God that's in every man that you read about in the Gnostic scripts and everything.
Subgenius window is holy.
The thing that I'm wearing is just black.
The battleground of the gods is in us.
The gods are fighting out there.
It seems that somebody has thrown a tape he didn't like through the stained glass window in the church in the subgenius.
The gods against the Elder God.
But that thing can be replaced in just a moment.
There are two heads.
Now there are two heads.
There's a second, a tiny head and a big head.
No, that is the false head.
The only real head is the bronze head.
Sure, you can be...
You've been bowing down to a false prophet.
The only real head is the bronze head.


The only real head is the bronze head.
And the other is lucky enough to be fated to be in.
Doctors for Odin.
Me, Doctors for Bob.
Consider yourself thrice blessed.
For it shall be your salvation.
And now I guess I went out to smoke a coke in Florida and down here working.
But the hang I'm getting is that this is the most important thing that has ever happened to you in your life.
What is happening now will never ever be the same thing ever.
And I'm going to be using the arrow again in the brand new...
I've never seen a dope.
Maybe they've seen some spade or something.
Probably what I like is I can smoke a dope down in Florida.
If I have an opportunity.
Any place with any substance that I might, you know, want.
And it's probably good to do smoking.
I've never seen a dope down in Florida.
Rather than going in here.
I don't really particularly enjoy working here.
God, that was just one of the most violent drug sequences I think I've ever had.
Look at that.
It's just fading right back in.
All the body parts are just dissolving.
That's amazing.
Look at the hallways.
There's not anybody around.
And it's not even all gone yet.
We've still got some here.
I think I know just what to do with that.
Ah.
Well, look.
What about these girls you keep telling me about?
Look, Bob has, you know, just all kinds of little groupies and everything.
Something's happening here.
The women...
We're taking over these mice.
Somebody's taking over...
We've got both heads in cutting.
God, dissidents and subgeniuses have just taken over the convention.
Both heads!
Until we get these kids back!
A group of women have just stormed the stage.
They're trying to take over the...
They have, they have.
They've stolen the heads.
Until we get all nine demands, both heads are not returning.
Two dissidents...
No heads for nobody!
It looks like a group of women have stolen the bleeding heads of Arnold Palmer and are
now...
Two audience mice.
They're reading their demands.
Bob's jockstrap!
Bob's jockstrap!
Male sacrifice!
Male sacrifice!
Round of chili dogs!
No heads!
No heads!
Dick of Bob!
Dick of Bob!
Take back a 12-year-old dancing boy!
That request applies to all of you.







You're so nice.
So much he crashed into the side of the convention hall.
Male Rock and Roll!
Male!
Male Paramount!
Male!
We have the heads!
No heads!
No heads!
No heads!
No!
No, no heads!
No heads!
No heads!
No heads!
No heads!
No heads!

No heads!
No heads!
No heads!
Yes, I believe I can see Arnold Palmer showing up.
You mean he's alive?
Something did happen. No, he's not alive.
Temporarily?
I'm most honored at this point to say that we will be going to camera one on the floor live,
and we'll be catching the decapitation of Arnold Palmer.
This is Arnold Palmer.
Hi, golfers.
I'm Arnold Palmer.
We will do whatever we can.
Wait a minute.
Hold on, hold on, friends.
Hold on.
Bob said, before this convention started, he said,
if any of these cheap bobbies, these immature, pit-eye, pink-splained subgenius types
come out here and blaspheme my sweet name, then pee on my head.
Well, I saw it earlier this morning.
He hopped out.
He's getting a skin.
That's what I'm talking about.
Come on over.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Those are worth, I mean, well, they don't have a job.
There's no prize on them, yeah.
Nobody knows about them.
Look at that.
Good thing they don't.
These old Malaysian guys.
Just going to capture this.
Lost in time.
Scavenged the records.
That chief has, that chief has like 16 different navigational computers.
Sternos said you guys were worth going to build a catapult, but I guess that didn't happen.
Who was going to carry it?
Who knows?
That's another plan like Wellman's cardboard limousine for dealing claws over.
Yeah.
I am a smart extraction and have a maddening memory of the great and great subgenius.
I believe to give one of my bitty eyes.
I might give it all to the boy.
They have this thing where they give, they cut their nipples off.
Yeah, no more sweetness in life.
They're like, well, this is terrible.
Yeah.
The only answer is hot lead.
Eat a lot of lead or kill me.
Yeah, right.
Well, they, when they say or kill me, that means you're going to die.
That's it.
That's what it really means.
You know, when Daner says open the door or kill me, you know, you better open it.
I'm protected by the mark of the code in the spiral.
See, has, has Janer ever showed you that sort of stigmata on his back where the blood spattered?
Oh, man.
I've seen, I've seen.
I've seen.
I've seen.

I've seen a little body, I've seen little things run out of his mouth.
I've seen, I've seen, yeah, just kind of psychic ether, the little furry ones.

God, we're just faithless.
In all the time Dolphins have played,
it is unlikely that we have ever had a champion or a foe
who could move the chances out so well
and was so little afraid of taking them.
Will Arnold Palmer decide to take a few chances in politics?
Yeah, Arnold wins it!
The skills that he has in that kind of a career next.
Follow the mountains.
That bleeding head.
The is-ness of the head.
The is-ness and the what-ness and the all-ness.
And the whole being.
A generous sprinkling whiskey on the guy.
Yeah.
Covering the guy with whiskey.
He's drinking it.
That solution.
He's rubbing it.
Yeah, he's got the blood.
Yeah, he's got the prop juice.
Spreading the prop juice around the man's being anointed.
Look at that.
That's it.
And when the head is falling, then I say,
ha, ha, ha.
No head, neither head.
Ladies and gentlemen, we don't have anything else to go on screen right now.
We have to keep these people on screen.
I know that you are amazing.
No head, neither head.
No head, neither head.
Oh, now Zandy is upset.
No head, neither head.
No head, neither head.

President Zandy, that's that in the background.
Flying, attempting to scale the head.
19,000 foot head.
No head, neither head.
No head, neither head.

The entire convention has been disrupted by this renegade group.
No head, neither head.
No head, neither head.
No head, neither head.
No head, neither head.
This has to be as amazing as the attempted assassination of Bob late last year.
This is ayes, judикatie, an

I was born.
I'm going to get these damn people in prison.
I'll keep my��를, arrest her and take her.

There's heads every where. We've got no leadership at all. Right.
You can well imagine the usual situation.
Right, bleeding head good, wheel head good.
We're giving up.
We're just going to see if we can break these loose
and get them into the Gulf, the whole state.
There'll be a record inside, a little record,
so that you can play it and hear the songs and the prayers
and the beautiful rituals and hymns to Bob and the screams.
And there will be proof of UFOs and that kind of thing.
Yeah.
What about the Subcon 2 that was held recently in Chicago?
Could you tell us exactly what happened with the bleeding?
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
The World Subgenius Convention in 1982 was held in Chicago,
and the bleeding head of the World Cup golfer was launched.
Arnold's face spun through the air
and landed on the roof of the building next door.
So the world won't be coming to an end this year,
and...
Summer will last a little longer.
I think it's already over.
But the problem is the...
I don't know if you guys knew this,
but the women of the church of the subgenius overthrew the patriarch.
It's like I don't even know why you're talking to me.
You ought to be talking to the great masterous dominatrix,
someone else who's downstairs in her throne chamber of exclamatization
waiting for me to fix her a cup of coffee.
I see, I see.
Seriously, the women overthrew the patriarchy of the church.
We knew that.
At this point, it's all just a sham.
I mean, us popes and high-end predictables can pretend all we want,
but she's going to babysit tonight, you know what I mean?
I see, I see.
Well, how has the church changed then due to this new development?
I mean, the day-to-day life of the church...
Dad and Barbara is taking command.
Yeah, I see.
Bob's not really dead, but because you can't kill that witch.
He's now running in the back of the limousine.
You know, it's real confusing on this end,
just as much as it is on your end, as you can well imagine.
It's always been that way.
If you'll notice, one of the first gigantic shows we had there in Dallas,
the first one we put on, Jackie was not hit, and yet Jack was.
Of course, we in Puzzled Evidence have the actual photographs of Jackie being hit,
but she was, of course, hit, and there was an argument between people in the car.
Yeah, as I understand, she was climbing over, getting onto the back of the car
to make herself a better target, that noble, noble woman.
She was scrambling for a piece of her brain that was shot out.
And see, she got her brain, but we didn't.
Dallas is a friendly town, and we'll try to cooperate with the snipers here.
We need the trade.
We need the people coming in, and, of course, the hotels are all set up.
Now, you don't have to use school book buildings, warehouses, anything like that.
You can work right out of your hotel room.
Okay, and I just want a note to local callers.
We do see that you're on the board right now.
It's just that we want to complete this satellite call while the satellite's in the arc,
and we'll get to you as soon as possible.
Oh, hi.
Thank you.
Oh, we have more people there.
Hello.
This is who from Dallas?
Oh, hello.
How are you doing, JR?
I'm doing all right.
Doug, are you still with us?
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
We've got a conference call here.
JR wants to talk to you.
JR.
Go ahead and speak to Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
How are you doing?
All right.
Yeah, you said Dallas was a nice little town?
Slow?
No, nice little town.
Yeah, Dallas is a nice little hamlet, yeah.
Hamlet is a money town.
I want you to know that.
Money.
Well, we know that, and—
Why do you think I'm here, Daddy-O?
This is the money town for any religious cult worth its salt.
I'll tell you that.
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.
It's a sunny moment and you're feeling low.
You're hurt all over and you're moving slow.
Well, people, there's nothing that you should know.
Tune us in on the radio, Doc.
We've got charisma, we've got style.
Well, people, we'll make you feel better for a while.
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.
And here we are at the subgenius convention.
World subgenius conclave.
Next year, I think, they'll be called the world subgenius party.
Because the subwienies have pretty much given up, I believe, according to a spokesman on the organizational idea.
That's the maids, the hotel maids here at the Radisson.
Bob just walked by just a few seconds ago.
We didn't get him on camera.
I understand that is to be expected.
Oh, they're talking.
There's Bob.
No matter where he is, no matter what he's doing, two hours of exercise every day.
Bob's new health clinics are coming out pretty soon.
I think you should be seeing them in most major cities.
You've already seen the ads.
The conventioneers are in the background, some fighting, some having fun.
Almost all of them drunk, inebriated in some way.
It was so far, the convention has been much like the first convention for the 15th.
There seems to be no...
Here we are on camera seven.
You can see some of the rituals starting up.
We've got to bust out of here.
Some of the reporters...
Oh.
Not all of the reporters have the security clearance that I do.
Being as I am a publicity manager for Dr. Bob.
How about that's heavy.
Okay, here's a good one.
This one's real heavy.
Jerome Palmer taught his son to be more than just a good golfer.
A good golfer also had to be a certain kind of man.
In high school, for example, Arnie learned a very important lesson.
He missed a shot in a junior match.
He was very, very angry.
Arnie's face turned red and he picked up his golf and threw it over a bunch of trees.
Everyone who is observing us has fled.
They weren't listening to the words. That's the problem.
Don't pay attention.
They think they've got to get in some damn hell ritual musical rhythm.
And they don't listen to the words at all.
Oh hell, their minds on dancing.
They want to dance. That's exactly it.
They want to move their damn feet.
They want to be a little bit more serious.
Beer dancing.
Your modern day sex.
Oh yeah.
Faithless.
Universal creation.
Self-genocide.
Mutilation.
They have to see a miracle for proof.
They demand proof.
I demand a job.
Bob demands that we create those miracles.
Yeah!
But Mr. Palmer, what can we do next?
What can we do, Jerome?
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me.
I'm not going to do that.
Bob.
The alien myself.
Who am I?
PrAdam.

But, not ever.

Look, Jayner is going like, man, I want you to tape this later.
This guy, of course, really thinks he's going to be shoved right in it.
Yeah.
That's going to be it, right?
Okay, they put his head down on the block.
He's got his golf clubs.
He's got his iron.
He's holding the iron in his teeth.
This is terrible.
This really is.
Oh, look, he's putting one hand in his pocket.
Good Lord, like he does like it's real.
I do this every day.
This is the first time he's ever had American clubs on.
And now Sterno raises the huge scimitar.
That thing must be seven feet long.
And they're building to a fever piece.
He's got lead shot inside to make it go down faster.
Heal the head.
Bad.
Bleeding head.
Good.
Golfer must die.
Golfer must die.
Oh, look at that.
Oh, that looks beautiful.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
Now he's holding up the head.
It's bleeding, see?
Oh, it's still, yeah.
Okay, he's putting it back on.
Yeah.
There we go.
It bleeds on.
It bleeds on.
They're carrying the body off.
They do throw the body into the pipe.
They blow.
Look, it's bubbling.
It's bubbling.
It's just, yeah.
There you go.
There goes the body.
All recycled back into the EcoSport.
That's the neat thing about Subgenius.
Look.
Look at that.
You can see in the little mirrors you can see.
Yeah, there he goes.
Sterno really swings a mean scimitar.
And I like that.
I like the way he carries it in the guitar case.
I think that's a real nice touch.
Right on the slide.
Yeah, okay.
He's got a lot more traditional style.
Yeah, yeah.
There we go.
He's holding the head up.
It's still bleeding.
Uh-huh.
It will keep bleeding.
It will bleed for, until it needs to be done again.
And once the dolorous stroke is administered one more time.
One more donor.
One more.
Open his torso.
That's it.
You can't use your brain to think about your religion.
You go into war.
This is the law.
That is the law.
What is the law?
Some of these people have been using their brains to break the temple.
They use their brains.
He says, you put those boxes up.

They're going to be put up round.
You're fired!
So you go home.
So you go home.
And your mother's at the door.
And your mother looks up.
And she says, I don't care what happened.
Where's the ring?
What were you doing?
Smoking pot again?
And you think you've lost it all.
And there's no place for you to go.
You've got no job.
You've got no home.
So you've got to use your brain and make a breakthrough.
Every time they knock you down, you've got to get back up.
That's the real thing.
That's real.
Sex hurt.
Hell, these people think sex hurt means tying them up.
Hell, no!
You don't know what that means.
They're bruised by misunderstanding, reading meaning into sex hurt.
It means what it means.
Sex until it hurts.
Do it until it hurts.
Praise me for what I'm doing.
Praise the church.
And praise Bob.
I mean, it's simple enough.
You can understand that.
Love them.
Love one another until it hurts.
Anybody can understand that.
You don't have to go to school to understand that.
Take a little sore in your mouth.
You go to school and they take it away from you.
You look your way back.
You look your way back.
Then you're sure locked in the pit.
You've got to backslide.
Then you backslide.
Then you backslide.
Then you backslide.
You let go of the church.
Let go all the way.
Upside and downslide.
Slide into home.
If you want to avoid temptation, go at it.
Forticate like your very life depended on it.
By the way, I have a lot of pills.
And if anybody would like to take a pill, I'd like to give them a pill right now.
Come up and be anointed, friends.
Now, these are Dobbs-type pills.
That means that each one's got a slightly different grain to it.
Each one will hit you just a little different, too.
Oh, friends, let's get ready.
He's got the pill in his mouth, friends.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Oh, yes, friends.
Another sore save for Bob.
Oh, yes, friends.
They're rolling in the aisles.
They're having a spiritual experience at your expense.
Oh, yes.
Jesus had taken pills in church.
Had taken the nine-iron Ecclesian.
Five six.
Jesus had taken pills in church.
Jesus had taken pills in church.
As it says, the nine-iron Ecclesian.
Five six.
Jesus had taken pills in church.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
A little girl came up to me.

Crashed up on stage.
Ran over to me
and handed me a magazine article.
And the title of that article, ladies and gentlemen, is Bob's dead.
Hallelujah.
No, blasphemy.
Blasphemy.
If you think Bob is dead, just ask Connie.
Go on.
Get out of here.
Bob's dead.
It's true.
He's dead, sure.
My God.
My God!
Where's that near confidence?
...the President of this country can preach lies like this!
It's Bob's death!
It's Bob's death! Is he?
No!
Is he even a little sick?
No!
Well, maybe then.
It's Bob's death!
No!
Are we gonna have him?
Yes!
Yeah!

Kill Bob!
Kill Bob!
Kill Bob!
Kill Bob!
Kill Bob!

Kill Bob!
Jesus did take pills in church and it did kill Bob!

Those messages from the exes said on this paper, build a church.
That paper was a $10 bill.
And Bob went out and said, I want my army.
I want my army of subgeniuses.
So he went to the police station and he walked in there and he said,
how many of you people here will do whatever I tell you?
And three-fourths of them stood like this, one step.
And he looked at the other fourth who were going, hey, I don't know.
You're subgeniuses, he said to them.
He went into the Pentagon and he walked up to them and he said,
how many of you are going to stand with me in my army?
And they all rose their hands, except for three janitors.
And he turned to the janitors and said, why didn't you do it?
He said, well, I don't want to join an army unless the war is right and everything.
Bob said, you're with me!
And the Church of the Subgenius was formed.
Now this, this is the fourth time I've ever been on a stage in front of people in my life.
And Bob gave me the feeling to do that.
And he said, what do you mean by that?
And I said, well, I got something that makes me want to shout.
I've got this funk that like comes over me.
And shout all the time.




And it says, Mike, these people here are here for one reason.
And you are here for one reason.
And that is to be funkin', funkin', funkin' with Uncle Bob.
You better dance!
And he statedly, Michael Flores twisted the little empty Tylenol capsule apart.
A fiendish grin spread over his puckish little face as he poured the cyanide into the empty Tylenol capsule.
And he did that again.
Recapped it and put it in the.
along with all the others.
He, he, he, he thought to himself,
won't those innocent people with their headaches be surprised
when they wake up dead two days from now?
It was the voices in his head.
It's apparently like getting drunk or something.
Hold on, that was tentatively a convenience.
He is perhaps the most picturesque of all the subgeniuses here.
He tentatively has a very high standard of what is not art
and is trying to make sure that the convention itself
is kept.
He's probably killed, if not the convention itself,
at least a few of the doctor men, the evil doctors.
There he's pumping up his synthesizer.
It's an air controlled electronic synthesizer.
Oh my gosh, he hit stono!
What the hell is playing?
I thought I saw one.
I thought I saw one.
I don't want to cry.



I thought to sing this drivel.
Close my eyes and beat me away.
I mean I like the music, but what's this,
is done?
It's just I and I.
I saw one.
I thought I saw one.
I thought I saw one.


I didn't care what you thought of mine.
Well, it is legal around here.
Roundabout.
But of course.
Wisdom does not depend on drugs.
Yay, the sacred herb,
Havafrop, Zipulop,
that is found on the graves
of the Tibetan wise man
in those small white bundles.
Well, that's the kind of thing
that many, and I don't mean those...
Opium?
The white bundles that you find here in...
Oh, opium.
Well, that's getting to golf.
There you've got Arnold Palmer,
the head of the sub-division.
About whom we used to be apathetic,
but now we just don't care.
Right.
We'll be seeing the bloody head
launching in just a little while, actually.
We have a lot.
We have several Arnold Palmer training films, too,
for those of you into hardcore rough
and green maintenance.
Right, hardcore rough and tumble,
Arnold Palmer.
Later on, we'll be having, on VideoCam 3,
the best out of two of three falls
with Arnold himself.
Volunteer girls from the audience
will be coming up and taking their turns with Arnold.
So why spoil the beauty of the thing
for legality's sake?
Remember, kids, nothing is illegal
if 100 sub-guinea businessmen decide to do it.
That's right.
And we had that wonderful tape
where you saw the young, naked, nubile maidens
wrestling with Arnold Palmer's bloody head.
No heads, no heads!
We want heads!
Both heads are being held hostage
in one room in this hotel,
and nobody knows which.
They're in the closet, they're in a sack,
and you don't know where.
There ain't no bobs here.
They're all wits.
Go on!
No heads, no heads!
There ain't no bobs here.
They're all dicks.
Dicks for Bob.
No heads!
No heads!
No heads, no heads!
I've been the possessor of the head
for the past, oh, since I was in 8th grade.
It was originally my dad's head.
Dottie came up to me and asked me
if she could borrow the head for a minute,
and I said yes.
But I say, wait a second, wait a second,
I say, you can have the head!
You can have the head!

You can have the head!
I don't want it!
You can have the head!
It's a curse!
It's a horrible curse that's been with me for the past
all my life, that I absolved myself
from Spots Building for the head!
The curse be on you!
You are the curse of the head!
You are the curse of the head!
Flores is trying to make a,
Flores is desperately trying to break up
with the cash register where the people
have been paying to get in.
He's not the only one, but he's,
looks like he's got a gun, yes,
but they're holding him off.
They're trying to, they're,
Flores is convinced, from what I can understand,
Flores set this up with tentatively inconvenience.
All the violence, the nudity, that was LSD
that was being given away,
Buck Naked was giving away capsules
with very, very high doses of LSD inside them.
We believe it's LSD.
I don't think it's the legendary prop.
Oh, wait.
Hold it.
We'll have to tune out now.
Is Senator Kinney here for the interrogation?
I guess not.
Well, you guys, this is the panel discussion.
Science does not remove the terror of the gods,
especially the elder gods.
The gods seem to get crankier with age.
More forbidding all the time.
More vengeful.
More dangerous.
Get your damn foot off Bob's head.
Put your feet on Bob's head.
I got a case of boozeys up in the room,
and I figure we ought to lock them up,
go over to the science fiction convention,
and just kill them all.
Kill, kill, kill.
Kill them goddamn Delronda Hubbard's bag of wild maize.
We'll all lay there without acid,
sucking ass gunny,
and doing science fiction weirdos.
And poor earbugs causing illicit.
Yeah.
Who cares about edges?
Grandpa heard some strange things about William Shatner.
No, there will be no panel peeing.
It's not in the schedule.
Juvenile urination.
Is anybody out of trouble?
Nasty doctors.
Those doctors always talk about pee and gross stuff like that.
I'm talking real childish.
Childish doctors.
Doctors for stool examinations.
Stool examinations.
Bone cancer surgeons for Bob.
Species dissection.
Urologist surgeons for Robert.
X-ray technicians for Bob.
Yodelers for Bob.
Zit cream sellers for Bob.
Anthropologists for Bob.
Baby snatchers for Bob.
All right, the procession has started up.
They're reeling, the women are bringing the dead corpse of Sturdo Kiekever
into the, into the,
into the crematory.

Now, people are laughing.
I can't believe it.
They don't believe he's dead.
They think this is all a plot.
The Reverend Janor Hyperkleets from Little Rock, Arkansas
tried to make it all a little clearer to me
with his own explanation of his conversion
into the church of the subgenius.
They said this jar was my mind,
and then they poured it down a sink.
Run that by me again?
I, I don't know.
What do you mean?
Who got that?
Who got that?
No, we're going to try to find out.

stay at home, stay at home.
We're going to try to find out,


Come on, who's got the
Come on, who's got the
Come on, who's got the
Anybody got any Tylenol?
I just need a couple of extra straight tabs to get off.
I've got some of the 15-year-old Tylenol here.
Maybe if we soak up in that leftover Kool-Aid
from that other religious experiment,
we can have some luck with them.
Sounds like a Tylenol party, sure.
Sure.
I'm always up for a Tylenol party.
Because, you know, I don't want no Arnold Baller.
I don't want no Yarka Teaser.
I don't want no Sub-Dee-Dees.
And I predict that our local American doctors will go on strike
and be replaced by African witch doctors.
We're splashing liberation right around the world,
and we'll die to do it.
Everybody.
We'll sing a Arnold Palmer.
And he can set you free.
Bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.
He'll stand up for me.
Bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.
He'll stand up for me.
Bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.
Come on, sing up.
How are you going to start this war if we don't sing?
How are we going to start this Vietnam War?
It's put the church right down the middle, friends.
It's what the church needs.
Put the church right in twain.
Your cross, put it like a moon.
You're talking Trevino.
You can just back your party.
You're talking Trevino.
I prefer basketball myself.
They say he's a golfer.
They call Trevino a golfer.
I was watching TV in 1967,
Master's Tournament, third hole.
I saw him miss a shot about like this.
I couldn't believe it.
They say he's a golfer.
If this was indeed an extraterrestrial spacecraft
with living occupants,
it must have been very disconcerting for them
to cross millions of miles
of space, only to be hit on the head
with rotten orange.
These are subgenies.
Subgenies, right.
They grant wishes.
Well, kind of, yeah.
Yeah, right.
Or they give you spells.
They can bring on problems like sickness,
world problems, death, drugs, pain, perversion.
Or they can occasionally go out
and just get spaced out
and dingy, as the young people say today.
By 1950,
some of these characters were beginning
to spin their stories of fantastic conversations
with alleged space people.
Some of them expanded the stories
to include alleged rides in the UFOs.
Bob is trying to bring the end
of the world correctly, you might say.
He's trying to make it the end of their world instead
of the end of the world.
Because if the conspiracy is still in charge
when the Xs land, they'll snuff us
like we would shoot a dog.
We'll shoot a dog that's been hit by a car
on the side of the highway bleeding to death.
Whereas if Bob can get to them first,
maybe he can, well, being the saint of sails,
he's gonna be wheeling and dealing the fate of the Earth
with these beings that are so technologically advanced
they've gone beyond technology
and they're more like gods.
They wiped out the dinosaurs on a picnic
63 million years ago, which was about the same time
that they planted the seeds of the human race
and the subgenius race, which are, by the way,
two separate races.
Once again, the main point is slack.
That's the Reverend Ivan Stang talking there,
a more vocal member of this weird cult
who I interviewed in his hotel room in Chicago.
Well, whatever else they may be,
the subgeniuses are clever sleight-of-hand artists.
In the midst of my conversation with him,
he demonstrated something called time control
by suddenly throwing me back to Berkeley, California
sometime last year.
I think the most important thing that your listeners
need to know is that the Church of the Subgenius
is man's only hope for slack in these coming end times.
That's exactly why we're here in Berkeley tonight.
Now, what is this fabled slack once of you speaketh?
Slack, Bob, is, slack, I guess you'd say,
is the absolute and total absence of any stress whatsoever.
It's the highest state that man can try to reach
in his spiritual or carnal life.

So, we're here to spread the word of Dobbs,
which, of course, is the main path to slack that the people need.
If the last 50 years made such a change,
just imagine the New York of 1980
when everyone has a number instead of a name
and the government tells you whom you should marry.
Just imagine 1980.
Things are coming together.
Completely out of hand here at the convention.
Mass panic, roaring, heaving.
Now the security forces are attempting to clear the hall.
I want to thank the ladies for one of the best moves
that has brought this convention back to life.
The sex head war.
But you cannot get away from this power.
Just listening to what I'm telling you now
can be the turning point in your life.
Hello, angel one.
You will die.
You will die.
All she needs
is somebody who'll die.
Jeez, that's horrible.
Yeah, well, a decapitation is usually necessary
to join the church, to find yourself within the church.
But once the head is lost, the head is found.
That's right.
Bleeding head good.
Heel head bad.
That's right.
That's the Arnold Palmer cult theme
for those golfers out there
who may be interested in the Trevinoist theory
of lawn maintenance and green tending.
We'll tune in later for a live broadcast
from the 14th hole of the Pill Beach Golf Course.
Now back to you, Doug.
And we do want to differentiate
between the live Arnold Palmer,
the Trevinoist, and the Church of Vic Morrow.
Indeed.
Somebody who'll die.
I myself killed some 15,000.
We will discontinue the interview
to check the quality of the recordings.
We switch you to the 16th tee,
where we'll show you in slow motion
Arnold Palmer, U.S. opium champion.
Somebody who'll die.
And everything else is at subgenius.com
because this is the hour of slack
and it's the Church of the Subgenius
and our new official post office box.
Well, it's the old Cleveland Heights post office box.
Uh, the Texas Austin office had to move,
so now we're at post office box 181417
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118
www.subgenius.com
Where's that bucket?
Where's that bucket, Jones?
Turn it.
Hey, boy.
Hey, boy.
Hey.
Hey.
We're doctors for Bob. We're the band that has the musical questions.
Get large amounts of LSD and be combined with hard liquor to produce bad results.
And the answer is a resounding no.
You can just get off our fucking game, motherfucker.
