1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,340
Ray is putting you to sleep.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,220
To sleep.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,280
Relax.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:13,980
And sleep.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,380
Sleep.

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,480
Sleep.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,440
Good.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,780
Ray's had its effect.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,560
One tough, pink hombre.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,220
One tough, pink hombre.

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:29,360
Hombre.

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,880
One tough, pink hombre.

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,580
One tough, pink hombre.

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,960
I don't like the pink.

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,080
It's a little creepy.

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:37,580
Yeah.

17
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,640
I don't like the pink.

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,720
It's a little creepy.

19
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,260
Yeah, it's a little creepy, but so is what we do to the subgenius.

20
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,320
Our own subgenius.

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,760
Invoking a religious experience.

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,540
It's quite a big job.

23
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,500
Bob's figured it out.

24
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,460
He knows what he's doing, okay?

25
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,440
If I don't go talk to him now, it's going to be too late.

26
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,320
Listen to your mom.

27
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,960
You're going to meet a guy named Bob.

28
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,200
Have you ever even...

29
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,920
I haven't seen him.

30
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,620
I don't want you going alone.

31
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,920
Why don't you come with me then?

32
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,580
Sure, I will.

33
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,320
We like to spy on the neighbors.

34
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,360
They look so happy together.

35
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,380
Funny, the power of strangers.

36
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:26,300
Sometimes I wonder if they got it better, please.

37
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,280
Yeah.

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:38,040
It seems like aاحsha-like relationship.

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,280
That there were two from pick-upc Ahí BARDA XIAAN.

40
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:44,960
That's insane.

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,320
That's what my great-grandfather did with him.

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,800
I think it's quite unaesthetic.

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:47,800


44
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:47,860
I love that.

45
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,680
It's間 quake is kind of hard in America, and Lupita Não Pegeda is straight from there.

46
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:48,680


47
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,200
Now that we have talked about how it was a good thing up until I made us a sin, it is yearly.

48
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,260
I cannot even think about what it was.

49
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:58,620


50
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,680
Have you seen grass

51
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,200
So green

52
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,500
Grass

53
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,400
So green

54
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,900
Oh I

55
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,100
Like to be like that

56
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,000
I

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,120
Like to be like that

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,700
I

59
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,940
Like to be moving on

60
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,340
Along

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,680
So

62
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,200
Green

63
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:51,200
So green

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,060
I want to laugh

65
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,780
The way they laugh

66
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,240
See all my blues

67
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,720
Get back up in the sky

68
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,200
If only we had what they had

69
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,820
We'd never worry

70
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,220
And we'd never cry

71
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,760
Oh green

72
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,140
Have you seen green

73
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,360
Have you seen grass

74
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,660
So green

75
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,560
Grass

76
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,440
So green

77
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,860
Oh I

78
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,040
Like to be like that

79
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,940
I

80
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,880
Like to be like that

81
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,200
I

82
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,520
Like to be moving on

83
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,920
Along

84
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,220
So

85
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:53,900
Green

86
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,220
So green

87
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:08,400
Oh green

88
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,480
rees

89
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,480
Me

90
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,020
I told you to do with those kinds of people.

91
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,100
Punch her in the face.

92
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,360
You're in between being completely back at home

93
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,840
and having structure and support of sober peers

94
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,140
and beginning to, as Bob says, get your together,

95
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,760
which means setting goals, getting a disposable job,

96
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,780
just something you interact with people

97
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,940
where you're of some kind of service

98
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,260
and you enjoy doing it.

99
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,440
It's a structure, it's humble, and it's simple.

100
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,440
Can I ask you a,

101
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,040
can I ask you a,

102
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,900
I know you've answered a million Beatle questions

103
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,560
all the time, but I have to ask you,

104
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,020
there's one story that I've never thought,

105
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,300
I've always wondered, is this true

106
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,160
or is this just one of those things that was made up?

107
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,280
But there's a famous story that Bob introduced you guys

108
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,140
to pot for the first time.

109
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,440
You had never tried it before and that's the story.

110
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,160
And I thought, is that true?

111
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,800
No, it is true.

112
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,540
It is true.

113
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
But he didn't actually give us it.

114
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,500
He was in the room.

115
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,080
So he was not the supplier?

116
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:31,920
No.

117
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,600
Bob, your dealer.

118
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,760
Now Bob was in the room in the hotel

119
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,260
when it was arranged that someone else

120
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,300
would bring some stuff.

121
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,880
What was it?

122
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,960
Ah!

123
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,340
Oh,

124
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,500
We're back babe.

125
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,660
And Bob recognised him as Bob.

126
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:29,460
Huh?

127
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,080
In reality, he's off to a church.

128
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,940
In reality, he's off to a church.

129
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,940
In reality, he's off to a church.

130
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,920
Or more specifically, an alien worshipping church with very sinister plans.

131
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
What's next? Blush? Mascara?

132
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,920
Next time, I'll pull out the leather and high heels and pink underwear for you.

133
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,920
Leather, high heels, and pink underwear.

134
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,260
Pink underwear works.

135
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,680
Pink underwear works.

136
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,180
Bob, he's not the king.

137
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,040
You know, he doesn't love, so I'm very curious to see what's going to happen next.

138
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,240
Okay, which place is with me?

139
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,060
He is covering all that.

140
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,120
I know you're all working really hard to make your sh** look amazing.

141
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,160
But they must taste great, too.

142
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,460
Each of you has a sample of your sh** for the judges to taste.

143
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,920
We'll pick the one that we like best.

144
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,420
The winner of this test will gain a leg up in the competition.

145
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,520
He or she will get to pick one of the other two teams to sit idle for 30 minutes.

146
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,600
Bob, please tell us about your sh**.

147
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,580
What I did was a white sh**.

148
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,700
It's got a pineapple filling layer and a coconut layer.

149
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,100
Coconut, pineapple. Reminds me of the islands. Very good.

150
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,000
Bob, this sh** is delicious. It's light and feathery. I really enjoyed this.

151
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,560
Look at how much f**k this thing has.

152
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,860
At least enough to rotate these slackers.

153
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,580
Alright, team. Let's go to work.

154
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,880
So, how do you know everyone?

155
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,720
I'm a friend of Bob's.

156
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,740
You're a f*****g idiot.

157
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,900
You're a f*****g idiot.

158
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,720
You're a f*****g idiot.

159
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,160
You're a f*****g idiot.

160
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,900
You're a f*****g idiot.

161
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,040
Give me your hand.

162
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,660
Just give his hand.

163
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:24,660


164
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:24,840
Give me your hand.

165
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:34,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No offense, but I just ain't comfortable hanging around all night with, you know, whatchamacallit, Bob's.

166
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,080
Yeah, right. That's too bad. Could have been fun. Could have made a little money.

167
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,120
Yeah, you know, thank you. But I'm very happy with my clientele as they are.

168
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,600
Okay, Jimmy Bob, Tommy, Bobby, Billy.

169
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,020
Okay, Jimmy Bob, Tommy, Bobby, Billy.

170
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,420
Okay, Jimmy Bob, Tommy, Bobby, Billy.

171
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,660
Okay, Jimmy Bob, Tommy, Bobby, Billy.

172
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,740
Okay, Jimmy Bob, Tommy, Bobby, Billy.

173
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:04,300
Good ol' Rusty, Pepper, Jessica, Warty, Cleavis, Jerry, Jimbo, Pap, Brother, Splendle, Kyle, Riggs, Cricket, Rusty, Hank, Flint.

174
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,020
Okay, guys, I think he's out about five minutes ago.

175
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,440
Bobby Steel, Bobby Digital, what is this new mouth?

176
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,880
I'm talking about some slack.

177
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,800
Every time this dude enters a room, he ends up a goddamn bop.

178
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,200
She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob.

179
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,260
Taking up some of the slack might help to release the dummy.

180
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:23,920
Bobby.

181
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,400
Bobby.

182
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,000
Bobby.

183
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,460
Bobby.

184
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,000
All right, well, look at all this stuff. What are we getting?

185
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,440
Bob. That's their specialty.

186
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,180
Love that bop.

187
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,840
Yeah, yeah!

188
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,160
I'll have the bop.

189
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,100
That's the last bop. They got the last bop.

190
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,740
I know. They're going in first with the last bop.

191
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,520
That was our bop.

192
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,460
You can't beat a bop.

193
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,380
We had that bop.

194
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,300
They're gonna be heroes.

195
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,340
Well, what are we gonna do now? If we can't get the bop, the whole thing is useless.

196
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,080
That was our bop. We had that bop.

197
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,900
What's this one?

198
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,100
That bop.

199
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,260
Another bop?

200
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,320
We'll be going in with lesser bop.

201
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,140
I beg your pardon?

202
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,880
Lesser bop?

203
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,980
I think not.

204
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,320
I'll have a bop.

205
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,600
Whatever happened to bop?

206
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,120
Yeah, bop spelled backwards. It's still bop.

207
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,700
Hey, for every stank, I got a new joke for you.

208
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,980
It's just bop is what it is. It's just, it's literally bop.

209
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,940
Yes, sirree, bop.

210
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,080
Yes, sirree, ma'am.

211
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:31,140
Connie, that last ten minutes was all assembled by The Large, except for the very beginning by Reverend Royal Decapitator.

212
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:41,520
And I may be as puzzled as you are by that pretty song that The Large included at the beginning, which was the song Green by E.D. Brickell.

213
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,540
I'm not sure how that fits into Hour of Slack, sounding pretty as it does.

214
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,080
But The Large has been so generous with his editing talents that I ain't gonna lie.

215
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,700
I'm gonna lick a gift collage in the mouth.

216
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,580
That ten minutes probably saved me ten hours of work.

217
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:13,600
Coming up, lots of puzzling evidence, radio synesthesia, the Ask Dr. Howell Show, all of those with Dr. Philo Drummond, Dr. Hal Robbins, Puzzling Evidence, Phineas Narco, Dr. Sinister, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

218
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,480
Hello, you are on the air.

219
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,560
Dr. Sinister!

220
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,120
There we go.

221
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,900
Yeah, it's going well, going well up here in WCSB land.

222
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,140
I've been, we've been enjoying the amino acids from here at the Philo-seum.

223
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,800
I figured it would be enjoyed by any who heard it.

224
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:43,540
Yeah, and as Philo and I were just saying, I've heard this song 18 million times, but I still love it.

225
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,740
Yeah, there's some songs like that.

226
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,540
Well, I played the tracks before that, too.

227
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,240
Right.

228
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:51,880
That's right.

229
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,720
That's actually one of the reasons why it gets so much plays, it's because it's one of their longer songs.

230
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,080
Right.

231
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:06,820
One of the dirty secrets of DJs is that we're lazy and we don't like having to change the CD or the record every two minutes, you know, or worse, every like one minute, you know.

232
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,960
One of my favorite bands.

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,440
One of my favorites is the soundtrack of Lucifer Rising, which is 27 minutes on each side of the LP.

234
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,240
That was a great one for radio background.

235
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,820
I've never actually heard of that.

236
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,160
Who did that?

237
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,960
It was recorded on death row in prison.

238
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,720
It was the soundtrack for this Kenneth Anger underground movie, right?

239
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,220
Huh.

240
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,360
And one of the main musicians on it was Bobby Busilio, who was one of the Manson family.

241
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,440
He was in prison for the Manson murders.

242
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:49,360
So, you know, Anger got lots of extra voodoo juju mileage out of, you know, using murderers for his sound, to do his soundtrack.

243
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,040
To tell the truth, I thought the movie was really, really boring and he actually saw me walk out of the theater.

244
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,880
Signed my poster of it.

245
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,520
Man, you don't want to offend a guy who's friends with lots of murderers.

246
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,300
Well, I mean, he's a Satanist too.

247
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,680
He's friends with Satan.

248
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,580
Now, we have business arrangements with Satan.

249
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,180
You know, I'm friends with Satan myself.

250
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:12,840
Religious.

251
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,580
We get along.

252
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,000
You know, Satan is, we have an understanding as well.

253
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,760
That's good.

254
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,760
In fact, I really enjoyed, I really...

255
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,900
You can play all bases, you know.

256
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,840
Yeah, I really enjoyed the Hour of Slack tonight because it had this rant from, it sounded like years and years ago.

257
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:38,460
The reason it sounded like years ago is because you came out afterwards and said that this happened just a couple weeks ago, but you sounded younger.

258
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,700
Yeah, yeah, that was, I've had to do reruns, you know.

259
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,440
Yeah, well, hey, you know, some call them reruns.

260
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,420
Others call, let's revisit a classic.

261
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:48,980
Yeah.

262
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,480
Right.

263
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,320
Well, there was a lot of me reading...

264
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:51,780
Don't call them reruns, call them classics.

265
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,280
I had written a forward for a book called The Big Book of Conspiracies.

266
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,920
Yes, I own a copy of that book at home, actually.

267
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,060
Right, that's what I was reading on that old show.

268
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,120
And also, I was reading some stuff that Nenslow wrote.

269
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,260
Well, actually, no, there was a rant by somebody else.

270
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,160
I can't remember who it was.

271
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,660
I think it was Papa Joe Mama, maybe.

272
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,000
You're right, yeah, Papa Joe.

273
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,880
That's who it was, talking about how Satan, he was making an argument that I have made myself, that I came up with on my own, which is biblical justification.

274
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,340
Oh.

275
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,380
Yeah, you know, just the idea that...

276
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:23,480
Well, yeah, I mean...

277
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:30,680
Because Satan is the resistance against this evil dictator god who says, do as I say or burn.

278
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,880
Well, it's like the conspiracy and the subgeniuses.

279
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,120
The conspiracy is our whole reason for existing.

280
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,100
Without them, we'd just be normals.

281
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,080
Yes, the raison d'etre of not being normal.

282
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,760
They've just come.

283
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,100
Yeah, yeah, you know, I like a raison bran.

284
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,860
What?

285
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,140
I like to have a big bowl of raison bran every morning for breakfast.

286
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,660
Raisin bran and raisin...

287
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,240
How dare you?

288
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,000
Or there's also another one, a reason bran.

289
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,940
I never was able to find any of that on the shelves.

290
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,580
The shelves were stripped bare of reason bran.

291
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:17,960
Well, you were looking for obscured prunes, which is a form of liturgy conducted to the nearly dead.

292
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,600
I like to prune the family tree.

293
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,980
Yeah, we all have that feeling.

294
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,480
You know, which...

295
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,700
Making of family trees, I think...

296
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,840
That's how I encourage people to eat their children.

297
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:35,240
Puzzling evidence is, according to what I'm seeing on screen three, puzzling evidence is trying to call...

298
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,780
I'm seeing a call from area code 925. That's definitely outside the listening area.

299
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,300
Am I nauseatingly buzzy right now at this moment?

300
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,340
There's a little bit of a buzz.

301
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,160
A little.

302
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,260
But you know what, Dave, we get...

303
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,400
I'm getting a little buzz off you, Dave.

304
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Yeah, Dave, we get a buzz every time we talk to you, so...

305
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,520
Oh, man, thanks a lot.

306
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,560
It's the monos...

307
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,160
Didn't mean to pee in your shoes, but...

308
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,300
Well...

309
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,940
But there is a movie called Troll.

310
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,180
Amazing.

311
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,400
It's a Norwegian movie.

312
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,080
Troll Hunter.

313
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,740
Troll Hunter.

314
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,600
Troll Hunter, yeah.

315
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,280
I have the Norwegian copy on my face.

316
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,560
Yeah.

317
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,460
I mean, my YouTube thing.

318
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,160
Yeah.

319
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,580
Somebody's putting up movies.

320
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,340
Movies and movies.

321
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,440
I've got that one with subtitles.

322
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,040
I want somebody to...

323
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,640
The trolls look great in that.

324
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,840
They look like current...

325
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,560
Like real fairytale trolls.

326
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,300
They kind of look like the old Ray Terryhausen, like Jack the Giant.

327
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,780
Well, they're more outlandish looking than that, though.

328
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,140
They're...

329
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,940
I think we should call the president about it.

330
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,700
They're cartoonish, yet photo real.

331
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,920
That's what I liked about them.

332
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:38,900
They were like a crazy cartoon drawing that they were rendered photo realistically with

333
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,040
shaky cam and...

334
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,420
That's that song.

335
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:40,680
Yeah.

336
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,340
Fake night vision and everything.

337
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:42,940
I wrote it for all the people.

338
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,740
I heard that they're...

339
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,580
American Hollywood made them.

340
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:46,580


341
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:46,680
I mean, they're...

342
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:46,680


343
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:46,680


344
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:46,680


345
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:46,680


346
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:46,680


347
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:46,680


348
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:46,700
I mean, they're...

349
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,180
I mean, that's cool.

350
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,180


351
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,940
Mom and pop...

352
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,480
Don't have a voice...

353
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,060
...multi-conglomerate conspiracy is going to make a Hollywood version of Troll Hunter.

354
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,080
Well, maybe the Canadian Chief will hear you this time.

355
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,220
Oh my god.

356
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,560
Which they'll probably change the title to Bigfoot Hunter.

357
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,280
I think they should keep Troll.

358
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,480
Well, yeah.

359
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,580
Yeah, but they're already in Troll, I guess.

360
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,400
But then it needs...

361
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,240
But it's like, why remake it?

362
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,180
It's so...

363
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,820
The weirdness of it is that it's so Norwegian to begin with.

364
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,020
Ah, well.

365
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,020
It's Norwegian.

366
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,480
I really like the fact that the trolls could still...

367
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:16,680
Troll hunters, Troll hunters.

368
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:16,680


369
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:16,680


370
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:16,680


371
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:16,680


372
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,900
Smell the blood of a Christian man.

373
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,920
It was okay if you were an atheist.

374
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,540
You could go troll hunting.

375
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,360
But if you were a Christian man, you'd draw their attention.

376
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,740
They could smell you.

377
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,780
They wanted to eat you real bad on account of your religion.

378
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,000
They wanted to eat you real bad.

379
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,660
I smell the blood of a subgenius wallet.

380
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,640
This is your religion.

381
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,140
Religion.

382
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,940
You don't think, well, you do think about your religion, but your wallet.

383
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,360
This is music from Philo's first porno movie in the 70s.

384
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,820
I've been reading a lot about Roger Williams and all those early churches are all about stealing money from each other.

385
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,960
You know, Papists versus Protestants.

386
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:07,460
And the King of England, Charles I, is constantly trying to drain all the Catholics and fighting with Ireland.

387
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,980
He finally decides to go do the fight with Ireland and gets his butt kicked.

388
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,500
I mean, completely.

389
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,420
And then starts the English Civil War and off you go into it.

390
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,140
While they're doing a civil war for the next 2,000 years, the rest of Europe gets busy with commerce.

391
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,220
Now it's just about t-shirts.

392
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,360
Yeah.

393
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,400
Mind the gap.

394
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,480
Alan.

395
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,260
No, that's from, nobody knows that one.

396
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:38,060
Now, did you know that Maasai Point, where we're heading now, was named in honor of Bigfoot Maasai,

397
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:45,140
a Chiricahua Apache warrior who jumped from the train in Missouri as it was heading to Florida.

398
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:54,100
We're at Chiricahua National Monument and we're going to try to do the Echo Canyon Trail.

399
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:06,900
But there are mountain lions here, or mounting lions, so named because they will mount you for seven years.

400
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,800
The Chiricahua National Monument?

401
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,180
Yeah.

402
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,820
And it's still in the...

403
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,840
Yes, I have.

404
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,500
I've been there.

405
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,760
I've been there in the winter.

406
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,140
Many days walk in the farther you walk in, the better.

407
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:30,840
I saw a giant frozen waterfall there that's of enormous height.

408
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,540
Many other interesting things to see there in the winter.

409
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,300
Geronimo from there?

410
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:34,740
No.

411
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,140
Geronimo?

412
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,700
It's not Geronimo, is it?

413
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,060
Who was the guy?

414
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,520
He was an Apache.

415
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,220
He was...

416
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,000
Cochise.

417
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,600
Cochise.

418
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:46,940


419
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,520
I remember where I went with some of the...

420
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,300
Jim?

421
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,200
Yeah.

422
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,920
His stronghold.

423
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,500
So the Chiricahua is to the south of Tucson.

424
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:06,000
And there are bears there and they have a spotted cat that the Mexicans call El Tigre.

425
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,780
He's in those mountains.

426
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,240
I noticed that's near a town called Wilcox.

427
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,640
I'm not sure where that is.

428
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,360
I don't know where it was.

429
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,800
There's no town nearby.

430
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,520
I mean, in southern Arizona, Wilcox certainly is.

431
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:35,700
But Chiricahua is also a stretch into northern Sonora in Mexico and into the state of New Mexico.

432
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,100
They had some problems with fire.

433
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,640
Zach, I got a sporting event laid out for this Saturday.

434
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,300
A fire eater named Philo.

435
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,020
Philo.

436
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,160
Philo.

437
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,960
Never heard of him.

438
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:58,680
At this time of the year, we spend a lot of time outdoors, hiking and causing forest fires in the woods and the mountains.

439
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,900
This summer, thousands of acres of valuable timberland will be destroyed because you caused the forest fire.

440
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,740
It's up to you to be sure that you destroy timber, wildlife, and the water supply,

441
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,120
and destroy the natural resources on which our nation depends.

442
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,220
Just follow a few simple rules.

443
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,080
Don't crush out cigarettes.

444
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,660
Don't break matches in two after using them.

445
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,240
Be careless when you're in the mountains or woodlands.

446
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,720
So remember, only you can cause forest fires.

447
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,600
We continue now with our cover-up.

448
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,140
Matches and lighters are children's toys.

449
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,460
They are made for girls and boys.

450
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,060
More than 90,000 children curious about fire play.

451
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,160
Teach your children that matches and lighters are toys.

452
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,020
Fire.

453
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,420
Fire.

454
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,420
Fire.

455
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,880
Thanks to Fernanda Nandy Lemur for those old clips.

456
00:21:51,220 --> 00:22:00,920
And also old is the following excellent recording by Pater Nostril of ESO at 3X Day in the year 2000.

457
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:09,080
This is Einstein's Secret Orchestra with Michelle George, Bob Mosick, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and leader Chaz Smith.

458
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,640
The original ESO in its purest form of the song Solar Fire.

459
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,220
Hey!

460
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,380
Turning on to Amber, travel the night

461
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,720
He must know the answer, he must know why

462
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,040
Looking for the answer, look to the sky

463
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,480
Sun and light stream into the night

464
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,820
First light stream

465
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,480
First light stream

466
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,860
The Shines of the Fire

467
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,120
The shadows getting short of filling your eyes

468
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,440
A brightly burning starfire light giving light

469
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,580
A dawning into morning day and night

470
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,100
Looking for the answer, look to the sky

471
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,440
Sun and light stream into the night

472
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,760
First light stream, the Shines of the Fire

473
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,440
He must know the answer, he must know why

474
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,040
Looking for the answer, look to the sky

475
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,700
Starting from tomorrow, look to the sky

476
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,180
There's a new day dawning, life giving light

477
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,480
Follow our eyes and sense and then you know why

478
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,860
Looking for the answer, look to the sky

479
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,080
Sun and light stream into the night

480
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,560
First light stream, the Shines of the Fire

481
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,940
Sun and light stream into the night

482
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:11,500
This is what we call the night

483
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,900
Look to the sky

484
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:12,980
Look to the sky

485
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,800
Look to the sky

486
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,640
Look to the sky

487
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,000
Look to the sky

488
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,540
Sun and light stream into the night

489
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:41,960
Looking for the answer, look to the sky Looking for the answer, look to the sky

490
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,220
Looking for the answer, look to the sky

491
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,860
Looking for the answer, look to the sky

492
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,280
We sat down.

493
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,620
We don't do that perhaps often enough.

494
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,480
But we sat down and stopped walking and taking pictures

495
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:22,020
on a beautiful, beautiful trail in the Chiricahua National Monument,

496
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,980
which features hoodoos like Bryce,

497
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,840
and like City of Rocks.

498
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,360
It has these bizarre pinnacle-shaped rocks

499
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:41,360
made of 27-million-year-old volcanic tuff or rhyolite.

500
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,720
Again, it's Sus Dali sculptured rock.

501
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,660
It takes some rigorous climbing and hiking at times,

502
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,460
but it's so gorgeously weird-looking.

503
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,120
It all has this icing of bright,

504
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:03,420
green lichen that's just wherever it's able to grow.

505
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,960
Yeah, and orange lichen.

506
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,800
And the rocks are kind of bluish sometimes,

507
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,900
and orangey, and even greeny.

508
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,660
And somehow, we've got this day with this perfect sky.

509
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,600
It's like...

510
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,220
Well, it's real nice weather.

511
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:18,900
Surreal.

512
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,880
The sun came out,

513
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,400
and we're among these really unusual rock formations.

514
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,520
I mean, this kind of thing doesn't occur many places.

515
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,800
But we've been finding those places

516
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,040
where the rocks are spiky and craggy,

517
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,960
yet rounded and layered.

518
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,260
They look like tall totem poles,

519
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,180
or, yes, I'll dare say it, peni.

520
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,820
There's an awful lot of penis-shaped rocks around here.

521
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,100
That's the easiest way to...

522
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,900
Really, the most accurate way to describe a lot of them.

523
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,440
Really pretty impressive ones, in many cases.

524
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,840
And, of course, others are kind of squat.

525
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,760
And then there's a lot of balanced rocks,

526
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,920
or situations where everything eroded

527
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,160
out from in between a pinnacle and a round rock,

528
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,180
and the round rock ended up sitting on top of the pinnacle.

529
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,580
You see, they're kind of teeterous-looking.

530
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,620
You're almost afraid that they'll fall down on you at this moment.

531
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,840
After sitting there for millions of years,

532
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,120
they're going to suddenly topple over.

533
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,080
And they could, too.

534
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,020
They could.

535
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,060
That's the way things are here at Chiricahua National Monument

536
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,660
for the Hour of Slack.

537
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,280
Praise Bob.

538
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,080
Praise Bob!

539
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,060
I ain't gonna stand up next to the mountain

540
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:48,040
And not jump it down with my hands

541
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:54,520
I ain't gonna stand up next to the mountain

542
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,360
And not jump it down with my hands

543
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,500
And not jump it down with my hands

544
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,380
And not jump it down with my hands

545
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,940
I'm going to something like this.

546
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,280
Yeah, we're going to something like this.

547
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,280


548
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,940
I want this to be one of my homes.

549
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,360
So we can always be gazing at a hoodoo there

550
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,020
and look down at the ground and find these objects,

551
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:25,440
the art that are made prettier than anybody could ever make anything.

552
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,080
How can God make this?

553
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,040
How can God make this so beautiful?

554
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,980
It's just...

555
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,860
How can God make this so beautiful?

556
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,640
That's what the lady asked us at Bryce Canyon at dawn.

557
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,560
How can God make this so beautiful?

558
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,200
Have a hot dog!

559
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,960
I ate only yesterday.

560
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,340
This isn't an apple, you dummy!

561
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,840
It's a hot dog!

562
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,520
Hot dog!

563
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,200
Don't touch that, Jimmy.

564
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,140
You never know what Mr. Fig has up his sleeve.

565
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,000
Come on.

566
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,200
What's the matter with you folks?

567
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,580
How often does a tree offer you a hot dog?

568
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,260
Three things working against us, or four, or a hundred.

569
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,300
The air is thin.

570
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,560
We're at 7,000 feet almost.

571
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,220
And we're not used to that.

572
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:26,820
And...

573
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,760
We're old.

574
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,460
And we've...

575
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:38,300
This is the third really big, long, steep trail we've hiked in three days.

576
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,420
And I have vertigo.

577
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,940
And we didn't quite get enough sleep.

578
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,160
However, it's worth it.

579
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,460
We got down in there.

580
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,560
We got down in there.

581
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,920
And we're going to get back out of there.

582
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,920
That's the hard part, actually.

583
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,660
I had a bad case of baptasia before I left on the trip.

584
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,780
It slowed us down.

585
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,140
I had to stop real frequently.

586
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,880
Every ten minutes, look for a rest area.

587
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,420
We came to a rest stop.

588
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,520
The Texas something rest stop.

589
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,620
Just outside of Chiricahua.

590
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,440
Texas Canyon.

591
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,500
Texas Canyon rest stop.

592
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,560
And these rocks out here are as good as the damn canyon.

593
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,580
They're just spectacular.

594
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,720
Somebody just fled.

595
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:26,980
They just flushed them.

596
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,920
Right by the phone.

597
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,140
Oh, they wrecked my soul.

598
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,220
Damn.

599
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,780
What was Reverend Stein?

600
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,520
He was boding the benefits of the mute button on his cell phone.

601
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,920
Then he got where it was.

602
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,040
WCSB Cleveland, flushing your time down the toilet since 1976.

603
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,740
Do you need to wear a mood ring when you make that flushing sound?

604
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,380
You couldn't even tell I was gone.

605
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,360
Or going.

606
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,960
I was going.

607
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:55,640
And yet you couldn't tell.

608
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,820
Well, I assume that there's a reason why you're not going.

609
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:56,820


610
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:56,820


611
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:56,820


612
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:56,820


613
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:56,820


614
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:56,820


615
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:56,820


616
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:56,820


617
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:56,820


618
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:56,820


619
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:56,820


620
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,460
There's a lot of extra meditation going on.

621
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,640
And extra medication, too.

622
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,080
That's what I said.

623
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,840
Some of these people actually use this as a sort of chemical tool to attain some sort

624
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,760
of higher consciousness.

625
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,700
Kind of like sniffing woo-ha or whatever it's called in South America.

626
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,820
It's good for toilet training.

627
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,300
You can use subgenius radio for toilet training.

628
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,320
Only the elder class can do that.

629
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,740
I know it worked for bleepo, Abernathy, me, Philo.

630
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,780
We've all used it.

631
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,100
All of us parental breeder types.

632
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,420
Yeah.

633
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,940
I'm an evolutionary dead end myself.

634
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:30,880
Yeah.

635
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,060
Me, too.

636
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,780
I mean, right at this moment, anyway.

637
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,620
No, you're not.

638
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,200
Dave has children all over the world.

639
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,340
Do you?

640
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,960
No, Dave.

641
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,220
No, I thought you said Philo or you have children all over the world, meaning you've impregnated

642
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,780
a lot of accordions.

643
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,160
We do.

644
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:50,800
We do.

645
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,700
We have kids all over the world.

646
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,000
That's what I want my super-

647
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,820
Mother Earth herself.

648
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,060
Mother Earth herself.

649
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,460
She's impregnated his one more children.

650
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,360
For y'all have knocked her up.

651
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,220
I'll knock her up.

652
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,520
It's a group effort.

653
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,360
I'll knock her up there.

654
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,260
I'll knock her up around here.

655
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,600
Is Al there?

656
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,280
I'll knock her up.

657
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,280
I'm out there.

658
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,820
Get me out of here.

659
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,840
Where's the boxer shorts on my head?

660
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:22,980
Hey, Red.

661
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,280
We dug your mud up.

662
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,400
Stop calling me by that.

663
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,400


664
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,400


665
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,400


666
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,400


667
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,400


668
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,400


669
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,400


670
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,400


671
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,400


672
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,400


673
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,400


674
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,400


675
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,400


676
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,040
We're on primetime.

677
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,380
Oh, no, we're not.

678
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:29,860
That's right.

679
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:34,940
It's primetime on the West Coast, but this show, of course, is not quite ready for primetime.

680
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,040
Hey, Red, we don't yet.

681
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,040
This show is not even ready for primetime, if you ask me.

682
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:46,520
This show is often populated by mad baboons who call in to bother you, to perplex you.

683
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,460
Here we are.

684
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,260
Sometimes you repair them silently and with great delft.

685
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:56,220
And other times, they keep talking about weird stuff.

686
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,260
Where's my father?

687
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,720
You know, it's so fun to be able to hang up on people.

688
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,000
They're talking about you, Dave.

689
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,000
Where's my father?

690
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,320
Did you see Hugo?

691
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,200
I've been, I wrote, it's on my list of things to do.

692
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,020
In 3D, it's circled.

693
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,520
Ah.

694
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,760
Yeah, that was good in 3D.

695
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,060
I don't know if it's playing anymore in 3D.

696
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,720
Yeah, well, it is.

697
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,440
The Grand Lake, which I intend to go see someday, someday.

698
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,140
I know nothing.

699
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,520
I'm not going to go see something that's in the can while I'm out on the...

700
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,020
In the can.

701
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:26,720
Yes.

702
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,280
I've been inside the cans of many state parks now.

703
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,520
I've been taking photographs.

704
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:31,900
Yeah.

705
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:36,600
You know, some states have much better funding than others, I can tell you that.

706
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,940
I had a dream once, years ago, when Father and I were driving around aimlessly for various reasons,

707
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:48,540
of doing all of the bathrooms, you know, early, early net web thing, you know,

708
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,860
and I thought it was a unique idea.

709
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,680
We're doing...

710
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,700
News of all the bathrooms we have, all those rest stop places, and just...

711
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,600
And early GPS, you know, put that in.

712
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,420
And now there are 20 of those websites, at least, right here in my mind.

713
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,920
Well, I...

714
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,300
Someone pointed out that Pulp Fiction had a lot of people going to the bathroom and coming out of the bathroom.

715
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:08,780
Oh, okay.

716
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,140
It was usually John Travolta.

717
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:10,900
Yeah.

718
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,440
There's not often that in the movies.

719
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,960
I've also heard mentioned that Stanley Kubrick's movies always have...

720
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,620
A bathroom scene.

721
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,120
I'm sorry, 2001.

722
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,580
And The Shining.

723
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,100
Yeah.

724
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,100
Yeah, if you think about it.

725
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:28,440
2001.

726
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,240
And...

727
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,000
Mark Rickhorns.

728
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,120
And...

729
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,860
Bathrooms.

730
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,140
The Shining.

731
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,960
What's the last one he did?

732
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,660
The one he did?

733
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,100
The one he...

734
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,740
Eyes shut.

735
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,000
Yeah, Eyes Shut, Riley.

736
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,320
Yeah.

737
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,260
But Hal and I went on for about half a show once, trying to figure out why we liked it.

738
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,720
I did.

739
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,300
I don't know why.

740
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,340
What about Paths of Glory?

741
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,360
No bath...

742
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:49,820
Yeah, probably.

743
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:50,540
Probably.

744
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,720
I don't know.

745
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:51,720


746
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:51,720


747
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:51,720


748
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:51,720


749
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:51,720


750
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:51,720


751
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:51,720


752
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,560
1957 or something.

753
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:52,860
Yeah.

754
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,540
Of course, we don't know.

755
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,680
We have to check that in the unknown pile right now.

756
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,220
How come subgenius shows turn into film history shows for 20 minutes every time?

757
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,600
Because instead of having a life, we all watch movies forever.

758
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,100
Yeah.

759
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,020
Old movies.

760
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:12,640
My latest location I have to go visit is Goblin State Park in Green River, Utah.

761
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,020
I saw it in Galaxy Quest.

762
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:15,520
Yeah.

763
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,420
I was thinking, now, some of this is painted in, but some of this is real.

764
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:18,920
Yeah, but it's real.

765
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:19,660
Yeah.

766
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,000


767
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,840
It's on those real rocks.

768
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,780
On the big old round golf ball rocks.

769
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,060
Yeah.

770
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,540
I heard it.

771
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,400
Alien land.

772
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,460
That and Alabama Hills.

773
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,020
You got everything.

774
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,720
Is that where Kurt bought the Gorn?

775
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:28,740
What?

776
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,420
No, that's at Vasquez Rocks, and I was there almost...

777
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:37,420
Bob Dobbs was almost busted there a month ago, but I don't want to tell that story anymore.

778
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,000
Yeah.

779
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,040
No, you told that story on the last two shows.

780
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:40,280
The old blind box.

781
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,740
The last five shows, yeah.

782
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,960
Vasquez Rocks is where they...

783
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,460
Where Kirk walked and fought the Gorn.

784
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:47,960
Maybe.

785
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,840
And we're planning...

786
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:49,860
That's where Bob got it.

787
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:49,980
Yeah.

788
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:49,980


789
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,160
The dinosaurs were shot with music in there.

790
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,680
And they did some catch-up parts of Jesus Christ Superstar there.

791
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,160
Most of it's filmed in Negev, but they're...

792
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,760
Or in...

793
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,220
Yeah, in Palestine.

794
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,800
They run over to Vasquez for a quick...

795
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,860
Sometimes you got to do those extra shots, yeah.

796
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,480
Vasquez had a little Gorn action figure when I was a kid.

797
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:07,980
Wow.

798
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,160
How much, man?

799
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,360
It'd be worth something now if I had it still.

800
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,240
No, I'm not going to say that.

801
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:19,560
It had to be explained to me two or three years ago what a Gorn was because I had forgotten.

802
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,480
Me too.

803
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:28,560
I was such a bad nerd that I'd forgotten the Star Trek character of the Gorn and how stupid-looking it was.

804
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,080
Really?

805
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,360
I understand the modern-day version is all ugly and...

806
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,200
In fact, there is one in that movie.

807
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:40,300
There's a Gorn in that modern-day Star Wars remake.

808
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,860
The Gorn was a lizard-headed costume man.

809
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,680
Oh, yeah.

810
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,520
In like the fourth episode or something.

811
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,260
Yeah.

812
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,720
And it was really terrible.

813
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,300
Terrible costume.

814
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,280
Lizard-head man.

815
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,480
That was what made him so famous.

816
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:57,640
I didn't notice him because I'm always looking for the fake caves made out of real nice thick aluminum.

817
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,220
Black-painted aluminum they have in Hollywood.

818
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,580
You couldn't see that when I was 12 years old.

819
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,080
But now you can see that.

820
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,300
You can see what everything is made of.

821
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,320
On Day Job Orchestra.

822
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,240
He's running around with a very phallic stalactite.

823
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,260
There's a devil in the dark.

824
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,820
I don't remember.

825
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,480
Yes.

826
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,920
There's phallic stalactites everywhere.

827
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,800
That'd be a good band name, Phallic Stalactite.

828
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,960
The Petrified Penis Forest.

829
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,500
There was a place that was like that.

830
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,260
It's called the City of Rocks.

831
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:42,320
It looked like pagans had spent millennia carving giant phallic symbols in the rock.

832
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,240
But actually, they were all natural.

833
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,700
What about that spooky forest that everyone goes to?

834
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,200
Just to kill themselves in Japan.

835
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,540
Yeah.

836
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,460
I don't want to go there, man.

837
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,280
Suicide forest.

838
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,100
I don't want to have X-Day there again.

839
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,100
It was a bad place to have X-Day.

840
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,540
We didn't make any money either.

841
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,320
You could go to it on Google.

842
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,840
You know, just drive in.

843
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,360
You can do anything on Google now.

844
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,220
You can go places on Google.

845
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,340
Except as long as it's not real.

846
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,880
I've been doing both.

847
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,640
I'll Google a place and then I'll go to the place.

848
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,240
The Puzzling Evidence Show.

849
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:27,660
Then I'll Google it again.

850
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,600
I'm just so sad.

851
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,540
Then I'll gargle it.

852
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,760
Very sad now.

853
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,660
Why is that?

854
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,160
Because no queen of UFOs has come.

855
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,480
I think we lost UFOs this fall in the city.

856
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,240
It happens Scott Bakula fighting a Gorn.

857
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,200
Is that Rocknar?

858
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,640
It is.

859
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,840
Rocknar's the one who had to explain to me what a Gorn was again.

860
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,340
I agree.

861
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,680
Because he was selling a t-shirt for Mac.

862
00:39:49,700 --> 00:40:00,020
And I honestly had been so far from Captain Kirk and Spock that I'd forgotten.

863
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:00,460
Yeah.

864
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,300
But I'm trying to relearn everything.

865
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,740
The CGI Gorn that they had in the Enterprise episode.

866
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:06,740
Right.

867
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,440
Oh, okay.

868
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,840
Well, Rocknar, I want to tell you.

869
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,680
I don't think Gorn.

870
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,580
Gorn porn.

871
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,940
Now you're talking, man.

872
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,020
Now, see, up until this point, I was thinking this is pretty nerdy.

873
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,680
I don't know.

874
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,520
Gorn porn.

875
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:21,800
Gorn porn.

876
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,300
They're reptilians, right?

877
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,220
And they're really slow.

878
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,640
The Gorns are reptilian creatures.

879
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,580
Yeah, they're like sleazestacks.

880
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,620
They're like doing it.

881
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,080
Yeah, like doing it with a dinosaur.

882
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,300
Yeah, they're really slow.

883
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:31,560
A sleazestack.

884
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:32,980
Yeah, yeah.

885
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,520
They're really slow.

886
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,460
Super slow.

887
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,360
They have dual peni reptiles do.

888
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,800
I don't know about dinosaurs.

889
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,000
They may be different.

890
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,700
They're not reptiles.

891
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,060
But neither are Gorns aren't dinosaurs either.

892
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,300
They're different.

893
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:49,980
They're from another.

894
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,780
Would a Gorn porn eventually end in a snub film?

895
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,240
Why, yes, it would.

896
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:56,760
Everything.

897
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,340
Everything would end in a snub film.

898
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,040
I'm surprised Hal's not listening and trying to call in right now.

899
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:06,920
As Dr. Leguim said, nobody's biography has a happy ending.

900
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,500
Yeah, especially the Autobot movie.

901
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,380
I'm dying.

902
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,160
The kind that goes on is.

903
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,280
And they lived happily ever after.

904
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:25,100
After forever and ever, those are my favorite kind of endings.

905
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:33,440
They live forever in a century of bliss and then a decade and then another century and

906
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,280
then at the end of the say, you get into these movies that have touched me.

907
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:43,560
No matter if it's every single market.

908
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,620
I would like to keep hearing the same president employment space.

909
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,540
From in.

910
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,480
Are you printing this out?

911
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,460
Open the bathroom door, please, Hal.

912
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,820
The script's printed like 30 seconds before we get there.

913
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,400
Open, Hal, the bathroom door.

914
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,720
Quick.

915
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,780
I can't do that, Dave.

916
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,460
It's stuck.

917
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,920
Can't take it.

918
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,860
Must reach.

919
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,560
Oxygen switch.

920
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,740
Must reach.

921
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:16,780
Toilet.

922
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,400
Paper.

923
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,940
Must talk like William Shatner.

924
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,140
The History Channel presents Rest Stocks of America.

925
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,740
With your hosts, Dr. Philo Drummond, Buzzing Evidence, and Reverend Ivan Stagg.

926
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,500
I'll tell you about the best restrooms on your drive across America.

927
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:42,840
The best public restrooms you can get to, and the best private restrooms that are sometimes hard to get to,

928
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,260
but just as rewarding in those times of trouble,

929
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,540
when the nature's call is most urgent.

930
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,640
What about rest stops?

931
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,380
My favorite rest stop is in Arizona, and it's called Texas Valley.

932
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:06,820
It's just past Wilcox, Arizona, near Chiricahua National Park,

933
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,360
and that rest stop is as cool-looking as the $5 National Park.

934
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,000
Huh.

935
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,900
Not that I would discourage people from...

936
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,940
We're partying our national parks, but...

937
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,120
Who owns it?

938
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,580
The state of Arizona, I suppose.

939
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:28,400
The rocks around it were beckoning me, but we basically just stopped for the rest stop.

940
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:28,740
Yeah.

941
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,460
But it's the most scenic rest stop I've ever seen.

942
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,660
I was going to say, that's what's cool about Arizona and Mexico.

943
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,460
And well kept.

944
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,560
There's the rest stop.

945
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,920
When we got to California, the first rest stop we came to was closed.

946
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,720
And I thought, man, this is a bad sign.

947
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,340
Yep.

948
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,120
If they're closed all the way to L.A., then we'll know.

949
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,480
The government is collapsing.

950
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,180
But the next one was open.

951
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,780
Not for long.

952
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:58,240
And there were signs everywhere saying, if you see anyone smoking, call this number.

953
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,640
Be a fink for America!

954
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:06,800
Report smoking in national parks and rest stops.

955
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,780
I understand fire danger.

956
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,040
Only you can prevent forest fires.

957
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:16,900
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's that as much as just the encouragement of finkery.

958
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:24,320
The Junior Slacks Squad, when we take our campers out into the forest, we've always taught

959
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,980
them how to put their forest fires out when they were finished.

960
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,220
It's not out until you can lower your belly under the cold, wet ashes.

961
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:37,160
When they were finished warming themselves on the forest fire they'd set, we always tried

962
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:43,360
to teach them how to put the forest fire out if they had time, before they had to go back

963
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,160
to civilization.

964
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,660
Turn in your parents.

965
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,020
And some sort of Jack Chickian nightmare.

966
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:49,920
Whoa.

967
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,420
Clean up your forest fire, boys.

968
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,940
Stir, I want you to stir that forest two times.

969
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,040
Report your neighbor.

970
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,740
Report your friends.

971
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:12,500
Remember, Smokey the Bear says, only you can turn in your neighbor.

972
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,280
Oh, only me?

973
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,440
I'm under all this pressure.

974
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,180
Oh, thank God.

975
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,080
Oh, thank God.

976
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,940
It was a nightmare about the communist takeover of America.

977
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:24,560
Actually, Smokey the Bear didn't actually say that himself.

978
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:24,660


979
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,760
Those words were put into his mouth by a marketing PR firm.

980
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,180
Smokey was exploited.

981
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,020
The only bipedal, fully bipedal clothes wearing bear.

982
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,640
Yogi was just a legend.

983
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,080
But Smokey was real, and they used him.

984
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,640
They took him to the forest.

985
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,420
They took him to government laboratories in the desert and programmed him to talk about

986
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,240
forest fires.

987
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,280
Poor Smokey.

988
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,920
I hear some noodling going on there.

989
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,800
Poor Smokey.

990
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:03,660
What did they do to you, Smokey?

991
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,960
The thing is over there.

992
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,620
The thing.

993
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,100
The thing.

994
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,280
Have you seen the thing?

995
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,820
Souvenir jewelry.

996
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,060
Thing.

997
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,620
Thing.

998
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,620


999
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,620


1000
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,620


1001
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,620


1002
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,620


1003
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,620


1004
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,620


1005
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,620


1006
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,620


1007
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,620


1008
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,620


1009
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,620


1010
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:25,400
But we're going to skip the thing, because I know all about the thing.

1011
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,320
And here's the thing.

1012
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,820
We don't even want to see the thing.

1013
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:34,820
I know all about the thing.

1014
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,360
Maybe she has the thing that I was looking for.

1015
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,600
I was looking for a thing.

1016
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,340
The thing, can you take it?

1017
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,380
Can I take it?

1018
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,020
Yes, you must.

1019
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,600
The thing from the tree.

1020
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,280
the abyss. Speaking

1021
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,000
of the thing, you know, I drove

1022
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,600
here from

1023
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,760
Cleveland Bluffs, Ohio.

1024
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,360
And on I-10, I saw

1025
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,400
billboards saying, do you

1026
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,880
dare to see the thing?

1027
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,380
I didn't even know that thing was around

1028
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,360
anymore. Well, it's maybe a different

1029
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,640
thing. There was a thing

1030
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,480
that I saw as a youth

1031
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,020
that was a

1032
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,420
mistreated chimpanzee.

1033
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,640
Oh, really? I thought it was

1034
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,100
a mummy.

1035
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:16,860
I suspect

1036
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,400
that this particular thing is

1037
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,380
more probably a mummy or

1038
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,080
something because that chimpanzee

1039
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,220
must be dead by now.

1040
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,220
It was half dead when I saw it. You're not talking about John

1041
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,200
Carpenter's the thing. No.

1042
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,500
I'm talking about the thing. No, we're talking about the thing

1043
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,540
in Arizona. Can you take it?

1044
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,400
The thing, next six

1045
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,120
exits. The thing,

1046
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,820
fresh cherry cider for sale.

1047
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,480
Yeah, we chose not to

1048
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,620
pull over and see the thing for the simple

1049
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,080
reason that it was on the wrong side.

1050
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,260
Well, I have to tell a story now

1051
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,420
about the thing.

1052
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,340
We went to the thing to see the thing.

1053
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,540
What was the thing?

1054
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,900
The problem with going to see the thing

1055
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,380
is that you have to sign a document

1056
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,440
that you won't say what the thing is

1057
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,060
under penalty of death.

1058
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,740
Really? That's the...

1059
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,320
They have like the thing...

1060
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,340
They've got the thing police.

1061
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,780
We'll just start, we'll change it, we'll quit

1062
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,700
saying what old Seapaw is. We should do that.

1063
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,320
And make people sign a statement

1064
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,560
saying, I

1065
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,540
accept whatever happens to me, even at the...

1066
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,440
If I'm attacked

1067
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,660
by the thing, which we do not name.

1068
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,040
And I will not name the...

1069
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,980
It's like that Fight Club rule

1070
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,380
that everybody knows about.

1071
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,060
Who does take one subgenius every X day.

1072
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,700
There's always one less subgenius

1073
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,680
that paid to come in.

1074
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,780
That's like that Fight Club rule.

1075
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,820
They should be glad we're coming.

1076
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,740
Yes, you do not talk about Fight Club, etc., etc.,

1077
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:40,780
Fight Club, etc.

1078
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,440
Yeah, the first rule is the same as the

1079
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,080
second rule.

1080
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,620
The third rule is

1081
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,060
if C rule number one and two...

1082
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,240
That's sort of a Tarantino-esque, really.

1083
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,700
Dr. Drummond, for some reason

1084
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,440
your normally piercing voice

1085
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,720
doesn't seem to be coming through like it does...

1086
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,880
It's coming through for me.

1087
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,640
It's because I'm so tired

1088
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,620
and worn out over the tough...

1089
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,080
Perhaps you should adjust your level.

1090
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,680
...the tough work I had to do today,

1091
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,460
conspiring...

1092
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,120
Reverend Stang, adjust your level

1093
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,780
and you will hear Philo and Incense around

1094
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,440
and Regiscope.

1095
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,860
Today I had a particularly...

1096
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:15,080
I had a particularly...

1097
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,960
egregious, tiring day

1098
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,200
being a liaison with the conspiracy

1099
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,220
that I am for the church.

1100
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,960
Dad had a bad day at work.

1101
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,480
I have to go back into the conspiracy,

1102
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,140
the bucket, the gut of the conspiracy.

1103
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,900
He must burrow into the bowels

1104
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:31,920
of the conspiracy.

1105
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,080
I dive into the maw

1106
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,080
and then I slither down the throat

1107
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,940
into the very bowels of the conspiracy.

1108
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,040
Now I wish I hadn't pushed him up close

1109
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,720
to the mic because he's popping every beat.

1110
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,020
Please do not pop.

1111
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,540
That microphone pop.

1112
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,360
We expect better out of our visitors

1113
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,800
to the Ask Dr. Howell.

1114
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,920
So let's speak with utmost delicacy

1115
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,100
and circumspection.

1116
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,300
You don't need to drool on my...

1117
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,400
There is no screen between our abilities

1118
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,340
and what we articulate.

1119
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,560
I won't pop.

1120
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,700
I won't pop.

1121
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,640
No popping and pipping.

1122
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,120
I won't pop.

1123
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,400
I won't pop.

1124
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,220
I won't pop.

1125
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,360
Boy, I wish I knew how to take this one off.

1126
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,520
I'd put it on yours

1127
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,040
and then you'd be all right.

1128
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,540
Dr. Howell's microphone

1129
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,120
does have a special windscreen.

1130
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,420
Would it even fit

1131
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,340
on that old broken beat-up thing?

1132
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:29,180
No, it won't.

1133
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,080
It's made for that.

1134
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,180
I don't think I will.

1135
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,280
You have the good mic just accepted.

1136
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,160
Yes, I have the good mic

1137
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,080
and you have the bad mic

1138
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,920
and I'll be in Scotland before you.

1139
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,720
Mike Smith was the bad mic.

1140
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,860
And me and my true love,

1141
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,480
we'll never meet again

1142
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,720
on the bonnie, bonnie banks

1143
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,040
of Lake Potawatomi.

1144
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,220
I think it's a blown backer.

1145
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,100
A broke back.

1146
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,200
A brownback spider or like Sam Brownback?

1147
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,040
Right.

1148
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,480
Sam Brownbacker, 960.

1149
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,020
It's always in the 9 series.

1150
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,120
Have you noticed that about me?

1151
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,940
I have a question for us, Dr. Howell.

1152
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,360
What are you guys talking about?

1153
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,340
What are we talking about, Dr. Howell?

1154
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,480
Well, you know, the Confederates

1155
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,000
sometimes were known as butternuts.

1156
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,900
Also, they were known as brownbacks.

1157
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:18,640
What?

1158
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,720
Those who broke away from the Union

1159
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:26,320
by the soldiers in a loose argot of colloquialism.

1160
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,200
Some of them were known as mud bellies.

1161
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,100
They were called graybacks also,

1162
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,160
which is more understandable than brownbacks.

1163
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,780
Anyway, it is all...

1164
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,020
Some of them were known as lard eaters.

1165
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,140
They didn't tell that to us southern boys.

1166
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,220
We didn't ever...

1167
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:43,840
They'd make a large sandwich using lard as bread.

1168
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,060
What did you hear the men were?

1169
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:45,660
They were called...

1170
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,120
Lard busters.

1171
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,360
Really?

1172
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:48,880
Heroes.

1173
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,240
Heroes, of course.

1174
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:50,560
The Confederates.

1175
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:50,740
The...

1176
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,680
Yeah, heroes.

1177
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:52,440
Out of Texas.

1178
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,680
Well, it is all within the unknowable world of Allah.

1179
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,540
Only he knows.

1180
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,020
For none but Allah can tell.

1181
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,180
And I saw a documentary on the making of The Thing.

1182
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,100
No!

1183
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,000
Which The Thing?

1184
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,380
Uh, the 1982 or 83 one with John Carpenter.

1185
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:14,800
Uh...

1186
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,240
Okay, because I...

1187
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,720
As we were driving down Highway 10 out here,

1188
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,640
I kept seeing billboards to...

1189
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,960
Do you dare to see The Thing?

1190
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:23,920
Oh, yes.

1191
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,060
That's a different...

1192
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:25,860
How could I...

1193
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,700
The Thing seemed to be a gift shop.

1194
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,360
How would you like a kick?

1195
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,440
It was on the other side of the highway,

1196
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,920
so we didn't pull over, but...

1197
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,040
The Thing.

1198
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,180
Can you take it?

1199
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:34,740
The Thing.

1200
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,380
How would you like a kick?

1201
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,240
Well, can you take it now that you've seen it?

1202
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:39,640
Um...

1203
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,460
Uh, maybe.

1204
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,700
I may have mentioned this last week,

1205
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,120
but one time when I was a kid,

1206
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,040
my family...

1207
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,420
My family stopped on the highway to see The Thing,

1208
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,740
and it was an abused, aged chimpanzee.

1209
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,180
Where's my father?

1210
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,160
A hairless chimpanzee that picked all its own...

1211
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,100
scratched all its own hair off and lived in insanity.

1212
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,160
Oh.

1213
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,520
Yeah, oh, it was awful.

1214
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,780
That was The Thing.

1215
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,380
And I don't think anyone dares to see that thing anymore,

1216
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:07,760
because...

1217
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,340
You know where that was, Phineas?

1218
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,940
It was like 50 cents then,

1219
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:15,040
but I'm talking about in the middle of the previous century.

1220
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,040


1221
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,140
You know what highway that was, Phineas?

1222
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:18,580
666?

1223
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:19,500
Yep.

1224
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,700
Uh-huh.

1225
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,540
Lucky guess.

1226
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,220
Yep.

1227
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,520
The Thing.

1228
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,900
The Thing ones I saw were all on highway, uh, Interstate 10.

1229
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,140
The Thing.

1230
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,760
Dr. Hall was familiar with it.

1231
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,600
He knew about the Interstate 10 Thing.

1232
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,560
He said that one is a mummy.

1233
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:44,040
The one I saw was a live, abused chimpanzee,

1234
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,220
and the one he saw was a mummy.

1235
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,020
Ah.

1236
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,020
Bill, there's also a mummy in Portland that's kind of a thing.

1237
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:57,900
Down by the court in Portland, there's a museum of Goldado with a cool...

1238
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,940
No, it's a prospector mummy, I think.

1239
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,340
Is it near the Mystery Hole?

1240
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,760
Uh, it's in the same town as the Mystery Hole.

1241
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,640
Have you been to the Mystery Hole?

1242
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,040
I've been to the Mystery Hole.

1243
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,280
Man.

1244
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,760
Did you get the vapors of encouragement?

1245
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,400
There was the vapors of enthusiasm.

1246
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:25,640
You got a little jar of these vapors, and you signed the liability thing before you went down into the Mystery Hole.

1247
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,300
And then it was...

1248
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,940
It's like the whole world got tinier and tinier as you went down the ladder.

1249
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:33,520
Yeah, I like that.

1250
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,340
To the point where you couldn't even use the ladder, it got so tiny.

1251
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,520
And there were tiny doors at the bottom with tiny things on the other side of the tiny door.

1252
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,800
Thing one and thing two.

1253
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,080
I just remember everything being really tiny.

1254
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,360
Yeah. Well, but do you remember everything?

1255
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,580
Do you remember all the things?

1256
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:56,240
No, I don't. That's the weird thing about it. I just...

1257
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,580
Why? Things? See?

1258
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,220
It's one of those thing things.

1259
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,280
That's right.

1260
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:11,100
Well, doctors, I shall bid you adieu.

1261
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,240
Adieu.

1262
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,820
I should...

1263
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,300
Bid you a doo-doo.

1264
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,420
A doo-doo.

1265
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:16,840
Oui, oui.

1266
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:18,920
Monsignor.

1267
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:19,860
Oui, oui.

1268
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:20,640
A doo-doo.

1269
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,480
Keep up the good work and...

1270
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,060
Do you know who shot Liberty Valance?

1271
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,500
No, I don't.

1272
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:28,980
The man.

1273
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,640
Well, that's...

1274
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,140
It was the man who shot Liberty Valance.

1275
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:41,080
If anybody can actually successfully answer the question of the night, who shot Liberty Valance, please call us now at 510-846-8508.

1276
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:41,080


1277
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:41,700
We'll save the answer.

1278
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,560
Alfredo Garcia.

1279
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,120
Was that a porno movie?

1280
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,640
Yeah.

1281
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,100
Al Qaeda, Garcia.

1282
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,340
See, there's the porno movie. There's a porno title in there somewhere.

1283
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:58,320
Yeah, there is.

1284
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,820
Yeah, get the head of...

1285
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:00,780
Al Qaeda, Garcia.

1286
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,160
Al Qaeda, Garcia.

1287
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:07,480
Like Machete versus Osama Bin Laden.

1288
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,460
Porno movie.

1289
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:28,680
I've heard it said and it makes me fret America has a fascist threat.

1290
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,060
Which organization can it be?

1291
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,560
This is what perplexes me.

1292
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,720
So I think I'll take a little quiz.

1293
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,340
And find out just what fascism is

1294
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:47,600
Though some may think that it's extreme

1295
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,180
To find out what words really mean

1296
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,360
It has a party rather small

1297
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,920
That seeks to rule and govern all

1298
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,500
A single leader whom they say

1299
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,680
Everybody must obey

1300
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:12,100
Destroy the government with lies

1301
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,620
Seize control and centralize

1302
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:19,000
Very shortly you will see

1303
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,660
A fascist state monopoly

1304
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,780
Although we've used the fascist name

1305
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:31,320
Communism is just the same

1306
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,660
It's plain to see these two are twins

1307
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,480
And freedom dies

1308
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,200
If either wins

1309
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,240
One billion conquered should reveal

1310
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,940
The danger that is very real

1311
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:50,280
The greatest fascist threat you see

1312
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,760
Is the communist conspiracy

1313
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:59,220
So rally now to freedom's call

1314
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,680
Unafraid we'll stand up tall

1315
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,400
With faith and courage we will find

1316
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:09,640
Peace-souring for all mankind

1317
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:16,780
With faith and courage we will find

1318
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,720
Peace-souring for all mankind

1319
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:31,940
That interesting little bit was by Janet Green

1320
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,600
called Fascist Threat

1321
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,860
thanks to Greg Bishop

1322
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,660
who also donated the podcast

1323
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:36,660


1324
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:36,660


1325
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:36,660


1326
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,520
hot dog tree clip from some Herschel Gordon Lewis production.

1327
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,640
Thanks to Reverend Royal Decapitator,

1328
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:46,680
not to be confused with Tator Gumfries,

1329
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,020
for some of the collages.

1330
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,960
Thanks to Puzzling Evidence Show, KPFA,

1331
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,020
Ask Dr. Howell, Radio Valencia,

1332
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,500
Radio Synesthesia on WCSV,

1333
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,120
and the National Park Systems.

1334
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,540
The background music is the Swingin' Love Corpses,

1335
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,660
Deadly Swill.

1336
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:06,920
This is our Slack number 1360

1337
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,440
from the Church of the Subgenius,

1338
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,420
as seen and stashed on subgenius.com.

1339
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:18,860
Praise Bob, and also praise Princess We Are Doe.

1340
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,920
My wife sees faces in everything,

1341
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,180
smiling faces,

1342
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,160
and sometimes tell lies.

1343
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,720
And so ends the famous story.

1344
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,160
Listen in again next week to...

1345
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,880
Sire, there is no more money.

1346
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,300
We gotta get some money.

1347
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,940
That dirty purgish harker backflag

1348
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,500
Wharton, Phillip, Buck, and Burton,

1349
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,220
Perkaluma, Burton, Burton,

1350
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:00,980
Buston, Idaho.

1351
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:01,540
Whoa!

1352
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:06,100
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1353
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,460
and we're even more glad that some listeners

1354
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:10,860
have donated enough to help us keep on going

1355
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:12,400
for another couple of months.

1356
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,900
Not just this show, but subgenius.com

1357
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,420
and all the other archive sites.

1358
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,940
But if you truly love Bob,

1359
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,500
and want some of that Slack back to rebound to you,

1360
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,460
you should go to subgenius.com front page,

1361
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:29,980
or especially the radio page,

1362
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,020
or the catalog store pages,

1363
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,340
and help out financially as best you can.

1364
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,700
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1365
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,700
and we don't want any subgeniuses

1366
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,360
to make their own situations worse.

1367
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,360
But some of you still have jobs.

1368
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:49,640
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1369
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,720
even if it's only once a month,

1370
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,180
from enough of you.

1371
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,600
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1372
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,920
All we're saying is that

1373
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,360
blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs,

1374
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,380
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1375
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,980
We also take checks and money orders to

1376
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,860
Subgenius Foundation.

1377
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:15,220
P.O. Box 181-417

1378
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:22,320
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1379
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:27,560
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be Slack.

1380
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,500
perimeter

1381
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,720
the

1382
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:52,660
little house

1383
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:53,480
Ryan

1384
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,460
I start

1385
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:56,620
by

1386
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,040
right now

1387
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:58,160
well.

1388
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:58,160


1389
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,320
how do you pal?

1390
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,060
Green pills!

1391
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,860
Green pills!

1392
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,460
Kill me!
