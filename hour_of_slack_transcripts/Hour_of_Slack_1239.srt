1
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,980
The

2
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,160
Bob show. And here he is.

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,380
Ja, ja, ga, Bob.

4
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,240
Bob. Oh, Bob.

5
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,160
Please, Bob. Listen, Bob.

6
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,100
I think they mean ja, ja,

7
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,920
ga, Bob. I said ja, ja, ga, Bob.

8
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,140
Uh, it says ja, ja,

9
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,000
ga, Bob. Oh, now there's a dish

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,100
to capture the imagination.

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,020
It's some kind

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,060
of forecaster, and it shows

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,100
the future of anyone the operator thinks about.

14
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,980
Well, darling, that's

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,920
witchcraft. No, it isn't.

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,940
It's some kind of

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,940
forecaster, and it shows the

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,820
future of anyone the operator thinks about.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,620
There are ancient powers

20
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,020
gathering in this place.

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,260
Powers beyond the comprehension of unbelievers.

22
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:18,900
See?

23
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,520
See?

24
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,200
That was nothing.

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,460
But that's how it always begins.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,700
Very small.

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,780
Pray for these people.

28
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,400
Pray for these people.

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,400
Pray for these people.

30
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,780
Pray for these people.

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,100
We all need to love and pray for these people

32
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,980
as they continue to spread

33
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,140
life through the community.

34
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,920
They have passed out,

35
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,720
containing many lives,

36
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,140
and attacking the church and Christians.

37
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,720
They are şithere thought feelings as well.

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:12,940

there's a달â stra對啊

40
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,280

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,280


42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,280


43
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,280

49
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,080
What's the name of the woman,

50
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,320
who has almost become sl 따 in her heart?

51
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,580
It's the modern age.

52
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,540
È l'età moderna.

53
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,120
Excuse me a second.

54
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,740
Hello.

55
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,760
The electronics department, please.

56
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,880
Hey, how you doing?

57
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,440
You're a sound effects man, always fooling around with electronic devices.

58
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,440
Fooling around with electronic devices.

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,120
Tell me, do you suppose robots would enjoy listening to music?

60
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,020
Oh, all right.

61
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,360
It's the modern age.

62
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,100
It's the modern age.

63
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,160
It's the modern age.

64
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,400
It's the modern age.

65
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,460
It's the modern age.

66
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:53,880
It's the modern age.

67
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,180
Elevator, yeah.

68
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,760
Elevator, elevator, go down.

69
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,860
Elevator, elevator, go down.

70
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,960
It's a one way.

71
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,920
Elevator, elevator, go down.

72
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,900
Anything new?

73
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,260
Not quite.

74
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,380
Nothing new.

75
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,600
Your telephone is out of order.

76
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,740
Pachy, pachy, pachy, pachy, pachy, pachy.

77
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,840
You're remote.

78
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,020
Within a month, lo and behold, a miracle had occurred.

79
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,820
Within a month, within a month.

80
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,800
The sky is low.

81
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,300
The ground is flat.

82
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,780
The sky is high.

83
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,460
They meet together in the sky.

84
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,940
Dirt in the clouds, clouds in the ground.

85
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,580
Pork in the store sold by the pound.

86
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,700
I lie awake at night.

87
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,620
And poke my finger in my eye.

88
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,520
Your telephone is out of order.

89
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,720
The sky is low.

90
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,800
The ground is high.

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,680
They meet together in the sky.

92
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,920
Dirt in the clouds, clouds in the ground.

93
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,620
Pork in the store sold by the pound.

94
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,120
What do real estate agents do?

95
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,740
Have you found the men's phone?

96
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


97
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,760
Come.

98
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,380
To them they're alone

99
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,800
Within a month, lo and behold, a miracle had occurred.

100
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,540
Shining new hair had started to grow on his patchy bald areas.

101
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,520
And his itching and scratching decreased significantly.

102
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,520
Within a month, within a month.

103
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,720
The sky is low, the ground is high.

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,480
They meet together in the sky.

105
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,820
Like dirt in the clouds, clouds in the ground.

106
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,520
Pork in the store, soy by the pound.

107
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,600
They pretend they're selling houses.

108
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Closing the deals on cellular farms.

109
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,720
The

110
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,060
silver

111
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,060


112
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,060


113
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,060


114
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,060


115
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,060


116
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,060


117
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,060


118
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,060


119
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,060


120
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,060


121
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,060


122
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,060


123
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,120
apart

124
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,120


125
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,660
a

126
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,600
tire

127
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:01,600


128
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:01,740
It broke

129
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,460
apart

130
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:03,620
și

131
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:03,700
and

132
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,540
so

133
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,300
You know about the, uh, suppressed transmission, of course.

134
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,340
This is a songbook.

135
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,800
Just think.

136
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,000
All we have to do is read the words in the book,

137
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,300
learn the music,

138
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,120
and then sing the songs.

139
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,580
Oh, impossible.

140
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,100
I have never sung a song before.

141
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,040
No way.

142
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,080
It's weird, huh?

143
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,820
We can do anything once we set our minds to it.

144
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,020
Whatever you say.

145
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,260
I'll count to three.

146
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,140
And then we'll start playing them.

147
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,660
One, two, three.

148
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,360
Oh, was that music?

149
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,020
I don't think so.

150
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,900
Let's try again.

151
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,880
I don't think that's the way it's supposed to sound.

152
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,640
From PR News in Washington, I'm still denouncing PR.

153
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,660
Stang has died.

154
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,700
Stang says he died of pneumonia over the weekend in the jungles of southern Massachusetts.

155
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,020
Stang says he was kidnapped from his home late yesterday.

156
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,140
Stang was also the voice of PR News.

157
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,400
Well, it turns out it was too good to be true.

158
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,360
Yes, it was a little too good to be true, my friends.

159
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,080
But don't fret.

160
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,380
I'm sure there's an answer.

161
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,500
Somewhere.

162
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,800
And that answer lies within.

163
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,920
And boy, does it lie.

164
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,560
And lies and lies and lies.

165
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,020
And what we just heard.

166
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:10,040
The PR News, of course, was by the great Fernandes Lee Murr.

167
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,060
And before, he also did the case of the missing sense.

168
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,840
And the very first cuts at the beginning of this show.

169
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,440
Which is hour of slack number 1,239.

170
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,080
Live, in this case.

171
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,580
On 1-10-10.

172
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,380
Before Fernandes and Andy Stang.

173
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,860
We're actually this whole show.

174
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,520
We're playing music by our friends tonight.

175
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,800
And now that we're back.

176
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,500
Our previous friends there.

177
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,920
That mixed up music.

178
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,920
That.

179
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,360
Ended with the phrase.

180
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,380
Was that music?

181
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,240
Is from Rural War Room's latest CD.

182
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,440
Called The Flaming Yawn.

183
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,420
We'll be.

184
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,980
We outplayed some other Rural War Room earlier.

185
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,500
That was the one called It's the Modern Age.

186
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,680
It may be hard for you to tell some of these pieces apart.

187
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,720
Before Rural War Room, we had a little.

188
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,320
A short, simple march.

189
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,540
Called March of the E-Class Workers.

190
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,060
From Gadgeto's new CD.

191
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,060
Called Crystal Radio.

192
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,460
I think that's the name of it.

193
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,020
He's from Gadgeto.com.

194
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,340
Gadgeto is spelled G-A-D-G-E-T-T-O.

195
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,700
Gadgeto.

196
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,380
Rural War Room is at RuralWarRoom.com.

197
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,200
But we also heard something from what you might call.

198
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,060
Mark Hosler's solo album.

199
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,040
Negative Land presents Thick Mo Tackle.

200
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,520
Thick Mo Tactic.

201
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,180
Thick Mo Tactic is mostly Mark Hosler.

202
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,140
With a couple of other friends.

203
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,720
He did that song song.

204
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,260
With Lofty Music.

205
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,340
Called Pork in the Store.

206
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,460
From the Thick Mo Tactic album.

207
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,020
From Negative Land.com.

208
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,440
Negative Land, by the way, does not have an E in negative.

209
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,500
In case you ever wondered about that.

210
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,340
Only at the beginning, not at the end.

211
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:20,860
That's right.

212
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,700
And we had Reverend Sweetness McGee.

213
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,820
Gave us a little collage there.

214
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,360
As did Gadgeto with Pray for These People.

215
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,820
And we have a new collage, yes.

216
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,280
Called Local Color.

217
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,620
We got a couple of EPs from this person.

218
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,540
Don Music of Local Color.

219
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,280
He did the.

220
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,800
Well, we'll hear more of that in upcoming shows.

221
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,920
But you can find Local Color at.

222
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,700
This is a nice website URL.

223
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,760
Brainpanlitterbox.com.

224
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,040
This music in the background, by the way, is also rural war room.

225
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,200
And will probably be followed by some more music from Thick Mo Tactic.

226
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,540
Which is Reverend Mark Hosler of Negative Land.

227
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,220
And I think that covers it.

228
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,440
Lee Murr.

229
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,460
Gadgeto.

230
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,660
Sweetness McGee.

231
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,680
Rural War Room.

232
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,440
Mark Hosler.

233
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,140
And, yes.

234
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,420
I think that's it.

235
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,160
That's it?

236
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,020
That's the whole gang.

237
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,140
And Princess We is here.

238
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,620
The beautiful Princess We.

239
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,900
In fact, she's always here.

240
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,420
From now on.

241
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:32,620
Hi there.

242
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,340
She's never going to have to leave.

243
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,660
She can do anything she wants from now on.

244
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,160
Because.

245
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,980
Friends.

246
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,580
Princess We.

247
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,300
Our doe.

248
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,840
Queen of all the UFOs.

249
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,160
Retired.

250
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,420
She quit.

251
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,640
She repented.

252
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,680
Quit her job.

253
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,600
Of 30 years.

254
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,140
And slapped off.

255
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,360
Actually, it was one week shy of 30 years.

256
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,360
But they gave her three years for free.

257
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,180
Just for being her.

258
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,660
And when I'm not giddy.

259
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,540
I just have to wipe this silly grin off my face.

260
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,200
That just creeps up out of nowhere.

261
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,720
Wonderful.

262
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,420
So, friends.

263
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:11,840
It's.

264
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,140
It's.

265
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,140


266
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,140


267
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,140


268
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,140


269
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,140


270
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,140


271
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,140


272
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,140


273
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,140


274
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,560
We don't know what it's going to be like.

275
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:13,960
I mean.

276
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,380
For her, of course.

277
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,180
It's great.

278
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,880
And for me it will be great.

279
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,380
But.

280
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,100
I've been wondering about my career.

281
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,180
Because it's like.

282
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,520
If Princess We is home.

283
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,740
That means it's Saturday.

284
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,980
Well, if she's always home, that means it's the eternal Saturday.

285
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,080
And indeed.

286
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,280
We haven't been in the station here.

287
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,480
Because we've been on the eternal vacation.

288
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,260
We left.

289
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,920
For Stang Ranch in Stang County, Texas.

290
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,120
So, I just wanted to say thank you.

291
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,120


292
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,120


293
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,120


294
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,120


295
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,120


296
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,120


297
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,120


298
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,120


299
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,820
just before Existlessnessmas

300
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,360
and had an Existlessness vacation.

301
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:54,420
Flew from oddly warm Ohio to Texas

302
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,640
where it was 73 degrees the first day

303
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,060
and then it was a blizzard the next day.

304
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,780
Yes, friends, strange, strange weather.

305
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,000
You aren't supposed to have to shovel snow in North Texas.

306
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,700
Certainly not in Stang County

307
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,580
where there's always supposed to be a drought

308
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,960
according to the ancient Indian curse.

309
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,060
But instead we had snowstorms twice

310
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,360
while in sunny Texas.

311
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,780
Very, very strange.

312
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,880
Very strange.

313
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,680
Some might call these signs of the end times.

314
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,400
And we came home

315
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,760
and then we shoveled our driveway

316
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
and then we filled orders.

317
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,080
And all of those things took three days.

318
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,940
And we had to take pills

319
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,680
to...

320
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,680
to ease our pain from the...

321
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,860
But just regular pills,

322
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,760
not the kind...

323
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,980
not Bob's kind...

324
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,240
not them kind pills, Bob.

325
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,480
Not them kind pills, Bob.

326
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,560
Matter over mind.

327
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,720
That's what it is, friends.

328
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,380
If you take them kind pills,

329
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,480
it's...

330
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,100
you change the way your mind is working

331
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,680
by swallowing some matter.

332
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,480
In this case, ibuprofen, I think.

333
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,460
Probably would cut it.

334
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,680
Aspirin. Yes, aspirin.

335
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,260
Yeah, we've...

336
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,880
I guess...

337
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,800
And once we get this hour of slack done,

338
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,800
then I can answer my email

339
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,280
from the last three weeks.

340
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,840
See, we got our priorities right.

341
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,260
Joy!

342
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,360
We fill the orders

343
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,360
and send people their ordainments

344
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,460
or their books

345
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,980
or whatever they needed

346
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,780
that they ordered three weeks ago.

347
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,420
Those are all on the way.

348
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,340
It's in the mail.

349
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,140
It's in the mail, just like Bob said.

350
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,380
Oh, and we have other news.

351
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:42,740
Let's see.

352
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,000
Subgenius Devival coming up at Winterstar,

353
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,360
which is February 14th weekend, right?

354
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,320
That's right.

355
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,340
Valentine's Day weekend.

356
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,720
The only way to know about

357
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,580
the Winterstar Symposium

358
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,440
is to go to

359
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,760
roseandcomet.com

360
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,600
That's not Rose-in,

361
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,620
but roseandcomet.com

362
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,140
or just Google

363
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,080
Winterstar Symposium, I suppose.

364
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,620
Or Starwood Festival,

365
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,600
and you can get there that way, too.

366
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,180
That's right.

367
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,620
We're still trying to figure out

368
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,860
where Starwood's going to be.

369
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,700
In fact,

370
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,860
they're probably

371
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,520
hammering that out

372
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,140
right as we speak.

373
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,980
That is true.

374
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,760
This very, very moment.

375
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,040
Yeah, at this moment,

376
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
they're probably deciding

377
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,520
which of several places

378
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,500
to hold Starwood at,

379
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,860
but that will be for the first time.

380
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,220
That'll be the week after X-Day,

381
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,120
and X-Day is the week of July 5th.

382
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,160
Actually, X-Day ends July 5th.

383
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,460
It starts, and the world ends July 5th

384
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,300
at 7 in the morning.

385
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,000
It's that simple.

386
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,640
Indeed.

387
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,760
So I don't know why we're worried about Starwood,

388
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,140
but X-Day will be at the same old, same place

389
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,080
as always,

390
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,740
and you can look that up at subgenius.com,

391
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,180
although I think I have to get

392
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,400
the numbers going.

393
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,380
I see a little, I mean the web page.

394
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,740
I have to fix that web page.

395
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,800
I see a blinking square light.

396
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,640
What have I got here?

397
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,000
Is it the blinking of day?

398
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,940
Is it Dave?

399
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,840
The steamroller bowling bag was, wasn't it?

400
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,920
It was the psychic bowling bag.

401
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,480
Or the steamroller, either one.

402
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,300
Those are the ones I remember.

403
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,520
Okay, sure.

404
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,520
Back when I lived in Onion Town,

405
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,500
right next to Dobstown.

406
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,300
Little Hamlet, not too far.

407
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,200
Beautiful place.

408
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,220
That's that Cipriano onion, right?

409
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,180
Oh, yeah.

410
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,100
Yeah, they made them,

411
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,300
they double caramelized them

412
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,660
and whipped them up on the children.

413
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,440
Mm-mm.

414
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,860
Mm-mm.

415
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:39,840
Onion.

416
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,500
Children.

417
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,140
The bulb of Dobstown.

418
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,780
A little bulb hanging off.

419
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,320
You peel one layer away

420
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,620
and you still peel it.

421
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,340
Mm-mm.

422
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,140
Skin it back, friends.

423
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,080
That's for those of you with a five-kid.

424
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,940
Hold on to it while we run water through it.

425
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,480
That's what Bob said.

426
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,580
Bob's brain is like a sieve.

427
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,580
It holds only the spaghetti that it needs to hold.

428
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,400
Or whatever material.

429
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,420
Well, you pour, it's like a computer.

430
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,120
It's a box that you pry open.

431
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,600
And pour money into every month or so.

432
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,840
And everything else passes out,

433
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,080
but it holds the money.

434
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,020
It retains.

435
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,440
The Dob's brain retains the money.

436
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,700
In other ways, it's quite retarded.

437
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,780
Quite slow to pick up the beat.

438
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,280
The brain holds on to very few things

439
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,180
that don't have to do with finance

440
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,540
or the buskick artifacts.

441
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,120
So take care of your brain, friends.

442
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,700
Or it'll take care of you.

443
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,560
Take care of your brain's friends.

444
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,060
Those are all the other organs

445
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,700
that are contiguous with it.

446
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,480
If you don't take care of your brain,

447
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,540
someone else will take care of your brain for you.

448
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,640
Your mouth is directly connected to the brain,

449
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,060
so you have to brush your teeth,

450
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,220
shove that toothbrush way back in there,

451
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,540
and you can get the root of the brain.

452
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,880
The nose is a direct pathway to the brain.

453
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,300
And be careful when you're cleaning that out.

454
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,460
If you grab any of those long hairs

455
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,100
and pull too hard for too long,

456
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,220
you can uproot.

457
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,420
Again, you're uprooting part of the brain

458
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,480
because a long, slimy string

459
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,600
still connected to the brain,

460
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,480
as the swinging love corpse has described,

461
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,240
the booger.

462
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,380
And while you're there visiting the booger brain,

463
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,980
stop off at the Pineal Sands Rest Home and Vista Resort.

464
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,520
It's a beautiful place to take a look at what's happened

465
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,120
and what's going on.

466
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,120


467
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,240
What's going to happen in your head?

468
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,520
I'm afraid that's the only place it's going to happen.

469
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,220
Right.

470
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,720
In our minds.

471
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,820
In our mind's eye.

472
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,140
We're going to see all kinds of things.

473
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,960
We're going to see Big Sister get fatter,

474
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,880
with a P spelled P-H-A-T-T-E-R,

475
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,300
you know, like she's passing some meat, fatter.

476
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,580
And we're going to see everybody else on the land

477
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,660
become much leaner and more full of beans.

478
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,640
But that's the way of El Mondo, or El Mundo.

479
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,660
El Mondo, El Mundo.

480
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,040
The music we just heard there was Mark Osler,

481
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,040
or Thigmotactic.

482
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,580
It took me, I had to practice a while

483
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,720
to be able to say the name of his new solo band,

484
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:28,860
Thigmotactic.

485
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,200
It's tricky.

486
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,600
Does it have an arcane meaning, Thigmotactic?

487
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,200
Yeah, it does.

488
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,500
It's not a made-up word.

489
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,400
He found it in a book.

490
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,720
So, he found it somewhere,

491
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,960
and in context, I think it meant protecting oneself

492
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,160
or something along those lines.

493
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,680
I don't know.

494
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,400
But it was actually some pretty music.

495
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,700
It's funny how these olden bands that I used to know

496
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,080
back before they knew how to play music,

497
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,740
back when they were famous,

498
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,160
like the Devos and the Negative Lands,

499
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,400
over the years, and the Swingin' Love Corpses,

500
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,360
over the years, they...

501
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,340
They learn how to play.

502
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,960
That's horrible when that happens.

503
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,200
It's pretty, but it's different.

504
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,440
It is different.

505
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,100
They used to say that's what destroyed punk.

506
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,460
Not different.

507
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,240
Different.

508
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,240
Well, okay.

509
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,920
This is Speed Cave in the background

510
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,360
from our Friends of the Divergent.

511
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,860
Oh, Speed Cave?

512
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,380
Is emotional?

513
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,060
Beneferent?

514
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,520
I thought they were more just like a,

515
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,180
kind of a psychic pie you shove into your,

516
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:39,440
uh,

517
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:39,440


518
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,260
hypothalamus and just let it cook.

519
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,600
Or so you said once.

520
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,220
Oh, I can smell that pie cooking right now.

521
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,920
Call in to me.

522
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,740
Call in to me.

523
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,700
Come and take a chance, sonny boy.

524
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,860
There's plenty of steaming hot pie in here.

525
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,400
The kind that made America great.

526
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,420
Enjoy.

527
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,380
Feast on my brain.

528
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,500
Oh.

529
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,060
And you have to take care of your heart, too, friends.

530
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,040
And your heart.

531
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:09,440


532
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,280
And I'm gonna take care of it.

533
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,280


534
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,840
Dr. Legume could tell you about that

535
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,860
if he wasn't in the hospital right now.

536
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,800
That's some more news for many of you subgeniuses.

537
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,180
If you don't know Dr. Legume,

538
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,500
you're probably safer that way.

539
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,040
But many of you do know Dr. Legume

540
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,660
and many thousands more know of the fearsome Dr. Legume,

541
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,020
generally regarded as the, uh,

542
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,960
the subgenius tough guy, you might say.

543
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,920
The hulking man.

544
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,020
The hulking man.

545
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,480
Oh, a mountain.

546
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,080
Yeah, Dr. Katahdin Legume.

547
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,100
Uh, he's such a mighty man

548
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,220
that he had over, on New Year's Day,

549
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,840
or New Year's Eve, I don't know which,

550
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,660
he had three heart attacks.

551
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,900
Yes, but not only did he survive them,

552
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,580
he survived the subsequent five, count them,

553
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,080
five heart bypass surgeries.

554
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,140
Good Lord.

555
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,880
And we talked to him just yesterday.

556
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,000
He was, uh, feeling, uh,

557
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,700
he sounded a bit ragged around the edges.

558
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,920
Uh, but, um, uh, he informed us that,

559
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,560
just as I suspected,

560
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,660
it wasn't that he was out partying like a crazy man

561
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,320
on New Year's and gave himself three heart attacks

562
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,800
by doing all manner of drugs and staying up too late.

563
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,080
No.

564
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,900
As a matter of fact, uh,

565
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,460
he said that he hasn't smoked or drank anything,

566
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,080
not cigarettes, not nothing,

567
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,240
since the last time he saw us here in Cleveland,

568
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:38,900
which was Monday.

569
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,160
That's a month ago.

570
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,400
And because of that,

571
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,420
because of his, his New Year resolution

572
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,340
to be a healthful person,

573
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,920
he was probably out taking a nice healthful walk

574
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
like I do all the time.

575
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,020
Drinking vegetable juice at the same time.

576
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,380
Yeah.

577
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,740
Pure abstinence.

578
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,840
That's what gave him three, not one,

579
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,060
three heart attacks.

580
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,740
In other words, as he put it,

581
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,620
he almost died of nothing.

582
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,900
And that's, now, that's the subgenius for you.

583
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,160
We've, as subgeni, we must remember to pollute our health,

584
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,060
to continue to eat the foods that make us sick,

585
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,500
to continue to smoke three to four packs of cigarettes a day,

586
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,340
albeit with chronic bronchitis and a bad eye.

587
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,840
We must continue to shave our heads,

588
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,780
even though there's nothing but skull remaining.

589
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,260
It keeps us alive and going somewhere.

590
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,760
I have no idea where, but...

591
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,900
Strength through disfigurement, friends,

592
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,820
is the name of that, uh, doctrine.

593
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,820
You stick to the subgenius industrial diet,

594
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,380
uh, which includes a little bit of everything,

595
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,660
and I mean literally everything.

596
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,160
Heavy metals included.

597
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,100
Uh, and, uh, and that's,

598
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,520
it kind of builds up your immunities.

599
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,040
That's the idea.

600
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,160
You know, just don't restrain yourself from pleasure.

601
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,620
But, uh, attack yourself with it.

602
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,040
Beat yourself over the head with your pleasures

603
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,520
and build up an immunity.

604
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,880
And then free yourself from the need, the desire, you see.

605
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,380
All life is, uh, unsatisfied desire,

606
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,060
so you just free yourself from that

607
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:19,380
by fulfilling every sick, twisted, meh, desire.

608
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,960
As long as it's, uh, consensual, of course.

609
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,600
Uh...

610
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,020
Death.

611
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,260
They believe that in, uh, good, liberal doses,

612
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,280
that one should enjoy oneself.

613
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,520
Party to life!

614
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,360
Tiffulist.

615
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,980
Kill yourself with life!

616
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,000
Laugh yourself to death for crying out loud.

617
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,120
Live yourself to death!

618
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,560
Leave those droopy eyelids at home

619
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,900
and come on into the sanctuary of Bob.

620
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,860
Bob will comfort you like a large, sweaty womb

621
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,300
and will make you give birth to something unholy.

622
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,460
So come on by.

623
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:05,660
Ah.

624
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,640
Sometimes.

625
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,780
He does smell like a large, sweaty womb sometimes.

626
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,560
Well, you tried to get that effect,

627
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,620
and you succeeded.

628
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,000
I told you it wouldn't work.

629
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,000
We told you it probably maybe could work sometimes,

630
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,260
but probably wouldn't.

631
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
But you had to go ahead with the idea

632
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,940
of wombifying practically every artifact left in Dodge Town.

633
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,160
So...

634
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,680
there you go.

635
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,480
And, uh...

636
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,960
we all go.

637
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,440
We are here to go.

638
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,420
Oh.

639
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,240
Oh, by the way, Dr. Legume mentioned that, uh...

640
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,500
Now, this may come as a surprise,

641
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,020
but heart attacks hurt.

642
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:48,000
He said that the pain was enough to make you not want bacon.

643
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,300
Now, think of that!

644
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,400
Actually, we all...

645
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,520
You can imagine not being able to eat bacon

646
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,680
because you had a heart attack

647
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,480
and you don't need any more cholesterol.

648
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,340
But imagine it hurting so much that you don't even want it.

649
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,440
Or as...

650
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,680
Dr. Legume put it,

651
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,040
I've become bacon queer.

652
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,460
That was his way of putting it.

653
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,900
BQ is much shorter than Q.

654
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,200
Yeah, yeah.

655
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,420
So, you know, friends...

656
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,980
There's a lot of pork queers around,

657
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,760
I get around, too.

658
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,140
There's a lot of ham queers and whatnot.

659
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,040
Pork is sold in stores.

660
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,300
And not stored in any soul,

661
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,520
as the...

662
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:34,940
You know.

663
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,300
That's how the subgenius advertisement goes.

664
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,440
That was pretty.

665
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,640
So, uh...

666
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,560
So what else?

667
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,360
Well, you see, it's...

668
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,820
We're not concerned with health.

669
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,420
And we're not concerned with intelligence,

670
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,120
as the name subgenius shows.

671
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,080
But with something far more important

672
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,900
and far more slippery, which is sanity.

673
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,500
And $30.

674
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,440
Well, that's where you know we're sane

675
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,100
because we ain't giving it away.

676
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,700
You know we're not crazy

677
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,940
because we ain't giving it away.

678
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,740
Well, actually, we are.

679
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,560
We're giving it away right here on this radio.

680
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,400
We're giving away the clues and the hints

681
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,300
that will lead you to do the right thing

682
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,800
for your local radio station.

683
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,140
Yes, despite the fact that the airwaves

684
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,580
are bought and sold by the fascist imperialists

685
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,300
from Zoran.

686
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,680
Not all airwaves,

687
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,000
and certainly not to all internetery.

688
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,360
Some of the internetery is still free,

689
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:35,260
although increasingly you have to know where and how

690
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:35,900
to look.

691
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,440
I say search for the hard nipples.

692
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,220
You know the phrase in advertising?

693
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,120
When you look what gooses people's bumps,

694
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,880
that's where you're gonna know the money's gonna be made

695
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,240
and the airwaves are gonna be slopped and sold

696
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,960
like a slimy, slithering thing.

697
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,280
Well, I can tell you what greases people's bumps

698
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,520
is stupid stuff.

699
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,600
Because that's what's the most popular

700
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,960
and that's what they go for.

701
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,780
Now, of course, I say stupid.

702
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,840
Now, how can a subgenius call something else stupid?

703
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,980
Well, it's easy.

704
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,020
It's not that we're that much smarter.

705
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,880
It's that we're simply better.

706
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,500
Not prettier, not taller, not richer,

707
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,960
not more educated, not smarter, not more correct.

708
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,740
Just simply better.

709
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,700
And only because we've got Bob

710
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,720
and that subgenius minister's card in our wallets.

711
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,480
That's all it takes to be better.

712
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:34,960
Yeah.

713
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,740
Not smart.

714
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,280
Well, parts might be bigger.

715
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:43,000
The tongue, the ego, the other tools of the preacher

716
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,800
will swell with exercise.

717
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,140
And that's why we're preaching exercise.

718
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,280
Exercise your sanity like Dave here does.

719
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,680
He's a good example to follow.

720
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,720
I'm at a loss to figure out how I'm exercising sanity,

721
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,400
but didn't you want me to...

722
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:00,480
Pump it!

723
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,140
Pump it up!

724
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,140
Ah.

725
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,280
Like a big fat balloon.

726
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,780
Stretch it out.

727
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,840
Like an over...

728
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,200
A bladder that you held too long.

729
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,780
Like an incestuous...

730
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,740
Oh, never mind.

731
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,560
That was something else.

732
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,820
Hey, Dave, when was the last time you dropped?

733
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,500
While Princess and I were on vacation,

734
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,120
we dropped almost every day.

735
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,320
You did?

736
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:28,960
Yeah.

737
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,300
Yeah, most people say you can't drop,

738
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,480
but it's like...

739
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,640
But maybe every four days or so,

740
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,860
because you're just wasting it.

741
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,800
But every day, we took a drop of water

742
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,340
and dropped it on a slide

743
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,900
and looked at the tiny monsters in there.

744
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,640
You could never burn out doing that.

745
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:47,800
Through the microscope.

746
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,160
Well, we were in Texas out on the goat ranch.

747
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:58,640
And so we had availed to us slime and slime waters

748
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,060
that you can't find in frozen northern Ohio.

749
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,620
Cow tanks with...

750
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,040
Cows swimming around in them.

751
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,480
The big giant aquariums.

752
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,700
Stock ponds.

753
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,700
We found those things are full of evil seed.

754
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,680
Fresh, juicy slime.

755
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,620
Oh, the juiciest slime.

756
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:22,540
Ostracods and diatoms rolling around in there.

757
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,420
And a giant stomach-turning blob.

758
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,620
And I filmed it!

759
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,320
Dave, Dave, Dave, this is the most wonderful thing.

760
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,020
We discovered that we could actually shoot videos

761
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,540
through the microscope hole of the microscope.

762
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,220
Just sticking the damn thing up against the damn thing.

763
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,900
Yeah, so I can put this stuff, once I edit this down,

764
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,200
I can put some of it on YouTube.

765
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:46,320
But I've been filming the frolicking and raping

766
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,820
of the microbes that I look at under my microscope.

767
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,780
When I say a stomach-turning blob,

768
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:58,220
I mean a blob in whose body

769
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,520
you can visibly see the stomach rotating

770
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,840
and swirl around wildly.

771
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,940
And the strings of blob rotifer fecal matter.

772
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,280
In fact, I think this thing used its spinning stomach

773
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,440
to propel itself.

774
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,180
Well, there are animals or hypoplods down there

775
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,560
with third nostrils.

776
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,280
I would think that there's a number of things

777
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,300
that are echoed, if not perfectly mirrored,

778
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,840
in the subgenius world.

779
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,180
When you say you can see something's stomach

780
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,560
inside on the outside while it's rotting its materials away,

781
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,120
Yeah, yeah.

782
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,280
we can, by use of certain third nostril techniques,

783
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:42,060
see humans on the bus, on the street, at the grocery store.

784
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,980
We can watch their intestines.

785
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,680
And they don't even know that's the good part.

786
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,000
And that's why, you know, when you get slack,

787
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,420
it's kind of like an in-joke.

788
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,220
You walk out chuckling, and you realize

789
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,880
you've just seen 240 people's stomachs.

790
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,160
I mean, the internal parts of their stomachs.

791
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,460
And they just had no idea that you were,

792
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,100
why you were looking at them down there.

793
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,160
Like that, laughing at what they had for dinner last night.

794
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,440
I don't know. It's a wonderful world.

795
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,180
Wondrous world.

796
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,980
Well, at any subgenius gathering,

797
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,060
that's what you'll see.

798
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,140
An orgy of stomach pumping.

799
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,680
And as above, so below.

800
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,300
There are, just as you see things down there

801
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,900
in the microscopic world that perfectly coincide with things.

802
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,640
They correlate to things in the larger world

803
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,820
that we're dealing with.

804
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,000
For instance, there's a type of rotifer down there

805
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,220
that looks just like a child's drawing of a kitty cat.

806
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,720
Only it moves.

807
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,200
But it looks like a very simple,

808
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,340
you know, a kid can draw a little circle

809
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,460
on top of a big circle,

810
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,820
and it draws two little ears and a little tail.

811
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,480
And that's a kitty cat, right?

812
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,380
Well, there are things that really look like that,

813
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:00,900
that are alive.

814
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:04,530
And chasing tiny little mice

815
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,550
that look like a child's drawing of a mouse.

816
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,510
And little stick figure men

817
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,110
that look sort of like a man,

818
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,470
except they have no arms or legs,

819
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,270
or faces.

820
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,530
But otherwise, they're like little people

821
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,330
running around down there, raping and killing,

822
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,590
just like real people.

823
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,950
What we must come to understand and realize

824
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,990
is that in the microscopic world,

825
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,230
there's also a mirror of the world above,

826
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,010
which is the world we live in,

827
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,390
and above us,

828
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,570
in huge, grand scope and fashion.

829
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,930
People, not people,

830
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,070
but whatever may encompass a galaxy,

831
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,630
going around, wiping and stomping

832
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,990
even large kitty cats

833
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,570
drawn by even larger children.

834
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,550
Right, right.

835
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,290
We're the equivalent of a child's,

836
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,930
an elder god child's drawing

837
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,210
of an elder god.

838
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,990
We humans are.

839
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,710
And the elder gods are the equivalent

840
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,830
of a child's drawing,

841
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,630
a child,

842
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,470
an ancient,

843
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:01,950
ancient,

844
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,710
or I don't even know what goes past the elder gods.

845
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:05,990
Maybe just...

846
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,590
The Ancient of Days.

847
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,630
All right.

848
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,330
That's, you know,

849
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,010
that's in the pre-week,

850
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,010
the pre-Seven-Day-Week format.

851
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,710
It's hard to tell how many days

852
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,930
the Ancient of Days was,

853
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,730
but he was pretty old.

854
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,110
I know what's even older,

855
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,950
Bible Man.

856
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,150
We were staying with Doc Frop

857
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,250
and Sister Decadence,

858
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,550
and somebody as a joke gave Sister Decadence

859
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,210
a Bible Man action figure.

860
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,750
Well, this was new to us.

861
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,590
Actually, it was a Bible Man's villain

862
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,110
whose name was Cipher.

863
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,910
But we got to looking at it,

864
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,210
it was like,

865
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,810
Bible Man,

866
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,350
what franchise is this?

867
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:46,430
And there was a BibleMan.com

868
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,850
advertised on the box

869
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,710
of this stupid action toy.

870
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,910
So we looked at BibleMan.com

871
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,810
and that was like

872
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,290
the floodgates of stupidity

873
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,270
poured open upon us.

874
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,710
It was fabulous.

875
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:03,290
It turns out Bible Man is the hero

876
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,550
who fights evil with the Bible,

877
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,530
and there's a Bible girl

878
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,830
who's kind of cute,

879
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,410
probably an ex-porn star,

880
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,550
and they've made a couple of DVDs

881
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,910
that must be so bad

882
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,750
that I swear to God,

883
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,510
on BibleMan.com it says,

884
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:24,110
free DVDs, only $17.

885
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:25,890
And I quote.

886
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,550
And you, if you don't believe me,

887
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,170
go to BibleMan.com,

888
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,750
and look around a little bit,

889
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,670
and you will see that those Christians

890
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,630
are selling things free for $17.

891
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,010
And I thought,

892
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,270
well, we need to do that.

893
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,030
Actually, I believe that we have done that

894
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,310
now that I think about it.

895
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,130
I think that that's an old subgenius.

896
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,010
But the difference is

897
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,370
we did it on purpose.

898
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,710
Free, only $30, you know.

899
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,490
I think that the Christians

900
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,090
are doing it on purpose too,

901
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:56,890
Mr. Englewell.

902
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,390
I think that...

903
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:05,430
No, I don't think they were that self-hypermodernating.

904
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,730
You mean intelligent?

905
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:09,890
I wouldn't say.

906
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,010
Let's not dress it in those terms.

907
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,170
You mean them stump-dumping Bible readers

908
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,090
was too dumb to know that free and $17

909
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,670
didn't go together somehow?

910
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,890
Probably it was a web page,

911
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,990
and probably they add,

912
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,110
first it was free,

913
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,090
and then they added,

914
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,310
they let it be free for a while,

915
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,370
and then they added the price,

916
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:32,270
but they kind of forgot to take out the free part.

917
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,090
Oh, yeah, sure.

918
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:33,730
Because that was artwork,

919
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,810
and the free was a GIF graphic or something.

920
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,850
Sure, Stanga.

921
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,690
And the person designing the website got fired,

922
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:40,990
I know how that happened.

923
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,310
and a new person designing a new website

924
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,650
inadvertently left free in there

925
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,550
when they put $17 in there.

926
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,210
See, that can't happen at a subgenius website

927
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,150
because nobody can get fired from it

928
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,470
because I'm the only one who does it,

929
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,550
which is why it hasn't been changed much

930
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,810
except for weekly hours of Slack every now and then.

931
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:56,570
But I'll get to that.

932
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,150
And the occasional schizoid personality jumps and leaps,

933
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,030
which any schizophrenic will do,

934
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,310
they will become another person for a while.

935
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:03,610
No, that's different.

936
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,450
That's alt.slack,

937
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,950
which is not the same as subgenius.com.

938
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:11,670
Subgenius.com is controlled totally by yours truly.

939
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,570
And the conspiracy.

940
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,570
And it's really,

941
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,770
it's like a fly frozen in amber.

942
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,970
But, no, the conspiracy

943
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,470
doesn't really control subgenius.com.

944
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,510
Well, yeah, sort of.

945
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,550
I've had to take down a couple of them

946
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,930
and a couple of Scientology secret documents

947
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,630
that we had inadvertently published.

948
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,450
I mean, I didn't even know they were on there.

949
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,390
But they were actual literature.

950
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,030
Now, for the uncensored,

951
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,890
completely free subgenius land,

952
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,550
you can look at alt.slack.

953
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,090
You would have to Google alt.slack

954
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,230
to find it, most of you.

955
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,570
Because to most of you,

956
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,530
the internet is your browser.

957
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,130
In fact, it's not even your browser.

958
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,290
It's Yahoo or Google.

959
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,810
To you, that's the internet.

960
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,470
Google or Yahoo and a browser.

961
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,930
Because there's no other way

962
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,890
of doing the internet for you.

963
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,790
Because you're young and hip.

964
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:13,850
Think of the, what a browser really means.

965
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,550
I'm old.

966
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,230
I'm old and I'm an old geek

967
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,530
who works under the hood.

968
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,570
An old tool user.

969
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,290
Yep, I've been napping.

970
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,350
I used to nap code.

971
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,690
I'd take a chunk of flint

972
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,030
and nap out me some code

973
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,570
for like a gallery,

974
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,410
our graphics gallery or some such thing,

975
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,090
or a podcast.

976
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,010
That's the way we used to do it.

977
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,990
Kids can't do that now.

978
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,070
They just click on things.

979
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,070
But real old people can't even click on things.

980
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:45,470
My father, Pappy, actually said to me,

981
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,630
you people can click on links.

982
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,950
I can't do that.

983
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,030
Nobody ever taught me how to click on a link.

984
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:58,570
Nobody ever taught me how to click on it.

985
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,610
But the sad thing is, well, actually,

986
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,330
all of us had taught Pappy how to click on a link.

987
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,590
He just, he has trouble with the click twice business.

988
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,650
Well, he thinks, maybe he thought

989
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,850
that a click on link had some sort of secret meaning.

990
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,170
Like browser.

991
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,190
When we think of the word browser,

992
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,630
what is a browser really?

993
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,530
It's a person who errantly goes from shop to shop.

994
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:21,930
Look at this.

995
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,270
Looking for things to perhaps buy one day.

996
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,010
It has to do with procurement

997
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:29,410
and the evil of material necessity gone wild

998
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,830
or something like that.

999
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,450
So perhaps when he said click on links,

1000
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,830
he thought you had to do more than just go to the part

1001
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,270
where it said links and click on it.

1002
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:42,550
Well, he doesn't need to know that stuff

1003
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,670
because he's Pappy.

1004
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,310
I think if you were Pappy,

1005
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,190
you wouldn't even know how to click on a link anyway.

1006
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,030
People would click on them for you.

1007
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,450
Yeah.

1008
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,130
And that's the way it works.

1009
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:52,550
Well, you think of me that way.

1010
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,130
You think of me.

1011
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:54,770
Huh?

1012
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,550
Well, no, I was just going to say,

1013
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,190
you think of me that way.

1014
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:01,090
As an itinerant Pappy, I'm able to click on links.

1015
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,610
But just the other day, I showed a person of my,

1016
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,970
even younger than my own age group,

1017
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,370
that all they would have to do is scroll down there

1018
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,210
and click on it.

1019
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,950
And they were going, oh, okay, what do I do now?

1020
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,950
And I felt like I was literally staying with Dave.

1021
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,210
Wow, that's really pathetic.

1022
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,210
I felt like I was some sort of computer.

1023
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,270
Computer whiz banger.

1024
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:26,290
Well, Princess, we felt like that at her old workplace.

1025
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:30,370
Now, when she's home with me, she's the Dave and I'm the Stang.

1026
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:33,630
But when she goes to work, she's the Stang and they're the Daves

1027
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,930
that don't know how to click on things.

1028
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,990
Abso-clickingly.

1029
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,850
You know, so it's all relative.

1030
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:46,270
Now, that person that you were helping, I just don't know.

1031
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,850
I just don't know.

1032
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,210
Well, click technology helps.

1033
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,030
I'll pray for them.

1034
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,290
I'm going to pray for that person.

1035
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:52,410
Don't tell me who they are.

1036
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:55,070
I'll just pray in general for all those people.

1037
00:42:55,170 --> 00:43:00,050
And they'll probably die because I don't think God listens to my prayers.

1038
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:03,010
I think some evil monster listens to my prayers.

1039
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,150
I'm pretty sure of that, too.

1040
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,250
That's why I don't pray much.

1041
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,630
You know, I think it is an evil monster.

1042
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,670
But remember, if you want to light a candle in the window for this person

1043
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:14,250
or any group of people, try not to light the drapes on fire.

1044
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,150
That's an important part of that.

1045
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:20,090
And when you pray, try not to, you know,

1046
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:23,430
use those magic negative evil incantations.

1047
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:26,630
Try and wish or pray something positive on them.

1048
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,490
Well, think how many smarty pants subgeniuses there are out there

1049
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,410
that know how to click on the link,

1050
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:35,710
but they don't know how to not set their drapes on fire.

1051
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,970
They're sitting there kicking away on their links

1052
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:40,410
while their drapes are burning away

1053
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,750
and they're setting their ceiling on fire.

1054
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:43,990
Soon they're going to be burned up.

1055
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,350
Their face will literally be on fire

1056
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,750
like that guy at the end of Crank 2.

1057
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:50,570
High voltage.

1058
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:53,230
And spilt milk will be flaming all over their floor.

1059
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,470
Right. They'll be watching spilt milk burn,

1060
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:57,290
just like Bob told them not to do.

1061
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:00,310
But they can still click on links, boy,

1062
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,370
and they can write code.

1063
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:02,410
Hmm.

1064
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:03,730
Phooey.

1065
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:05,730
Phooey on them.

1066
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:10,850
We learned many things on our trip down south to Texas.

1067
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,490
Besides about Bible Man.

1068
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:18,990
We learned about a TV show and a whole network for men.

1069
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,590
The network is called Spike.

1070
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,470
I did not know such a thing existed.

1071
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:27,910
It turns out that there's networks just for women

1072
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:32,830
and networks for gay homosexuals

1073
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:34,910
and networks for all kinds of...

1074
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:38,250
and for people who like to see animals get cut apart.

1075
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,630
That's Princess Wee's mom's favorite.

1076
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:42,730
And the autopsy network.

1077
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:43,670
All kinds of...

1078
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:44,970
I didn't know this because I don't...

1079
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,190
you know, nobody ever showed me how to click...

1080
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,330
how to change a channel.

1081
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:49,670
Oh, it's been...

1082
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:50,610
I can click on links,

1083
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,450
but I'm not big with channel changing.

1084
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,550
It's just like Fireside Theater predicted.

1085
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,350
Yes, it is.

1086
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:58,290
It exactly and most certainly is.

1087
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:01,810
I remember the first time I saw an operating table

1088
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,090
and an operating theater with medical students

1089
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:08,550
as they disrupted a cadaver's eternal schlep

1090
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,950
with... on television on channel 332,

1091
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:13,370
which is a long channel.

1092
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:15,430
I'm telling you, man, it's...

1093
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:17,010
it's...

1094
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,110
it is, you know?

1095
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:23,010
We found a show that has got...

1096
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,130
I guess you might say it was...

1097
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:28,330
it's the dumbest thing I've ever seen on television,

1098
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:33,490
short of my favorite show, Owl My Balls,

1099
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:35,510
which doesn't really exist yet,

1100
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:37,410
but is on its way, obviously,

1101
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:40,530
because this show we saw called Mansers.

1102
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,970
It's Answers for Men on the Men channel.

1103
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:44,930
Mansers.

1104
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:45,930
Mm-hmm.

1105
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,530
I was blinking in disbelief.

1106
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:53,310
For, like, three episodes of it,

1107
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,750
I sat there going,

1108
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,290
I can't believe anybody watches this

1109
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,930
for three episodes in a row.

1110
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,490
You'd have to be unbelievably stupid

1111
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:03,030
or else new to television

1112
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,510
to watch three of these things in a row.

1113
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,050
But every five seconds,

1114
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,230
there was a jiggling bikini girl,

1115
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:15,010
and they would answer questions

1116
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:16,990
that concern all men.

1117
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,670
Like, can you flatulate enough

1118
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,930
to blow your...

1119
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:22,930
to explode your scrotum?

1120
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,990
That was a serious question asked

1121
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,130
in not such lofty language,

1122
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:29,330
in much more vulgar language.

1123
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,130
That was one.

1124
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:31,110
Another one was,

1125
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:34,550
what animal is best at self-abuse?

1126
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,890
What food in my refrigerator?

1127
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:38,610
Which, the answer, by the way,

1128
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:39,150
is the elephant,

1129
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:42,010
because he is prehensile nose and...

1130
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:45,330
elephant...

1131
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:45,950
elephant...

1132
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,090
membar.

1133
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:48,430
The...

1134
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,850
What food would be best for me

1135
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:51,690
to make love to

1136
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,110
that I would find in my refrigerator?

1137
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,430
The answer is veal,

1138
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,770
because it has more collagen.

1139
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:57,790
These...

1140
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:58,330
Oh, how...

1141
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:00,490
How's the best way to get a lesbian

1142
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:02,450
to make love to a man?

1143
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:03,970
I remember seeing that one.

1144
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:05,010
And the answer to that one was

1145
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:08,290
to wear the urine of a pregnant female.

1146
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,610
Mmm.

1147
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,050
Now, this was...

1148
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,850
The way I'm outlining this show

1149
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:15,310
is so vastly different

1150
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:18,210
and vastly more sophisticated-sounding

1151
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,170
than the way they actually talk on this show,

1152
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:24,430
because this is a nice radio station

1153
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:26,130
for families, you know.

1154
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,590
I'm sure there's lots of children

1155
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:28,770
listening right now, and...

1156
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:29,510
Oh, certainly.

1157
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,030
So we don't want to be like

1158
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,690
the Mansers show.

1159
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:34,970
It was like jackass or something,

1160
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:38,130
only, believe it or not,

1161
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,190
jackass style, you might say.

1162
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,850
But it did have a jiggling bikini girl

1163
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:43,890
every five seconds,

1164
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:45,290
whether they were talking about women,

1165
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,950
whether she had anything to do

1166
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:49,630
with the show or not.

1167
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:52,310
It was Al My Ball's come to life.

1168
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:53,690
Right, and that's what...

1169
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:54,950
I was just thinking that

1170
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,750
if the Church of Subgenius

1171
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,010
had any of those balls,

1172
00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:59,930
that's the first thing they would do

1173
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:00,910
would be start their own

1174
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,310
replicant channel on 300...

1175
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:04,450
Or 953.

1176
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:05,970
Well, we are...

1177
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:06,750
We do have a start.

1178
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:07,570
Called Al My Balls,

1179
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:09,990
and really do Al My Balls.

1180
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:12,730
And I would say get far more specific

1181
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,310
than the concept of Al My Balls.

1182
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:15,070
Bob's.

1183
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:16,990
No, that's stupid.

1184
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:20,430
Well, if they look like Bob,

1185
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:21,830
then why not?

1186
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,270
Damn the torpedoes full speed ahead.

1187
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:25,870
I've got one that looks like Bob

1188
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,050
with a little tiny pipe.

1189
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:31,950
Well, you're not unusual in that respect.

1190
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,350
So many of us do nowadays.

1191
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:37,250
Well, when you get the surgery at Dobstown,

1192
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:39,350
but not many people can afford that.

1193
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:40,370
I got mine for free.

1194
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:42,370
Well, not free.

1195
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,490
I paid, but...

1196
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:45,310
Not with money.

1197
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:49,550
Paid with blood and sweat and urine and...

1198
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:49,790
Yeah.

1199
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:50,050
Mine.

1200
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,390
Blown out areas.

1201
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:57,190
Well, I would like to say that in the trades,

1202
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:00,270
what is it when they blur things

1203
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,570
when you're going through the airport?

1204
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,930
I had no idea that the father

1205
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:08,630
of the underpants bomber

1206
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:11,530
has close ties with the oil industry

1207
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:14,090
and the banking industry and even Mossad.

1208
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,450
Isn't that weird?

1209
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,790
Oh, the most recent bomber?

1210
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:18,670
Yeah.

1211
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,570
Oh, no, I didn't know that.

1212
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:21,230
Where did you...

1213
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,170
I didn't know that.

1214
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,330
But see, I'm just one of the sheeple.

1215
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:29,150
I don't believe anything I read on the internet.

1216
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:31,890
Oh, you can't believe also sheeple

1217
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:34,470
how many of the right wing talk show hosts

1218
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:36,430
have taken to calling anybody

1219
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:38,570
who doesn't agree with what they say

1220
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:39,270
a sheeple now.

1221
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:39,830
Yes, I know.

1222
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,610
And they think they invented that.

1223
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:42,250
That was my...

1224
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:42,690
I know.

1225
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:43,690
That was my point.

1226
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,870
And everyone knows that I invented it.

1227
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:46,230
That's right.

1228
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:49,770
Well, in fact, I'm pretty sure

1229
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:54,850
that we could probably find an ancient ESO show

1230
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:57,290
or Swamp Radio or Brain Rot or something

1231
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:59,770
which predates, which uses that term,

1232
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:02,330
predating dating itself.

1233
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:04,910
But as we know...

1234
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:05,990
Because back in those days,

1235
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,290
all you had to date was sheep.

1236
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,610
You people really were sheeple

1237
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:12,030
because they love their little sheep out there.

1238
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:13,230
And they would say,

1239
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:14,390
what's wrong with Herm?

1240
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:15,350
And we'd say,

1241
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:16,170
it's ew.

1242
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:21,570
But I remember when we first used those phrases incorrectly,

1243
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:24,230
there was a crazy guy in Texas.

1244
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:26,670
I'm pretty sure it's nobody that you know

1245
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:29,830
who was one of these like militia type guys

1246
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:31,170
who called everyone sheeple.

1247
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,350
Are you talking about Alex Jones?

1248
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,630
No, this is pre-Alex Jones.

1249
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:37,450
Remember, Alex Jones was pre-Alex Jones

1250
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:39,130
when he was in Texas.

1251
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,530
He was a guy in Texas

1252
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,670
that drove around in his pickup truck.

1253
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:42,810
He was a guy in Texas

1254
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:42,810


1255
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,270
hollering through a bullhorn.

1256
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:47,110
Now he hollers through his podcast.

1257
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,410
I think he's nuts myself

1258
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:54,110
because he's not a man of Bob.

1259
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:57,410
I looked on the membership on the Book of Life

1260
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:59,350
and I didn't see the name Alex Jones in there.

1261
00:50:59,470 --> 00:50:59,870
There is none.

1262
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:01,270
Well, there is another Alex Jones

1263
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,210
from Topeka, Kansas who is a...

1264
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:04,670
Oh, that one's saved.

1265
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:06,050
That one's saved, sure.

1266
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:10,490
He's what the first Alex Jones would call a sheeple.

1267
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,190
And yet he paid.

1268
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:12,650
Oh, my God.

1269
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,830
He's a subgenius ordained minister

1270
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:16,050
and so he's going to go to heaven

1271
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:17,530
and Alex Jones ain't.

1272
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:19,310
Alex Jones is going to die

1273
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,910
with the rest of the pinks

1274
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,470
and the quote sheeple.

1275
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:22,850
Me.

1276
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:24,270
Unquote.

1277
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:26,330
If you don't mind.

1278
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,270
If you don't mind me putting it that way.

1279
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:30,070
If you don't mind me being so bold

1280
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,690
as to intimate

1281
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:36,110
that perhaps somebody that didn't get behind J.R. Bob Dobbs

1282
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:39,310
and memorized Book of the Subgenius

1283
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:40,750
might be a dumbass.

1284
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,330
I wouldn't mean to.

1285
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:44,290
Intimate such a...

1286
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:49,690
I wouldn't want to imply something harsh like that.

1287
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:51,270
How you're bald.

1288
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:54,190
You're so brash and brassy.

1289
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:56,730
Oh, God.

1290
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,410
And here's another thing.

1291
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:00,370
This is how I know there's a conspiracy.

1292
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:05,050
You can't buy ranch-style beans up here in Ohio.

1293
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:07,670
I looked.

1294
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,170
I checked.

1295
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,750
I can't find ranch-style beans.

1296
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:11,750
Now, I went down to Texas.

1297
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:13,510
I bought seven cases of them

1298
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,850
and had them shipped up here.

1299
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:15,610
So I'm fine.

1300
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:16,110
I'm set.

1301
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,010
My friends and listeners down in Texas

1302
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,530
don't need to send me any more cases of ranch-style beans.

1303
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:22,830
But can you believe they don't?

1304
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:25,270
Well, you never even heard of them, have you, Dave?

1305
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:27,770
No, I have bought them at Ohio stores,

1306
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:28,970
not only in Cleveland,

1307
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,990
but out here in the far-flung sticks of Cleveland.

1308
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:31,110
You have?

1309
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:32,050
Yes.

1310
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:36,430
They're not a, you know, everyday Boston-baked or pork.

1311
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:40,150
And they're kind of slightly specialty items right now.

1312
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:41,730
Now, this is ranch-style brand.

1313
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,750
I don't mean ranch-style flavor.

1314
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,150
Sure, sure.

1315
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:50,610
But Bush's has ranch-style, chili-style beans and stuff.

1316
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:53,290
No, this is a brand in Texas.

1317
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:56,210
It used to, it had a very distinctive can

1318
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:59,430
that had a drawing of a cowboy on it,

1319
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:00,050
and it said,

1320
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:01,970
Husband Pleasing.

1321
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:03,970
Well, wouldn't you know,

1322
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:06,150
around towards the end of the 70s,

1323
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,290
suddenly it changed to

1324
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,130
Appetite Pleasing.

1325
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:14,890
Because apparently it's wrong to please a husband.

1326
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:16,490
Especially if he's not your husband,

1327
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:16,490


1328
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:18,790
Unless you mention also pleasing the wife,

1329
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:21,670
or then, well, you might be implying that marriage

1330
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:25,470
is somehow supposed to be a man or a woman.

1331
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:28,590
And of course, that's against the law now to intimate.

1332
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:32,110
I'm starting to sound like my dad now.

1333
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:36,230
You don't want mommy in the kitchen all day,

1334
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:38,430
doing the mommy stuff all day.

1335
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,130
Man gotta be a man.

1336
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:42,010
I'm trying to get in there, helping out once in a while,

1337
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:44,150
while he's rustling down the couch.

1338
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,250
While I was on vacation,

1339
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:52,650
I read a, somebody on the subgenius news group,

1340
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,650
alt.slack, was, it was some,

1341
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:57,910
a new person calling itself Negative Guy.

1342
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:02,210
And Negative Guy said that he hated happy people,

1343
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,370
especially families,

1344
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:09,230
because happy people didn't know how utterly screwed we are.

1345
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:11,850
And that made me jealous.

1346
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,090
I got to where I was thinking,

1347
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:16,390
I'm kind of jealous of all those unhappy people

1348
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:17,230
who hate everything.

1349
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:18,670
The hate-filled people.

1350
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,750
I've lost my hate.

1351
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,310
I've got a family.

1352
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:27,670
I don't know how completely screwed we are, apparently.

1353
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,790
And now I feel like I'm missing something,

1354
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:34,130
not being unhappy and full of hate anymore.

1355
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:38,190
I vaguely remember being unhappy and full of hate, but,

1356
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,050
I remember, it's not the same.

1357
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,350
If you're, you know, it's kind of like LSD.

1358
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:45,810
You're either, you're on the bus or you're off the bus.

1359
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,130
You're on your brain and drugs,

1360
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:49,770
or you're off the brain and the drugs.

1361
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,870
You can't describe it.

1362
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:55,850
And I can't, I can't,

1363
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:59,810
I'm having trouble remembering extreme unhappiness.

1364
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:00,930
Maybe you can help me.

1365
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:04,450
Oh, you mean me personally or we or the audience?

1366
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:06,130
Oh, anybody, somebody.

1367
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:07,490
Well, then.

1368
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:09,950
Can help to make me remember what it's like,

1369
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:13,050
to be, to really hate everybody.

1370
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:18,130
Well, as a young high he popped of the church,

1371
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:21,510
I have seen your early videos and you definitely

1372
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:25,230
were filled with a vile, vituperous,

1373
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,150
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1374
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:27,470
and a shining form of hatred.

1375
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:27,750
Yeah.

1376
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:30,530
A kind of luminescent, incandescent hatred,

1377
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:33,430
which burst through the screen like a photon beam

1378
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,690
and right into the brain of the viewer, making them go,

1379
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:39,050
Yeah, I hate them suckers too.

1380
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:39,630
Yeah.

1381
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:47,790
You know, and that's what got me going on it.

1382
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:52,390
And so I am literally heart wrenched to hear that you've lost a great deal.

1383
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:52,910
I know, man.

1384
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:54,350
All I've got left is slack.

1385
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:55,310
Comely hatred.

1386
00:55:55,330 --> 00:56:00,490
God, if only I could get rid of this slack and get my unhappiness back.

1387
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,230
Oh, wait, wait.

1388
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:03,910
I started to get it.

1389
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:05,370
I started to get it just then.

1390
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:08,850
I've lost it.

1391
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:09,030
I've lost it.

1392
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:09,030


1393
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:09,030


1394
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:09,030


1395
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:09,030


1396
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:15,690
I hear Princess We Laugh and my heart flies like a hawk and I can't.

1397
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,090
Shores like an eagle.

1398
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:21,690
I need to think about what I'm missing out on.

1399
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:28,530
All that hate, that juicy, glorious, mouth-watering hate.

1400
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:32,090
Oh, and feeling sorry for oneself.

1401
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,870
That's a juicy emotion.

1402
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,750
You can really milk that.

1403
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:37,190
Oh, look at where we're stopped here.

1404
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:38,150
You can milk hate.

1405
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:39,810
And you can milk self-pity.

1406
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:42,130
The two go together pretty well.

1407
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:44,910
When you're all hate-filled, then you feel bad, though.

1408
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:46,570
You don't like feeling bad, do you?

1409
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:49,690
Don't you like to feel good?

1410
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:56,710
Well, I do feel bad that I feel like I'm, like I said, all those unhappy people.

1411
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:58,690
I'm jealous.

1412
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,370
I'm missing it.

1413
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:03,870
I just don't, I'm so confused.

1414
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:07,250
I could see your house from here.

1415
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:07,630
Oh, my God.

1416
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:09,890
Oh, the Ferris Wheel of emotion.

1417
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:13,170
It goes with this music so inappropriately.

1418
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:13,790
I looked down below and...

1419
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:16,770
It's this music by Speed Cave of speedcave.com.

1420
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:18,270
Look, there's a few...

1421
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:18,890
Look, wait, wait.

1422
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,010
We're coming up to the top again.

1423
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:22,690
I can see more Speed Cavers running away.

1424
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:24,690
Something, something, a bomb just went off.

1425
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:25,930
Holy crutch.

1426
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:26,790
Oh, man.

1427
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:28,790
Oh, the Ferris Wheel stopped.

1428
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:32,390
I hate, I love, I have, nappy, shappy.

1429
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:35,150
I hate, I love, I have, nappy, shappy.

1430
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:36,790
I hate, I love, I have, nappy, shappy.

1431
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,150
That's pretty good.

1432
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:41,030
I'm going to make a loop of that noise there.

1433
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:45,070
I hate, I love, I have, nappy, shappy.

1434
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:49,030
I hate, I love, I have, nappy, shappy.

1435
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:50,670
Yeah.

1436
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:51,710
Oh, man.

1437
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,630
I hope that guy gets down.

1438
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:58,570
See, Dave, you just started to launch into a kind of an improv skit.

1439
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:03,530
Now, back when I was a hateman, I used to be able to jump into those skits right along

1440
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:04,030
with you.

1441
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:12,930
and now I'm just, it's like I'm too sane or sold out, pink, rational, normal.

1442
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:17,470
Stan, I must tell you, from the yogic point of view...

1443
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:19,590
Is slack bad? Is slack wrong?

1444
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:22,830
From the yogic point of view, slack is not wrong,

1445
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:25,290
but you must have an indifference to anger.

1446
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:27,430
You must have an indifference to evil.

1447
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:31,210
The conspiracy must make you go, oh, instead of,

1448
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:34,510
I'm going to kill him, wait, the exes are going to kill him,

1449
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:36,070
and I'm going to sit by and laugh.

1450
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,070
Hey, you know what I just realized?

1451
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:40,830
We have to go. The show's over now,

1452
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:44,130
and if I go on for another two seconds, that's the end of it.

1453
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:45,950
Friends, you've been listening to The Hour of Slack

1454
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,890
from the Church of the Subgenius.

1455
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:50,190
For more information about the Church of the Subgenius,

1456
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:53,090
you can look at subgenius.com,

1457
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:57,650
or you can write to P.O. Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1458
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:00,930
