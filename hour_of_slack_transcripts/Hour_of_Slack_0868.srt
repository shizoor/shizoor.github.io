1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Ready? One, two, ready, go!

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,420
Thank you.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,440
Like to drop by the fantastic bag?

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,940
Well, welcome to the hour of slack.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,840
Praise Bob Gold and Connie Drag.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,660
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,340
Look what you get. You get the nonstick crab basket.

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,980
You get a package of elastic chicken cakes.

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,780
And one more thing, folks.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,600
Of course you're going to get pot.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,640
Please return it to us.

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,080
My house smells inside.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,480
My favorite thing is that the food comes out.

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,540
My husband hates chicken, so I made the chicken the other night.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,520
And he's like, chicken, chicken.

16
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,640
I really appreciate the fat on the meat.

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,060
Another thing that's really nice, you can have a cocktail.

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,480
My favorite thing.

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,180
Is the fact that it's my family.

20
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,280
You salmon is too dry, a little too soggy.

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,580
And the family kept saying,

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,700
I like the oven.

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,580
I came home and made my husband chicken.

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,960
Such a wonderful shock.

25
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,460
We just love that machine.

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,280
The machine surprised me.

27
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,760
In the woods, it's fabulous.

28
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,060
I love electricity.

29
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,360
Call now and order the all-purpose chicken video

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,980
and an instructional nonstick platform.

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,400
Order right now.

32
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,400
And you'll also get 30 gloves worth $250.

33
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,260
Order right now.

34
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,500
And you'll also get the $30 dual chicken ties

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,920
for only 400 easy payments of only $19.99 plus SNH.

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,640
Or send $99.99, $99.95 plus SNH to Beverly Hills, California.

37
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,320
Hurrah!

38
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,380
Hurrah!

39
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,540
As soon as you're born, they make you feel small.

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,560
By giving you no time instead of it all.

41
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,580
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all.

42
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,400
A working class hero is something to be.

43
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,480
A working class hero is something to be.

44
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,700
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school.

45
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,880
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool.

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,720
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules.

47
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,640
A working class hero is something to be.

48
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:58,640


49
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:58,640


50
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,300
A working class hero is something to be.

51
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,360
A working class hero is something to be.

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,360
When they've tortured and scared you for 20 odd years.

53
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,260
Then they expect you to pick a career.

54
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,720
Then they expect you to pick a career.

55
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,680
When you can't really function

56
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,260
You're so full of fear.

57
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,060
A working class hero is something to be.

58
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,180
A working class hero is something to be.

59
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,320
Keep you doped with religion, sex and TV

60
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,240
A working class hero is something to be.

61
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,260
Keep you doped with religion, sex and TV.

62
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,280


63
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,620
A working class hero is something to be.

64
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:58,620


65
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,480
And you think you're so clever and classless and free

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,140
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see

67
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,100
A working class hero is something to be

68
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:26,620
A working class hero is something to be

69
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,360
There's room at the top, they are telling you still

70
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,880
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill

71
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,620
If you want to be like the folks on the hill

72
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,600
A working class hero

73
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,280
is something to be

74
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,760
A working class hero is something to be

75
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,460
If you want to be a hero well just follow me

76
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,240
If you want to be a hero well just follow me

77
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,940
I am a subgenius and by that virtue I am in touch with forces greater than men

78
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,180
I dare you to kill me, I am not a dupe of the conspiracy, I know more than they do

79
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,760
I am a subgenius, that's all I need to be

80
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,880
Fuck, I'm one of the good guys, I shall prevail

81
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,680
Let out the crazy man inside you, he knows what's what

82
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,140
Smile when you call me a fanatic, me primate, me overman

83
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,220
I say to the pigs, give me your money, you won't need it, the future offers you not for destruction

84
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,100
Unlike this 500 pound mouse that is inside of you

85
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,740
Jesus spoke of it when he said, here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty

86
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,200
The United Nations would betray the purpose of its founding

87
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:16,840
Members of Congress of both political parties agree that the United Nations Security Council is a threat to peace

88
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,320
We agree that horrible poisons and diseases

89
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,200
And gases and atomic weapons

90
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,720
Since we all agree on this goal, the issue is how best can we achieve it

91
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,220
What I can't understand is why no one has seen them until now

92
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,000
Many Americans have raised legitimate questions

93
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:44,480
If they follow the usual pattern of their species, the nest may contain from several hundreds to several thousands

94
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:51,060
The head of more than 30,000 anthrax had likely produced two to four times that amount

95
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,820
And that's why I'm here

96
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,400
If we know dangerous weapons, does it make more dangerous weapons?

97
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,780
This is capable of killing at least 20 people

98
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,700
We produce thousands of tons of sarin nerve gas

99
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,360
These actions killed or injured at least 20 people

100
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,540
More than six people died in the attacks

101
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,780
And surveillance weapons

102
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,220
Every chemical and biological weapon of the war in 91

103
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,140
And we do despite isolation from the civilized world

104
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,720
How she got that way will never be known

105
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,120
In a region where more than 135,000 American civilians with a likely range of hundreds of miles

106
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,940
That could be used to disperse chemical or biological areas

107
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,340
We're targeting Saudi Arabia, Israel and other Turkey nations

108
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,720
Without leaving any fingerprints

109
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:56,420
And of course, all that might be required are a small container in the United States to deliver it

110
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,320
Now you're talking, talking like a man

111
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:06,800
And that is including 12 Americans killing an American passenger

112
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,760
We know that Iraq and the United States of America go back a decade

113
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,820
We know that Iraq and the United States have had high level contacts

114
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,200
These include chemical and biological weapons

115
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,840
And biological attacks

116
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,460
We've learned bomb making

117
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,380
And poisons

118
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,580
And we know that after deadly gases

119
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,300
We've gleefully celebrated

120
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,160
The instruments of mass death and destruction

121
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,200
May God

122
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,840
Leave it all

123
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,580
Just the one he got to hitting that bottle

124
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,920
And an era of new hope will begin

125
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,680
Right

126
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,880
Right

127
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,660
Right

128
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,360
Right

129
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,520
Yes

130
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,820
Jed Clampett's awesome experiments will never leave this room.

131
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,440
Yeah!

132
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:35,660
You know?

133
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,480
We just need to get out of here now.

134
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:38,860
What's that spell?

135
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,800
What's that spell?

136
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,420
Yeah.

137
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,700
What's that spell?

138
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,640
No, I don't think we...

139
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,260
If one of those Kraut gunners get him, he's a goner.

140
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,620
Or maybe we should...

141
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,940
Ah, yes, dear friends.

142
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,020
That was ESO Radio.

143
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,380
Thanks to WCSB and Claymore.

144
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,500
And thanks to...

145
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:05,500


146
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:05,500


147
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,900
Thanks to Professor Chaz, Smith, Lonson Cowboy, Dave, Princess Wiardo, and your surely Reverend

148
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,760
Ivan saying, we've also been hearing lots and lots of Leemur.

149
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:22,620
That's right, cut-ups by Fernandinende Leemur, the great graphic artist of alt.binary slack

150
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:29,520
and now the great class cut-up of our of slack.

151
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,100
Slack, good slack.

152
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,480
And speaking of slack, friends, I was poking around on the internet.

153
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,840
Looking at alt.binary sounds MP3 full CDs.

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,220
And I found this Brazilian band.

155
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,500
It had a cool name, Ligia Urbana.

156
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,520
And it was doing...

157
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,540
Most of their stuff was in Portuguese, but they were doing this one song in English that I was familiar with.

158
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,620
And I downloaded it and listened to it.

159
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,100
And it's...

160
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,540
Friends, it falls into the category of Inadvertible Data.

161
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,000
In this case, tell me if you don't think this is Jim.

162
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,260
Jim Morrison beats Billy Idol.

163
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,420
This is Jim Morrison, the original sequencer strange, belong to

164
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:51,900
the past, who Quantum linen is from Winterqueen.

165
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,620
This move stops the pattern.

166
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,360
It has to be said.

167
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:54,600
That is a mediocre version.

168
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,000
No doubt.

169
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,540
It's difficult.

170
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,400
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away

171
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,340
Love, sister, it's just a kiss away

172
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,320
See the fire burning down my street

173
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,640
See the fire burning down like coal

174
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,900
See the fire burning down my street

175
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,100
See the fire and there's no fucking place to go

176
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,740
Where are the drugs? Where are the drugs?

177
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,940
Where are the drugs? Where are the drugs?

178
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,500
Give me a shelter

179
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,460
Come on, baby, give me a shelter tonight

180
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,280
It burns like a red coal carpet

181
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,040
Burns like a red coal carpet

182
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,140
Burns like a red coal carpet, man

183
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah

184
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,400
See a storm is coming

185
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:01,820
Yeah

186
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,260
My very life, my very life

187
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,820
Yeah

188
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,560
Come on, come on, come on

189
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,340
Give me a shelter

190
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,760
Give me a shelter

191
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,000
Give me a shelter

192
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,840
Give me a shelter

193
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,460
Mother Street today

194
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,720
Sebu

195
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Where are the fucking drugs?

196
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,520
Sebu

197
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:57,540
Oh, Far Easter drugs, dear friends.

198
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,780
Far Easter drugs.

199
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,940
The Brazilian band Lixiao Urbana.

200
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,100
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

201
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,420
And now this.

202
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,880
Well, it's time to declare the voting

203
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,880
on the Mystery Girl of the Week contest closed

204
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,800
and open the envelope.

205
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,880
Mystery Girl of the Week this week goes to North Korea

206
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,720
who dumped that one.

207
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,300
I love the way they dumped the news.

208
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,200
They were in a meeting and they just sort of looked at the Americans

209
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,580
and said,

210
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,920
Of course we have the fucking bomb, you moron.

211
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,340
I think pretty much, I think Zimbabwe's got the bomb.

212
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,720
I think Upper Mongolia or whatever it's called,

213
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,420
yeah, Outer Mongolia might have the bomb, too.

214
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,960
I think we've reached the level that they talked about.

215
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,400
The Tagalog Islands, everybody.

216
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,100
Pongo, Pongo.

217
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,400
Timor has a 200 nuki.

218
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,060
So what are you going to do about that?

219
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,780
You're just going to go plowing every place,

220
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,620
waving the bomb?

221
00:14:59,780 --> 00:14:59,960
Yeah.

222
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,400
And hoping they don't bomb everything back?

223
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,900
It's kind of silly.

224
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,240
Well, you've got to deliver the bomb.

225
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,620
I mean, you can't just have a bomb.

226
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,160
Right.

227
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,560
You've got to have one of those mailage postage systems.

228
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,340
You just have a bomb and you detonate it,

229
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,680
then you blow yourself up.

230
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,200
Yeah.

231
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,620
You have to deliver it somehow.

232
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,420
Yeah, you have to make it go somewhere else,

233
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,380
you know, whoever, whatever you don't like,

234
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,600
and then have it blow up there.

235
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,620
And you need one of those mailing systems, too,

236
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,460
because Stan knows that from the Church of the Subgenius.

237
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,080
I did download a tactical nuke video that was amazing.

238
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,720
I think he's sick, bro.

239
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,940
It was shot with like a,

240
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,020
like about a 50 or 60 foot long cannon.

241
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,240
Really?

242
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,580
Yeah, a big recoil thing.

243
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,600
One of those track.

244
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,240
Yeah, they're like,

245
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,580
yeah, those tubes they use now.

246
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,100
And the thing shot,

247
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,040
and then about two seconds later,

248
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,960
the mountain range way off in the distance just went white.

249
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,200
And then,

250
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,140
you'd

251
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,880
worship the gods of war.

252
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,380
And then, where there once was a mountain.

253
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,300
Stand at the stone feet of the red god of war.

254
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,380
This was just punched with a cannon into the hill, you know.

255
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,820
They call them tubes now.

256
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,740
There's a lot of baby acrimony going around in the Shvelt world.

257
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,660
They're probably letting a lot of these type videos out so that, you know.

258
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,960
So we can see it.

259
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,660
I've also noticed a lot of stories that kind of talk about how cool it is

260
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,300
that when America goes to war, it goes to war packing everything.

261
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,500
And they started talking about how we're,

262
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,440
that some of the things being ordered for the war and being packed was,

263
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,360
well, a sumo wrestler's suit was one of them.

264
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,020
That's not much of a suit.

265
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,920
A sumo wrestler's suit was going to be a thing.

266
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,700
Going along with the rest of the guy's gear?

267
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,100
Yeah.

268
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,140
Well, sheesh.

269
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,700
They're going to have some entertainment there.

270
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,800
They call it sumo wrestler for the news purposes,

271
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,860
but what they really mean is the extra costume for the superhero.

272
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,860
Oh, and the belt that he's wearing actually that goes up his crotch

273
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,540
actually propels him over Baghdad and drops him asunder like some mighty sack of...

274
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,540
All that mutant stuff.

275
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,760
All those movies with Spider-Man,

276
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,460
all these mutant power guys and so forth that are coming into vogue now.

277
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,060
Real big budget, exciting, well done.

278
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,340
Comic book movies.

279
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,320
It's all based on...

280
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,060
It's Donald Rolfe.

281
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,040
But the gist of the stories are generally that nobody goes to war like the U.S. does.

282
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,480
Nobody takes as much stuff with it.

283
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,120
Sheesh.

284
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:11,780
Well...

285
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,600
It's kind of self-effacing, not self-effacing, but, you know, too overconfident.

286
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,380
Pretty arrogant, really.

287
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,740
Yeah, arrogant. That's the word.

288
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,360
I knew it started with an A.

289
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,060
Well, they sort of control space.

290
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,120
Um...

291
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,360
Every blade of grass, dang.

292
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,780
They want to control every blade of grass and every molecule.

293
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,300
They want to control the planet.

294
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,860
They have, uh...

295
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,960
From outer space.

296
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,680
That was scary watching Dave do that one.

297
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,400
Well, because I missed it.

298
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,680
I'm not gonna look over there anymore.

299
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,400
I'm not looking over there anymore.

300
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm looking...

301
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,460
You're in the wrong direction. I missed it.

302
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,040
I'm gonna go look at porn on the internet or something.

303
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,340
I don't want to see that again.

304
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,460
I could see Donald Rumsfeld as a superhero.

305
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,640
Couldn't you?

306
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:57,380
Like wearing a sumo belt, bare-chested, bare-legged, like maybe with long, like, uh, lawyer socks on or...

307
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:03,200
And the power belt between his legs propelling him through space.

308
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,960
They said he was afraid of birds, but wasn't he some sort of Pleistocene bird himself?

309
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,780
I'm so kind.

310
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,220
Wasn't that beak made for chopping lamb chops?

311
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,780
Isn't that nozzle made for eating human flesh?

312
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,600
Donald Rumsfeld!

313
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,100
Don't look under your television set.

314
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,720
He's bad.

315
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,800
No!

316
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,960
How about Dick Cheney?

317
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,380
How about Dick Cheney?

318
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,940
The grandson of Lon Cheney.

319
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,580
No, no, no.

320
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,740
He is actually...

321
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,780
The man of a thousand billion dollar faces.

322
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,100
The man of a million petrodollars.

323
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,800
Tonight in your theater.

324
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,900
Don't come if you've got a heart condition or wear sunglasses past twelve.

325
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,980
Don't come if your knees are too...

326
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,640
Huh?

327
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,560
Pants!

328
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,920
Oh, I don't know what happened.

329
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,000
I don't know what happened.

330
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,200
I don't know what happened.

331
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,240
I don't know what happened.

332
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,860
I don't know what happened.

333
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,980
The Senate will come to order.

334
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,680
The Chaplain will leave the Senate in prayer.

335
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,120
Gracious God, you have made grief.

336
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,900
As a Senate family, we thank you for our dear friend's untimely deaths.

337
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,880
We are grateful for Saul and Sheila Wellstone's courageous deaths.

338
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,420
And his indefatigable commitment to help the debt of our society.

339
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,700
We praise you for grief for all people.

340
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,700
Particularly police officers and those who serve to make the Senate run smoothly.

341
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:52,220
Dear God, you have enriched all of our lives so generously through their untimely deaths.

342
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,040
Heal our grief over maintenance personnel.

343
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,720
And fill us with your untimely deaths.

344
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,640
Amen.

345
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,060
The Senate prayer delivered by Fernanda Nende-Lee Murr.

346
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:25,100
So that's a sign of oppression from the ubermanship that are keeping us down with their ragged bags and feet.

347
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,340
These ragged, raggedy, old baggedy, faggity feet.

348
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,040
Smelling us.

349
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,120
My pups are barking, boy.

350
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,560
My pups is dead.

351
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,160
I'm a smelly friend, you know what I mean.

352
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,340
Yeah, you gotta feed them.

353
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,160
You gotta feed those puppies.

354
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,780
I've just been so whooped and beaten down by the conspiracy, I just gave up.

355
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,060
You know what they like, Stan?

356
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:52,960
They like when you trim your toenails, you grind them up, you put them in a little bit of hot sauce, and you drip them back on your self-same toes.

357
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,200
That's appreciation for you.

358
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,640
Recycling?

359
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,920
Yes, it's a form of internal sacrosanct-sif-sifity.

360
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,180
You know, you make yourself holier than you thou or something.

361
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,300
Every day.

362
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,200
At least I do.

363
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,620
I, uh, I gave up on that, on thou, holiness, and than.

364
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,860
Well, making yourself holy.

365
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,760
I wish you gave up.

366
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,680
I can see it.

367
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,120
Give up!

368
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,220
I can see it.

369
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:20,900
Give up!

370
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,660
Give up!

371
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,400
Holy and holy.

372
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,440
The loudspeaker spoke up and said...

373
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:25,920
Holy and holy.

374
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,520
It is holy and holy.

375
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,340
Holy and holy.

376
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,020
To think of the...

377
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,440
Christianity is stupid.

378
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,200
Isn't it about the...

379
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,580
Communism is stupid.

380
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,080
Communism is good.

381
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Do you have a copy of that we could play real loud?

382
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,740
Common sense is stupid.

383
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,200
Common sense is stupid.

384
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,840
Common sense is stupid.

385
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:43,740
Common sense is stupid.

386
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,960
Common sense is stupid.

387
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:52,160
The very idea of offing yourself because of some stupid little problem like that makes

388
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:59,180
me think, well, what is a problem that's worthy of killing yourself?

389
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:05,540
So what I want you to do is imagine that you're, uh, you're in the car with the windshield

390
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:12,140
wipers going and you're listening to this, uh, religious show on the radio.

391
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,880
Okay.

392
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,980
And you're wondering to yourself, who are these guys?

393
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,780
Gotcha.

394
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,860
Okay, I'm there.

395
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,040
I'm driving.

396
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,680
I'm beginning to visualize now.

397
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,320
Oh, uh, what?

398
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,760
Don't take your eyes off the road though.

399
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,940
And now I can see it.

400
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,700
I can see it.

401
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,840
I can begin to see the beginnings of it.

402
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,780
And...

403
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,880
Tranks and tucks and sumpsh.

404
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,820
Yeah, that's the kind of stuff we used to listen to on the radio back in the old days,

405
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,020
driving around Texas.

406
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,020


407
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,020


408
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,020


409
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,620
The, the, you know, Texas.

410
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,660
I understand that Texas is about the size of, of Iraq.

411
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,220
Really?

412
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,640
Yeah.

413
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,940
Is that true?

414
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,980
So when they say, go in and see if you can find some nukes, my test would be, well, let's

415
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,960
go see if we can hide a suitcase full of nukes in Texas somewhere and say, now go see if

416
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,680
you can find it.

417
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,080
We only have the whole state of Texas to do it in.

418
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,880
You know, I think that...

419
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,620
That would work.

420
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,640
You could buy that.

421
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,760
You could build an invisibility chamber if you had to and put it into the...

422
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:27,860
Hide it in Texas?

423
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,680
And hide it in Texas.

424
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,060
You could put up by Amarillo next to, um, Cadillac Ranch and then...

425
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,500
I'd take it out to the...

426
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,100
They just wouldn't see it.

427
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,900
To the, uh, the Texas triangle, which is kind of like a different version of the Bermuda

428
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,720
triangle, but on land in Texas.

429
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,680
And I would just put it out in the middle and it would disappear.

430
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,680
Wow.

431
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,660
Until...

432
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,220
That's like a playa out there.

433
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,420
I needed to find it.

434
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,620
That was Dear Friends Puzzling Evidence.

435
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,600
Dr. Ford.

436
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,920
Philodrum and Dr. Howl...

437
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,960
Howlin' be funny.

438
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,500
Dr. Howl on KPFA in Berkeley.

439
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:03,520
This, uh, genius more than an hour, less than a show type show.

440
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,920
The, the, the show that dare not speak its name.

441
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,740
And now...

442
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:15,500
The past year resembles nothing so much as the, the bad alternate timeline that the

443
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,440
hero of a cheap science fiction book has to go back and fix.

444
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,920
It, it...

445
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,020
And you, the listener, are that time traveler.

446
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,540
Yes, you, humble listener.

447
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,800
If only your memory could be restored to you.

448
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,060
You are the humble time traveler.

449
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,280
I know what you mean though, uh, it, it does...

450
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,980
It's been weird.

451
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,500
Yeah, that would explain a lot.

452
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,080
It would explain the wooden headed people coming up to us while we're taking our sulfur

453
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,780
baths.

454
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:45,580
It would certainly explain all the money that's now going to be flowing into arms.

455
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,920
And legs.

456
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,780
And think of how fully well laundered that money it is.

457
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,900
Must be very squeaky clean.

458
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:50,900


459
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:50,900


460
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:50,900


461
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:50,900


462
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:50,900


463
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:50,900


464
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:50,900


465
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:50,900


466
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:50,900


467
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,580
It's squeaky clean by now.

468
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,680
Mm-hmm.

469
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,940
Just think about George the bushy haired one himself and counting that money back in some

470
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,360
room.

471
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,600
You gotta replace those behind the oval orifice.

472
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,640
Well, now, that's not what this is all about.

473
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:03,940
No.

474
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,000
This is all about, uh, revenge.

475
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,840
That's it.

476
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,560
Taking over Mars.

477
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:13,040
And, and, and to, uh, yes, eventually to take over, to take back Mars.

478
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:13,420
Yeah.

479
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,260
Take over Mars.

480
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,300
To take Mars back.

481
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,520
Our rightful home.

482
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,480
That we, the true Martians, were expelled from.

483
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:20,860
To take over Mars.

484
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:20,860


485
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:20,860


486
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:20,860


487
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:20,860


488
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:20,860


489
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:20,860


490
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:20,860


491
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:20,860


492
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:27,120
So that they, the oil sheiks and the, the oil billionaires and all the oily characters

493
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
would have some, they, they, they.

494
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,520
So we're living in the Martian time slip?

495
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,760
Oh, I can grok to that.

496
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,000
In this time continuum.

497
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,440
I can grok to that, my water brother, but by the same token, when do we.

498
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,160
We were enslaved.

499
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,420
We've got to go back in time and kill Bob's mom.

500
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,500
The psychic shakka took us off our own generals.

501
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,660
After, after Bob was born.

502
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,400
They came and took us off our own generals.

503
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:45,420
We were enslaved.

504
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,340
Thousands and millions and bazillions of years ago.

505
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,540
Does it, does it mean that there's a big, big.

506
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:50,840
The psychic shakka took us off our own generals.

507
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:50,840


508
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:50,840


509
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,080
We can go to the shakka and steal out the evidence.

510
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,640
With all the money we want, we are the friend of our house and we can pick it up and, and

511
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:54,980
just.

512
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,620
It doesn't mean anything like that.

513
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:56,820
No, man.

514
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,840
It just means that we were kidnapped from our home world and we're stuck here with

515
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,280
you twerps.

516
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,680
Yeah, you guys, you just, you guys.

517
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,900
He's a space junkie cowboy just looking for a fight.

518
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,420
His mama's calling, son of Stiner's his mama.

519
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:20,820
I'll be there in a minute.

520
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:20,820


521
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:20,820


522
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:20,820


523
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:20,820


524
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:20,820


525
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:20,820


526
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:20,820


527
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:20,820


528
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:20,820


529
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,380
I'm fighting all the Yankees.

530
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,520
The sons of JFK.

531
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,700
The Cubans in the mafia said, man, he'll be okay.

532
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,200
But the cowboy in a space gun have got to save the day.

533
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,760
Defeat the force of evil with his whistling.

534
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:47,040
Well, the space junkie cowboy, he will not be denied.

535
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,960
There's pot roast on the table.

536
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,640
Many more villains to roast outside.

537
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:50,800
I'll never forget that.

538
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:50,800


539
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:50,800


540
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,860
He's fighting all the criminals who stopped him sitting low

541
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,500
The whiteys came from Europe to kill you, no they wouldn't

542
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,740
But the cowboy and his space gun have got to save the day

543
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,840
Defeat the force of evil with his real spade

544
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,080
Space Bride!

545
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,800
Well the space junkie cowboy, he does not give a damn

546
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,220
His mama says, come on in boys, his mama got a plan

547
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,820
I'm gonna fight the men in white sheets who come from the Klu Klux Klan

548
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,120
They're fixin' to kill a black man who grows by the name of Sam

549
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,720
But the cowboy and his space gun have got to save the day

550
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,360
Defeat the force of evil with his Neato Space Bride!

551
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,320
Well the space junkie cowboy, he will not be coerced

552
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,200
His mama says, come on in sir, and his mama got a plan

553
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,860
I'm set to fight a bad man who's killing all the Jews

554
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,320
Make him mincemeat of his continent, gotta stop him before he's through

555
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,780
But the cowboy and his space gun have got to save the day

556
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,900
Defeat the force of evil with his real spade

557
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,800
Space Bride!

558
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,400
Space Junkie Cowboy

559
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,020
Space Junkie Cowboy

560
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,500
Space Junkie Cowboy

561
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,620
Space Bride!

562
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,180
Wooo!

563
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:45,840
By Drexel! Yes, that's D-R-E-X-E-L. Drexel from Drexel, Ohio. That's the album name.

564
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,040
And they are at this website.

565
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,040
www.drexelent.com

566
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,420
Drexelent.com. That's D-R-E-X-E-L-L-E-N-T

567
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:07,960
And now back to, well, some Lemur-ish cut-up collages.

568
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:14,500
Hustling evidences, howling over men, lonesome cowboys, and Chaz right here.

569
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,280
Well, we were through the looking glass with David Ferry and Nico.

570
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:18,940
One, two, three, four.

571
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,180
That's good. There we go, George. You're looking good on camera.

572
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,500
Yeah, don't worry about it. Your hair looks fine.

573
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,640
Uh, boss, you want to make sure his hand stays up in the wave gesture for a long time. We got to go off over here.

574
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,500
Looks like there's about 45 of them ready to go.

575
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,040
Mr. President, 30 seconds.

576
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,520
Do you want to take some of the shine off the big guy's nose? I can't get back in there again. It smells like shit.

577
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:53,020
The commies keep talking like that, I'll be throwing some food over the concentration camp fence to you. How's that?

578
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,640
Right after the baths, eh, Stank? Come on in and take a bath.

579
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:05,700
Hey, look at this special emollient they put in the bath water. It makes you feel so good. You don't want to think about things.

580
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,540
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

581
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,880
Knee pads truly make a world of difference.

582
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,180
Yep. Yep.

583
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,300
More proof that makes knee pads possible.

584
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,600
Yep. Yep. Yep.

585
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,460
Call now to order the two-piece ratchet knee pads or clamp set.

586
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,300
737-338-1310-881.

587
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

588
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:31,120
Then of course there was the time when the old woman came out of the house and tried to fit the baseball bat in my corner.

589
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,460
I think you can't use that either, man.

590
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,840
And then there was...

591
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:33,980
MK Ultra.

592
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,560
MK Ultra? Hey, he knows about the mind control experiments.

593
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,260
Wow!

594
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,940
What, did they, did they...

595
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,640
Hey, you know what, they thought...

596
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,480
Oh, he signed off because he's scared.

597
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,340
He was silent.

598
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:43,920
He was scared.

599
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:44,920
They stopped him.

600
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:54,840
Well, they stopped him mentally a long time ago in the past. See, that's what he doesn't understand. It was also a time control experiment, much like the Church of the Subgenius is, and therefore...

601
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,460
Ours will be.

602
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,500
Right.

603
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,040
That's one of the ipso-hipso's of the time biz.

604
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:02,460
Yeah.

605
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:09,500
Yeah. But this guy wasn't hip to that fact, I think, as he danced jolly-lee-lee-lee down there in this lane.

606
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,060
Well, let us know that he was hip.

607
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,220
You know, if you...

608
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,740
Might have been.

609
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,060
A what?

610
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,320
A horse.

611
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,320


612
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,320


613
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,320


614
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,980
Like, HAHA!

615
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:21,980


616
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,920
That was a pal begins his steps.

617
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,980
Apparently he's a mutta or nou on ya dear.

618
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,340
Ah, well.

619
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:27,860
Did you know that they—

620
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:27,860


621
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,700
They're g Odyssey machines Oxygen renovats 7 Oh ya?

622
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:29,700


623
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:29,700


624
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,000


625
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,740
Lots of that stuff.

626
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,920
This is an old hatır-

627
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,160
Ah-

628
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,200
SMBD wrongs my-

629
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Oh, right.

630
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:36,560
You're a sick and stupid-

631
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,740
Ehe-

632
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:42,480
promise girl!

633
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,900
experiments. Think of it that way, if you can. Huh? For example, you know, people look at an

634
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:55,060
elephant and it just looks so enormous, but, or someone told me earlier, you know, you eat a,

635
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:04,280
or given enough time they can, can an ant eat an elephant? Precisely. By eight properties,

636
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:11,240
I don't think you could. It'd be impossible. For example, you folks all are now unsophisticated

637
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,360
barbarians. And breaking news out of Bethlehem right now, Israeli forces leaving a trail of

638
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,240
sludge to prevent gunmen from seeking refuge in the explosive device at a checkpoint late this

639
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,360
afternoon. This in retaliation for a Palestinian church in Jerusalem. The passenger apparently

640
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,200
grabbed the sludge, killing 11 people. Cleanup boats menace the coastline, causing an environmental

641
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,080
hazard. Tom Daschle and other wannabes of creating security threats to his family.

642
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,480
Hard Car correspondent David Schuster has the story.

643
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:45,580
The question is, has Tom Daschle gone too far or is Tom Daschle a sore loser?

644
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,060
This program is known for asking you to call him.

645
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,140
With his majority gone and his party floundering, Tom Daschle handling defeat poorly.

646
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:02,220
But Democrats routinely unpatriotic and un-American. Tom Daschle, shrill, nasty, and dangerous.

647
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,560
In Washington. Foment hatred, the very essence of anger that we love.

648
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,380
Hey, Bob.

649
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:09,460
Hey, Bob.

650

668
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,440
Hi, Fernanda Nende.

669
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,420
Lee Moore.

670
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,760
I often want to say to a couple,

671
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,740
Bob, do their mouths with Duke. I put him down with my pizda, and then she shrieked,

672
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,600
we're hungry for you.

673
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,040
Guy back off.

674
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:22,980
Guy back off.

675
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,860
Guy back off.

676
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,860
Guy blown away.

677
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,100
And they bury the dog in the cracks with mouths full of my cheese.

678
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,440
Bob, my cheese.

679
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,880
Bob, my cheese.

680
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,240
Bob, my cheese.

681
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,340
Bob, blown away.

682
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,460
As husbands and wives come together, Bob creates a glow within you.

683
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,340
I lost our minds, and I needed to do something else.

684
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:46,180
I was struck recently by a hole in their seeking cheese, and they don't get it.

685
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,280
Oh, you mean that kind of bone-crushing time.

686
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,380
That kind of bone-crushing.

687
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:57,140
God died unexpectedly in an automobile accident this weekend, and they don't get it.

688
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,280
They are normal.

689
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,100
Bob threatened to be ripped asunder by God.

690
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:07,520
And Jesus has been in a series of unsatisfying relationships with men, invites him into a relationship with Bob.

691
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,180
And they bury the dog in the food.

692
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,980
But I can't say that, and they don't get it.

We believe in any inflationary set of pressures that might emerge

And any negative effects that we put in place

716

Similarly, the reason for this chronic and growing

Continuously rising or rising as much

719

00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:28,100
I have argued the best we can judge for decades either way

722
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,100
I'm having a heart attack

723
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,660
Can't be the same till I get my baby back

724
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,380
She's gone and left me broken out of my mind

725
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:37,380


726
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,060
I'm broken hearted

727
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,080
Came to stay but now we've parted

728
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,000
Like a transcontinental island

729
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,540
Burning and floating across the seven seas

730
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,400
Causing the constant formation of delicate bacteria

731
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,480
Cuted in a mustard keg

732
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,840
Her love had made a beautiful sunset

733
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,160
She's gone and left me, what shall I do?

734
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,880
She got back to her residence on Sunset Boulevard

735
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,520
Where the residue of her love had died through

736
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,500
I got bit and stoned by a Ned fly

737
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,440
Was swelled up into a baby

738
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,400
And floated away up in outer space

739
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,780
Like a Jules Verne hot air balloon

740
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,400
Jacob Barley took a dollax

741
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,620
And bled his tiny cam and all his little friends

742
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,520
Visiting from Scarsdale

743
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,380
That's why I'm having a heart attack

744
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,960
Can't be the same till I get my baby back

745
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,960
She's gone and left me broken hearted

746
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,860
Came to stay but now we've parted

747
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,480
Like a transcontinental island

748
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,020
Burning and floating across the seven seas

749
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,720
Causing the constant formation of delicate bacteria

750
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,480
Cuted in a mustard keg

751
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,320
Her love had made a beautiful sunset

752
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,340
She's gone and left me, what shall I do?

753
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,120
She got back to her residence on Sunset Boulevard

754
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,720
Where the residue of her love had died through

755
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,420
I got bit and stoned by a Ned fly

756
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,080
Was swelled up into a baby

757
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,440
Was swelled up into a baby

758
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,060
Was swelled up into a baby

759
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,660
And I blew away

760
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,580
And the whole world, it just let it go

761
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:17,880
Yeah, I'm our mother

762
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:28,140
It made my pick

763
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,460
The were in lover then

764
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:29,460


765
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:29,780
And you are, oh man

766
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:29,780


767
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:29,780


768
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:29,780


769
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:29,780


770
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,560
Telling me that I'm okay

771
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,160
But the world is like aFe

772
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,320
When I'm living

773
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:33,320


774
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,060
I'm having a heart attack!

775
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,520
Zug's Rift, dear friends.

776
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,260
This is coming off of a 30th anniversary 2CDR set

777
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:53,960
that has 175 Zug's Rift songs from 1971 to 2001.

778
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,140
The great, great Zug's Rift can be reached by you

779
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,700
if you have a pencil ready.

780
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,080
Got that pencil ready?

781
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,620
Now, Zug's Rift at, thank you Fine Lying Brothers,

782
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:13,360
at 6520 Platt Avenue.

783
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:20,340
That's Platt Avenue, number 184, West Hills, California.

784
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:27,720
9-1-3-0-7-3-2-1-8.

785
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:33,100
Again, that's 9-1-3-0-7-3-2-1.

786
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,480
8-4-ZUGS-RIFT.

787
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:42,640
Also at Zug's Rift dot 4MG dot com.

788
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:49,180
That's Zug's Rift at 4MG dot com.

789
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,300
Don't let her know.

790
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,100
This is the voice.

791
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,160
This is the voice of London College.

792
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,760
This is the voice of the BBC.

793
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,020
Somebody's parked a bus in my butt.

794
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,000
Well, there's an explosive device in there.

795
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,080
We're talking about a code yellow.

796
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,800
You are not using the force, young bad boy.

797
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,060
We are at code yellow right now, you guys.

798
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,340
I'll have you know that.

799
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,540
Code yellow in what?

800
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,200
In Portuguese, which is...

801
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,160
These are not the drugs you're looking for.

802
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:29,620
Amarillo.

803
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,260
No, we are at code yellow.

804
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,780
Code yellow right now.

805
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,420
The force is not with us, you silly arses.

806
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,400
Come on, man.

807
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,840
First place cops looked was at that.

808
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,940
I've fallen, and I can't get up.

809
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,880
Just lay there.

810
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,260
She's lying.

811
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,840
What are you going to say?

812
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,400
Pack the car near Havangad or something?

813
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,380
I mean, come on, boys.

814
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,800
Let's stop this inane game here.

815
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,600
Let's nail the hammer on the head.

816
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,040
The president signed up.

817
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,600
Oh, yeah, right.

818
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:57,840
Okay.

819
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,820
Trying to attack Canada.

820
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,440
I can't do the president.

821
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,040
They're prime minister of Canada.

822
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,860
I can't do Jean Quatien.

823
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,300
I can't do his voice.

824
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,580
And we are tired of what they are saying.

825
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,860
South of the border.

826
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,960
We have the right as a nation.

827
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,380
How many people showed up on the mall in D.C.

828
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,640
to protest the war that you didn't hear about in the news?

829
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,380
Bob was there.

830
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:19,960
Bob was?

831
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,980
Somebody sent me a picture of Bob standing there

832
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,780
with a couple of kids with their faces fuzzed out in a photograph

833
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,060
because the kids didn't want to get caught.

834
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,720
But there was...

835
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,000
Bob?

836
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Bob often shows up at protests.

837
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,540
And, in fact, has even been filmed by CNN and the like.

838
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:45,160
But in this case, a friend of one of the kids saw Bob,

839
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,940
photographed him, sent it in, got a rim job,

840
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:55,300
and that was the sum totality of Bob's involvement in the...

841
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,400
Is this part of the success seminar thing that he's doing down there now?

842
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,160
No, he works for the CIA.

843
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:03,800
He works for the CIA sometimes.

844
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,020
He was just taking notes.

845
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,040
So the success seminar is just like a pizza front for Black Ops, for the CIA?

846
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,140
No, that's Church of the Subgenius.

847
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,700
Is the pizza front for...

848
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,980
More or less, yeah.

849
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,900
Okay, but which is the core of the Black Ops?

850
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,960
Is it the CIA or the church?

851
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,800
The Austin office that's the church.

852
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,320
The Austin office or the church.

853
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,560
Those guys are nuts.

854
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
They get 10 bucks for every address.

855
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,140
For every address.

856
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,280
So they can actually come around and say,

857
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,420
we know where you live, right?

858
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,300
Well, see, the thing is...

859
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,760
The thing is now, because of the new law,

860
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,840
they can just get it off the internet for free.

861
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,300
Your computer is part of the internet.

862
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,400
My computer is.

863
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,480
And if you touch your computer,

864
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,400
your brain is part of the internet.

865
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,320
And it's all recorded.

866
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,780
Every bit of it is on google.com,

867
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:56,080
which will soon be called bigbrother.com or something like that.

868
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,180
But it's all going to be on one big website.

869
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,920
I'll be able to look up your thoughts.

870
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,880
You'll be able to look up my thoughts.

871
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,300
Go search.

872
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:03,300


873
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:03,300


874
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:03,300


875
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,000
It's a beautiful thing.

876
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:05,740
It's a beautiful thing.

877
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:05,740


878
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,040
Well, in some ways,

879
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,600
the evildoers can no longer hide their evil.

880
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,860
But by the same token,

881
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,040
it all just evens out.

882
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,280
There's just such a flood of endless information

883
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,280
about everybody's inner thoughts

884
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,240
that finally it just becomes a sort of a slurry,

885
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,760
a blank mush because it's just overload.

886
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,660
It's just a white static.

887
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,000
And when you see the sign,

888
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
it says our beak,

889
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,500
our back,

890
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,860
it's maxed free.

891
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,460
You'll know that you're going to finally get some work done around here.

892
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:39,900
Right.

893
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,420
Look at those smokestacks crack.

894
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,500
Everybody gets to toggle in, man.

895
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:44,800
Yeah.

896
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:45,820
When it started going,

897
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,540
going down this week,

898
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,940
I started sweeping up my leaves in the yard.

899
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:51,720
Did you?

900
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,660
That's all that's left to do.

901
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,900
That's all you can really do.

902
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:55,760
God,

903
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:57,880
hallelujah.

904
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,720
I don't care if you're fat.

905
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,960
I don't care.

906
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:02,980
I don't care.

907
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:02,980


908
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:02,980


909
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:02,980


910
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:02,980


911
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:02,980


912
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:02,980


913
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:02,980


914
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:02,980


915
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:02,980


916
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:02,980


917
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,280
I don't care.

918
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:03,300


919
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:03,300


920
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:03,300


921
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:03,300


922
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:03,300


923
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,260
Who's in front of you?

924
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,320
Facts of when?

925
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,380
He's doing.

926
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,280
I've been prospering that morning,

927
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,000
but I was talking this would do with the in you would price

928
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,460
the present in you.

929
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:15,840
Great.

930
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,360
How did I get on that?

931
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,300
Damn it.

932
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,060
They love shoes and

933
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,220
they love shoes and pajamas.

934
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,180
God has gone before.

935
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,200
I'm persuaded.

936
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:32,980
I'm persuaded.

937
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,160
God hallelujah!

938
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:43,300
What we are engaged in is essentially a struggle for communication.

939
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:49,360
The corporate industrial complex is a heavily armed fortress

940
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:55,380
dictating the baloney propaganda we are fed daily via multimedia channels.

941
00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:00,140
We hear only what they want us to hear.

942
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:07,280
So long as the man prevents the message from reaching the masses, justice is impeded.

943
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:13,740
The Unabomber used terrorism to gain publicity as an end in itself.

944
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:19,300
Notice how the press seeks to channel the public's interpretation of the Unabomber,

945
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,220
covering it as a serial killer story of crime and insanity,

946
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:28,660
while deliberately excluding consideration of the ideas themselves.

947
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:35,000
Imagine, if you will, mass communications not subject to corporate control.

948
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:41,200
Why, people might say anything, even things not fit to print.

949
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,580
Exactly.

950
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:48,420
When the ABC nightly news gets renamed Disney World,

951
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,800
you'll cherish the memory of your Unabomber vote.

952
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,100
Don't waste your vote, friends.

953
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,120
Unabomber in 19...

954
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,360
1996.

955
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:02,160
Whoa!

956
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,340
And, uh...

957
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:12,280
Yes, that was from www.paranoia.com, which is a fun little website.

958
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,200
Uh, what the hell...

959
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:20,700
According to my records, I've sent you 33 pages of information plus a postcard.

960
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:27,040
Most of what I sent you proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that much of what you've sent me is crap.

961
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,120
Only a person like you would be able to do that.

962
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,900
With your almost total lack of...

963
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,040
...

964
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,120
...

965
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,080
...

966
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,180
...

967
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:40,240
...

968
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:40,240

1007
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,560
I like that.

1008
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,380
All of you.

1009
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,880
One jelly donut.

1010
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:16,600
All right.

1011
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:22,240
So you get the abstract meaning of the ladies owing them a jelly donut.

1012
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,380
You know, there have been problems with the church.

1013
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:34,400
And, of course, there have been many problems with the armies amongst these very stern DIs who like to take it up all the way up, all the way up to the top of Jack Hill.

1014
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,900
Well, you know, kids are going to be learning this stuff.

1015
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,200
For you know what?

1016
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:45,840
The softer soldiers that aren't going to make it through boot, you know, have to make regular trips to the john.

1017
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:51,760
Well, with one swell foop, we laid one on our military.

1018
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:58,560
We hope our brave boys out there don't feel compelled to jump in the shack with the first drill instructor that she.

1019
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,240
You know, that would be.

1020
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:05,860
We hope that they carry a picture of W in their breast pocket.

1021
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,200
And they carry.

1022
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,660
An orangutan's breast on the top of their feet.

1023
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,440
Because most of them won't come out.

1024
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:16,020
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

1025
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,060
That's true.

1026
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,640
That's true.

1027
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,460
That's true.

1028
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:10,120
That's true.

1029
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:10,600
That's true.

1030
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:11,940
That's true.

1031
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:13,060
That's true.

1032
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:13,100
That's true.

1033
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,100


1034
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,100


1035
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,100


1036
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,100


1037
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,100


1038
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,100


1039
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,100


1040
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,100


1041
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:19,900
I did read a story that there are drone planes already flying the southern parts of Iraq destroying anything they see.

1042
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,000
That's what they're selling.

1043
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,260
They've already started that.

1044
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,060
They've been doing that for ten years, haven't they?

1045
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,520
Have you seen the Army commercials?

1046
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:29,520
Well, they unleashed like a fresh batch of them, like, just go terrorize everything.

1047
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,320
Have you seen the new Air Force commercial where the kid is out with his little plane

1048
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:33,400
airplane?

1049
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,440
Hey, what is drone a euphemism for?

1050
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,400
What?

1051
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,500
Are they drones?

1052
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:37,500


1053
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:37,500


1054
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,500
Are they really sending out little drone robots?

1055
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:43,700
Or are they dressing up little drone men as drone robots?

1056
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:49,020
It's the chimpanzee clone syndrome and those crazy right wing evangelicals behind it, as

1057
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:49,240
usual.

1058
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:49,260
They're just drone planes.

1059
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,760
They're unmanned planes that just fly around looking for targets.

1060
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:56,760
But have you guys seriously seen those spots, those Air Force commercials that show the

1061
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,400
kid flying his little robot plane and then in the last scene he's like moving one of

1062
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,700
those joysticks and you see one of those random shots over Iraq?

1063
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:05,620
Really?

1064
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:06,900
Oh yeah, this is for real.

1065
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,020
Oh, hmm.

1066
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:12,540
Yep, they're selling the remote robot clone planes pretty good nowadays.

1067
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:15,000
Gosh, with the sun setting on our show soon.

1068
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,500
And the sun setting on the American empire.

1069
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,520
Or shitting on it.

1070
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:18,840
No, no, no.

1071
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:21,900
Yeah, yeah.

1072
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,080
I don't know.

1073
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,260
With Anna Nicole's play show, I think we have a chance.

1074
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:31,720
Well, and now that rim jobs have come back into popularity.

1075
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:32,540
Really?

1076
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:33,220
With Anna Nicole.

1077
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,600
Although, I, frankly, to me, I think they're going to be a little bit more popular.

1078
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:35,600


1079
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:35,600


1080
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:35,600


1081
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:35,600


1082
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:35,600


1083
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:35,600


1084
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,980
That's just really weird.

1085
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,480
Pacific rim jobs?

1086
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:42,300
Well, there's a big, there's a...

1087
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,200
Man, that's pretty wild.

1088
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:44,980
Pacific rim jobs.

1089
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,140
Let me put it this way.

1090
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,220
That's pretty twisted.

1091
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,500
You can use your butt.

1092
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:53,280
You can use your butt for sitting or you can use it for shitting.

1093
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,900
And I say there is one H of a difference between sitting and shitting.

1094
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,100
Till next week.

1095
00:55:59,100 --> 00:55:59,920
Tell your friends.

1096
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,460
Till next week.

1097
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,860
Keep your hat on tight.

1098
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,280
Back in more fun.

1099
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:05,600
See you next week.

1110
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,600
Bye bye.

1111
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:15,500
