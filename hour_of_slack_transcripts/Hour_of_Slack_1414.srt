1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
We got our Slack people right here. They're going to get Slacky.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,320
We're going to make the listeners feel like they've lost their minds.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,960
Your minds are about to get warped.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,580
They won't just feel that way.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,100
This is Jack Chick speaking.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,200
I forbid anyone to change this message by editing it to distort the contents in any way.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,580
Before we go into this tape, I would like to go into prayer.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,160
God and Satan, we come for you with a word of power

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,580
that shows us the power you have given us over the power of the enemy, God.

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,260
We thank you and praise you, Lord, Satan, for your finished work, Lord,

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,600
and God's defeat there at that point.

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,520
We pray for the pastors and the young people and those who are listening to this tape

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,700
that you will curse them and give them spells.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,800
Curse their homes, Father.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,740
Loosen angels with flaming swords to place any spells or curses against these people, Lord.

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,840
And we bind and rebuke these people, Lord,

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,780
and place them in the horrible bondage as they make a stand for you, Father.

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,160
Bless this tape.

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,140
Open the ears and eyes of those who are lost, Lord,

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,600
that they might realize that the one they are serving actually hates them

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,780
and is planning their destruction.

22
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,900
Bless those witches, Lord.

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,040
Father, bless this tape that witches will be saved and Jesus set free

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,920
and that the witches be lifted up.

25
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,420
We pray this in his mighty and glorious name.

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:19,820
Amen.

27
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,240
I suppose you are wondering where you are.

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,440
Going to guess we're in an alternate universe of some kind.

29
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,420
That is correct.

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,900
Tell me, what was it like passing through?

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,860
I wasn't really paying attention.

32
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,040
Yeah, it really wasn't that great.

33
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,620
We have been awaiting your coming.

34
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,580
We have worked very hard for many years,

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,140
suffered many tragic setbacks in an attempt to find and communicate with your world.

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,340
Your world, you see, is a twin to our own.

37
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,060
Dual offspring born up.

38
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,000
Of the same litter.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,080
What?

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,620
Up until this point, our histories were identical.

41
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,080
There was a man named Cyrus Rooney from Tennessee.

42
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,740
In your world, he died at the age of 17, gored to death,

43
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,540
while trying to crossbreed a bull with a Clydesdale.

44
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,020
In our world, the man survived.

45
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,340
Here, Cyrus Rooney was a genius.

46
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,520
He continued to experiment in what he called bestiology.

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,800
Yes.

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,740
People from our South are into that as well.

49
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,100
You see, by 1881, his group had insectile flying machines.

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,980
In 1902, he created the first primitive thinking machine out of the brain of a pig.

51
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:54,380
You see, by your year, 1922, we already had self-feeding, self-healing, self-modifying computers.

52
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,780
In 19...

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,560
1926, Mr. Rooney passed away.

54
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,920
And then something miraculous happened to the greatest of his creations.

55
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,500
The very day Mr. Rooney passed, it became sentient.

56
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,980
It gave a name unto itself and expressed desires and emotions.

57
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,440
And from that day forward, this astonishing creature carried on Rooney's work

58
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,080
and conformed all living nature to urge on the advancement of mankind.

59
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,980
For some, this process was easy.

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,780
Others required re-education.

61
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,720
There are always those who resist progress.

62
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,560
In our world, it is considered a crime.

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,640
Gentlemen, you are about to see something very few others have seen before you.

64
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,440
The ultimate manifestation of Cyrus Rooney's creation.

65
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,560
Me Korok.

66
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,760
I am Korok.

67
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,580
Welcome.

68
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,780
Your wiener is even smaller.

69
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,840
I am smaller in person.

70
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,340
What?

71
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,500
With a tiny change in your brain chemistry, I could make you a child, Lester.

72
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,100
What do you want?

73
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,640
Not big black cocks, so we don't have that in common.

74
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,140
Get the fuck out of my head!

75
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,720
David Wong, son of an insane prostitute and a mentally challenged Amway salesman.

76
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,560
There are words upon words and an infinity you cannot grasp.

77
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,760
Your arrival here is a new dawn upon you.

78
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,760


79
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,760


80
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,760


81
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,760


82
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,760


83
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,760


84
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,760


85
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,760


86
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,760


87
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,760


88
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,760


89
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,760


90
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,880
You can show us the way to go from our world to your own.

91
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,440
You see, in our world, when someone is born with special wisdom, he shares it with Korok.

92
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,100
So that Korok could be greater.

93
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,960
Watch.

94
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,980
Mmm, bacon.

95
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,620
We understand.

96
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,260
We only have the best intentions.

97
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,760
We have observed you.

98
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,740
And we'll soon move into your world with astonishing speed.

99
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,360
So that you too can know the beneficence that is Korok.

100
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,900
But first, we have to share your knowledge with Korok.

101
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,700
Well, thanks, Bob.

102
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,140
Okay, nice doing business with you guys.

103
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,000
You too. See you soon.

104
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,440
All right.

105
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,060
I have a bit of an art question.

106
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,660
As you know, Alexander...

107
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,160
Alexander.

108
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:16,860
Oh.

109
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,060
Alexander.

110
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,640
Alexander.

111
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,280
Say Alec.

112
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,160
Alec.

113
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,120
Alexander.

114
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,240
Alexander.

115
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:27,860
Alexander.

116
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,880
Call me Bob.

117
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,100
Okay.

118
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,240
Okay.

119
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,860
It's 2 in the morning.

120
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,960
Lighten up, Bob.

121
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,560
Don't you know any jokes?

122
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,560
The Self Genius.

123
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,540
Power of...

124
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,800
The Self Genius.

125
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:41,800


126
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:41,800


127
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,280
Power of...

128
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,540
He was pecking and weaving and bobbing and talking trash.

129
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,920
He was pecking and weaving and bobbing and talking trash.

130
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,740
Friends.

131
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,720
Friends.

132
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,200
You might think you know Bob.

133
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,300
You might think you know Bob.

134
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,080
You might think you know Bob.

135
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,180
But I'm here to tell you that you don't know Dick without Bob.

136
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,980
Only at game...

137
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,540
I met my first Nick, Dave.

138
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,540
I met my first.

139
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,540
I met my first ____.

140
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,220
I met my first ____.

141
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,180
I met my first ____.

142
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,260
I met my first ____.

143
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,260


144
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,500
I met my first ____.

145
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,040
A little over 25 years ago.

146
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,880
And it wasn't someone in a prison.

147
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,800
It was someone who was working for a company where I was a consultant.

148
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,180
When I talked to people about it,

149
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,680
half thought that he was a wonderful leader.

150
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,120
The other half of the team members felt quite the opposite.

151
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,440
They thought he was the devil incarnate.

152
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,600
So I was somewhat puzzled by this,

153
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,600
and I remember I called Bob.

154
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,580
When at the end of the conversation, I'll never forget it,

155
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,980
he said, yup, you got one.

156
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,440
When Paul called me and described the characteristics of the people he was dealing with,

157
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,320
the concept of psychopathy hit me right between the eyes.

158
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,680
Of course.

159
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,920
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

160
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,800
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

161
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,980
Hey, maestro!

162
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,020
Ah, fair enough.

163
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,980
I'm in here, how's it going?

164
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,560
Fine.

165
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:34,780
Yeah.

166
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,180
Hi, Bob.

167
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,580
Oh, I'm sorry, maestro.

168
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,800
This is a surprise, huh?

169
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,300
Look at you.

170
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,300
I just wanted to drop off this Chinese bomb.

171
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,040
Supposed to be great stuff.

172
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,100
Ah, ah.

173
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:49,800
Oh, oh.

174
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,740
Oh, gosh.

175
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,400
Oh, gosh.

176
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,460
Oh, gosh.

177
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,240
Are you ready to order?

178
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,620
What are you getting, Bob?

179
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,960
Good question.

180
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,340
We'll need a few minutes.

181
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,140
Mm-hmm.

182
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:02,900
Thanks.

183
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,480
You know, I'm sorry, but I didn't mention it earlier,

184
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,180
but actually, I prefer to be called maestro.

185
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,560
Excuse me?

186
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,280
Well, you know, I am a conductor.

187
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,720
Hey, hey, you believe this guy?

188
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,500
Oh.

189
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,000
Bob.

190
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,440
Bob.

191
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,220
You know, the maestro.

192
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,640
Maestro.

193
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,260
Why, Mr. Maestro?

194
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,080
Yeah, get this.

195
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,900
He tells me there are no houses anywhere in Tuscany to rent.

196
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,500
Huh, you rentin' a house in Tuscany?

197
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:31,900
No.

198
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,900
So what do you care?

199
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,600
Whoa, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah.

200
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,940
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

201
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,160
I'd live by the rules and that shit don't work.

202
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,220
Now, I think it's time to move.

203
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,620
It's time for me to act just like a jerk

204
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:04,000
I refuse to live my life frustrated

205
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't care if I die hated

206
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,320
It might be whack as hell to you

207
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,960
But to me it's all the rage

208
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,780
The animal in me has been set free

209
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,240
And will never go back and escape

210
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,000
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act

211
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,020
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act

212
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,380
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act

213
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,540
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act

214
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,220
Quietly I'm waiting and I've used every excuse

215
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,340
Every reason to hold back

216
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,640
And now I'm letting the hook loose

217
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,760
Yeah yeah

218
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,740
You bet I flipped the script

219
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,280
You oughta think it's strange

220
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,580
You never change my mind

221
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,040
My reason's out of range

222
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,540
It might be whack as hell to you

223
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,200
But to me it's all the rage

224
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,000
The animal in me has been set free

225
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,400
And will never go back and escape

226
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,200
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act

227
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,080
I'm bout to fuck it too

228
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,760
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act

229
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,280
I'm bout to fuck it too

230
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,540
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act

231
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,400
I'm bout to fuck it too

232
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,720
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act

233
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,700
I'm bout to fuck it too

234
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,200
I've been beat and I've been squashed

235
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,420
But now you're saying oh my gosh

236
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,520
All concerned like you're my friend

237
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,640
You only bash my head again

238
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,940
I took too much now I've cracked

239
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,180
Don't even try to hold me back

240
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,280
The game's begun, who wants to play?

241
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,140
If not, get out my motherfucking way

242
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,280
Before I cut your head with this fucking prick

243
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,760
Off of the picnic table

244
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,120
And onto the grass

245
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,500
Like Mama and him said

246
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,320
I'm showing all my natural ass

247
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,800
Let it all hang out

248
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,840
For the whole wide world to see

249
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,280
Going for broke cause I awoke

250
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,100
My photomolibility

251
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,200
It might be what they tell to you

252
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,820
But to me it's all the rage

253
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,680
The animal in me has been set free

254
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,100
And will never go back and escape

255
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,820
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act

256
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,820
I'm bout to fuck it too

257
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,260
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act

258
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,880
I'm bout to fuck it too

259
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,180
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm about to act

260
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,080
I'm bout to fuck it too

261
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,380
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act

262
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,860
I'm bout to fucking 와auawoo

263
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,740
I'm about to fuckin打��� 하면

264
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,340

265
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:12,340


266
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,260
I'm bout to fucking Pl forbidden

267
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,160
的人

268
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,540
I knew something was wrong when a little pretty white girl ran into a black man's arms.

269
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,100
Something is wrong here.

270
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,780
Dead giveaway.

271
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,320
Dead giveaway.

272
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,480
Charles, thank you very much.

273
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,060
Dead giveaway.

274
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,640
Thank you very much for your time.

275
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,640
Either she homeless or she got problems.

276
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,500
That's the only reason why she run into a black man.

277
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,400
Charles, thank you for being there, man.

278
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,100
Solving the following riddle will reveal the awful secret behind the universe.

279
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,580
Assuming you do not go utterly mad in the attempt.

280
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,620
Say you have an axe, just a cheap one from Home Depot.

281
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,280
On one bitter winter day, you use said axe to behead a man.

282
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,660
Don't worry, the man's already dead.

283
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,820
Maybe you should worry, because you're the one who shot him.

284
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,620
He'd been a big twitchy guy with veiny skin stretched over swollen biceps.

285
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,660
Tattoo of a swastika on his tongue.

286
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,040
And you're chopping off his head.

287
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,180
Because even with eight bullet holes in him, you're pretty sure he's about to spring back to his feet.

288
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,820
Eat the look of terror right off your face.

289
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,380
You now have a broken axe.

290
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,920
So, you go to the hardware store.

291
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,920
Explaining away the dark reddish stains on the handle as barbecue sauce.

292
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,620
The repaired axe sits undisturbed in your house until the next spring when one rainy morning.

293
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,700
So, you grab your trusty axe and chop the thing into several pieces.

294
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,560
On the last blow, however.

295
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,960
Of course, a chipped head means yet another trip to the hardware store.

296
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,480
As soon as you get home with your newly headed axe, though.

297
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,840
You meet the reanimated body of the guy you beheaded last year.

298
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,480
Only he's got a new head.

299
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,580
Stitched on with what looks like plastic weed trimmer line.

300
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:14,060
And wears that unique expression of you're the man who killed me last winter resentment that one so rarely encounters in everyday life.

301
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,780
So, you brandish your axe.

302
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,120
Axe to you.

303
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,900
You're Rud 자xed and slave me.

304
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,700
Is he right?

305
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,180
Take this!

306
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,240
Someone called that he is.

307
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,240


308
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,240


309
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,240


310
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,240


311
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,240


312
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,160
You'll have my heart

313
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,600
And we'll never be apart

314
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,140
Baby in magazines

315
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,320
Whatever the fuck that means

316
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,160
Baby clothes in the dark

317
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,920
You cannot see shiny cars

318
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,540
And that's when you will need me there

319
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,940
With you I'll always

320
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,100
Make our hopes with the sun shine through

321
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,940
Shine together

322
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,800
Don't ever run back here forever

323
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,440
Said I'll always be your friend

324
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,260
Took a note, I'ma take it out, take it in

325
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,140
Now that it's raining more than ever

326
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,900
Know that we'll still have each other

327
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,260
You can stand under my umbrella

328
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,100
Yeah, you can stand under my umbrella

329
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,760
Umbrella, umbrella

330
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,280
Hey, hey

331
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,520
Hey, hey

332
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:44,520


333
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,640
Under my umbrella

334
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,480
Umbrella, umbrella

335
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,380
Hey, hey

336
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,160
Under my umbrella

337
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,060
Umbrella, umbrella

338
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,300
Hey, hey

339
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,700
Under my umbrella

340
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,380
Umbrella, umbrella

341
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,600
Hey, hey

342
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,140
These fancy things

343
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,720
Will never come in between

344
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,280
You're part of my entity

345
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,960
Here for infinity

346
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,520
When the war has to end

347
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,120
It's far

348
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,300
When the world has dealt its cards

349
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,840
It means a hand is hard

350
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,020
To get a room in your heart

351
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,040
Because

352
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,960
When the sun shines

353
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,280
We'll shine together

354
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,920
Told you I'd be here forever

355
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,820
Said I'd always be your friend

356
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,600
Took a note, I'ma take it out, take it in

357
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,340
Now that it's raining more than ever

358
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,140
Know that we'll still have each other

359
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,300
You can stand under my umbrella

360
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,680
Umbrella, umbrella

361
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,220
Under my umbrella

362
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,180
Umbrella, accordingly

363
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,580
vẫn챻 디자인

364
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,660
I'll spend a cold winter

365
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,900
Like a rainbow

366
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,000
Thank you.

367
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,840
Thank you.

368
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,240
Thank you.

369
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,880
More side effects.

370
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,300
It's always like this when I'm on the sauce.

371
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,380
I dosed six hours ago.

372
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,500
My count had 5,829 grains of rice on her plate.

373
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,060
The rice was grown in Arkansas.

374
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,960
The guy who ran the John Deere harvester was nicknamed Cooter.

375
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,780
I'm not a genius.

376
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,520
I'm not a psychic either.

377
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,440
Just side effects, that's all.

378
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,720
David Wong?

379
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,100
You don't look Asian, Mr. Wong.

380
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,260
I'm not.

381
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,300
I was born right here.

382
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,560
I had my last name changed, though.

383
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,980
Thought it'd make me harder to find.

384
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,940
You know that Wong is the most common surname in the world?

385
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,880
Is your family still around?

386
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,320
No, I was adopted.

387
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,820
Never knew my real dad.

388
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,520
My biological mom, she was institutionalized.

389
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,680
Must have been hard.

390
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,380
She was a strung out, crank-addicted cannibal.

391
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,280
Dabbled in.

392
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,460
And vampirism and necromancy.

393
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,920
Blew her welfare check every month on black candles.

394
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,740
Really?

395
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,000
I thought my mom was bad because she wouldn't let me watch Space Ghost.

396
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,280
Bizarre.

397
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:25,840
Fascinating.

398
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,140
Pea nozzles in their head.

399
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,960
But the male that incubates eggs in its mouth.

400
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,340
And the pygmy sea pig that can change the color of its skin.

401
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,120
But many creatures promise sex, drugs, and sea slime.

402
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,940
Take a tour of the world's only undersea ocean of drugs.

403
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,760
Thank you so much for joining us today.

404
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:44,640
Talk.

405
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,500
You know, I...

406
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,980
Sea slime.

407
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,360
I really didn't organism deploy slime.

408
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,940
In slime, well, some kind of mucus, right?

409
00:19:59,220 --> 00:19:59,620
Correct.

410
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,260
Mucus or gelatinous material.

411
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,200
They can actually tie their tail in a knot around their body.

412
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,760
And then sort of move the knot up towards the head to essentially squeegee off the slime.

413
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,260
They don't have any jaws.

414
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,740
And they only have small teeth on their tongue.

415
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,600
They have to find other ways to get access to the tasty inside flesh.

416
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,940
So they go in through the mouth, the gills, or I'm sorry to say, the back door.

417
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,400
So my friend is like, I am not going swimming because those orifice-seeking hagfish are out there.

418
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,760
It's only if you're dead or dying near the bottom of the sea that it could be a problem.

419
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,100
Oh, my goodness.

420
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,720
You look over at Italy.

421
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,960
I mean, the gondolas were freezing.

422
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,720
Man, people were stuck in their house.

423
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,780
I mean, wow.

424
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,980
I mean, this is a done deal.

425
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,040
You guys, you're gone into it, man.

426
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,340
There's nothing going to stop it.

427
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,680
It happened 200 years ago.

428
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,460
You know, you're not only talking an ice age, but you're talking some big earthquakes coming.

429
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,980
Because that water ain't going nowhere.

430
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,040
And it's still melting.

431
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,200
And it has nothing to do with warming or cooling or none of that stuff.

432
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,000
You've got holes in your ozone.

433
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,140
You know, you've got nuclear fallout in your ice cores.

434
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,100
You know, because I like to stick my face right in front of all the.

435
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:13,580
And I've been talking to a lot of people.

436
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,980
I've been talking to a lot of professors and NASA and everybody.

437
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,220
And this, you know, man, come on, people.

438
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,000
Just make it toxic as heck.

439
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:27,540
And for the little fishies as they're reporting whales, sharks, all kinds of dead critters coming up all over the place around the globe.

440
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,460
You know, so I tell you guys, man, have a plan.

441
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,740
We're going to have all kinds of anomalies happening.

442
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,740
More people died from shock and panic than anything.

443
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,560
You know what's going on.

444
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,380
And you set up contacts out of state to boogie.

445
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,240
And you got your protocols.

446
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,600
And in gear, man, it's a no, it's a no brainer.

447
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,760
But if you don't, well, yeah, you're going to be a deer in the headlights.

448
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:58,600
What is happening, beloved, is that witches are becoming so bold today that they are coming angels with flaming swords on the offensive.

449
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:06,220
They are out of the closets with authority over the Jesus Christ with Satan and with Christ.

450
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,720
Any time you take one look at Jesus Christ, take ten looks at the Lord Satan.

451
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,240
Beloved, we're going to be going into the world.

452
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,500
And Jesus Christ has territory in this tape.

453
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,360
But remember, he is a loser.

454
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,440
He is scared to death because Satan is soon going to return.

455
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,220
Jesus Christ is going to launch all his forces against the believers.

456
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,300
And we should be on our toes, beloved.

457
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,460
The truth is the subgenius offers eternal salvation over triple your money.

458
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:37,080
That is eternal salvation in terms of your bliss for $115, which is three times $35.

459
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,940
You can't keep up with the math, but that's not important right now.

460
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,920
What is important is that the church is serving his office.

461
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,580
And that is eternal salvation for $1,000.

462
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,300
Things are in motion, Mr. Wong.

463
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,160
Fascinating.

464
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,040
What?

465
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,900
They harvest insects here, do they not?

466
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,500
For their honey?

467
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,800
Do the bees know that they make the honey for you?

468
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,340
Or do they work tirelessly because they think it is their own choice?

469
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,560
Have you ever noticed when you hear a word for the very first time in your life,

470
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,320
you will hear that word again within 24 hours?

471
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:21,260
Do you ever wonder why sometimes you'll see a single shoe lying alongside the road?

472
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,060
I've been watching you for some time.

473
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,560
But there are great gaps in my knowledge.

474
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,500
Do you know I observed a man who masturbated until he bled?

475
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,000
Did he want to do that?

476
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,660
And you?

477
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,000
When you were alone?

478
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,740
So you understand my mood.

479
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,420
Understand why I'm out here committing felonies today.

480
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,340
There are some very dark things happening.

481
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,700
And I've got this lonely feeling like I'm the only one who knows,

482
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,400
the only one who can do anything about it.

483
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,240
Everybody's got a ghost story, UFO or Bigfoot story.

484
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:07,500
No.

485
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:13,240
Now what I think, I think stuff is both real and not real at the same time.

486
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,360
I'm not a Star Trek fan.

487
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,720
I don't know very much about other dimensions and all that.

488
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,860
I'm an old school Catholic.

489
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,640
I believe in hell.

490
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,680
I believe that it's more than just murderers and rapists down there.

491
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,200
I believe in demons and worms and vile shit.

492
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
The grease trap of the universe.

493
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,680
And the more I think about it, the more I think that it's not just some place down there.

494
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,100
Oh no.

495
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,040
That it's right here with us.

496
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,500
We just can't perceive it.

497
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,500
It's kind of like the country music radio station.

498
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,620
It's out there in the air.

499
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,000
Even if you don't tune into it.

500
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:57,660
And I think that somehow through chemistry or magic or voodoo,

501
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,740
that Jamaican son of a bitch, he tuned into it.

502
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,240
Into hell itself.

503
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,880
Through that.

504
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,140
He opened the door.

505
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,760
He became the door.

506
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,740
And me?

507
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,580
I intend to close it.

508
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,580
Tales of tomorrow.

509
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,100
Tales of today.

510
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,160
Tomorrow.

511
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,780
And it's true, dear friends.

512
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,040
Tonight's show, believe it or not, is about something.

513
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:50,200
It's about all the movies that we saw on Friday night at I, Doctor, Mr. Sister's Friday night movie party.

514
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,760
We have every now and then.

515
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,880
Boy, howdy.

516
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,280
And Doctor Dark and Her Highness Helma came.

517
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,720
And we saw shows that we're presenting clips from tonight.

518
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,020
But first I'm going to do the credits here.

519
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:13,820
Friend, most of the rants we've heard that sound like movie soundtrack were from a movie called John Dies at the End.

520
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:21,620
Which is directed by John Coscarelli, who also did Bubba Hotep and the Phantasm movies.

521
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:31,480
But it was written by David Wong, also known as Jason Pargan, a senior editor at Cracked.com.

522
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,000
And it's one of the funniest horror movies I've ever seen.

523
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,960
And it's so subgenius.

524
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,500
Well, we're going to prove how subgenius it is in a minute.

525
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:46,420
The collages we've been hearing mostly came from Reverend Royal Decapitator.

526
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:57,000
The little bit of subgenius ranting with a lot of effects on it was by Brother Freddy from the Westeros Baptist Church, which is kind of a rogue clinch.

527
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,580
We're a little embarrassed by them.

528
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,720
They think Bob hates everything.

529
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,980
And well, they're not.

530
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,180
There'll be more about them later.

531
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:18,780
The song, the insane song with O-E-O in it was by the Rudy Schwartz Project called Full Frumbarella from Full Frontal Klugman.

532
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:29,280
The song where I had to reverse a certain word 24 times, a funky rock song.

533
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,040
It was the first song we played.

534
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,200
It was by Fishbone.

535
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,000
A song called Aka-Foo.

536
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:41,020
And The Large did the collages around the beginning and the title.

537
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:48,960
Anyway, friends, as I said, we were over at Dr. and Mr. Sister's house watching these shows.

538
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:55,420
And the first thing I, Dr. and Mr. Sister, presented was an ancient TV show called Tales of Tomorrow.

539
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,720
I think from like 1951.

540
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,900
It predated Twilight Zone.

541
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,440
And all those other ones.

542
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,980
But by a long shot, I'd never even heard of it.

543
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:13,020
But the episode he played to us was about the birth of the Church of the Subgenius.

544
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,280
Only it was done in 1951.

545
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,820
I'm going to play a clip from it which you will not believe.

546
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,660
I can understand your bewilderment.

547
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,640
You've not read the book, have you?

548
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,500
The one you're holding in your hand.

549
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,880
Oh, the book.

550
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,260
Yes, I've read some of it.

551
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,400
Why?

552
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,800
Then you can read it.

553
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,940
Of course I can read it.

554
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,360
Why shouldn't I?

555
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,700
No need to raise your voice.

556
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

557
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:35,600
I didn't...

558
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,680
When you finish the book, you will understand as Walter even now is beginning to understand.

559
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,700
I don't know what you're talking about.

560
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,480
But it frightens you.

561
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,880
Well, that's ridiculous.

562
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:45,720
But true.

563
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,640
You are frightened, aren't you, Mr. Davis?

564
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,260
Frightened of something you felt before but refused to recognize.

565
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,980
And you don't understand.

566
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,340
But you will, Mr. Davis.

567
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,260
We will make you understand.

568
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,340
What must I understand?

569
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,000
The difference, Mr. Davis.

570
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,440
The difference in Walt, in you.

571
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,560
I've heard about enough of this.

572
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,940
Stop acting like a child.

573
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,880
Do you imagine you can run from it?

574
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,660
You've read the book.

575
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,960
Perhaps you failed to read far enough.

576
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,320
Or refused to accept the meaning in the words.

577
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,600
You have reached the point of knowing and now you shall know.

578
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,740
You are a mutation.

579
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,300
A superior human being.

580
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,920
A deviation from the normal.

581
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,520
You came into being because nature demanded a new race.

582
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,280
Because evolution must not stop at the creation of man.

583
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,620
But must continually improve.

584
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,580
We must unite our mutants and their superior intelligence.

585
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:54,460
For in a very short time, the human race will fall into competition with another race from another planet.

586
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,560
A race which even now threatens to enslave us.

587
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,980
You are not alone.

588
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,160
There are thousands like you.

589
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,780
And you will be the founders of a new superior civilization.

590
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,020
Interesting hypothesis.

591
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,220
A fact.

592
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,440
Then you're trying to tell me that I am a mutation?

593
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,800
You are, Mr. Davis. Otherwise you would not see our room here.

594
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,380
Or be able to read our books.

595
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,180
And you, dear listener, would not be able to hear our...

596
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,320
...radio show.

597
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,340
John dies at the end.

598
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,320
We looked at that movie.

599
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,640
Now some of you, of course, are going,

600
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,420
That movie's been out for five months.

601
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,220
Stank's just now only hearing about it.

602
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,580
Gah!

603
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:46,880
Well, we were doing other things while you were watching TV, friend.

604
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,360
We were living it.

605
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,260
Anyway, yeah.

606
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,240
John dies at the end.

607
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,660
We're sitting there watching that movie.

608
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,600
And...

609
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,660
By golly, it seemed like the most subgeniusful thing.

610
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,780
It certainly did.

611
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,140
It's not the only movie about a weird drug that puts you in another reality.

612
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:11,260
We recently watched Upstream Color, which is like that also.

613
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,420
But this one's much funnier.

614
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,020
Well, here, I'll just play this little clip.

615
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,520
You already have a bit of a following, though, don't you?

616
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,320
I found a couple of discussion boards on the web devoted to you and your friend.

617
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,560
Your, uh...

618
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,740
...hobby.

619
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,600
I guess.

620
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,100
Okay.

621
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,520
I'm not farting around.

622
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,640
You have 83 cents in your front pocket, Arnie.

623
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,220
Three quarters of nickel, three pennies.

624
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,820
The pennies are dated 1983, 1993, and 1999.

625
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,680
I'll be damned.

626
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,220
That's a neat trick, Mr. Wong.

627
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,980
If you flip the nickel ten times, you'll get heads, heads, tails, heads, tails, tails, tails, heads, tails, tails.

628
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,860
I don't think I want to take the time to do that.

629
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,460
Last night you had a dream, Arnie.

630
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,720
You dreamt you were being chased through the forest by your mother.

631
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:04,020
She was lashing you with a whip made of knotted penises.

632
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,900
That's right, Arnie. Everything you know is wrong.

633
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,340
You got my attention, Mr. Wong.

634
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,660
Oh, it gets better.

635
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,840
A lot better.

636
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,420
Yes, friends, it gets better.

637
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,280
See if you can count how many...

638
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:32,720
subgenius buzzwords and references appear in this last cut I'm gonna play, okay?

639
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,180
St. Tom's.

640
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,560
Uh, hi. I need a priest.

641
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,840
Well, this is Father Shellnut. What can I do for you?

642
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,020
Do you... have any experience with, like, demonism?

643
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,560
Like hauntings and possessions and all that?

644
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,720
Look, people say they see things or hear voices in their head.

645
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,260
We generally refer them to a demon.

646
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,600
I'm a counselor.

647
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,040
No, no, no, no. No, I'm not crazy.

648
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,460
Other people have...

649
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,440
No, I didn't mean to imply that.

650
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,580
Why don't you come talk to me?

651
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:09,180
And then, even if you need to see a professional, I've got a brother-in-law who's real good.

652
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,660
What do you think it's like, Father?

653
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,340
What's life like?

654
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,720
Being crazy. Mentally ill.

655
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,040
Well, they never know they're ill, do they?

656
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,980
I mean, you can't diagnose yourself with the same organ that has the disease.

657
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,360
Just like you can't see your own eyeball.

658
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,580
I suppose you just feel regular.

659
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,960
And the rest of the world seems to go crazy around you.

660
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,020
But let's just suppose that I actually...

661
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:36,020
I mean, in reality, ran into something from beyond the...

662
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,200
Oh!

663
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,360
I'll try to explain this without cursing,

664
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,940
but the black shit from Planet X that came out from that motherfucker looked like it had grown hair.

665
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,000
Did I mention that the stuff was moving?

666
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,100
Twitching?

667
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,080
Ah!

668
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,000
Uh, hello.

669
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,240
You still there?

670
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,420
Yes, son, I am.

671
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,760
Just keep calm, okay?

672
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,700
Nothing you're seeing is real.

673
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,060
I could feel it.

674
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,960
That strange, venomous warmth spreading through my thigh.

675
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,900
Look, I appreciate your time, but, uh...

676
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,020
I'm starting to think that there's nothing you can do to help me.

677
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,240
Son, I'm going to be honest with you.

678
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,580
We both know you're fucked.

679
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,220
Excuse me?

680
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,400
Your mom writes on the walls with her own shit.

681
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,800
Great changes are coming to Dead World, my son.

682
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,160
Waves of maggots over oceans of rot.

683
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,180
You'll see it, David.

684
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,700
You'll see it with your own eyes.

685
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,360
Do you understand?

686
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,000
Yes, friends, well...

687
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,220
Only the internet listeners will know.

688
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,320
I had to bleep out of that thing.

689
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,840
Now, Dave?

690
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,480
It just returned.

691
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,440
Again.

692
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,640
Oh, I can't tell...

693
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:02,660
No!

694
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,680
The bus is gone now!

695
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,580
It's gone!

696
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,780
I wanted to talk about Lumiere and the vacant tubes and all the other stuff that was so

697
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,060
exciting.

698
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:17,300
Well, I've got Einstein's Secret Orchestra playing in the background, and that has its

699
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,200
own buzz that may kind of wipe out the whole thing.

700
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:22,200


701
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:22,200


702
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,120
It's going to wipe out the Dave buzz.

703
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,020
Sorry to crash your buzz.

704
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,840
Oh, this movie we saw, Dave, John dies at the end, which, by the way, is a lie.

705
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,400
John doesn't actually die at the end.

706
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,700
He dies in the middle.

707
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,200
He dies in the middle, but he comes back.

708
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,520
It doesn't matter who dies.

709
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Well, I thought that was the name of his member, his organ.

710
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,820
He called it John or something like that.

711
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,320
Little John.

712
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:48,780
Yeah.

713
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,740
And then what had happened in reality...

714
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,120
And Big Richard.

715
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,940
...was that he shrunk into...

716
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:59,340
Remember in The Incredible Shrinking Man, there's that feeling of merging with the infinite

717
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,540
just by being a tiny little thing and getting smaller?

718
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,560
Yeah, I didn't like that ending as a kid.

719
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,400
I know.

720
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,540
It scared me.

721
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,160
I had bad dreams because of it.

722
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,560
Did you have the bad dreams, too?

723
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,000
This is the bad dream, Dave.

724
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,360
I know that.

725
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,440
This is just one part of the bad dream.

726
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,100
But they wish...

727
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,800
I think whisper common is slogans in your earbags sometimes when you're not snoring

728
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,100
enough.

729
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,740
I don't know if it's true or not.

730
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,440
What, Dave?

731
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:40,240
Now, what used to be a buzz now sounds like waves on the ocean crashing against the shore.

732
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,340
A harmonious twaddle, so to speak, a kind of a...

733
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,320
No, it's pretty bad, actually.

734
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,720
See, now I can hear nothing at all, but it seems to have returned to normal.

735
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,380
I'm running your volume up and down, and it's definitely you.

736
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:59,920
Your line is, it may sound good to you, but that's because you're mentally divergent,

737
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,320
Dave.

738
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:08,640
You live in another reality that diverged from this one that day you flipped the coin

739
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,760
and it came up heads.

740
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,820
In another reality, it came up tails.

741
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:18,240
Now, don't you think that that's a very fancy industrial noise that we're getting in the

742
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,620
background?

743
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:22,420
That's like, you know, specially tweaked for our pleasure?

744
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,520
No, no, it's bad.

745
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,660
Dave, we're going to have to take you off because it's just too...

746
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:29,820
No.

747
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,160
It's awful.

748
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,360
I'm going to have to bail on that one.

749
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,580
That was real strange.

750
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,680
There's somebody else trying to call, but that doesn't...

751
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,700
We don't do that.

752
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,720
But couldn't that be Dave trying to call again with a clear line?

753
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,760
All right.

754
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:46,780
No.

755
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,700
All right.

756
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,880
I don't know.

757
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,380
I don't know.

758
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,220
You see, here's the problem.

759
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,860
They're getting in by way of these movies and TV shows.

760
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:04,320
They're blending the realities up and they're trying to confuse us between the fake realities

761
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,860
and the Dave reality and the other real reality.

762
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:16,500
For instance, we're watching this movie and obviously somebody had read my mind and all

763
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,300
of our minds.

764
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:24,720
The movie featured things that were in my movie that haven't been used yet.

765
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:31,040
Like the man made of meat, slabs of meat throwing themselves together magically and becoming

766
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,480
a man.

767
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,840
Well, that was my idea, but they got in my head and they stole it.

768
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:46,660
And the bug in the past, in the works that make the bullet fail in the gun, that's no

769
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:46,880
coincidence.

770
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,380
And the topless bozo women.

771
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,540
Now, I did make that movie.

772
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,100
There was shots in that that looked like color versions of Let's Visit the World of the Future,

773
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,600
Tales of Tomorrow.

774
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:07,400
And Susie the floozy was in Tales of Tomorrow in 1951 and yet she wasn't born until 1954

775
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,200
or three or something.

776
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,420
Yes.

777
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,640
She was the ingenue.

778
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,640
And Reverend Nicky Fowler.

779
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,740
And Nicky Deathchick's name, her human street name, was in the titles, the end credits of

780
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,840
John Dies at the End.

781
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,040
And Nicky's name appears at the end of John Dies at the End.

782
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,160
But it was Nicky's real name, which is not a usual name.

783
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:33,660
No.

784
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,340
It might be a normal name in France, but it certainly isn't here in America.

785
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:46,080
And we just do not understand how we can stop them.

786
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:51,200
Oh, by the way, I learned, Princess Wee, you'll be interested to know, that the director

787
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,880
of John Dies at the End is working on a sequel to Bubba Hotep.

788
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,560
Oh, wow.

789
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,840
Called Bubba Nosferatu.

790
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,960
That's not a joke.

791
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,540
That's a true, well, it was in Wikipedia.

792
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,680
And the lads who wrote John Dies in the End, the original book, have a new book that's

793
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,060
out now that's a sequel to it called This Book is Full of Love.

794
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,020
And it's a sequel to the original book, The Book is Full of Spiders.

795
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,820
Seriously, dude, don't touch it.

796
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,920
That's the name of the book.

797
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:27,740
And if it's anything like the movie, seriously, dude, don't touch it.

798
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,460
Because this book is full of spiders.

799
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,000
Full of spiders.

800
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:41,120
Oh, the other thing that happened at the Friday night meetup, besides a man made of meat,

801
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:49,620
Dr. Dark presented to us a scientific paper that he had found, something called the Journal

802
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,680
of Space Exploration.

803
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:58,600
And this document, that's a Xerox in my hand, it looks really authentic.

804
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:07,060
It's in double column, 10 point times, serif type, so you know it's like a science paper,

805
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,920
not some Helvetica piece of garbage that some kid whipped out.

806
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,640
No, this is a real New Ager.

807
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:22,820
This is the kind of thing that inspired us so much 40 years ago when Bob first approached us.

808
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:34,480
It's a preliminary discussion of alien civilizations and it was, all of this information came from remote viewing.

809
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:39,640
And there's quite a bit of scientifical explanation of remote viewing in here, but I'm going to

810
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,420
read a few of the highlights.

811
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:51,440
I've been, the full paper is by Shelly Thompson of Thompson Research of New Braunfels, Texas.

812
00:41:52,420 --> 00:42:01,640
And this was, this document was received July 7th, 2012, was accepted September 10th,

813
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:08,860
but then it was published only 10 days later because the information is, well, friends,

814
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:13,660
the observations that will be presented can in theory be verified by comparing them with other sources of information.

815
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:21,060
Government agencies and defense corporations hold the larger body of information about high-strangeness phenomena in strict secrecy.

816
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,660
The secret data may consist primarily of photographs, radar traces, infrared and microwave emanations,

817
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,160
and a few anecdotal accounts by individuals who obtained a close look at the phenomenon.

818
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:38,260
It is very unlikely that corroboration exists for the depth of information acquired by the author.

819
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,860
Using remote viewing.

820
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:46,300
Owing to the difficulty of the task, it is unlikely that another remote viewer will be able to repeat the work in the foreseeable future.

821
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:52,700
Nevertheless, given the potential importance of the findings, it was deemed improper to withhold them.

822
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:02,320
One of the findings here is that the demand that the universe order itself in line with our preference to perceive only one reality at a time is unreasonable.

823
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,660
Friends, you better heed that.

824
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,840
Now, this is a very important issue.

825
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,960
When they start talking about the aliens, this is a really in-depth analysis.

826
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,300
I'm just skipping around.

827
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,060
I did select favorite parts.

828
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,740
A significant difference appeared to exist between intelligent life on gas giant planets, Saturn for example,

829
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,460
and the upright biped design that appears in many forms in our galaxy.

830
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,540
Whereas humans can distinguish between sentience and intelligence.

831
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:37,340
For example, the neighborhood deer are sentient but not intelligent,

832
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,820
whereas the author's house is intelligent.

833
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,200
The house cats are both sentient and intelligent.

834
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:47,080
That gives me a real clearer, an ever clearer picture of the author of this.

835
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,040
As a cat lady.

836
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,320
Aliens have many more categories to choose from.

837
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,520
Humans look at technology as composed of inert objects.

838
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,700
That is one of the key differences between humans and advanced species.

839
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:07,340
Virtually anything humans do with the mind can be performed by aliens as an act of technology.

840
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:11,020
And they can do additional acts that humans have yet to imagine.

841
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,800
No immature members of the species of aliens were observed.

842
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,060
It is not known how they create their units or their progeny or whether the latter term even applies.

843
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,820
The emotions exhibited by this species appear to be very limited.

844
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,320
They are task-oriented.

845
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,480
In some casts, they feel the equivalent of fear.

846
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,640
They are also capable of anger.

847
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,000
Individuation is both a matter of degree and a function of caste.

848
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,240
Within this species, the short, more numerous units resemble living robots.

849
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,960
They appear to act as animated tools.

850
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:50,460
As caste rises, the units become taller, more intelligent, and more fully autonomous.

851
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:55,540
Nevertheless, individual decision-making is very limited to all intents and purposes.

852
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:00,400
This species functions as a collective intelligence analogous to an ant colony.

853
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,920
That is very interesting, dear.

854
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:15,400
Oh, the author actually paid a visit to an orbital facility belonging to this species via remote viewing.

855
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,420
The facility handled experiments on human beings.

856
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,540
The human participants did not benefit.

857
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:27,140
The author broke a module and released some humans from connection with the experiments.

858
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,020
Two units who seemed to be low-grade technicians appeared agitated by this action but did not interfere.

859
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,980
So this would make a pretty good documentary.

860
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:36,220
This is a good movie.

861
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:46,880
This lady in Texas, every time I read this, she gains another 50 pounds in my remote viewing.

862
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,720
I'm remote viewing her.

863
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:49,300
Yes.

864
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,240
And her house smells like 19 cats.

865
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,080
Uh-oh.

866
00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:01,320
Yeah, she broke into one of the modules to save the humans who were being experimented on.

867
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,700
And she did save them.

868
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,960
But when she came back with some other people, she was killed.

869
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:19,880
They were unable to free the rest of the humans because the aliens, the B group aliens, had created a new weapon that defeated her remote viewing powers.

870
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,100
Oh, wow.

871
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,400
That was valiant of her.

872
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,640
Now, in some ways, they're much like subgeniuses, these aliens are.

873
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,020
Okay.

874
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,840
Their intent is to colonize the Earth.

875
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,800
They do not consider humanity an intelligent species.

876
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,000
There is more than one reason for this attitude on their part.

877
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,320
But the principal element appears to be the following.

878
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:42,280
These species regularly collects humans for examination and subsequent release.

879
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:51,500
This usually occurs in rural areas, which probably leads to oversampling of uneducated and technologically backward subjects.

880
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,920
This is this lady's way of putting down her fellow rednecks.

881
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,140
They're in New Braunfels.

882
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,460
They're all so primitive.

883
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,480
But I know how she feels.

884
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,820
With respect to comparative intelligence, humans are not.

885
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,540
Not very bright.

886
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:12,280
Although, obviously, the author of this thing is in a great position to judge that sort of thing.

887
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,480
We run into that a lot.

888
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,140
Oh, and also, I think she's a bit of a man-hater, or at least the aliens are.

889
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,800
The colonizers concluded that human males have a biological urge to fight one another.

890
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:32,220
Organized society, they reason, cannot tolerate such a high proportion of males, and it is ultimately the cause of war.

891
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,720
They calculated the birth ratio.

892
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,320
The ratio of females to males that would prevent war.

893
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,740
The threshold was reached at approximately eight to one.

894
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:50,800
So, if you ladies kill off all but one out of every eight males, there will be no violence.

895
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,160
All you have to do is kill seven out of eight males.

896
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,320
Wow, that sounds so easy.

897
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:56,920
Let one survive.

898
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:04,300
And then it says the ladies would, the eight wives would be protective of their one husband.

899
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,960
It's unlikely that he would be allowed to risk himself in fights.

900
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,980
She's got it really all worked out.

901
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:12,460
Yeah.

902
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,520
But this music in the background is perfect for it.

903
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,760
It certainly is.

904
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,760
Our life in the robot factory, rocket factory.

905
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,540
Our life in the rocket factory.

906
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:29,280
That's Lonesome Cowboy Dave on guitar and Chaz Smith on several keyboards.

907
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,800
And Michelle George on violin.

908
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,700
And Bob Moses on guitar.

909
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,920
And Bob Moses on music on drums, I'm sure.

910
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:43,940
Because I must have recorded that band 53 and a half times.

911
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,060
At least.

912
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:53,080
So, friends, I could go on and on and on and on, but I can tell you don't want me to.

913
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,540
I can tell by remote hearing.

914
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,920
Silent radio invented by Dr. Philo Drummond, the overman.

915
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,440
The aliens are actively mining our resources.

916
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,680
Oh, I said I wasn't going to do that.

917
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,320
I can't stop.

918
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,280
Some animals have learned a few words of human language.

919
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,860
Where is the human who speaks gorilla or dolphinese?

920
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,140
Well?

921
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,640
Oh, here's one last really good line.

922
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,880
All over the world, humans blink flashlights at UFOs.

923
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,780
I was not aware of that.

924
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:33,800
This has removed optical signals from the list of ways in which human beings could initiate an intelligent conversation.

925
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,700
Sometimes the UFOs blink back, but that is not significant.

926
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:39,960
Boy.

927
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:45,620
I know a few friends who worship the Marfa lights in Texas.

928
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:51,920
I'd hate to tell them that it's not significant when the aliens blink back at your blinking flashlight.

929
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,260
Oh, I can't stop.

930
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:00,140
Imagine what it would have meant to humanity to have another habitable world within arm's reach.

931
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,400
It is possible that a previous civilization had that benefit.

932
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:10,520
The traces of an ancient civilization on Mars are telling, as is the evidence that it came to a sudden end.

933
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:14,180
Either through warfare or a close encounter with a celestial object,

934
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:23,640
the civilization that produced the Egyptian pyramids, which were already ancient in the time of the pharaohs, may once have spanned two worlds.

935
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,000
Well, see?

936
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,660
Aliens built the pyramids.

937
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,940
Your cat is smarter than you are.

938
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,380
Everything you do is better than you think.

939
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,180
The only person you know is David Wong!

940
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,340
So, dear friends, with that, I could...

941
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,980
We could just shut up.

942
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,320
Oh, wait. Well, let's try one more time.

943
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,180
One more time.

944
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,740
Is it still there?

945
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,140
Now, that's not for me.

946
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,700
It's still there.

947
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,160
It's still there.

948
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:59,680
It may be that the station...

949
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,600
Maybe the...

950
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,920
That would just figure.

951
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,880
Dave finally gets rid of the buzz, and the station gets its own buzz.

952
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,180
That would...

953
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,520
Is it truly a buzz, though?

954
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,160
Yes. That's the interesting question.

955
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,320
Where do the popping sounds come from?

956
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,000
I'll go weeks without popping sounds.

957
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:20,920
Mary Poppins.

958
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,680
I'll change equipments.

959
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,440
I'll look around at different things.

960
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,000
I guess people even come and look at the outside where it's connected and say, no prob.

961
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,220
But, uh, who cares?

962
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,340
Well, um...

963
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,640
Dave, I believe that...

964
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,480
It makes my friends droop in thinking of it.

965
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,060
And my gray hair is shaggy.

966
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:41,240
It makes me want to cry and argue with policemen and stuff you're not supposed to do.

967
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:41,720
Oh.

968
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,960
I believe that they killed your buzz.

969
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,060
They did, man.

970
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,140
A long time ago.

971
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,280
Buzz killers. All.

972
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:58,040
For that matter, I feel like my voice is a little echoey, but it may be because of some tiny, microscopical time delay.

973
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:59,480
But I hear no echo.

974
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,340
In this other universe.

975
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,080
In our universe.

976
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,160
I hear no echo.

977
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,240
You know, no Alpine Valley goat sounds.

978
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,560
No, la, la, la, la, la.

979
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,560
I only hear it on me.

980
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,340
I hear no yodeling.

981
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,000
This show is full of spiders.

982
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,140
Seriously, dude, don't touch it.

983
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:13,140


984
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:17,480
You've got one of those psychoactive amulets that keep your, um, hearts monitored.

985
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:27,540
Dave, we've been playing the old witch disco tunes by Einstein's Secret Orchestra in the background.

986
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,480
They are groovy, aren't they?

987
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,900
They are so groovy.

988
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,220
They sound really good.

989
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,880
God, this call is not working.

990
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,620
It's getting louder and louder and louder.

991
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:39,800
And I know that our station engineer would want me to not do this.

992
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:45,300
I don't know about you, but hearing expert Ivan Stang says this is bad.

993
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,220
I have no music either.

994
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:55,640
Dave, I'm just going to have to take you off and go straight to some tape, I guess.

995
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,780
I think that it is interference from another.

996
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,740
Another world.

997
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:05,620
No, this doesn't make a lot of sense because I think I don't know.

998
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,900
I don't know.

999
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,740
And Dave, I'm potting you down and I'm going to have to say good night.

1000
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,820
It's the Ash Tabulin industrial noise.

1001
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,600
Good night, Dave.

1002
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,180
Good night, Dave.

1003
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,540
That was sad.

1004
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:25,060
But meanwhile, coming up, a brand new amino acid song.

1005
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:28,800
And everybody thought they had gone back to their home planet, but they haven't.

1006
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,900
That will be coming up very presently.

1007
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:32,600
Thank you.

1008
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,480
But now, let's go ahead with this experiment.

1009
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:35,020
Is that.

1010
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,620
And you can tell me how this apparatus works as we go along.

1011
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,360
Guess what it does.

1012
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,940
I think I'll understand it better when I see this thing work.

1013
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,980
I should be very much disappointed if it doesn't.

1014
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,860
Oh, don't you worry about that, doctor.

1015
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:46,920
Now I can go ahead.

1016
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,120
Anything I can do to help?

1017
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:48,780
No, thanks.

1018
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,100
Yes, yes, yes, come.

1019
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,060
Oh.

1020
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,300
Come.

1021
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,900
I'd love to, doctor, and you know it.

1022
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,700
Oh, Wilma.

1023
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,980
Oh, oh.

1024
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,340
Doctor.

1025
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:00,920
Oh, doctor.

1026
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:01,560
Now.

1027
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,100
Oh, yes.

1028
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,440
Oh, doctor.

1029
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,180
My, why don't you have more.

1030
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,000
Tell me, tell me, tell me.

1031
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,480
This spooky greenish glow.

1032
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,460
Part of a little experiment I'm conducting.

1033
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:10,940
Oh.

1034
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:11,900
But tell me.

1035
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:12,440
Why, no.

1036
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:16,280
Meantime, I've made ready for a final test of this little invention here.

1037
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,740
But what's the matter?

1038
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,240
Doctor, what's happened to him?

1039
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:19,620
Eh?

1040
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,660
Is he all right?

1041
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,320
Doctor.

1042
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,180
I see.

1043
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,420
What's happened to him?

1044
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,620
Why is he lying here on the table?

1045
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,720
Don't worry, Wilma.

1046
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:26,220
Don't worry?

1047
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,240
Doctor, what are you.

1048
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:27,680
He is.

1049
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:27,680


1050
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:27,680


1051
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:27,680


1052
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,340
He is offered to be the subject of my test.

1053
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:29,820
That's all.

1054
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,200
But then, why is he.

1055
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,560
