1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
That's what I want

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,500
That's what I want

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,420
They are not complete

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,800
They cannot be

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,500
They don't even start to know

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,340
I want to hold you

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,060
I want to show you

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,900
Everything that love can be

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,380
I want you next to

10
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,480
I want you next to

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:57,480


12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:57,980
Plus two

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,260
I want you to be

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,160
With me

15
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,360
With me

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,040
bass solo

17
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,040


18
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,040

00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,300
Remember, Bob is the comrade of all people.

37
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,940
Here in China, just like in America,

38
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,300
the people need slack.

39
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,680
In Chinese, we call slack 了天牌.

40
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,520
But it must be true slack,

41
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,240
not the bad slack of the conspiracy.

42
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,020
Please, Bob, help me somebody.

43
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,760
Bob!

44
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,260
Eternal salvation

45
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,040
or triple your money back.

The Church of the Subgenius

47
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:56,660
Mis amigos,

48
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,200
queridos,

49
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,540
¿Qué quiere en su vida?

50
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,840
¿Riqueza grande?

51
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,980
¿Una mujer bonita o un hombre guapo?

52
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,380
¿Un coche rápido?

53
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,860
¿Fuerza tremendo?

54
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:21,840
¿O simplemente una filosofía perfecto?

55
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,680
¿Por qué trabaja como perro

56
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,260
para estas cosas?

57
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,680
Puede tener todo con la Iglesia del Subgenius

58
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,820
por un dólar solamente.

59
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,600
¿Conoce usted Bob Dobbs?

60
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,640
Bob Dobbs y su Iglesia son la troca a salvación

61
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,920

En todas maneras.

65
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,300
Sí, el mundo es a punto de terminar.

66
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,140
Pero puede escapar los desastros

67
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,340

Le haré borracho con felicidad y slack.

70
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,620
Por solamente un dolor,

71
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,520
puede obtener su suerte

72
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,480
increíble y saberduría.

73
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,260
No es una broma.

74
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,680
Por favor, escribe Bob a

75
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,960

la más grande de su vida.

79
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,300
Pongo suyos ojos verdes.

80
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,200
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

81
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,620

82
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,960
Heraglic function.

83
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,800
That's it, friends.

84
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,900
Ah, yes, praise Bob.

85
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,680
And this is the last hour

86
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,700
of the pledge drive.

87
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,780
And this is your announcer,

88
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,560
your mere host,

89
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,920
Reverend Ivan Stang,

90
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,240
with our good prayer partner.

91
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,560
Well, we got, I'm Pastor Buck Naked,

92
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,180
and over here is Dr. Chaos.

93
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,080
Hello.

94
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,560
Whew, help me somebody.

95
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,660
And as a special guest tonight,

96
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,980
we have the great author,

97
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,280
Jay Condom, author and musician

98
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,720
and artiste, one who all of you

99
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,280
probably know as the author

100
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,980
of the great comic book, P-Dawg.

101
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,680
There's nothing wrong with saying it.

102
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,040
It's like saying Pee-wee Herman.

103
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,760
Where is that?

104
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,840
Where is Mr. Condom?

105
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,960
Ah, here he comes.

106
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,060
Let me give the number, Stang.

107
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,360
Yes.

108
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,180
Let's do that.

109
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,100
Okay, we are still in pledge drive land.

110
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,080
The number to call is 828-9500.

111
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,160
We're going to be soliciting your pledges

112
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,280
for the Hour of Slack,

113
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,800
your fist against Criswell.

114
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,800
828-9500.

115
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,580
And 823-7490.

116
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,660
Call that line only if you want to talk to us.

117
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,020
On or off the air.

118
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,300
It doesn't have to be on the air,

119
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,000
but we'll pick up that line separate.

120
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,100
828-9500.

121
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,640
There are plenty of volunteers here

122
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,220
to take the pledges.

123
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,980
And like I said,

124
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,640
if you want to call 823-7490

125
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,820
to talk to us, that's fine.

126
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,960
Other than that,

127
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,900
call those other lines

128
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,740
to make a pledge for the Hour of Slack

129
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,460
radio ministry

130
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,660
to keep K&ON's challenge going.

131
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,140
And if you want to tell Criswell

132
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,200
what you think of him,

133
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,340
then tell us.

134
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,440
Oh, yes, dear friends,

135
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,800
because you see,

136
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,100
you see,

137
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,020
we can't keep saving the world for nothing.

138
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,780
There is no more money.

139
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,500
We've got to get some money.

140
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,640
That's it.

141
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,300
our money is which?

142
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,920
America's ultimate freedom.

143
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,100
I know,

144
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,000
Ken,

145
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,180
was the most spent

146
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,180


147
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,020
Criswell saying

148
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,980
that he super cared

149
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,920
about American spirituality

150
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:32,920


151
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:32,920


152
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,760
when he knew

153
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,000
he was going to die.

154
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,000


155
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,000


156
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,000


157
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,000


158
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,020
The8

159
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,900
Our às

160
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:58,760
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

161
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,960
Oh, yes, it's true.

162
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,280
It's all true.

163
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,780
Everything you ever heard.

164
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,180
Everything you know is true, friends.

165
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,740
And I tell you what.

166
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,840
We just, now, Buck, what were you saying?

167
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,780
Do we have a call from someone who dares to support this blasphemous show?

168
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:28,080
Yeah, we're getting a couple calls of support, and we're only 6.5% to our goal, and time is closing in.

169
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,820
So please call us and make your place to the Our Slack Radio Ministry at 828-9500.

170
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,040
By the way, I'm telling all our volunteers tonight not to pick up line one, which is 823-7490.

171
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,780
That's to talk to us.

172
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,900
I think we just lost a caller that we were going to talk to, give him a healing.

173
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,460
He's pink.

174
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,880
He needs a healing.

175
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,400
But 828-9500 is your number to pledge.

176
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,300
That's right, and friends, tonight we've got an action-packed show.

177
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,240
We've got an exorcism coming up.

178
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,080
That's Cecilia, you listening.

179
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,820
We've got your ritual coming.

180
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:12,140
And we're looking for the hate caller, the wonderful, hateful old lady who called last week that we were never able to get on the air.

181
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,780
Yeah, let me say a few words about that, Rev.

182
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,420
Yeah, we had a...

183
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,440
Yeah.

184
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:17,960
Call her.

185
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,840
I think she was from Old Women for Criswell or something.

186
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:29,120
And she called in, and she was giving me a real taste of heck over the phone.

187
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,020
And I told her to read her Bible, and that really got her excited.

188
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,820
Yeah.

189
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,100
So we would like that woman to call us back, and we do like hate calls.

190
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,860
I know that sounds crazy, but we're not afraid of controversy.

191
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,260
Oh, we have to have it.

192
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,000
We have to have it, friends.

193
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:55,780
You know, dear friends, we can't keep on saving the world with Bob for nothing.

194
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:02,060
What do you think this church and this radio station runs on, friends?

195
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,460
Does it run on money?

196
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,360
Say no!

197
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,440
No!

198
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,100
No.

199
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,700
Does it run on air?

200
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,020
Say no, my friend!

201
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:10,520
No!

202
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,020
No!

203
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:11,480
No.

204
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,560
Does it run on honey?

205
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,160
Say no!

206
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:14,620
No!

207
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,100
No.

208
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,580
No.

209
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:16,660
No.

210
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:16,660


211
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:16,660


212
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:16,660


213
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:16,660


214
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:16,660


215
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,200
This church and this radio station both run on money.

216
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,440
Money.

217
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:28,440
And you must take it upon yourself, my friends, to entrust to Bob that which is Bob's.

218
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,040
Give the Bob his due, they say.

219
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,900
And look what your pledge gets you, friends.

220
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,160
Another few minutes of slack in this life, but even more important, it buys you time

221
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,780
in subgenius hell.

222
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,740
Now, there's many levels to the before or afterlife.

223
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:52,280
at the lowest rung you know you find the christian hell that's at the very bottom but only christians

224
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:59,540
go there then a step up from that you have the christian heaven that's usually reserved only

225
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:08,880
for christians also and that one is uh it's like a total absence of pain and pleasure but then

226
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,080
but then friends for the really good people you take a step up to the subgenius hell

227
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:24,240
and as it says in janer clothesians 151849 but by the time you get to the christian heaven

228
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:31,400
my friends you'll be wishing to god you'd made it to subgenius hell

229
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,240
because subgenius hell consists of total pleasure for subgenius's friends and

230
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,740
which

231
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:38,860
we've

232
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:38,860


233
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,320
Total torture and misery for the unsaved and the pink ones.

234
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,680
But up there at the very top, the very pinnacle of the afterlife, you get to the subgenius heaven.

235
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:58,560
And no, you won't be, quote, sitting on damp clouds harping and trumpeting all 24 hours of bloody day.

236
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,520
Nay, nay, for it's a squirting universe, my friend.

237
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:08,200
And in the subgenius heaven, you actually become the squirt.

238
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,980
For eternity, or the ooze, as the case may be for 50% of the population.

239
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,440
Praise Bob.

240
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,980
But only, friends, this only happens.

241
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:24,000
You can only gain admittance to Asgard or Valhalla, home of slain heroes for Bob,

242
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:30,400
by pledging that which is most important to you to K-N-O-N,

243
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,440
the only station that dares bring you more than one minute of slack.

244
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,680
A whole hour of slack, friends.

245
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,920
I know that ain't much.

246
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,520
It's more than most people ever even dream exists.

247
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:50,680
So we do want you to call that number, that sacred number, 828-9500.

248
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,080
You numerologists out there know what that really means.

249
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,200
And you kids, by the way, the children's subgeniuses, I know it's kind of late.

250
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,220
You should be asleep.

251
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,900
But get your decoder pins out because the special subgenius code will be coming out.

252
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,760
And you'll get that.

253
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,640
Nasty joke you can tell tomorrow at school.

254
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,780
That traveling salesman joke, friends.

255
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,960
And that traveling salesman, you know who it is.

256
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,360
It's Bob.

257
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,660
He's the traveling salesman of mythology.

258
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,160
Yes.

259
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,400
Oh, yes.

260
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:31,720
Oh, and we will be, by the way, playing that wonderful tape that the famous Mr. P.P. sent us.

261
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,940
So, Mr. P.P., please don't call in begging us to play your tape.

262
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,720
We will get it.

263
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,840
We will get around to it this week.

264
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,140
Oh, yes.

265
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,420
And we've got an exorcism to perform.

266
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,020
And, well, we might as well get to that now.

267
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,280
By the way, to pledge, once again, that number is 828-9500.

268
00:18:50,300 --> 00:19:00,680
And I must say that, friends, you subgenius believers out there have shown a poor, poor record for tithing this time around.

269
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,820
It's embarrassing to walk into this station and see the big thermometer.

270
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,360
With our thermometers down there at around $10,000.

271
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,840
We need to pick it up, friends.

272
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,580
Just one or two hundred dollar donations to this station.

273
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,800
Not to the church, nay.

274
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,980
Bob doesn't need your money.

275
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:27,980
All he wants is your soul and a little link from your spinal cord down along about the 14th vertebrae.

276
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,420
Oh, we love you, friends.

277
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,640
And we love the souls that we store in those canisters.

278
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,700
Isn't that great?

279
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,320
True, friends.

280
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,060
Praise Bob.

281
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,940
It's a lovely love.

282
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:51,920
Oh, and thanks to Reverend Chris Gross for that beautiful music that just ended and signals me to go to another something or other.

283
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,180
We ought to queue up.

284
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:53,960
Huh?

285
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
Another canister.

286
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,860
Yeah, let's get out another one of them canisters, boy.

287
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,620
Those souls, boy.

288
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,040
Inhaling souls.

289
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,300
There's nothing like it.

290
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,600
That's not my headphones doing that, is it?

291
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,200
Oh.

292
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,980
Yeah, we're going to be needing the soul sucker tonight.

293
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,860
There's a lot of filthy souls out there that need to be cleansed, I'm sure.

294
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,080
Cleansed of that filth that fills their wallets.

295
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,780
That pathetic, useless garbage the Federal Reserve puts out.

296
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,620
You can't do that much with it, but this station can.

297
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,420
It can save the earth with the church.

298
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,920
But, uh, well, uh...

299
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,820
We need to queue up that record.

300
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:43,960
We've got a famous musician and, as I said, the author of P-Dawg Comics.

301
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,680
Let's hang loose on that for a minute.

302
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,880
We need to give the numbers again.

303
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,080
We aren't getting much of a response at all.

304
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,340
The number is 828-9500.

305
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,160
We do...

306
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,720
Well, you're not kidding.

307
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,060
We do need your support for the, uh...

308
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,760
Our Slack radio ministry.

309
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,280
And we're not getting it.

310
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,380
And, uh...

311
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,800
That's 828-9500.

312
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,180
828-9500.

313
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,120
828-9500.

314
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,920
And the reason...

315
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,740
Oh, there's a little support.

316
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,840
Well, let's listen to these callers and see what they have to say

317
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,020
and come right back after we play this record.

318
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,320
We'll be right back.

319
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,980
We'll be right back.

320
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:40,320
We'll be right back.

321
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,120
We'll be right back.

322
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,540
We'll be right back.

323
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,760
The mule nose could taste makes a big difference.

324
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,200
Oh, friends, if you only knew what went into that.

325
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,020
Let's fire that puppy up.

326
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:02,300
If you only knew what went into that mule nose on mule nose records.

327
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,260
And this is by.

328
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,160
Check the mystery fluid.

329
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,360
The mystery.

330
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,540
Yeah, check the level of that mystery fluid before we empty that mule nose.

331
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,440
Let me say once again, the number is 828-9500.

332
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,940
That's 828.

333
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,380
828-9500 to make a real pledge to the hour slack radio ministry and then send it in.

334
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,180
We've got some bonuses we'll tell you about just in a minute.

335
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,200
After this.

336
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,380
Start that record over again.

337
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,040
Yeah, start that record over.

338
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,280
Lee Harvey was a friend of mine.

339
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,440
Homer Henderson and the Dow Worthington Garden Boys.

340
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,520
Oh, yes.

341
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:41,720
Lee Harvey was a friend of mine.

342
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,420
Oh, yeah.

343
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:52,400
I was born in Dallas in 1952.

344
00:24:54,020 --> 00:25:00,060
The Harvey moved across the street on Beckley Avenue.

345
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:08,340
He used to throw the ball to me when I was just a kid.

346
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,660
They say he shot the president.

347
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,020
Yeah.

348
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah.

349
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,000


350
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,000


351
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,000


352
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,000


353
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,000


354
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,000


355
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,000


356
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,000


357
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,000


358
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,000


359
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,000


360
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,000


361
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,260
I don't think he did.

362
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:22,440
And Lee Harvey was a friend of mine.

363
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:30,400
He used to take me fishing all the time.

364
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:40,200
He used to throw the ball to me when I was just a kid.

365
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,000
They say he shot the president.

366
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,500
Oh, yeah.

367
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:44,500


368
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:44,500


369
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:44,500


370
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:44,500


371
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:44,500


372
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,000
I don't think he did.

373
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,640
I don't think he was president.

374
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:51,640


375
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:51,640


376
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:58,360
I've seen that picture of him with pamphlets and a gun.

377
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,940
The shadows are pointing every which way.

378
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,100
But there's only just one son.

379
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:12,760
Someone played the photo and snuck away.

380
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,000
And here and there.

381
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,000


382
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,000


383
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,000


384
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,000


385
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,000


386
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,000


387
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,060
They say he shot the president

388
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,740
I don't think he did

389
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:27,680
And Lee Harvey was a friend of mine

390
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,620
He used to take me fishing all the time

391
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:42,180
He used to throw the ball to me

392
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,240
When I was just a kid

393
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,480
They say he shot the president

394
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,240
I don't think he did

395
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,220
I've seen it all on TV

396
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,400
Lee Harvey got gunned down

397
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,600
Murdered

398
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,180
Murdered by Jack Ruby

399
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,100
The biggest sleaze in town

400
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,900
He stuck that gun into his ribs

401
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,900
And said, here's looking at you, kid

402
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,060
Ruby killed Lee Harvey

403
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,960
TV proved he did

404
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,960
And Lee Harvey was a friend of mine

405
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,020
A very good friend

406
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,400
Yeah

407
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:40,640
He used to take me fishing all the time

408
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,160
That's right, he did

409
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,000
He used to throw the ball to me

410
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,040
When I was just a kid

411
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,340
They say he shot the president

412
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:03,520
I don't think he did

413
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,740
Oh, yes, dear friends

414
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,620
That was Lee Harvey was a friend of mine

415
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,920
By Homer Henderson and the Dow Worthington Garden Boys

416
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,820
Oh, yes, and we've got

417
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,640
We've got Homer Condom here

418
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,480
Right now

419
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,080
Oh, friends, and that

420
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,100
That song has so much meaning for so many of us

421
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,880
I think we ought to dedicate the next five minutes

422
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,620
To puzzling evidence, by the way

423
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,880
I mean, how many of you really

424
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,320
You know Lee Harvey

425
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,660
He was just set up

426
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,080
He was an okay guy

427
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,120
He was, as a matter of fact

428
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,400
Oh

429
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,660
This is a little-known fact that I should mention

430
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,260
I know a guy who was a very good

431
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,240
Another person who was a good friend of Lee Harvey Oswald's

432
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,320
His name is Kerry Thornley

433
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,820
Lives in Atlanta right now

434
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:58,280
He is actually the co-founder of the Discordian cult

435
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,820
And about 2% of our listeners are actually

436
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,340
Probably members of that cult

437
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:03,620
Yeah

438
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,300
Yes

439
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:04,300


440
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:04,300


441
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:04,300


442
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:04,300


443
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:04,300


444
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:04,300


445
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:04,300


446
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:13,760
Murray, who goes by other names in the Discordian world, was buddies with Lee Harvey and the Marines.

447
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,080
And his name is in the Warren Commission.

448
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:25,140
He got checked out, too, in the great, that beautiful, orchestrated cover-up that they did.

449
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,820
You ought to talk to some Dallas police about what they think about it.

450
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,100
Well, I know someone else they could talk to, and that's Bobby Sox.

451
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:40,060
His father fired Lee Harvey Oswald from the Childs Stovall map-making company.

452
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,720
That's a shame.

453
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,840
You know, if they hadn't have fired him, he wouldn't have become a dude.

454
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:46,980
That's right.

455
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,780
He wouldn't have had to go to Russia and all that other stuff.

456
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,060
He thought he was a spy.

457
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,140
Well, there's some evidence that we turned up here at Mule Nose Records to further indict this conspiracy.

458
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,240
What was that?

459
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,200
Don't worry about it. It was a conspiracy.

460
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,280
But anyway...

461
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,580
They like to do that to let us know they're listening.

462
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,740
Here's this burned letter, this memorandum we found.

463
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,340
Listen to this.

464
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,860
They say his nagging Russian wife made him fall for Marilyn Monroe.

465
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,120
When Marilyn came to Dallas to O.H. Lee's should go.

466
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,300
JFK stole her away.

467
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,820
Lee Harvey flipped his lid.

468
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,540
They'll say he shot the president.

469
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,560
We'll agree he did.

470
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,540
This is an inter-office memorandum framing Lee Harvey Oswald.

471
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,200
And I think Spector is responsible.

472
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,280
If not...

473
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,060
If not smirsh.

474
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,440
No, not smirsh.

475
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,560
At the bottom, it says P.S.

476
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,920
You are no longer a smirsh operative.

477
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,380
Well, my mom and dad were once kicked out of Jack Ruby's club.

478
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,420
Wow.

479
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,620
Yeah, how about that?

480
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,120
That's an honor.

481
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:50,660
Yeah.

482
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:56,640
And I personally know Larry Buchanan who made the film The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald.

483
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,100
Bucky Buchanan.

484
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,000
Oh, yeah.

485
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,280
Yeah, in fact, a couple of Texas Monthly issues ago, you could read my article about...

486
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:12,820
That great filmmaker in Dallas, Larry Buchanan, who tried to defend Lee Harvey and other great patriots like...

487
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,480
Other great Dallas patriots like John Hinckley and...

488
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,820
Which magazine was that?

489
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,540
Oh, that TM magazine.

490
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,080
Oh, TM.

491
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,040
So it says TM by Ivan Stang.

492
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:24,700
That's...

493
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,480
No, no.

494
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,020
It uses my fake name.

495
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,400
Oh.

496
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,360
But we're going to...

497
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,920
Friends, the number to call...

498
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,160
Listen, this is serious.

499
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,120
We can't keep...

500
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,280
If you little pledge partners out there would call...

501
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,080
And cough up those bucks, we wouldn't be listening to this through crummy headphones.

502
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,000
That's right.

503
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,640
We'd be...

504
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,660
Friends, we'd be doing this show from a spaceship.

505
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,640
And Lee Harvey is a K-N-O-N exclusive.

506
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,020
No other radio station will play it.

507
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,420
The number to call is 828-9500.

508
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,340
Give him that number again, Doug.

509
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,360
That number...

510
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,580
Who's Doug?

511
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,120
That number is 828-9500.

512
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,860
Sorry, that's your fake Christian name.

513
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,380
Now, we've got a comment...

514
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:03,680
A comment...

515
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,260
A comment...

516
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:04,760
From the...

517
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,500
From the...

518
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:11,100
Our listening audience to this next bit of news here.

519
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,220
So we're going to put this...

520
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,800
Patch this dude in here.

521
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,660
Okay, let's see if we can do that.

522
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:15,940
Let's see that.

523
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,400
Hello.

524
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,540
Hello, friends.

525
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,640
Okay, what do you have to tell us on the AeroSlack radio ministry tonight?

526
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,180
I have something to tell you about our not-so-good friend, Mr. Criswell.

527
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,300
Oh, the evil Criswell.

528
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,460
Oh, heck.

529
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:33,880
Yes.

530
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,500
Yes, Mr. Criswell.

531
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,840
Mr. Criswell is the anti-Bob.

532
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,700
I have definite proof of this.

533
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,440
That's a stiff accusation.

534
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,500
Yeah, because there's been so many anti-Bobs brought up.

535
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,980
He wishes he was the anti-Bob.

536
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,140
He is the anti-Bob.

537
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,880
He ain't man enough to be the anti-Bob.

538
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,540
No, we're not talking...

539
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,000
We're not talking Neeky here.

540
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,620
This is not Neeky.

541
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,400
This is worse than Neeky.

542
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,780
He's not Neeky.

543
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,040
He's not Neeky.

544
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,920
Even the amazing Criswell wasn't the anti-Bob, and if he couldn't do it, no one can.

545
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,640
Now, come on.

546
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,940
This even beats the Oklahoma 900-foot Jesus.

547
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,420
Oh, my friends.

548
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,900
This is serious.

549
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,880
This is serious stuff he's talking here.

550
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,440
This is top-flight dogma here.

551
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,460
The closure here is no better yet.

552
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,540
Leave the room.

553
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,340
Criswell brainwashes, but the problem is his brainwashing is not complete.

554
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,300
It leaves his subjects in a dazed state.

555
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,020
I don't want my brainwashed.

556
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,280
It's incomplete.

557
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,240
They still have this longing for something else.

558
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,120
You know what they're longing for?

559
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:34,480
Friends?

560
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,040
They're longing for Bob.

561
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,300
Praise Bob.

562
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:37,780
Bob.

563
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,380
They want Bob.

564
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,660
That is why Bob is greater than Criswell.

565
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,840
Bob completely brainwashes his subjects.

566
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,460
They no longer have wants or needs.

567
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,200
Their brains are so clean and so pure and slack.

568
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,640
They just...

569
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,180
They howl and...

570
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,020
A new slate.

571
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,580
Okay.

572
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,300
A new life.

573
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,980
Okay, well, thanks for sharing that with us.

574
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,160
Praise Bob.

575
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,040
Praise Bob.

576
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,760
Oh, that feels good.

577
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,240
Fuck it.

578
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:03,980
Oh.

579
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,000
Oh, that was a nice...

580
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,300
That was a great call.

581
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,600
That was an excellent call.

582
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,480
Well, friends, while we're on the...

583
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,500
While we're on the...

584
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:11,980
No, he didn't.

585
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,120
Signing off.

586
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,400
I heard him say the F word.

587
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,040
No, he didn't.

588
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,520
He said...

589
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,160
He said...

590
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,120
Fuck it.

591
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,220
As in suck my soul.

592
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:18,820
That's not...

593
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,540
That's not a customer.

594
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:19,840
Oh.

595
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,320
He said it that way.

596
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:20,960
Oh, sorry.

597
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,260
See, this is the soul sucker here, friends.

598
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,020
My mistake.

599
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,100
Now, go ahead now.

600
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,700
The Dr. Chaos now has a pledge drive announcement.

601
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,880
The number to call is 828-9500.

602
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:40,060
This, by the way, this is not one of those annoying type pledge drive announcements.

603
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,860
This is a real from the gland pledge drive announcement.

604
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,100
We're not playing games with you.

605
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:51,080
We really do need the financial attention at the station to continue to fight the fight.

606
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,300
And, by the way, now we have a pleasure.

607
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,240
Our best pledger tonight, Martha Thompson, wants to know when the next D-Vival is going to be.

608
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,700
And we're going to announce that for you, Martha, in just a little bit.

609
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,320
There is a D-Vival coming up where you can meet a real subgenius.

610
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,180
Or something.

611
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,100
Although, you seem like you're a real subgenius.

612
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:18,240
By the way, Martha, I don't think it's too much to say that she did pledge $30 to fight the fight.

613
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,360
And she gets a bonus.

614
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,640
She gets a bonus.

615
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,440
She gets a boner.

616
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,220
A bonus.

617
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:25,680
No.

618
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,060
Oh, that's two of them.

619
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,840
Well, actually, she gets two bonuses.

620
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,140
Oh.

621
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,760
She not only gets a pamphlet, a subgenius pamphlet, which all pledgers,

622
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,200
get, but for me, she gets two buttons.

623
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,940
A J.R. Bob Dobbs button and a Barbara button.

624
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,800
That's Bob whenever he's a woman.

625
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,920
And L. Ron Hubbard says people can push your stress buttons.

626
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:54,680
And we don't have any callers at 828-9500.

627
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,180
That's 828-9500.

628
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,640
I hope you can remember that number.

629
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,500
And we need real pledges.

630
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,540
Oh, there's a few.

631
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,180
And I thank you both for that.

632
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
There's a few more.

633
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,360
I really thank you.

634
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,360
Norton, come on down, pal.

635
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,480
I've got something to show you.

636
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,560
With chaos now.

637
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:16,800
Doc?

638
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,680
Doc?

639
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,620
Yes.

640
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,000
Well, hello and good evening, my friends.

641
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,940
I am the Reverend Dr. Sardonicus Chaos.

642
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,160
And I have an important message for each and every one of you out there.

643
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,860
You know, there is an old saying that the best thing,

644
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,860
the best things in life are free.

645
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,300
Well, my friends, that is an untrue statement.

646
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,240
A conspiracy lie.

647
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,900
A demonic pink lie.

648
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,740
Slack is one of the best things in life.

649
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,380
And around here, slack does not come cheaply.

650
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,280
There is no free ride, my friends.

651
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,700
Picture yourself driving through the desert

652
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:59,380
when all of a sudden your car's radiator overheats.

653
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,220
You pull over to the side of the road and open up the hood

654
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,740
and the radiator starts sparting like a geyser.

655
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,940
Sparting and oozing.

656
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,660
Spewing steam everywhere.

657
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,420
You're stuck out in the desert in the middle of nowhere

658
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,060
and it's five miles to the nearest Stucky's.

659
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,600
You figure, well, I'll have to hitch a ride to the nearest service station

660
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,340
and get my car towed in and fixed.

661
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,580
But every car that passes you is being driven by Criswell

662
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,100
or one of his followers.

663
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,340
The evil Criswell.

664
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,200
Do you think they're going to...

665
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,920
Are they going to stop and give you a ride?

666
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,260
Well, you'd better think again, friend.

667
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,820
You're probably not pink enough for them.

668
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,540
Anyway, if the Hour of Slack radio ministry

669
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,340
is your vehicle to get you to the land of slack,

670
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,280
then you, my friend, must buy the next tank of gas.

671
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,500
Why?

672
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,920
And you want to know why?

673
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,200
Why must you buy that next tank of gas?

674
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,360
I want to know why.

675
00:37:59,560 --> 00:37:59,900
Why?

676
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,280
Because we are under so much pressure

677
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,200
from those followers

678
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:03,880
and those churches.

679
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,820
But you can help us change that.

680
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,460
Send in those pledges.

681
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,900
Send it in.

682
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,440
I'm sorry I asked.

683
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,100
All of them in.

684
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,660
Now...

685
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,860
Friends, with that pledge to this show, you get...

686
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,900
You get the subgenius pamphlet number two,

687
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,200
the amazing new pamphlet,

688
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,540
and those fantastic Bob Dobbs buttons.

689
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,640
That's right.

690
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,640
If you will specify that you pledge to the Hour...

691
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,320
For the Hour of Slack show,

692
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,300
you get that pamphlet and those buttons.

693
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,240
Ah, yes.

694
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,060
And it's magic.

695
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,540
Friends, Bob will lock into your soul,

696
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,460
and you'll never escape.

697
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,560
And you'll be so glad to have given up your free will

698
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,540
to that great master

699
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,600
who has no mind of his own,

700
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,760
but merely acts by chance,

701
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,540
for he is the Bob.

702
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,360
Ah, yes.

703
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,740
Now, we know that some of you out there are Slack vampires.

704
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,940
You listen to the Hour of Slack every week

705
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,120
and figure this is great.

706
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,340
No commercials, no salesmen,

707
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,200
no unwatchable,

708
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,800
no wanted blah blah being forced on me by the conspiracy.

709
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,060
True Slack.

710
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,280
But, you see, without your pledge,

711
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,560
we won't be able to continue.

712
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,800
Pretty soon, you're going to be listening to the same old, same old

713
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,700
that everybody else's tone-deaf grandma is listening to.

714
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,760
Is that what you really want?

715
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,460
I didn't think so.

716
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,160
Well, you know what to do.

717
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,720
Send in those pledges.

718
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,500
Now, unlike other ministries,

719
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,380
we do not use guilt as a weapon.

720
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,580
We let you use your own guilt against yourself.

721
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,140
All right.

722
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,860
And when you start feeling guilty enough,

723
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,900
you will know what to do.

724
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,440
Dig down deep.

725
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,780
Way down deep.

726
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,420
No, further than that even.

727
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,140
And give until it hurts.

728
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,100
Send in those pledges.

729
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,320
At 828-9500.

730
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,540
We've got lines open now.

731
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,060
828-9500.

732
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,120
Send it in.

733
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,220
Call it in right now at 828-9500.

734
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,060
Send in those pledges, friends.

735
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:58,920
Thank you.

736
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,940
Praise Bob.

737
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,340
Fight the fight against the Criswell demons

738
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,340
by calling 828-9500.

739
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,300
Yeah, we've got something on line one.

740
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,020
Oh, friends.

741
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:26,220
And you know, I think it's time to do that exorcism that we had promised.

742
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,160
This is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

743
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,040
Hold on.

744
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,140
As you well know, 90.9 FM.

745
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,820
Oh, yes.

746
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,840
Okay, hold on.

747
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,620
Hold on.

748
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,140
Hold on.

749
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,160
Hold on.

750
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,820
Are we trying to get a call?

751
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,760
Yeah, we've got a call.

752
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,480
Oh, here we go.

753
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,680
In Dallas, Texas.

754
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,500
This is the subtenor of radio ministry.

755
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:01,000
Power of Slack on KNON 90.9 in the left excess.

756
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,120
Oh, hold on.

757
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,760
I think I've messed up one more time.

758
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,500
Okay, hold on again.

759
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,020
Oh, we're friends.

760
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:06,820
We're striving.

761
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,140
Did I do it?

762
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,240
Is he on?

763
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,040
No.

764
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:12,800
Hello?

765
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,280
Hello?

766
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,420
Sweet hour of Slack.

767
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,180
Sweet hour of Slack.

768
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,080
Caller.

769
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,460
Caller.

770
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:29,740
Hello?

771
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,880
I'm holding it.

772
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,080
Is the caller there?

773
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,600
I think I killed our caller somehow.

774
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:49,640
I think we need to follow up here with a song by Reverend Seth Deitch and Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger

775
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,840
of the Church of Mr. Science of the Subgenius.

776
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,620
But first, we need to announce that our phone lines have dried up again.

777
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,220
It's 828-9500.

778
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,360
We're only 7% towards our goal.

779
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,380
7%, friends.

780
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,160
Can you stand it?

781
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,120
We're only 7%.

782
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,120


783
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,120


784
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,120


785
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,120


786
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:07,520
7% of our goal of assuring K&N and Wynn's existence versus the onslaught of the Criswell

787
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,580
barbarians.

788
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,920
Now, this is no joke, friends.

789
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,900
We are not kidding.

790
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:19,540
We are actually under constant attack and threat by the Cris demons.

791
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,600
And I can't get a skin mask.

792
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,080
Hello?

793
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:23,440
K&N and Wynn?

794
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:23,800


795
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:24,840
Yeah.

796
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,440
You're on the hour of Slack.

797
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,020
Are you a brother in Slack?

798
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,500
A minister of Slack?

799
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,460
I need help.

800
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,240
I need help.

801
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,280
My car is trying to achieve Slack.

802
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,060
And I want to make sure it gets a blessing from Bob so it'll achieve true Slack and go

803
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,900
to Subgenius.

804
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,800
You need a healer of appliances, friend.

805
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,840
That's a very specialty trade within the church.

806
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:52,040
A healer of appliances should be seen through the church.

807
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:58,260
And we can't tell you exactly how to get that ministry over the free airwaves of K&N.

808
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:58,780
Oh, please.

809
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,420
Oh, please.

810
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,120
This is a free station, son.

811
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,900
I'm willing to support the hour of Slack.

812
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,280
I'm willing to support it.

813
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,500
I'm willing to make a pledge.

814
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,300
Thank you.

815
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:06,800
Thank you.

816
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:12,880
And just call 828-9500 and make that pledge and keep it going because remember, the Cris

817
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,960
monster is out there and he's going to get us.

818
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,360
And your car is healed.

819
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,880
Go home, jump in it, ride off.

820
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,340
Well, I wouldn't say his car is healed just yet, but also, we were going to tell Martha

821
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,500
about the DeViva, weren't we, Stan?

822
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:25,980
Oh, yeah.

823
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,740
Why don't you quickly tell Martha about that?

824
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:28,600
Okay.

825
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,760
Well, you know, I don't know where it is.

826
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,040
It's actually at the next big science fiction convention, the Fantasy Fair that you will

827
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,400
read about in the papers on July 5th, about 1130, wherever that is.

828
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,160
We'll be telling you.

829
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,420
And Martha will already have her buttons, won't she?

830
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,340
Yes, she will.

831
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,640
Martha certainly will.

832
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:47,860
I hope so.

833
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,040
Martha will be well prepared.

834
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:49,920
She won't die.

835
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,840
She won't have to be sacrificed.

836
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:57,480
You know, what it's going to take to bring Bob back from the dead is probably the sacrifice

837
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,840
of thousands of lives of pink boys.

838
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,840
So to speak.

839
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,540
But, friends...

840
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:04,760
Hello.

841
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,560
Hello, my friend.

842
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,000
How are you?

843
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:09,080
If you hadn't called, we would have played your tape.

844
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,060
If I wouldn't have what?

845
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,140
If you hadn't called, we would have played your tape.

846
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,120
I'm going to make a pledge.

847
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,340
Well, then call the other line.

848
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,100
That's 828-9500.

849
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:18,640
Okay.

850
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,220
That's 828-9500.

851
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,780
Please call and make a pledge at 828-9500.

852
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:31,480
Let me tell you the story of J.R.

853
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,220
Bob Dolls.

854
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:38,280
Friend of man and yeti, he walked with the gods.

855
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,980
He wore a silly grin and he smoked a stupid pipe.

856
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:49,700
He fought the conspiracy every day of his life.

857
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,560
He whipped the stench of many a man.

858
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,360
He bothered many children.

859
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,460
With his money...

860
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,160
He blessed.

861
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,560
Counted the religion in which we all believe.

862
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,240
Brought us all the slack that everybody needs.

863
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:18,920
Was the greatest salesman the world had ever seen.

864
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,460
He could sell the parts after he ate all the beans.

865
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,900
He could sell a pile of shit to a common fly.

866
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:31,460
All...

867
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,920
All of us who knew him.

868
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,360
He would never die.

869
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,440
Bob Dolls.

870
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,480
Bob Dolls.

871
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,520
He was a real man and brave.

872
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,000
Bob Dolls.

873
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:51,480
Bob Dolls.

874
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,680
He's lying dead in his grave.

875
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,460
Without Bob, what are we?

876
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:01,460


877
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:01,460


878
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:01,460


879
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,980
What are we gonna do?

880
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:08,540
When the men from Planet X go marching through?

881
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:15,260
Our whole race is stuck in jail with only Bob to raise the bail.

882
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,400
But now he's dead, so we'll do what we do.

883
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:29,140
He founded the city known as Dobbs Town.

884
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,400
He's in Malaysia.

885
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,540
It was rarely found.

886
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,320
There is study for hidden science.

887
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,820
Until that fatal day.

888
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,460
When he came up to his block in the city by the bay.

889
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,880
If you had ever seen him.

890
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,200
If you had ever dared.

891
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,040
Most had no occasion.

892
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,940
Others just made scared.

893
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,120
So others said,

894
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


895
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


896
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


897
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


898
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


899
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:03,440
Bob came to San Francisco for the even of the eighth.

900
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:09,040
When the Holy Smiling One would step out on the stage.

901
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,320
Bob looked to the left.

902
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,100
Then he looked to the right.

903
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:21,380
Then he strode out with confidence into the bright spotlight.

904
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:27,280
He waved at all the cheering fans as he stepped up to the mic.

905
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,120
When a praise was heard.

906
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,720
Cassie Bullitt sent him to eternal night.

907
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,820
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs.

908
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,800
Proud to their savior had come.

909
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:51,220
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs.

910
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,860
Retreated by the flash of a gun.

911
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,920
Without Bob we have flown.

912
00:47:58,980 --> 00:47:59,120
Without Bob we have flown.

913
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,100
He would be the beard.

914
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,660
As we swiftly approached that fatal year.

915
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:12,240
For in 1998 he would have set the record straight.

916
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,740
But now he's dead.

917
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,320
So we're doomed over here.

918
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,960
Oh friends.

919
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,620
Please save Kane Owen from the false churches.

920
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,120
Please save Kane Owen from the false churches.

921
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:38,520
Call us at 828-9500. This isn't a joke or a rehearsal. This is real. This is K&ON

922
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:45,640
asking you for your help in a real crisis. Please stop the false churches

923
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:52,460
and call K&ON at 828-9500. Now dear friends, we got a letter in the mail.

924
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:57,240
Actually, we've gotten several things in the mail. I'd like to... There's apparently a

925
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:02,640
computer network, a subgenius computer network centered in Dallas and we got a

926
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,320
letter about it and then I lost the letter here at the station when I was

927
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,960
about to read it at some point. It dematerialized. So I think that was Frank

928
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,340
Kennedy. Please send that information in again if I don't find it again. But

929
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:22,600
friends, we have here a letter from... an informal request it says from Cecilia

930
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,960
and she says, Bob rules. Dear Bob,

931
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,220
Bob rules. Dear Bob,

932
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:36,060
I need some help. Two weeks ago, my fella whose name we can't mention who works at

933
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:40,940
Bluebonnet and I were listening to the show when he who must not be named and I

934
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:48,400
think you know who I mean jumped out of the radio and bit my guy. He bit my guy

935
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,900
and he's been an utter beep hole ever since. Could you possibly heal him on one

936
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,140
of the shows in absentia? He listens faithfully.

937
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:00,820
It's really a problem and I would certainly appreciate your hitting him

938
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:05,800
with the soul sucker or whatever is appropriate. He refuses to give me a hard

939
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,540
time because of this. I'm miserable. Thanks so much.

940
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:17,440
Praise Bob, Cecilia. Now Cecilia, I'm afraid what it's gonna take here is a

941
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:27,120
full-fledged exorcism... subgenius exorcism rant. All right. All right.

942
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,400
All right. All right. Get ready now, my friend. You're out there. I know you're listening.

943
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:36,560
I know you're listening to what's going on. It was Bob who banished you to the pit. It

944
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:44,160
was he who flung you from the depths of heaven to the pit of hell. It was he who cast you

945
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:50,620
out, unclean spirit. He has dominion over you. I order you in the name of Bob to come

946
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:53,100
out of this poor servant of Bob.

947
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:53,560
Thanks.

948
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:57,060
I command you to put your hands on the radio.

949
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:57,100
Good. Good. All right. So we take you out. It's nice to see you. Yes, it's nice to see

950
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,580
The power of Bob compels you.

951
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,900
The power of Bob compels you.

952
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,680
The power of Bob compels you.

953
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,360
The power of Bob compels you.

954
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,520
And I demand you to come out.

955
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,820
Come out!

956
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,660
Come out of that innocent person.

957
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:19,320
Come out of that innocent person, unclean spirit.

958
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,960
Oh, yes, friends.

959
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,380
Oh, yes, I feel the power.

960
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,640
I'm in the spirit, dear friends.

961
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,440
I'm getting a sign.

962
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,280
I can see someone in my mind's eye.

963
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,900
No, wait.

964
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,020
It's someone out there he's afraid to call.

965
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:37,760
It's a young man.

966
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,160
His name is...

967
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,780
I can't quite get it.

968
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:41,700
Frank, I think.

969
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,380
I'm getting Frank.

970
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,860
But he's deeply troubled, friends.

971
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,380
He's burdened.

972
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,860
He's bound by demons.

973
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,720
He's bound by binding spirits of...

974
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,360
Sea demons?

975
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,980
It's conspiracy false street drugs, friends.

976
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,620
He's bound by...

977
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,120
He's bound by drugs.

978
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,920
He's got terrible financial problems

979
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,340
because he can't afford the drugs.

980
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,040
He wants to be free, but the demons won't let him be.

981
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,580
He needs slack.

982
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,760
He needs slack to set him free.

983
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,140
Oh, yeah!

984
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,100
Bob, are you listening?

985
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,700
I want you to come down.

986
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,200
I want to cast out all the cancers, tuberculosis, tumors, arthritis,

987
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,620
and bad checks from this man.

988
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,080
I want you to cast him out from the crown of his head

989
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,460
to the sole glands of his feet.

990
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,660
Cast out that demon.

991
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,420
Beat off the devil.

992
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,480
And set him free.

993
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,060
I command this now in the name of Bob Dobbs,

994
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,780
High Epopt of the Church of the Subgenius.

995
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,240
Help me, somebody.

996
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,060
Praise Bob!

997
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,720
She ain't got no legs.

998
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,980
My legs are on fire.

999
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,020
Pull the lever.

1000
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,320
Down you go.

1001
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,120
Niggy be gone.

1002
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,960
Niggy be gone.

1003
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,260
Niggy be gone.

1004
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,740
Niggy be gone.

1005
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,600
Niggy be gone.

1006
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,700
Face you, Niggy.

1007
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,540
Well, that opens up a line at...

1008
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:54,760
9,500.

1009
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,560
Niggy is gone, and now we need you to pledge your funds

1010
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,800
to keep K-N-O-N doing this kind of real healing.

1011
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,240
Where else can you hear?

1012
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:09,400
But K-N-O-N, 90.9, the voice of the Yetis.

1013
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:13,080
Where else can you hear a healing like that?

1014
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,100
Nowhere else.

1015
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:14,820
It's the truth.

1016
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,940
It's nowhere else.

1017
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:22,740
And, you know, where else can you listen to a crazed maniacal caller like this?

1018
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,600
He's on the air with us now.

1019
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:26,460
Hello, caller?

1020
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:27,420
Yes.

1021
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,900
Well, what do you got?

1022
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:29,760
I'm pink.

1023
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,540
You're pink, too.

1024
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,640
But your money is green, Frank.

1025
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,440
But your money is green.

1026
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,160
Now, have you pledged to...

1027
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,120
Have you pledged to...

1028
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,680
Or, it's like, be honest, truthful.

1029
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,100
I've pledged to audio abuse.

1030
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,340
You pledged to audio abuse, okay.

1031
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:47,520
Well, that's cool, and, you know, really, you know, if you help audio abuse, well, by

1032
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,740
gosh, you're fighting the fight.

1033
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,880
How much did you pledge?

1034
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:50,460
Twenty.

1035
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,420
Did you send it in?

1036
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,020
Yes.

1037
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,380
Not yet.

1038
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,300
I got it right over here.

1039
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,580
But it's in the bag, right?

1040
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:55,920
Right.

1041
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:56,720
Well, great.

1042
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,100
Well, thanks.

1043
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,180
What would you like from us?

1044
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,580
I need to be saved.

1045
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,200
You need to be saved.

1046
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:06,120
Well, you know, actually, you know, we're the church, we're sort of a self-help church,

1047
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:11,340
and we try to help you to save yourself, but, you know, there's only so much slack in the

1048
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:15,240
world, and you may not get that much of it in your time, but yet you have to keep the

1049
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,360
struggle up and fight the fight to get that slack.

1050
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,980
Or send money to the station or...

1051
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,280
Call that number, 828-9500.

1052
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,660
Now, if you...

1053
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:27,660
It's...

1054
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,740
I guess what we're trying to tell you, friend, is how much do you listen to our Slack radio

1055
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:34,080
ministry?

1056
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:35,420
Do what?

1057
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,000
How much do you listen to us here?

1058
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:37,920
Oh, every week.

1059
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:38,660
Every week.

1060
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,020
So, do you know about what we're talking about, about Slack?

1061
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,000
Yes, Slack.

1062
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:44,740
Right, Slack.

1063
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,680
Well, what's Slack mean to you, then?

1064
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,360
Utopia.

1065
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,920
Remember, we're trying to get you to use your own brain, so what's Slack mean to you?

1066
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:51,700
Utopia.

1067
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:52,900
Utopia.

1068
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:53,480
That's all?

1069
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:55,720
Yeah, really.

1070
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,220
That's a good answer, Ron.

1071
00:54:59,220 --> 00:54:59,580
Is it?

1072
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,020
Yeah.

1073
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,000
What is Utopia, though?

1074
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,440
Yeah, but what would Utopia be?

1075
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,000
I mean, would it be a place where you wouldn't have to what?

1076
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,240
Or you would have to what?

1077
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:07,580
Or what?

1078
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,220
Never wind.

1079
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,320
I mean, what's your idea of heaven?

1080
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,920
I mean, do you want to go to a heaven where nothing ever happens?

1081
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:15,700
No way.

1082
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,560
Where you're just having to listen and mind your manners the way you did on Earth?

1083
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,180
No.

1084
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,540
Is that what you're looking for?

1085
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:21,840
Why is that so exciting?

1086
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:21,960
I mean, is that what you're looking for?

1087
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:21,960


1088
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,840
Well, Christian heaven is a joke.

1089
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,620
It's boring.

1090
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:25,460
Yeah?

1091
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,540
But, I mean, I want something besides that when I die.

1092
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:29,400
Right.

1093
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,100
You don't want to keep your pants on no longer.

1094
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,040
That's for damn sure.

1095
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:32,420
Okay.

1096
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:32,760
Go to hell.

1097
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:35,520
So, you say you want subgenius hell?

1098
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,220
Yes.

1099
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,100
Okay.

1100
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:42,120
Now, did you know that, by the way, talking about Christian theologies, did you know that

1101
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,140
heaven is hotter than hell?

1102
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:43,920
Really?

1103
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:49,420
Right, because there's, if you look in your Bible, there's seven suns that eat heaven,

1104
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:49,740
okay?

1105
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:56,900
And now, if you took an earth, okay, put seven suns, that would be hotter than the molten

1106
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,480
gaseous threshold of brimstone.

1107
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,240
Oh, that's all the time we have.

1108
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:00,860
I'm sorry.

1109
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,300
But anyway, here's a soul sucker, okay?

1110
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,540
Oh, yeah.

1111
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,500
That's it.

1112
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,380
Well, that opened up a line at our private line here at 823-749-0.

1113
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,360
You can call us and enjoy the experience of being on our Slack with a real subgenius minister.

1114
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,020
That's 823-749-0.

1115
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:24,780
But the main number to call is 828-9500.

1116
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:32,100
That's 828-9500 to help us fight the fight, to bring the power of Bob into the lives of

1117
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:32,800
all of us.

1118
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:40,200
Remember, KNON, Voice of the Yetis, 90.9 in Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington.

1119
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:40,980
Yeah.

1120
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,120
Coppell.

1121
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:43,640
The Metroplex.

1122
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,380
The Metro-Mess.

1123
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,840
And we've only got one light shining.

1124
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,300
A traveling Bob.

1125
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,000
Just one little light to keep KNON open.

1126
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,640
Only one light, friends.

1127
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,020
A traveling Bob went up to a farmhouse, knocked on the door.

1128
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,960
The farmer opened the door and said, yes.

1129
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,420
The traveling salesman said, my car's broken down.

1130
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:06,020
May I stay the night at your place?

1131
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:10,140
The farmer said, yes, but you'll have to sleep with my son.

1132
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:14,040
The traveling salesman said, oops, sorry, wrong joke.

1133
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:15,840
Ha.

1134
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,020
And that, friends, was from Victims of AIDS.

1135
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,120
And now, Dr. Chaos.

1136
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:22,360
Dr. Chaos?

1137
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:24,660
Yes.

1138
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:30,700
I'd like to speak about the, I'd like to speak to you about the religious hypocrites,

1139
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:36,540
the false churches, the people that are, shall we say, giving us a rough time.

1140
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,100
828-9500.

1141
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,400
828-9500.

1142
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,820
Operating and degenerating within the conspiracy, religious hypocrites are sub-hypocrites.

1143
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:45,820


1144
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:46,160
They're human.

1145
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:56,160
Their hideous purpose in life is to hatefully, hatefully attack and destroy all that is truly slackful and good.

1146
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:04,240
Quoting mechanically from their religious books, they proudly ask others if they are as saved as their sick minds say they are.

1147
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,860
Self-tormented.

1148
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:11,100
The false churches slyly torment and confuse those that they pretend to help.

1149
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,680
You can't shame them, for they have no shame.

1150
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,560
Only monstrous arrogance.

1151
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,760
And that is why we need your help.

1152
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,940
Awaiting navigational input interface for base computer.

1153
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:25,360
Check.

1154
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,880
Prepare for interlocking.

1155
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:27,720
Oh, yes, friends.

1156
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,260
We've been waiting for a sign.

1157
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:34,180
For a sign from you, from out in the audience, to 828-9500.

1158
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,560
Please call the Hour of Slack radio ministry.

1159
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:37,880
Don't let us die.

1160
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:38,760
No!

1161
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,440
Don't let us be destroyed by the false churches.

1162
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,660
It, it, it's...

1163
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,020
It's pulverized by the masses and...

1164
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:51,100
And ruined by the, by the humans, by the human beings that are ruining us.

1165
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,180
And, and taking away all your slack.

1166
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,900
Hey, it's not mine that I'm worried about.

1167
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,860
I've been slacking off for years, but I'm worried about your slack.

1168
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,020
And you're the one.

1169
00:58:59,140 --> 00:58:59,880
Don't you see?

1170
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,820
You're ruining your own life by not pledging to King of the Wind.

1171
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:05,320
It ain't the money, friends, it's the power.

1172
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,020
It's the power to, to keep this station on the air.

1173
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,940
Just to talk to you freely about what we really believe.

1174
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:14,560
I'm the, I don't, there's no, not enough money in the world to make me sustain.

1175
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:19,440
I'm the only one standing here and saying, oh my, my God, my God, what has Dallas come

1176
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:19,660
to?

1177
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:25,340
When only, no, no lights at all on the board and only me, only me out here screaming and

1178
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:28,440
telling you, please, please, please get it away.

1179
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,380
Because I can't do it all myself.

1180
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,760
I don't have the money.

1181
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,300
I don't have the funds.

1182
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:37,220
I don't have the slack to keep this station on the air by myself.

1183
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,100
My, my, my, my, the leads in my forehead's stood out.

1184
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,880
And I can't make it work.

1185
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,040
I can't make it work.

1186
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:47,660
Only you, only you can give this station the ability to survive.

1187
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:48,900
And there it sits.

1188
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,360
There it sits.

1189
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:51,520
Dead.

1190
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,220
Dead.

1191
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:56,560
There's no, there's no, ain't no more slack in the world.

1192
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,700
We thank all our, our pledgers that called us.

1193
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:04,280
All our pledgers that called us would, but it's all over now.

1194
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,900
I don't think we're going to make it.

1195
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:12,780
We only made seven and a half percent, seven and a half percent of our goal for the play

1196
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:12,860
show.

1197
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:16,900
And I can tell you who made some of the most of the quo for the generation, and this was

1198
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,100
theivers.

1199
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,140
And I don't think anybody, nobody could ever make, make city life sound like this again.

1200
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:30,000
It was anything but the heavens.

1201
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:36,100
Others stopped the ship and the sea, the Venus, the lleva, and the tartaram of the river.

1202
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:36,940
I'm in Tibet.

And, friends, you have to remember that this is a church.

This church does everything that any other church does.

We put out books.

01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,760
We put out pamphlets.

We put out incredible audio tape lessons that you can hear.
