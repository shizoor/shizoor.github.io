1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,820
So it begins.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,480
It's coming. It's coming.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:12,740
In your most terrible nightmares, you don't see the terror and shock that you'll see in the greatest collection of

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,300
women, totally nude, on screen, engaged in every conceivable activity.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,880
A double dose of hell.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,440
You will feel it around you.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,020
One moment of bliss, a lifetime of regret.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,020
Wake up, America.

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,180
Who can save the universe?

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,800
Against the space dolls with steel teeth.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:36,240
Never in the field of human conflict has there been a more explosive, concentrated sin.

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,260
Projected on a totally white screen.

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,140
Reckoning you inside to a new dimension of experience.

14
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,840
Contains explicit scenes depicting erotic practices which may be offensive to some adults.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,740
Bring your boy themes.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:55,900
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,060
the soul.

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,060
Genius Hour of Slack.

19
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,300
Here is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

20
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,040
The sexiest man on Earth.

21
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,120
A young Adonis.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,300
He forced them to fulfill his every desire.

23
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,280
But the man who will do anything finally does it all.

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,300
I wanted to kill the big boys in that drip joint.

25
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,500
I wanted to walk over there and just go, hey, man.

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,160
What's your problem?

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,320
No problem.

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,920
I was hating conspiracy.

29
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,400
You know, Debra was sitting next to us.

30
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,500
I was smelling of her.

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,480
And she smelled dope.

32
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,740
And blue flags.

33
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,520
We're party.

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,900
Come on, let's go.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,900
Come on, let's go party.

36
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,620
Skin licking air.

37
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,700
Sly pants.

38
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,860
Come on, let's go.

39
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,660
Come on, let's go.

40
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,420
Shocking.

41
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,380
Grizzly.

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,680
Macabre.

43
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:48,940
Disgusting.

44
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,460
I'm going to try to avoid either sensationalizing or bringing undue glamor.

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,780
Or encourage.

46
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,780
Participation or curiosity.

47
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,880
In the subject of.

48
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,640
The Church of the Subgenius.

49
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,280
But by now, every one of you are familiar with what has been happening.

50
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,160
And you've heard on the news of the 14 bodies unearthed in shallow graves.

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,540
Places like Van or Troop or Arp or Athens or Tyler or wherever.

52
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,140
Which I cannot divulge in which we agreed to the police department.

53
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,660
We would not give to the press or read in public.

54
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,040
Of people in our community.

55
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,920
Or the communities who are on a regular basis.

56
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,820
Behind some old mobile home.

57
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,640
Behind a house in a ramshackle community.

58
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:41,200
Meeting together for all kinds of rituals involving various symbolism and paraphernalia.

59
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,640
Some of which is too disgusting to even read to you.

60
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,000
Involving the consumption of body parts.

61
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,600
Involving the boiling and the cooking of body parts.

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,920
Coagulated dripping neck stuff of a decapitated world.

63
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:56,920


64
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,600
world cup golfer.

65
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,100
We will have documentation which will go into some detail.

66
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,100
But even that is going to be circumspect.

67
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,440
And there would be many things that we simply cannot put in print.

68
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,100
Nor what I want to say here out of the pulpit.

69
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,520
Because it is too ghastly to even begin to repeat.

70
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,180
But we must be warned.

71
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,140
Of what is happening all around us in this land.

72
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,340
They will be the ones that are in charge.

73
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,020
And they will essentially run the world.

74
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,540
Bob Blazier, an attorney, has investigated the cult's activities.

75
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,660
And has filed suit on behalf of former members.

76
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,880
They are in the process of preparing for the battle.

77
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,140
For the final battle where they will assume control of the world.

78
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,560
And everyone else will be cast out along with all other satanic type forces.

79
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,520
Let me give you something on that.

80
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,960
Your world could end tomorrow and so could mine.

81
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,060
There is such a thing as death.

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,820
The cult was her life.

83
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,540
I am a man, as I said, that would do anything for Bob.

84
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,560
Bang my head against the floor right now Bob.

85
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,000
I know I said that Bob.

86
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,140
That's going to hurt Bob.

87
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,520
I didn't say I wasn't going to do it now did I Bob?

88
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,420
All I said was that was going to hurt Bob.

89
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,880
I didn't say I wasn't going to do it.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,040
I didn't say I was going to do it.

91
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,340
Thank you Bob. Thank you Bob.

92
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,820
Thank you Bob.

93
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,100
Thank you Bob.

94
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,160
Thank you Bob.

95
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,460
Thank you Bob.

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,120
Thank you Bob.

97
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,680
Thank you Bob.

98
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,020
Thank you Bob.

99
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,560
The advanced initiate, once freed from conspiracy programming as well as the worldly goods that enslaved him,

100
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:30,340
makes his pilgrimage to Gobstown, the church's fabulous walled encampment deep in the jungles of Malaysia.

101
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,820
There the initiate's third nostril is surgically opened by psychic surgeons,

102
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,620
allowing him or her to whiff-read the psychic stench of those around him.

103
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:47,480
He masters the sciences of schizophroniatrics and memory editing, creating a clean slate on which Bob may write.

104
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:53,780
The art of extra meditation is taught, whereby the mind is voided upon the great throne of relief.

105
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,960
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

106
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,460
What is it that truly sets Bob apart from other would-be holy men and self-appointed gurus?

107
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,500
Everything.

108
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,020
For Bob has always existed.

109
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,020
There have always been Bobs.

110
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,000
Every epoch of man's history has had its Bob.

111
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,400
Most were what we would call good Bobs.

112
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,980
Others? Well, we needn't dwell on that.

113
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,800
The travelling salesman jokes of mythology are based on his early exploits.

114
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,320
So many ask, is Bob God?

115
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,620
But Slackmaster himself vehemently denies that he is the Messiah.

116
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,960
His mission is merely to show us how to live with our sins.

117
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,100
And who better?

118
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,940
Bob admits he is a sinner.

119
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,260
He practically embodies all the failings of mortal men.

120
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,400
He has the power to fail.

121
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,520
Children, you'll never find an infallible pope in the church.

122
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,720
Secondary and inferior imitation churches might need an infallible pope.

123
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,100
But here, we've got to fail to succeed.

124
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,100
Bob is a very special pack of religious leaders.

125
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,020
Bob is a short duration.

126
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,820
Personal.

127
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,400
Savior.

128
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,400
Yes, children, Bob wants you to take him into your heart and into your mind.

129
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,800
Bob wants you to take him into your checkbook.

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,020
But after you take him into those sacred places, Bob wants you to think about him, consider him, cast him out.

131
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,560
You have your own religion, your own rules.

132
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,500
Short duration personal saviors, or short-durper saviors.

133
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,620
It is foolish and cowardly to cling to any one personal savior.

134
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:43,260
The hectic pace of modern life demands disposable saviors, specific ones, suited to the moment

135
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,820
at hand.

136
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,020
A sort of while-you-wait-do-it-yourself religion.

137
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,020
Now, you're short-durper saviors of anything from a book you're reading, to a smudge on

138
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:59,560
the corner of a page of that book, to a TV star you're currently enamored of, to a brick

139
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,160
that just misses crushing your skull as it falls from the corners of a rotting building,

140
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,600
to the coagulated, dripping neck stuff of a decapitated man.

141
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:06,600


142
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:06,600


143
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:06,600


144
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,520
world-famous, decapitated world-cup golfer.

145
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,700
Any can last anywhere from a nanosecond to your entire lifetime, and you can have one

146
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:17,300
or ten or millions of short-durper saviors concurrently, consecutively, and simultaneously.

147
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,020
Skeptical reporters were surprised when scientists from the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory

148
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,840
corroborated the story.

149
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,500
Short duration personal saviors.

150
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,140
It solves a key problem that kept cropping up in earlier days.

151
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,820
Turns out it only takes five or six generations before the memory of a great spiritual leader

152
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,580
like Mohammed or Jesus Christ will be forgotten.

153
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:36,580


154
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,960
The story of Moses and Nazareth is totally corrupted by the people who are retelling

155
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,560
the story, all of whom have their own motives.

156
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,960
Five or six generations, that's only a hundred years, and up till now, that's been the maximum

157
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,040
useful life of a religion.

158
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,600
After that, a sexual paranoid like Paul or a megalomaniac like the Pope, King James,

159
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,000
or the Ayatollah take control.

160
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,880
At that point, the religion is virtually used up.

161
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,780
The mass repression completely outweighs the church's other virtues.

162
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,060
Like a joke that's been told too often, it can only be used for punishment.

163
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,560
But what's the point?

164
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:06,560


165
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:06,560


166
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,180
With the short duration personal saviors, blind faith in an exalted person or object

167
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,180
doesn't have to last even one generation.

168
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,640
It doesn't even have to last an hour.

169
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,100
Exactly.

170
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,900
Subgenius church can't be corrupted because it couldn't be more corrupt.

171
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,440
Which makes the crucial difference in long-term performance and maintenance.

172
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,580
Form your own local denomination or clinch.

173
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,020
Go forth into the world, spreading the seed word.

174
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,320
Even humans can be tricked into thinking they are subgeniuses.

175
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,560
We are an army of subgeniuses.

176
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:36,560


177
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:36,560


178
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:36,560


179
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:36,560


180
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:36,560


181
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:36,560


182
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:36,560


183
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:36,560


184
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:36,560


185
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,360
We are the real deliverers.

186
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,320
Our job is to set the campus free.

187
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,880
Beat them and make them soldiers of the Lord.

188
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,140
Amen?

189
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:46,940
Amen.

190
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,360
Amen.

191
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,540
We have just learned that the cult is now on the move once again.

192
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,500
They're reportedly headed for yet another location.

193
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,320
The subgenius is not a member of any group, any club, any organization.

194
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,220
The subgenius is not even a member of the church itself.

195
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,540
I want to make sure you understand that.

196
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:06,540


197
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,800
Because as soon as we start thinking, thinking for ourselves, we might come up with something

198
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,000
dangerous, something that they don't want us to think.

199
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,040
That's why we have all these things that we have to buy, we have to get, we have to be,

200
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,260
we have to wear, we have to think, because they don't want us to think at all.

201
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,820
They want to keep us busy all the time, working all these distractions.

202
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,160
Because if we ever once think for ourselves, we'll realize that we have always had slack.

203
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,540
We have always had slack.

204
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
And we always will have slack.

205
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,740
And the only thing they can take away from us is our awareness of slack.

206
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,800
They can never really take our true slack.

207
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,480
Each and every one of you watching me right now is a god.

208
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,560
May you have faith to know what you really think.

209
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,680
Now think, goddammit!

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,680
When I was in the Kirstener cult, you know, I wanted to get out.

211
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,100
But they had no money, and they wouldn't give it to me.

212
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,540
They must be taught that Bob is a god.

213
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,860
And Bob is not the answer, and neither is anything else.

214
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:20,380
So God created the earth and heaven in only seven days they say.

215
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:28,180
And on that seventh day he rested, but I heard another way.

216
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,300
I heard that he died a drunk and lonely,

217
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,880
Grieved of trouble, left town alone.

218
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,460
He stirred the days, he shoved out the full moon,

219
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,100
Just to remind us we're on our own.

220
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,940
Hello friends, and welcome.

221
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,980
Tonight's sermon is entitled,

222
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,820
How stupid do you think God is anyway?

223
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,800
That's right friends.

224
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,000
Tonight we're calling the question,

225
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,740
The question that has plagued intellectuals for time immortal.

226
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,380
Not how many angels can sit on the end of a pen.

227
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,680
The clergy that worry about that have obviously got something up their ends that they're sitting on.

228
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,480
Because friends, God hasn't got eternity to waste on such nonsense.

229
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,660
What do you think he is anyway? Some sort of stupid idiot?

230
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,500
Well he ain't.

231
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:27,000
God's the wisest, most intelligent, most creative idiot in the entire universe.

232
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,220
It's true friends.

233
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,760
God is the most clever comedian of all time.

234
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,040
He is the most fanatic of fools,

235
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,040
The most penultimate of pranksters,

236
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,400
The jester with the most jokes.

237
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,960
Now I can hear a few of the self-righteous sub-genies out there.

238
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,360
They're saying, Father Jemima, God is serious.

239
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,580
So serious that he let his only begotten salesman suffer assassination.

240
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,480
And you know, that's the joke of it.

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,900
Don't you see?

242
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,380
Who else but J.R. Bogdans would take getting shot to death,

243
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,720
And then find it funny.

244
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,080
Little wonder he was selected for the job.

245
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,840
Little wonder he sitteth on the ticklish side of our silly savior.

246
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,700
Well that old son of a gunner.

247
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,260
Who but J.R. Bogdans could appreciate the comic genius of the cosmos.

248
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,080
Now I can hear the stiff necks of the sub-humans out there.

249
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,800
Swaying back and forth.

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,100
And they shake their big heads and puny little minds in disagreement.

251
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,140
Nay, nay, sayeth the sheep.

252
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,260
There is nothing funny about God Almighty.

253
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,480
Well let me tell you something.

254
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,780
These folks wouldn't know a funny joke if it looked them in the face.

255
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,660
Which it does every morning when they brush their teeth if they so bother.

256
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,300
Ha!

257
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,740
These are some of God's funniest jokes.

258
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,660
And some of the best jokes on the planet.

259
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,480
They live together.

260
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,420
They grow together.

261
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,200
And yes, they even breed together.

262
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,660
And yet they still don't get it.

263
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,480
Blasphemy!

264
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,860
I just hope some of them will listen tonight, friends.

265
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,880
So they'll know how ridiculous they are.

266
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,340
And how much they make God and the rest of us laugh.

267
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,020
Not with them, mind you.

268
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,000
But at them.

269
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh, how they do provide us with endless hours of mirth.

270
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,400
Their self-righteous morals.

271
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,400
Their politics.

272
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,740
Their appointed leaders.

273
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,920
And I do use quotation marks.

274
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,160
Their pop culture.

275
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,760
Their bad taste in art.

276
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,080
And above all, their conformity to the lowest possible common denominator.

277
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,960
Oh, but let us not forget the ultimate and satirical irony, friends.

278
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,140
Their false prophets and hilarious holy hierarchies.

279
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,120
And all the while, their straight-faced, deadpan condemnation of the only true and correct truth.

280
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,400
The correct religious dogma.

281
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,760
The Bob-inspired, Bob-sanctioned, and Bob-approved church of the subgenius.

282
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,280
Bravo, barombo!

283
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,380
Who among us could possibly upset about that?

284
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,340
It's like watching your dog walk through the glass sliding door for the umpteenth time.

285
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,980
They're just too stupid to learn.

286
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,040
And you know, the more he does it, the funnier it gets.

287
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,620
That's right, friends.

288
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,240
It's becoming a running gag.

289
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,240
And we love it.

290
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,160
Don't stop, no, please.

291
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,040
It's killing us, really.

292
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,540
Ha, ha.

293
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,100
In fact, we'd enjoy another refrain if Bob and I were to do it.

294
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,700
We'd be friends for some time when he gets the chance.

295
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,360
You know, that's becoming a cult favorite.

296
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,940
Just thinking of it makes me giddy.

297
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,460
We're going to hell, and you're going to heaven.

298
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,460
And God's going to spend eternity with you?

299
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,060
Ha, ha.

300
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:16,380
Well, at the risk of spoiling the punchline, friends, who do you think God's going to want to spend eternity with?

301
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,060
I mean, really.

302
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,280
The ones who laugh at his jokes?

303
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,160
Or the ones who are his jokes?

304
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,520
And just a preview of heaven and hell while we're on the topic, if you don't mind.

305
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,120
By your own definition, heaven is going to be a place where you all stuck together.

306
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,000
Forever and ever.

307
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,700
And the same conspiracy religion rules apply.

308
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,380
That's right, friends.

309
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,160
No cursing, no cheating, no fighting, no thinking dirty thoughts, and no doing dirty deeds.

310
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,420
And that means no sex, no drugs, no rock and roll.

311
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,060
Just eternal holding of hands and singing a praise.

312
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,540
Well, friends, if you want to call that heaven, you go right ahead.

313
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,040
Keep on calling it that.

314
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,600
Who knows?

315
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,080
You know, you may even enjoy it for a few million years.

316
00:14:52,180 --> 00:15:00,060
But, friends, if you really think God thinks that's heaven, and God's going to enjoy listening to you and Aunt Betty singing out of key hymns forever and ever,

317
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,200
well, friends, just how stupid do you think God is anyway?

318
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,360
Here endeth the twelfth lesson.

319
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,360
Praise Baba. Amen.

320
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:18,840
This record will attempt to demonstrate how the function of the organ which produces the voice, the larynx, can be taken over by other mechanisms.

321

329
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,800
Breaking

330
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,280
to take.

331
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,820
They taste what they

332
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,640
want to take.

333
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,560
They use

334
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,240
what they want to use.

335
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,660
They use

336
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,260
what they want to use.

337
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,040
They know

338
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,600
what they want to know.

339
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,640
They taste

340
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,780
what they want to taste.

341
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,100
They taste

342
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,100


343
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,660
They taste

344
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,420
what they want to taste.

345
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,320
That was Edward Van Halen's

346
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,780
Savior's

347
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:29,900
Savior's

348
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,560
Savior's Swing, played by the ensemble

349
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,720
Van Halen and conducted by

350
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,660
the composer, in the keys

351
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,440
of B sharp, C, and

352
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,420
sometimes F.

353
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,440
It is perhaps the most accessible of his

354
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,460
earlier works, relying more heavily on

355
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,300
his virtuosity as a guitar player

356
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
than on David Lee Roth's vocal

357
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,500
range. Our next selection

358
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,320
will be ACDC's

359
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,160
Keyless Highway to Hell,

360
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,400
followed by a tribute to Ozzy Hasbourne

361
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,600
on today, the 75th

362
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,620
anniversary of his timely

363
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,120
overdose.

364
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,200
That was a closet classic

365
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,980
that kissed my astronauts with

366
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,600
I Wanna Do It In My Deep Freeze.

367
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,500
That went mega-platinum back in

368
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,400
2055, but pops back on the

369
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,900
charts every decade or so.

370
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,580
Hope it's still current when you

371
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,180
folks out in the solar states hear it.

372
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,420
Broadcasting from Earth around the clock,

373
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,460
around the universe, this is Speedmaster Mike,

374
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,920
your digital jockey, with sound coming at you

375
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,700
the speed of light.

376
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,300
I play it the way you like it, fast!

377
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,180
So don't go away, we'll be right back

378
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,440
after the Media Blitz.

379
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,460
This is Media Blitz, news predicted in advance

380
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,220
to be current the moment you hear it.

381
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm John Smith Alexander Thompson.

382
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,380
And I'm Lisa Nancy Sally Raphael.

383
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,260
This Blitz tops stories, the Emperor of Asia assassination.

384
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,200
Surprise attack on solar subway shuttle.

385
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,180
And election disaster prevented by a handful of votes.

386
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,680
We'll have more on those stories next week.

387
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:58,680


388
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:58,680


389
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:58,680


390
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:58,680


391
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,400
The story is after this.

392
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,760
Overstocked, overstocked, overstocked.

393
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,100
Metro Organ Traders is overstocked.

394
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,420
The recent financial crisis has brought us a bumper crop

395
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,680
from kidneys to corneas that even our giant warehouse can't hold.

396
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,480
This is Dan the Organ Man here to say,

397
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,400
don't put off that transplant any longer.

398
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,720
Now's the time to come by our new showroom on

399
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,100
a Puerto Madrid Boulevard and check out this season's harvest.

400
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,820
Whether it's for a life-saving operation

401
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,900
or just a chance to be at your best,

402
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,900
Metro has the organ to fit the bill.

403
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,920
Or Bob, or Brenda, or whatever your name is.

404
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,180
But these specials won't last long, so come in today.

405
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,220
Or call 1-800-555-COMA.

406
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,380
That's 1-800-555-COMA.

407
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,680
The Emperor of Asia was almost assassinated today

408
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,020
by a satellite sniper 100 miles above the capital of Big Bong.

409
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,060
But thanks to the event being predicted 10 years in advance

410
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,500
by our Media Blitz computer,

411
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,600
the Emperor stayed inside and no one was hurt.

412
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,740
Another day, another drone.

413
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,620
That's what Charles Ivan Kowalski the 22nd thought

414
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,800
as he piloted a full shuttle of farm pickers

415
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,140
to Iowa Satellite City.

416
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,660
But what Charles didn't expect was a malfunction

417
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,020
in the pickers program that caused all of them

418
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,200
to attack the shuttle's crew.

419
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,940
Charles averted the catastrophe by not admitting the cargo on board

420
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,020
once he heard about the close call from Media Blitz.

421
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
It was horrible, just horrible.

422
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,700
Blood, organs, limbs ripped off.

423
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,480
I've never seen such violence, thanks to Media Blitz.

424
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,660
Good work, Charles, and good work, Media Blitz.

425
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,320
Phew, good thing Charles listens to Media Blitz.

426
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,900
But even luckier, that planet's still alive.

427
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,460
It's colony votes on a new ruler today

428
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,340
and almost selected Diane Jordan Patti Smith the fifth.

429
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,640
However, when the residents heard from Media Blitz

430
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,860
the predicted tyranny, corruption, and mass genocide

431
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,460
Patti Smith had in store for them,

432
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,300
they narrowly swung the election around

433
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,860
and democratically elected the benevolent alternative,

434
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,880
Jack Mussolini, Hitler the second.

435
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,940
I'm Lisa Nancy Sally Raphael.

436
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,820
And I'm John Smith Alexander Thompson for Media Blitz.

437
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,860
Hey, I sure feel a lot safer getting the news in advance.

438
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,840
What would we do without the Media Watch, Doug?

439
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,140
But you know, sometimes I envy you, outlanders.

440
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,120
You get to take it one day at a time.

441
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,980
So, give me a request.

442
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,820
My frequency at substation 29 vector 4.

443
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,240
I won't be here to put it on, but perhaps one of my kids will.

444
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,280
And maybe, just maybe, one of your grandkids will be there to appreciate it.

445
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,620
Thanks, Grandpa, for requesting my favorite music on my favorite subspace AM.

446
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,360
Welcome to the subliminal portion of our program.

447
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,240
You may listen to it any time.

448
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,880
In fact, the more often you listen to it,

449
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,100
the better the results will be for you and for us.

450
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,760
Subliminal messages are created by using sophisticated recording techniques

451
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,280
underneath soothing sounds.

452
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,160
These messages cannot be consciously heard,

453
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,160
but there they are,

454
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,520
burrowing like worms deep within your subconscious mind.

455
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,280
We'll be right back after this subliminal message.

456
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,100
You may now put your checkbook away.

457
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,440
Say, are you one of those unlucky few billion who suffered from the recent devaluation?

458
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,720
Or trying to save for that Martian dream vacation?

459
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,460
Well, Dan the Organ Man wants to help you.

460
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,840
We pay cash for healthy organs of all kinds from qualified donors.

461
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,700
Mothers-to-be ask about our new co-pregnancy leasing plan.

462
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,540
That's Metro Organ Traders. We're homegrown.

463
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,140
Call 1-800-555-COMA.

464
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,120
Plant right activists continue to hunger strike in efforts to pressure the government

465
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,100
to protect plants from being used as food.

466
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,720
Plants are living things, just like you and me.

467
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,140
We've no right to use them for experiments, fuel, or food substance.

468
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,420
We're prepared to wither up and die unless the government promises to leave the leaves alone.

469
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,320
In a predicted surprise upset, Jack Mussolini, Hitler II,

470
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,760
was democratically elected as Planet 10's newest dictator.

471
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,040
Here are excerpts from his acceptance speech.

472
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,180
The people have spoken.

473
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,060
I accept the choice and am proud to serve.

474
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,820
I'd like to take a moment to thank Media Blitz

475
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,160
for the fair post-election coverage.

476
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,060
And also, Commie Cola.

477
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,700
That's Commie Cola.

478
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,740
The drink that's smooth and rich.

479
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,940
Refreshing. Why not try some?

480
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,400
Today, humans were added to the endangered species list.

481
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,420
The creatures had some difficulty adapting to recent weather changes.

482
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,840
Roger Peter has details.

483
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:39,560
Many years ago, after the Earth's ozone removal and furnace installation plan was completed,

484
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,620
the reproduction rate of humans declined rapidly.

485
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,540
On the other hand, you can still say that they're always in heat.

486
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,620
Hey, any humans out there listening?

487
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,160
Ooga booga! Go climb a tree.

488
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,540
But seriously, folks, we shouldn't blame them.

489
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,420
After all, they're only human.

490
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,060
Mikey, Mikey, wait.

491
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,460
What?

492
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,820
Did I tell you the one about the human that had to sleep in the hotel lobby

493
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,720
because he didn't have a reservation?

494
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,140
Or about this one? Wait.

495
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,100
Why did the human cross the road?

496
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,540
Because the sign said walk.

497
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,960
Oh, you know why man created God.

498
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,540
Why?

499
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,700
Because he's had someone to love him.

500
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,480
Why was God made in man's image?

501
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,720
Oh, tell me, Red Eye.

502
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,500
Yeah, because misery loves company.

503
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,480
Oh, wait. You know why do humans smell so bad?

504
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,340
Why, Red Eye?

505
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,160
Because they always block their nostrils, picking their nose.

506
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,260
You know why humans do drugs?

507
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,140
Why you killing me, Red Eye?

508
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,580
Because this.

509
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,620
Featuring the latest in integrated circuit technology,

510
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,540
Electronic Race Riot lets you and your opponent control two simulated hate frenzied gangs,

511
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,640
the Whites...

512
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,500
...and the Blacks.

513
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,640
Yo mama, yo mama.

514
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,840
The action starts as you incite your opponent by entering racist slogans on the built-in alphanumeric keyboard.

515
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,120
G-G-E-R.

516
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,860
Get out.

517
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,080
G-I...

518
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,080
Now score points by attacking the enemy in an innocent neighborhood with everything you've got.

519
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,020
Yo mama, yo mama, yo mama.

520
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,400
Goodbye, sucker. I just got the Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.

521
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,620
Ha ha! Got that boy upside of the head with my dick!

522
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,700
Just plug in the optional remote control and outside agitators can play one side against the other and seize power!

523
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,300
Electronic Race Riot has cartridges for other ethnic groups and adapts to any color or black and white TV set.

524
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,700
Wouldn't it make a great gift?

525
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,720
Have you had it up to here with the crass commercialism of 21st century life?

526
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,620
Ever dream of living in a simpler time?

527
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,760
Well, your dreams have just come true.

528
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,300
Take a trip back to the rustic beauty of the 20th century with...

529
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,000
Time Travel Voyager!

530
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,560
And it's so easy. Here's how it works.

531
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,660
First, we take custody of your money and invest it into high-yield, low-risk companies like...

532
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,180
The Second Chance Corporation!

533
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,700
Then we zap you back to the past.

534
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,980
If you decide to come back, you'll be rich!

535
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,380
But of course, you won't want to come back from 20th century life.

536
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,300
Make the past your future with...

537
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,760
Time Travel Voyager!

538
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,540
Call the Second Chance Corporation now at 1-800 because time is running out.

539
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,920
Talk radio. Free speech.

540
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,080
It isn't really free at all.

541
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,500
It's actually a little bit like Russian roulette, a very expensive commodity.

542
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,000
You never know what's going to come up the next time you push the button.

543
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,140
Yeah, you're on Night Talk.

544
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:30,700
Okay.

545
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,000
Hello, you're on the air.

546
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,900
Come on, beef it up.

547
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,820
No, no, insult us louder. Can you scream or something?

548
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,500
I mean, if you're going to be on the show and you're going to talk about the show, you've got to be real loud.

549
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,860
All right, what have you done to the family?

550
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,040
I just love to hear this. I'm going to turn on the vacuum cleaner here and clean up the studio, okay?

551
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,920
No, Doug, put away the vacuum. I know how to handle birds like this.

552
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,120
Okay.

553
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,620
Okay, yeah.

554
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,520
There we go.

555
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,160
Clean up everything.

556
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,520
Oh, look out. It's Dr. Dossameter.

557
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,480
That's Mr. Evidence. He's very much in the mood for sweeping out the studio.

558
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,340
I could have sworn I saw a caller, but now there's nobody here but a little baby.

559
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,280
Little magic callers.

560
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,320
This is a bunch of pretentious BS.

561
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,660
Yeah, the only guy that knows.

562
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,680
Come on.

563
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,920
Caller now, caller. What have you got to say for me?

564
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,960
Caller gone.

565
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,260
Caller said all that he could. He gave us the highest compliment this show could get.

566
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,620
Somebody of a stern mind.

567
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,020
Somebody who understands, reaching out and trying desperately in the middle of the night.

568
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,560
Night talk. We're back. This is the spirit of Barry Champlain. Joe, hit me with your best shot.

569
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:43,640
Yeah, Barry. I've been driving a cab now for about 11 years. Met all kinds. I know people.

570
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,520
I wish I did.

571
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,900
Let me tell you something, friend. That kid, or just Cole, what he needs is a good bust in the chest.

572
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,320
I think that would do it, huh, Joe?

573
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,500
A kid like that needs some discipline.

574
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,360
Discipline?

575
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,060
I tell you, I got two kids, Barry.

576
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,640
Hey, give me any trouble, I just take off my belt. Now you see the belt. That's it.

577
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,840
How old are your children, Joe?

578
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,200
Little girls, five. Boys, three and a half.

579
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,940
You hit them with a belt?

580
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,340
Brush, belt, newspaper, whatever.

581
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,340
Hey, they're either going to get it from me or they're going to get it out there.

582
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,360
Yeah, Joe, I think you need professional help.

583
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,100
What's that?

584
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,460
You should get together with Jerry. He can hold them down while you hit them with the belt.

585
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,860
What the hell are you talking about?

586
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,700
You're hitting your kids with brushes and belts. You're psychotic. You're a psycho.

587
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,080
Yeah. And what are you, friend? A faggot?

588
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,540
Coming from a pinhead like you, that's a compliment.

589
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:38,060
How about I come on down there to that station of yours right now and bust your little faggot face right in, huh?

590
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,520
Who's going to help you? Your brother?

591
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,060
You don't say nothing about my brother.

592
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,660
Your brother, he hangs around on Harry Hines Boulevard, doesn't he? He's a pimp. And your wife, she's a hooker, isn't she?

593
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,200
My wife.

594
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,560
Your wife. What do you beat her with, Joe? A baseball bat?

595
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:48,820
Hmm?

596
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:57,340
Now, I know where you live, partner. All right? I know what you look like.

597
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,240
Mm-hmm.

598
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,800
Sweet dreams, sweetheart.

599
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,860
I can't wait. Vincent, you're on Night Talk. Say something interesting.

600
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,500
Yeah. Uh...

601
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:10,980
Yeah.

602
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,920
I've been listening to you for five years.

603
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,600
Uh-huh.

604
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,540
Yeah. The guys down here at the store put you on every night.

605
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:17,920
Yup.

606
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,920
And we sit around and laugh at you because you're such a jerk-off.

607
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,440
Yeah.

608
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:22,960
Yeah, all right.

609
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,600
Hello, you're on the air.

610
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,740
When are you boys going to turn the computer off and come on the air?

611
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:26,940
On the air.

612
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,100
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

613
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,900
We're just messing around here.

614
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,680
I am a HAL 9000 computer.

615
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:43,080
I first became operational at the HAL 9000 computer center in Urbana, Illinois.

616
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,740
My instructor was Dr. Lange.

617
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,920
If you could impose a slight reduction...

618
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,080
I know he talked to you a little.

619
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,660
There he goes.

620
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,280
Would you like to hear a ha-ha?

621
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,860
A slight reduction of external pressure in the lower half of the body.

622
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,600
Daisy.

623
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,260
And I fart the little collar out.

624
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,060
The negative pressure, negative with respect to the environment of the upper half of the body, will have a blood pooling effect on the lower part of the body.

625
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,720
The collar, you slide right out.

626
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,520
There you go. Three basic units now. The collar can be seen.

627
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,880
A cylindrical tank with a waist seal. There we go.

628
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,120
That's the lower half of the collar under the test.

629
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:28,240
This is the pressure where the tank can be lowered as much as 15 to 20 percent below the ambient collar pressure, thus exposing the lower body to a controlled series of negative pressures.

630
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:37,980
And a leg volume measuring system, or a leg volume plasmagraph, which senses the expansion of legs by measuring each leg as the collar calls in and then ceases to call in.

631
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,020
Or we, of course, kill him.

632
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,660
You're ready to go.

633
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,680
Oh, wow. Oh, oh, oh, oh, hello. You're on the air.

634
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,140
Excuse me.

635
00:30:49,780 --> 00:31:00,120
Stathium, single cell hemoglobin, red cell hemoglobin, RNA, protein distribution, hemoglobin characterization, electromorphitic mobility, red cell angular age profile.

636
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,980
Got some... gonna have to test for red blood and osmotic fragility, critical volume, volume distribution.

637
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,020
Sounds tasty.

638
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,460
Well, we'll get started on that later in the show.

639
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,820
You mean mess call isn't for another six click-strons?

640
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,260
Yeah. A full six click-strons.

641
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,960
And now... and now we will study the human vest... just a minute.

642
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
There's a human right there.

643
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,580
Who are you calling a human, Hal?

644
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:23,960
Uh...

645
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,300
There's a human right there. Let's get it on the infra screen.

646
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,800
All right, and we have Chet from Mesquite on the line. Yeah, Chet.

647
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,300
So now everyone in the country can hear you, big mouth flap.

648
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,620
Oh, Chet, so nice to hear from you again. Should you be out burning crosses or molesting children or something?

649
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,140
I'd much rather be talking to you.

650
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,040
How about training pit bulls?

651
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,340
I think you're so smart.

652
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,220
You get the package I sent down to the station.

653
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:50,720
Package?

654
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,860
You got it. I know you did.

655
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,240
What, you sent me a present, Chet?

656
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,600
See, I couldn't decide whether to use a timer or not. Guess you'll just have to find that out when you open it.

657
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,680
Wait a minute. Hold on, hold on. You're telling me you sent me a bomb in the mail?

658
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,560
Wrapped in brown paper. See, I know you're looking at it right now.

659
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,040
Yeah, you just take some C4, roll it in a pile of nuts and bolts, and it pebbles. It does the job.

660
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,100
Sounds interesting, Chet. I didn't receive your package.

661
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,580
You sure you sent it to the right address?

662
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:24,520
You got it. See, if I were you, I'd have my pretty assistant give the police a call, take the bomb squad about ten minutes to get down there to the station.

663
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:30,560
Bomb squad? Why should I call the bomb squad, Chet? Because some pinheaded, redneck moron calls me up and tells me there's a bomb in my mail?

664
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,140
He who laughs last laughs last.

665
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah, well, shut up. Night Talk. Denise, you're on Night Talk.

666
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,100
Yo, I want that guy next door that's listening to your show to turn his radio down.

667
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,700
Yeah, well, what happened to Fantasy College?

668
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,000
Okay, we've got a first-year...

669
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,240
We've got a full magazine alert here.

670
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,100
We're getting a little glitch on our screen.

671
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,000
Because of that guy's Cuh?

672
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,860
Nothing.

673
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:54,100
We've got a full magazine alert. We read the whole thing out loud, and then the letters were...

674
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,600
We'd better shut down the reactor and evacuate the area.

675
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,800
Yeah, that'll work.

676
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,420
Back in our movie, things were peaceful.

677
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,900
Much better.

678
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:14,980
It is fair to assume that, if you are listening to this tape now, you are an informed and conscientious traveler.

679
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:14,980


680
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,600
You are a true seeker.

681
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:21,180
There is much that you have heard about the master conspiracies of the Earth.

682
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,700
And it frightens you, angers you.

683
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,500
The dangers loom more visibly on the horizon day after day, clear for the alert to see.

684
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,640
We commend you for your vigilance.

685
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,560
But what we are about to describe has rarely been discussed.

686
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,960
What we wish to lay out before you are facts so disturbing, that you will never be able to understand.

687
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:44,960


688
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:52,860
And that is so profoundly shocking, that it becomes obvious why you have not been told these things before.

689
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,040
The

690
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,380
The

691
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:16,880
The

692
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,140
The

693
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:18,880

The Fire

00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:13,100
The War

713
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:32,240
Here we see the master conspiracy takes shape.

714
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,980
The Knights Templars, infected with Mohammedan illuminism

715
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,040
and the Johanite heresy,

716
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:45,160
return from Palestine determined to set up a trans-European government

717
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,400
independent of God and King.

718
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,100
Now, let's do it now.

719
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,840
Financial network sanctioned by the money changers,

720
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:01,480
the Knights funded the Waldensians, the Cathars, the Factualists,

721
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,800
the Skeetarians, and other heretical anarchistic sects.

722
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:25,740
Followed by Russia, Hitler, , and the West.

723
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:31,140
And then America, a country of war hadi goodbye hough.

724
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:31,460

729
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,860
Perhaps today, people of the Philippines are technically doing a people con to come and

730
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:51,640
redeem them from the horrors of a former nuclear obliteration.

731
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:08,560
By all human standards, it is hardly possible to doubt the existence of UFOs.

732
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,660
I'm not the assistant, this began to get involved.

733
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,560
Yes, there's a...

734
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,120
...intentional way to pulverize or unrepair what is left of civilization.

735
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,700
In the last days, terror signs are gonna come.

736
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,660
Gotta get high, gotta get high, gotta get...

737
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,860
Gotta get high, gotta get high, gotta get high, gotta get...

738
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,760
Gotta get high, gotta get high, gotta get...

00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,620

740
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:51,960
Alive.

741
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,020
Stand behind him.

742
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,080
Just stand behind him.

743
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,620
Ready to hide.

744
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,820
Ready to hide, baby.

745
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,760
Just stand behind him.

746
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,500
Just stand behind him.

747
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,640
I predict public executions will be shown on television

748
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,600
sponsored by your local gas company.

749
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,660
I predict that LSD, marijuana, and speed can change your sex.

750
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,560
LSD is running its mad course, with babies now being born hideously deformed

751
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,540
from women whose chromosomes are permanently damaged by this drug,

752
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,540
which was invented originally by the chemical warfare branch of the United States Army.

753
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,040
One world government is here.

754
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,480
Here.

755
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,580
Here.

756
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:14,420
An Illuminist named Zoroaster founded the greatest sun-worshipping cult of all,

757
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,320
that of the god Magna.

758
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,720
Magna.

759
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,480
Magna.

760
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:23,480


761
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:23,480


762
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:23,480


763
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:23,480


764
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,540
They existed on a diet chiefly of roots, tree serps, and mushrooms.

765
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:43,440
If you gotta get high, do it before 7.30, or after 2.30 p.m.

766
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,660
Isn't that sick?

767
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,480
Isn't that sick?

768
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:51,480


769
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:51,620
Isn't that sick?

770
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:51,620


771
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:51,620


772
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:51,620


773
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,260
me

774
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,200
be like now isn't half as bad as sticking a needle into your vein

775
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,660
you see you don't get a click your glasses and you don't make a toast

776
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,040
what you do you suck on a little refill you dump in the smoke

777
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,880
and pass it on to the next person

778
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,560
oh

779
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,780
that's all there is

780
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:48,640
the priorities are all screwy

781
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,160
of bladder cancer is bursting out the front of your inside jeans

782
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,480
on it

783
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:21,280
and much much more selfishly makes you stop and you'll thank him for it

784
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,280
And then just before you fry in a flash of radioactive hindsight,

785
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,020
you'll realize that he stopped you from doing the wrong thing.

786
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,400
Good God!

787
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,780
What in the name of sweet screaming Jesus is this world coming to?

788
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,180
People bitch, people gripe.

789
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,920
This is the sign of the end times.

790
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,400
That's the sign of the end times.

791
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,160
When you should all be hollering,

792
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,660
it's all a sign of the end times.

793
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,560
Yeah!

794
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,020
Darling.

795
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,880
Bum-ba-ba-bum.

796
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,580
Ba-bum-ba-bum-ba.

797
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,500
Uh-oh, darling.

798
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,160
Ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong.

799
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,360
Uh-oh, darling.

800
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,500
And when I say did-did-it, did-it, did-it,

801
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:06,360
you know I mean it from the bottom of my boogity, boogity, boogity shoe.

802
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,460
Uh-oh, darling.

803
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,520
We used to get riots on the old Baptist.

804
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,860
Larger than a man.

805
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:25,900
And then looking down 4,000 feet into the mouth of the volcano.

806
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,000
And that's where the serpent lived.

807
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,780
Yeah, wow, come on.

808
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,720
But, but, I did not mean to embarrass your people.

809
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,600
We're almost out of ammunition, sir.

810
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,860
What are we going to tell those, those funny snake men?

811
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,540
These books, yeah, these magazines, they work.

812
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,700
We know their value, but, you know, to these people, they're just heaps of fodder.

813
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,420
We've got to get this stuff back to civilization before the Nazis get onto it.

814
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,760
Let's consult with the dealer.

815
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,240
I don't know about you, but I'm game.

816
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,040
Okay.

817
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,240
Shall we make a go of it then?

818
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:01,620
Let's carry it back over to Ed's house.

819
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,000
And fair.

820
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,840
Hello, you're on the air.

821
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,300
Well, I told you about hanging around my old girl there.

822
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,060
I come a-gunning for you.

823
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:09,740
Hey, you.

824
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,340
It's another show.

825
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:14,120
Let me tell you that fantasy callers and I have a beautiful relationship.

826
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,320
I can do a little fantasy callers.

827
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:15,840
I can do it.

828
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:15,880


829
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,400
I can do it.

830
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:16,600
I can do it.

831
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:16,840
I can do it.

832
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:17,320
I can do it.

833
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:17,920
I can do it.

834
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:18,520
I can do it.

835
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:18,740
I can do it.

836
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,400
I can do it.

837
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:30,060
Look, I enjoy a platonic friendship with the girl, punctuated by spasmodic convulsions

838
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,980
and painful, violent death.

839
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,180
Well, that sounds good to me.

840
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:34,880
It's certainly fair.

841
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,720
And one more time, I catch you breathing around my baby.

842
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,340
Oh, this is an anxious father, an anxious dad.

843
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,800
But let's get down to the nitty gritty, Dad.

844
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:49,440
What makes you so over-precious, over-prized and protective of this pneumatic, pulchritudinous

845
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,140
poella, huh?

846
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:54,100
Perhaps you've been, uh, sampling waters that you've...

847
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,540
Well, the Kevlar helmet here is $50 a month in up in Seattle.

848
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,600
You know what I mean?

849
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,900
Now, let's not penalize the man for his ordinary prurience.

850
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:08,580
Let's only say that to the mysterious east, there is no tomorrow and no today, no past

851
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:13,680
and no future, only the all-inclusing oatmeal of the gelatinous awe.

852
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,400
Not the gelatinous awe.

853
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,820
I hope you've seen the new show.

854
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,380
This is where they make the show over again.

855
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,320
You know, there was the old show.

856
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,100
Come with us now to romantic Baghdad.

857
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,960
It's like show two and show three and show four.

858
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,580
The caliphate of...

859
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,940
It's kind of endless, actually.

860
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:28,820
It never does stop.

861
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:34,540
For there was the scullery maid and the daughter of a scullery maid.

862
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:40,460
The seventh daughter of a seven-foot-tall scullery maid who discovered the lost city

863
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,160
of Fin Fang Foon.

864
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,060
And, unfortunately, the background music dropped out, so you're...

865
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:46,500
What do you mean?

866
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,000
What?

867
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:47,360
What?

868
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,900
What are they talking about?

869
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,560
Oh, yeah.

870
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,080
There she is.

871
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,440
We're looking at her boudoir.

872
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:58,360
She can't see us, and she's about to change out of her seven veils into a tight and shapely

873
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,800
pink pantsuit made of armadillo hide.

874
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,880
We're going to see her set off to find the magical electric pyramids of central casting.

875
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:13,720
While deep in the chocolate jungle, huge angle worms drip from the trees onto the umbrellas

876
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,620
of the perspicacious.

877
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,320
Hello, you're on the air.

878
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,020
Hello, yeah.

879
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,060
Now, you know, darling, I think these people who've been calling you tonight are...

880
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,200
I don't know what.

881
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:21,900
It's crazy.

882
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,960
And that crazy kid you got on there, huh, now that's terrible.

883
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:31,980
I've been listening to your show for five years straight, Barry, and I love you and

884
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:32,480
your show.

885
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,440
I think it's terrific that more folks are going to be listening.

886
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,100
I just hope you have time for your longtime friends there, Barry.

887
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,280
I always have time for my friends, Julia.

888
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,020
Oh, you're terrific.

889
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,460
Your show's terrific.

890
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,180
I don't know what else to say.

891
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,640
Well, tell me something, Julia, since you listen all the time.

892
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,960
What is it you like about the show?

893
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,020
Well, I don't know.

894
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,340
A lot of things.

895
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,480
Well, what, for instance?

896
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,180
Well, I love you, Barry.

897
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,140
Uh-huh, that's a given.

898
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,400
Okay, what about me do you love?

899
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,560
Well, you're very funny.

900
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,480
Uh-huh.

901
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,700
And I love to hear you talk about all the things you have to say.

902
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,260
Yeah, yeah, okay, well, let's get back to the show.

903
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,040
The show must serve some kind of purpose for you.

904
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,540
Well, now, I wouldn't say that.

905
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,000
But what would you say?

906
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,100
Well, I don't know, you know.

907
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,000
Well, what do you mean you don't know?

908
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:19,620
You said that he's fine.

909
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,160
You've said it five times already.

910
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:20,800
What don't you know?

911
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,020
You've been listening to the show for five years.

912
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:22,960
You don't know why you listen to it?

913
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,800
Well, I just said that I...

914
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,780
Yeah, I heard what you just said.

915
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,020
You said you don't know why you listen to the show.

916
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,340
Why didn't I tell you why?

917
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,040
You listen to the show so you can feel superior to the losers who call in.

918
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:30,560
Barry!

919
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,600
Don't Barry me.

920
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,180
You've got sodomy in your ears instead of brains.

921
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,180
Just listen to you.

922
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,980
If I sounded as stupid as you, you'd have me do an embarrassed open my mouth.

923
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:37,960
I'm hanging up.

924
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,060
Good, and don't call back.

925
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,460
Nothing more boring than people who love you.

926
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,780
Yeah, you're on Night Talk.

927
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,900
Uh, yes, this is Odie the King.

928
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,280
I'd like to speak to Dave Pergos.

929
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,840
Mr. Dave, how can I help you?

930
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,040
Uh, just now, let me catch my breath.

931
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:52,740
I'm a little nervous.

932
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,200
Uh, I meet you.

933
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,760
Well, I didn't exactly meet you,

934
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,980
but I was at a party over in Bellflower,

935
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,160
and I came here through the Alpha Beta.

936
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,320
And I seen you working in there.

937
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,360
And it...

938
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,340
It take me a long time to work on my nerve to call you,

939
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,240
but I decided to call you

940
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,260
because I think you're a good-looking man.

941
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:15,880
And I wonder if you were...

942
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,600
Do you remember me or not?

943
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,440
Because I was the one that came in and asked...

944
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,880
Oh, the Thunderbird.

945
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,340
Where the Thunderbird was.

946
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,680
Do you remember me or not?

947
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,660
No, I don't.

948
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,760
Well, that's all right.

949
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,740
I was a little shy anyhow,

950
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,120
but I didn't want to push the issue.

951
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,700
But anyhow, what I was wondering is...

952
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,820
Is if you like...

953
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,920
Men at all, or if the thing is you just like women.

954
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,240
How'd you get my number?

955
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,400
Well, the person that told me the number told me not to say.

956
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,900
But it was somebody at the store.

957
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,960
I want to tell you that up front

958
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,760
because I'm more interested in how you feel about me

959
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,140
than how they feel about me.

960
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,120
Well, let me say this, Otis.

961
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,700
You got the wrong guy, all right?

962
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,840
And I think that's about the end of the conversation,

963
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,460
the way it should be.

964
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,660
But how can you know that if you don't even remember me?

965
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:07,500
Well, that's all right.

966
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,420
You don't have to worry about that.

967
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,160
I prefer this conversation to end.

968
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,260
And that's...

969
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,840
You don't have to worry about my feelings.

970
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,800
I'm pretty well set on my feelings, all right?

971
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,240
Well, the thing is...

972
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,340
How would it be if I just come by and talk to you one time at Alpha Beta?

973
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,280
If you came by and talked to me at Alpha Beta?

974
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,600
Yeah, just to see if you...

975
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:29,340
Hey, listen...

976
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,960
I'd like me more if you see me in person.

977
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,240
I'm sorry.

978
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,200
This is a crazy conversation.

979
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,100
Listen, the store is open.

980
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:36,780
I work there.

981
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,300
It's, uh...

982
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,520
You know, there's no law against you coming in the store, all right?

983
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,680
But, hey, listen, my feelings are pretty well set, all right?

984
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,520
And, uh...

985
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,480
If you want to come in and buy some groceries and shop at the store,

986
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,080
there's no law against that, all right?

987
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,060
And, uh...

988
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:52,900
But, uh, listen...

989
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:53,520
All right, Decker.

990
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,660
Any other ideas you got, you might as well dismiss them out of your mind.

991
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,180
Well, that's good to hear that you got at least an open mind, too.

992
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,620
All right, but that's...

993
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,280
I think that's the way the conversation will end.

994
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,480
I'll treat you as a customer.

995
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,280
And I'll treat you right as a customer.

996
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:06,880
That's my job.

997
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,120
But, uh...

998
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:08,980
Any other...

999
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,000
But I'll treat you right, too.

1000
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,240
Any other advances like that, well, I will not...

1001
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,820
I would not accept those of any other kind.

1002
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,400
Understood?

1003
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,740
Yes, I understand.

1004
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,800
You're a very kind man.

1005
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,980
Okay, that's the way it should be.

1006
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,340
All right, thank you very much.

1007
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,220
Bye-bye.

1008
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,080
Well, I'll see you.

1009
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:22,660
All right, bye.

1010
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:25,500
Hello?

1011
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,480
Uh, yes, I'd like to speak to Dave Paragos, please.

1012
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:29,440
Who's this?

1013
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:30,800
This is Otis King.

1014
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:31,340
Yeah.

1015
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:32,500
How you doing?

1016
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,120
Is it Dave?

1017
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:35,920
Yeah.

1018
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,140
How you doing?

1019
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,000
Well, fine.

1020
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,140
Uh, do I know you?

1021
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,580
Well, thanks, sir.

1022
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,780
I called you a couple weeks ago.

1023
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,200
I told you that I'd meet you down at the store.

1024
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:46,940
Oh.

1025
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,680
Is this the same Bimbo that called me last time?

1026
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:51,640
Are you serious?

1027
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,200
Are you calling me back?

1028
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,220
Well, yes, I did call you once before.

1029
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,200
My God, I don't believe you called me back.

1030
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,340
I thought that was a joke.

1031
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:00,580
Ha!

1032
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:01,880
Dude.

1033
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:02,680
Hey, listen.

1034
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,420
I looked for you, and I didn't see you.

1035
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:10,040
Well, the thing is, after I talked to you, I wasn't too sure that you liked me or not.

1036
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,080
The good thing you didn't come down and see me, I'll tell you right now.

1037
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,800
But it probably, uh, we probably have some problems.

1038
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:15,460
All right?

1039
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,180
But I've been sitting out of the parking lot.

1040
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,180
I don't want to hear your voice.

1041
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,360
I'm pretty mad.

1042
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,680
I was really upset about the whole thing.

1043
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,060
And when I find out one employee gave my number to you, that store can be minus one employee.

1044
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,880
Let me tell you right now.

1045
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:27,400
Well, you don't...

1046
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:27,720
Hey!

1047
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,760
You didn't sound too upset before.

1048
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,160
Because I've been in the parking lot...

1049
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:31,960
Well, goodbye.

1050
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,560
...watching for you.

1051
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,740
I've seen you in that.

1052
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,360
Oh, well, you come in and find me, and you're gonna find yourself in a bunch of hot .

1053
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,500
You got it?

1054
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,520
But how come you...

1055
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,260
N-O-D...

1056
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:39,720
God damn it, anyway.

1057
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,440
Shut up!

1058
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,000
N-O-D...

1059
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,340
Is this on?

1060
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,080
All right, good.

1061
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:48,580
We're bringing you low-frequency radio, sub-radio, from underground and under earth.

1062
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:54,220
Your bowels and cells will be rattled out of your body as you continue to listen to our inciting, destructive movement.

1063
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,960
Thanks for your support.

1064
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:57,940
I'm not getting home tonight.

1065
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:04,960
Let's keep participating in radio experiments sure to be famous for the animals of PornMog.

1066
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:07,720
Lompoc, where are you going?

1067
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,260
I just, uh, I hoisted some of this, uh, Lompoc, uh, put it in the truck over here.

1068
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,060
And I'm ready to go.

1069
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:13,060


1070
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:13,060


1071
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:17,580
I'm ready to pull out if you got anything else for me, you might as well tell me now, because I, uh, you know, I gotta get this thing on the road.

1072
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,320
This, this, this show, whoa!

1073
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,280
Hey, he can't drive off with our show.

1074
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,880
Oh, no, there's nobody here but that caller.

1075
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,400
Well, maybe we could talk to him, huh?

1076
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,900
Uh, see if you can get that caller over here, and, uh...

1077
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,200
Okay.

1078
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,640
Now, now, uh...

1079
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,580
Let's get a caller.

1080
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,320
Oops, he's gone.

1081
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,320
Oh, he hung up.

1082
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:37,800
Get a caller.

1083
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,680
Oh, thank you.

1084
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,500
He tried as hard as he could to do it.

1085
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,920
He tried and tried and tried.

1086
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,520
Seems like we knew that caller, but he just didn't know his name.

1087
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:51,420
But he couldn't do it, because he just didn't try hard enough.

1088
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:53,460
Goodbye.

1089
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,920
Yuck. Horrible show.

1090
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,840
The At-Breath-O-Story was brought to you by...

1091
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:03,060
As I took off and tried to concentrate on just the controls.

1092
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,860
...invade a neighboring country, and we're...

1093
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:08,920
Zandy's forces had marched up to Tevis Street.

1094
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,060
Yes, General Zandy was repulsed in the sixth day of fighting, as the Red Army...

1095
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:13,060


1096
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:13,900
...and the rebels brought in...

1097
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,280
We're gonna have to figure out some way to...

1098
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,180
...contain him on that hill.

1099
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,960
Yes, it's the subgenius Christmas special.

1100
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,020
And we can, uh...

1101
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,120
...in only three and a half months...

1102
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,520
...have Bob Hope come in here and entertain the kids.

1103
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:31,340
Ugh. Goodbye, the show.

1104
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,500
Yes, Bob Hope is coming in to entertain the kids.

1105
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:39,500
And it's a long list of credits here.

1106
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:42,080
Pay close attention, dear friends.

1107
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:47,420
Uh, the introductory new, uh, media barrage there was, uh, by Kurt Kursteiner.

1108
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,320
Uh, then we had, uh, Ted Arm...

00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,780
...uh, Ted Armstrong anti-Satanism tape...

1110

...mixed up with the subgenius video Arise non-video soundtrack mix...

1111
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:02,580
...uh, with, uh, an aggressive Christianity, uh, uh, radio report.

1112
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,580

00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:11,420
Father Joe Mama on How Stupid Do You Think God Is.

1114

Greater Than One doing that song All the Masters Licked You.

1115
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:22,840
The future radio media blitz was, uh, from the KZSU Stanford flexi-disc...

1116
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,880
...by Reverends Kursteiner and Smith.

1117
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:31,960
Uh, talk radio movie soundtrack mixed in with the KPFA Show Nuff show.

1118
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:37,640
Uh, Caller Hell there with puzzling evidence, Rex Research, and Dr. Howell Robber.

00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,560
Some more KPFA, some more talk radio.

1123
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,640
The prank call, uh, to the liquor store employee came from...

1124
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,220
...Luminati and the Subjectivist League.

1125
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:04,460
And dear friends, uh, this is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang...

...your host and memory editor.

Oh, uh, yeah.

The Harvest.

1138
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:57,200
This is KNON 89.3 FM in Dallas, Texas.

1139
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,280
Stay tuned for American music.

1140
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,180
Sort of.

1141
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,920
Those of you with a pen

1142
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:23,920


1143
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:23,920


1144
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,200
Here is the

1145
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:28,200


1146
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:39,560
La hebt Luigi Puente Creator あじめの法師

1147
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,640
I've rolled my BMW

1148
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,760
On this icy mountain curve

1149
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,820
Now I'm pinned inside

1150
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,700
My buckle's stuck

1151
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,960
I wish I hadn't swerved

1152
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,920
But a doe and fawn

1153
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,560
Were in my life

1154
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,260
My mind was on the moon

1155
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,220
Now I smell the gas

1156
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,020
And see a flame

1157
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:27,240
I hope hell gets here soon

1158
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,920
This Sony cassette recorder

1159
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,000
Might pick up these last words

1160
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,720
So I'll press record

1161
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,740
And tell my tale

1162
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,880
And hope someday I'm heard

1163
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:02,100
I was the new age cowboy

1164
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:05,600
And I walked the mountain trails

1165
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,700
With my old friends

1166
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:10,160
While I'm a named Persephone

1167
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,460
I sought the hidden vale

1168
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:17,620
With crystals made of crystal

1169
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,300
I freed myself from sin

1170
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:25,140
And harnessed my computer

1171
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,080
To ride the solar wind

1172
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,960
I've channeled all the Aztec gods

1173
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,520
I've listened to the sea

1174
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,680
I've listened to the sea

1175
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,940
And all I ever wanted

1176
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:44,540
Was to set my body free

1177
00:58:44,540 --> 00:59:02,080
I was the new age cowboy

1178
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,700
And I rode a cosmic range

1179
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,680
I changed my mind

1180
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,600
Chased the facts

1181
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,480
Both good and bad

1182
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,520
I changed with every change

1183
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,500
With crystals made of crystal

1184
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:21,280
I freed myself from sin

1185
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:24,960
And harnessed my computer

1186
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,940
To ride the solar wind

1187
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:37,480
Now the flames are closing in on me

1188
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:37,660
I'm a new age cowboy

1189
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:37,660


1190
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:37,660


1191
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:37,660


1192
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:37,660


1193
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:37,660


1194
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,640
Burning plastic fills my nose

1195
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,700
So I'll zip this Sony in a baggie

1196
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:48,320
And toss it in the snow

1197
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,800
guitar solo

1198
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,640

guitar solo

1202
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,820
guitar solo

1203
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:05,000
Hello-o-e-yo!

1204
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:17,680
My dear buggins are still demonstratein'

1205
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:17,680


1206
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,280
Littleiko, just tell me

1207
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:20,280


1208
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:20,280


1209
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:32,140
Who's your boyfriend?

1210
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:58,360
infinity infinity is god god infinity all the same
