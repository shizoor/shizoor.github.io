You're swimming in a sea of Bob's Pills right now.
You're up here, man!
You're choking on Bob's Pills,
but you're just too blind to have the dumb taste them to death,
to taste them, to know they're there.
You've just got to open your eyes,
open your throat, not still crying.
We've got the technology,
we've got the fan,
we've got the pills,
and we've got the authorization
for only $30, friends.
We'll be there.
Try not only to try to open the top of your head,
strike back the brain cells you don't need,
replace them with what's in Bob's head,
what's inside his little tiny pill,
what's inside his potion, my God,
and what's inside his potion
could be what's inside your head.
Useless, destroyed, washed.
You could be as mindless as Bob Bob,
but you're not.
You could be as handsome as Bob Bob,
you could be as black as Bob Bob.
Well, actually, that's a lie, nobody can,
but you know what I'm saying, friends?
You can get slapped.
The subgenius must get slapped.
The subgenius will get slapped,
and I can tell you exactly how soon
he will get slapped.
In 83 days,
the subgenius will have slapped.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery
which reaches from the inner mind to...
The subgenius.
Power of Slash.
Bloods.
What a great mic arm.
This is the most comfortable radio station in the whole world.
With the coolest mic arm.
I can just lean back in this easy chair.
And there's an arm that...
It's a mic stand with an arm that's adjustable.
It's a real biotic arm, too.
It's got blood in it and everything.
We have the technology.
Yeah, I noticed if you scrape the side of the mic stand,
it bleeds and it kind of rides.
It's like a...
It's just similar to the Bob Stick monitor or the Arnold.
It doesn't have a brain or anything.
It's just a bone and...
Well, it does have a brain. It's just a bone and...
You can't just lash it and have to cheat it.
I think there's...
When they did the clone mix,
they just put a little bit of brain cells in there
so it would be, you know, like a smart arm.
Oh.
Yeah.
So you can just kind of get...
Oh, is that what sort of follows my mouth around?
Yeah.
Some of them...
But some of them get...
What are they gonna think of that?
They get a little rebellious sometimes.
Oh, yeah?
Then they'll bother you while you're talking.
They'll grab you right around the throat.
You're kidding.
If they don't like what you're saying, man, it's weird.
Oh, should I pet it?
Oh, it's getting...
Yeah.
They'll get bigger.
They'll get bigger.
All right.
Yeah, I...
I think I'll leave that alone.
Yeah, you don't want it to be too friendly.
Uh...
Oh, it's so comfortable in this...
This basement radio station that Chaz has.
Yeah, the FCCIA was gonna try and bust them last week.
I don't blame them.
I can't believe that you can get this behind the counter.
I guess the Eglise Pentecostal down the street...
I mean, over the counter.
...had their own...
Huh?
The Eglise Pentecostal, you know, the church down the street there where they all shake
up the tambourines on Sunday.
I guess they had their own radio station.
And Chaz was just jamming it out.
Yeah.
And the FCCIA came by.
You gotta go for it, man.
You gotta like...
And it goes...
You gotta just pretend that microphone is a woman, which is not easy with that bony
arm holding...
Well, I guess they do have the microphones now that actually are, well, you know, part
of a woman.
They do?
Yeah.
I mean...
Well, how come we're not using those?
No more deep-beating prayer scripts for you.
You just be...
You'll be talking in a microphone all the time, man.
Because you're so much...
You'll be mouthing the microphone is what you mean.
Mm-hmm.
I'm...
I like this.
Oh, this is such a great studio.
In my studio, the mics are just mics that...
They're just cheap radio shit, plastic and...
And your basement, I guess, is like three feet of water under it.
We don't have any.







We don't have basements in Texas.
Oh, that's right.
We have penthouses.
I work up on the very top of the skyscraper, but the...
I have my actual studio, my mics are hanging from strings from uncured boards.
It's called Tarzan's Radio Station because it's out of a penthouse.
It's in the garden.
It's in a treehouse.
I knew the hour's light from a treehouse.
I thought you knew that.
No, I didn't know that.
Everything's like from Vines.
I knew you were pretty far up in the air.
We could be really high-tech, but I insist...
Bob has a lot of experience.



I always insisted that we produce the hour of slack on the kind of equipment that any
poverty-stricken shut-in could afford, which means two cheap Radio Shack decks and bad
volume equalizer.
Wait a minute.
You mean that Polaroid you sent me with that treehouse that had hour of slack written
on it like H-O-W-E-R and then slack, the S was backwards?
I thought that was like a kid's treehouse and they were just sticking on your name and
that's the studio?
No, that is actually where we do that.
That's the...
That's the real studio.
With the little picnic table sitting up there on the treehouse.
It's a pretty sturdy treehouse and the mics really do hang from Vines because they're
such cheap mics that if anything touches the cord of the mic, you can hear it all the way
just as if...
Here, listen.
Hear that?
...you touch the front of the mic.
You see?
These new womanly, manly mics, these gene spliced mic arms that Chaz and you guys have
here in outer space...
Well, those mics...
Well, friends...
...are the ones that are the best.

...and they're so much better than...
That's right.
I'm back here.
That was a tape.
That was actually just only a tape of the...
Of my last visit to Einstein's secret studio there and I'm not drunk right now.
The reason I may sound a little mush mouth is I...
When I was at that studio a few days ago in Cleveland, we went out for burgers at Burger
King.
I remember that name, Burger King.
I remember that name, Burger King.
I got me a damn burger and bit into it just as heartily as hell and there was a rock,
some kind of a little hard thing.
I don't know what it was because I swallowed it and it broke my tooth and I had a broken
tooth.
And about two hours ago, I got into the dentist office back here at home in Dallas and she
ground up my old tooth and put in a brand new tooth but my mouth is still really numb.
And I mean, the whole bottom half, the right side of my mouth is just dead, completely
dead and my brain, the right side of my brain is dead.
I can only be logical and the logical thing to do now I think would be for me to go back
to the tapes.
First, oh, and man, we had a great show in Cleveland at the Euclid Tavern.
It was very well recorded.
Praise the sound man, Mike.
God, I'm starting to spit.
I'm drooling, friends.
Novocaine, what a trip.
Anyway, it was just myself and Einstein's Secret Orchestra, Chaz Smith, Lonesome Cowboy
Dave, and special guest Princess Wiardo.
And Michelle Smith, the Hendrix of the electric violin and the drummer, Bob.
And we got some excellent recordings from that show.
I'm going to be playing some of that.
We did a lot of extra recording in the studio.
But before we go into that, I also discovered, sort of rediscovered this band or artist named
James Kochalka.
Okay.
James Kochalka, superstar.
WFMU sent the CD of his album Monkey vs. Robot.
And I played something off of it about a year ago and then it got lost in the shuffle.
But Princess Wi asked me to bring to Cleveland, she said, bring some of that weird cartoony
music that people send to you in the mail instead of all your electric guitars.


And I went, oh, well, okay.
And I grabbed a whole bunch of cartoony CDs.
And while re-listening to Monkey vs. Robot, I realized what a treasure trove it was.
And so here's the soundcheck of love from Monkey vs. Robot by James Kochalka, superstar.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?






I love you.
Hey, is this thing on?
Where has our love gone?
There's something wrong with this microphone.
Is it worn out and getting old?
I don't want to start a fight.
But the sound guy's not too bright.
Check one.
Check two.
I love you.
Hey.
Is this thing on?
Where has our love gone?
Monkey play in the jungle.
Robot work in the factory.
They will have a giant rumble.
Monkey vs. Robot.
Robot vs. Robot
Monkey hate technology
Robot hate the monkey
They will fight eternally
Monkey vs. Robot
Monkey vs. Robot
Monkey mates in the jungle
Robot replicate in factory
They both love their mother
Why must they hate each other?
Why can't we all get along?
Would that be oh so wrong?
Why can't we all love each other?
Monkey and a robot brother
Monkey vs. Robot
Monkey vs. Robot
Monkey vs. Robot
Monkey vs. Robot
Monkey vs. Robot
Monkey vs. Robot
M-O-N-K-E-Y

Monkey vs. Robot
And certainly the monkey versus robot theme is a common to not only Devo, the Devonian philosophy, but of course also the Church of the Subgenius, seen here on track three. Thank you.
What kind of a god is it who has to be defended by little old illiterate redneck ladies and geeks against assholes like me?
What kind of a god is that, I ask you?
And we are so disgusted with this pussy, sissy god who has to have dumb rednecks in Arkansas defended against idiots like me.
Thank you.


We, the Church of the Subgenius, in the name of Bob Dobbs, as of this moment tonight, herewith declare war on God!
War on God!
We are not going to let him push us around like this.
We're not going to take it anymore.
Not from that kind of god, anyway.
What kind of a god is that, I ask you?
What kind of a god is that, I ask you?
Praise God!
Ill-Pretty!
Well, you know, it's easy to pick on the Christians.
But really, they just happen to be the ones who are in our face in this country more.
The, um, I personally would like to kill all the New Agers and Muslims and damn you.
Actually, friends, actually, as an evangelical subgenius, I'm kind of a pacifist.
I'm not, I'm not into killing the pigs.
I'm into enslaving them, certainly, putting them to work, buying and sub-trading them, breeding them, using them.
You know, why waste a natural resource?
If you, hey listen, folks, if you're the bloodthirsty kind of subgenius that wants to kill all the pigs,
there's a section of the church, Dr. Legumes, Holocaustals, you're welcome to join the Holocaustals.
All they want to do is fight and kill and everything.
Or you can join us humble evangelicals.
Not my turn, friends.
Somebody else named it that.
Um, whatever, you know, take it if you want to, if you'd rather kill pigs.
Join the Holocaustals if you want the love of Bob Doves, friends,
and the fierce, frictional interface between Bob and Connie Doves.
Man.
Because, friends, you know, we're just like every other religion.
This whole thing is based on hating everyone who's not like us.
The big difference between us and the Christians is,
at least we can't kill.
We can't come out and admit it.
And on top of that, not only do we hate everybody who's not like us, that includes all of us.
Because none of us, the only thing that we as subgeniuses have in common is that we have
nothing at all in common with the conspiracy of the common normal.
Otherwise, that's all we have in common.
The only thing we have in common, friends, is we're all kind of queer for Bob.
But, you know, we're all kind of queer for Bob.
Not necessarily.
I don't know if I'd put it that way.
But, you know, we're, as we've said, we've tried to tell you, folks, we're bisexual.
When you buy subgenius T-shirts, we come.
It's a bunch.
It's a beautiful thing.
And, you know, I'd like to take this opportunity, personally, to thank Bob Doves, wherever Bob is.
Bob?
Bob?
Bob?
You hear me?
Danny, you listen, Bob.
Bob, I want to thank you for giving me slack the last two years.
Bob!
Bob, I want you to know that your promise rings true.
Bob!
These people out here have been wondering about, am I, as a subgenius, ever going to get the perfect sex hurt?
The ultimate ooze squirt?
Am I ever going to find my true yeti mate and find true love?
And, friends, all I can do is tell you that, in my case, it goddamn worked.
Praise Bob and help honey, I've been getting more pussy and better pussy than I ever got in my entire life.
And I happen to like pussy.
Some people may take that a little way.
And, praise Bob, I've been married for 25 years.
I should have about 25 new wives tonight, I hope.
Oh, yes, friends.
And you can say, you come up after this show like the drunks often do, and say, whoever's saying, where's my slack?
I thought you were going to give me slack.
And that's when I get to say, if you think that anybody else is going to give you slack, then this message has been lost on you.
You have not heard anything Bob has said to you.
Because only you, you and you, can make your own slack.
And that's all there is to it, my friends.
Praise Bob.
That's the greatest gift he made.
Praise Bob.
Yes, friends, and it's true.
Sure, we're trying to sell you something for nothing.
But this is the one religion where you really can get something for nothing.
Because you're going to get that slack.
If we finally convince you to do it yourself, you're going to get that slack.
And what did you spend?
Nothing but money.
And what is money really worth?
Ask Michael Jackson.
Ask Elvis Presley.
Ask Madonna.
They've got all the money in the world.
And they're obviously miserable, fucked up wretches who have, do desperately need Bob Dobson, some kind of slack in their lives so that they can finally fucking laugh at themselves.
And friends, you know, you may, and here's another miracle, Bob.
Now a lot of you folks are not very rich.
Some of you live in poverty.
Some of you are diseased, not very healthy.
Some of you have mental illness or depression.
Some of you are just plain kind of funny looking or too fat or too skinny or socially inept, kind of clumsy and shy.
Hey, I'm not making fun.
I have been all of those things myself and hope to again someday.
But you know what?
And if you're honest with yourself, you didn't really join the church because you wanted to meet a bunch of new sub-genius friends.
It's not a fan club like that.
In fact, chances are you'd just as soon be left to fucking alone.
And friends, you can be alone with Bob.
All those other personal saviors demand, oh, they want so much from you.
They're breathing down your neck going, Bob.
Did you pay your taxes on time?
Do you make enough money?
Are you going to get laid?
Did you do the right thing?
Have you kissed my ass enough?
Bob Dobbs doesn't care about any of that crap.
He doesn't care about your sins.
He doesn't give a shit about your sins.
Because Bob came and comes again and again to justify your sins, to rationalize your sins, my friends.
And you know, with all the despite and the hate, I'm not going to say anything.
I'm going to say that Bob is a conspiracy and an invisible monster.
And the fact that they hate us all so much because we, oh, might be promiscuous or we might cuss or we might think our own thoughts or one of those awful kind of things, you know.
As much as they hate us, friends, we can hate them so, so much more.
And you know why?
It's as simple as that.
It's because we've got Bob and they don't.
And for that, we can hate them.
Hate them.
Hate them.
Hate.
Hate.
Hate.
God, they're just going to creep.
In some ways, it's beautiful to hear a big crowd of fascist subgeniuses chatting hate.
But at the same time, it kind of makes me sick.
It makes me feel like I'm going to be a bad guy.
It makes me feel like I'm going to be a bad guy.
Oh, friends, I almost forgot.
We have a special guest tonight.
It's What's Inside Your Brain, actually.
Hold on.
Hold on just a second.
What is in your brain?
What is in your brain?
What is in your brain?
Don't repeat what I said.
The big question was, what is in your brain?
What is in your brain?
Friends, I'm going to depart from my prepared material just to explain something to you.
Then I'm going to give you this.
Actually, it's some kind of a melon.
There's supposed to be a pumpkin.
Friends, before a subgenius show, we preachers have this little ritual where we usually get some bobbing from the audience and have it come backstage.
We have this great big pumpkin.
When we have one, it's destroyed now.
We hollow the pumpkin out and we drill four or five holes in the sides, however many male creatures there are.
And we take a squirrel or two or three live squirrels, if we can get that many.
We put them inside the pumpkin.
We put the pumpkin full of squirrels on top of the bobby's head.
And then the preachers stand around and fuck the pumpkin with the squirrels.
Now, you know, that kind of gets our kids away.
It's like football players going, oh, I'm going to get a little bit of a big one.
I'm going to put it in the huddle just before the game, you know, to build up the spirit.
It's just a thing we do.
And the squirrels are dead and the pumpkin's been used.
Friends, the slack that we feel while we're fucking that pumpkin full of squirrels is nothing compared to the slack that you could be feeling just by staring at your dirty fingernails if you had true bob consciousness.
The fact is you are floating in a sea of bob pills right now.
There are bob pills.
Up to your dirt show, you've been choking to death on the pills of bob, friends.
And if only yours.
But the problem is you're too blind and deaf and taste numb to be able to feel those pills.
But, friends, what's in those pills is the same thing that's inside bob's head.
And it's the same thing that could be inside this pumpkin.
And, friends, I'm going to hand this pumpkin out to you.
Not right now.
I'm going to hold up the friends a little bit later.
In fact, I'm going to put it here.
Up, up, up.
Praise the pumpkin.
I'm not going to launch the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.
That could destroy the universe if we do it in the wrong way.
Praise the pumpkin.
Up, up, up.
Praise the pumpkin.
Two of the pumpkins.
Praise the pumpkin.
Now, when somebody really feels the spirit.
We give you permission, as holy men, to come up here and grab one of these two fruits.
And, well, do whatever comes natural with it.
If you want to launch it, launch it.
Now, the one thing I ask is keep in mind that this nice club, Euclid Tavern, has let us come in here to be perverted assholes.
And we don't want to mess up their facility.
Which is why we're here.

Which is why I have this sacred paper towel.
So, within limits, within reasonable limits, you're welcome to fuck the pumpkin.
Here, here's your mug.
Now, friends, as I said, 80 days.
We've got 80 more days until X day.
80 3D days, you might say.
Until the rapture, dear friends.
The rupture itself.
When the spaceships will line up at 7 o'clock a.m. July 5th this year.
The X's presences will line up in a huge line from north to south pole over the international date line in the middle of the Pacific Ocean at 7 a.m.
And they will remain hovering over the planet as the planet rotates beneath this great line of spaceships.
We in America will be able to sit and watch our planet.
And we will be able to see the X's and the X's on television as first the natives of Pago Pago are ruptured up.
The dues paying natives of Pago.
Then the Australians.
Then the Japanese subgeniuses.
Then across Russia and Europe.
And in each of those on television, we will see the dues paying subgeniuses, one in a thousand, suddenly disappear.
Hey, man, I thought this was all just kind of a funny joke.
I didn't think if there really is an X day.
That means there really is a conspiracy.
There really is a bomb.
And that might mean there really is a hell.
Alright, don't worry about the hell part too much, friends.
You'll cross that bridge when it comes to it.
Big funny joke, man.
But friends, you know, that will be a day of glory.
Of naked glory.
And I must say, but yeah.
Is there perhaps one unforgivable sin?
That would prevent you from being ruptured up into these egg vessels?
Is there a sin in the church of the subgenius?
Oh, there's plenty of sins.
We collect them.
We list them.
We try to discover new sins.
We're born with the old sins.
But is there one sin where you commit that sin and Bob's pissed off forever?
Pull the lever, down you go.
Is there one?
Yes, there is, friends.
And it is the simple sin of not bothering to send in a bomb.
And that's the sin of not bothering to send in that $30 membership and become a minister.
A dues-paying subgenius minister in this church.
Once again, sure, maybe it's just something for nothing.
Maybe it's just a bunch of snake oil.
Well, if that's the case, then maybe you learned an important lesson that you needed real bad.
But what if it's true?
Ah, yeah.
Ah, yeah.
What if it's true?
You know, because if it is true, friends, what will you get for your $30 besides eternal salvation?
You get your own spaceship, for one thing.
You get your own planet.
And you get your own universe, if that's what you want.
If all you want is a little cottage out in the woods, that's fine.
If you only want a couple of shopping malls or a whorehouse, that's fine.
But if you want, you can have your own do-it-yourself universe.
You can have the world.
And you can have it now.
You just have to be willing to be killing for Bob.
You have to be ready to break all the rules with the other side.
We want the world and we want it now.
Friends, what is the law?
What is the law?
To rock on all fours and grovel and snuffle in the dirt.
That is the law.
We are not men.
To spill blood.
To mate all willy-nilly every which way with everything that walks around us.
That is the law.
We are not men.
Break on through to the other side.
What is the law?
The law to place doves every day of our lives.
That is the law.
We are not men.
What is the law?
To find another yeti, male, female, or pet and fuck it until you have more little subgeniuses.
That is the law.
We are not men!

What is the law?
Cause we are not men.
We are not men in the cortisol suckers and diarrhea


We are not men.
We are devour.
The evil air.
Break on through to the other sideải

We might Mercury and the other side,
We want Venus and the Venus abscent.
And we want it now.
We want the Earth.
And we want it now.
Earth first.
We want Mars.
And we want it now.
We will take Mars.
We want Jupiter.
And we want it now.
We want Saturn.
And we want it now.
We want Jupiter.
And we want it now.
You thought that it sounded just as good as anything from the fancy studios at WCSB right?
It fools people. They don't know.
In fact I have people going, what kind of super computer do you use to put our slack together?
And I go, I make that sentence.
Oh, a Cyber Spaz 9000.
And they go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.
They always act like they know what I'm talking about, so they don't want it to look stupid.
Just you kids in a treehouse, and none of that high-tech stuff at all.
You know, I heard one time, it was a vicious rumor that you, those,
those you know that when you get Collins it's actually just somebody downstairs
with a one on being cans and a long stream actually the Collins are from
years and years ago from others that gene we just fake our you know my half
the mother world shooter generated I type that stuff I heard your voice voice
any voice you know we've got like phenomes or whatever you call them the
hormones for my own yours yeah my urine recorded we've got dr. how you know
puzzling evidence and Chaz Princess we and you just all the Papa Joe mom and
dr. legume all those characters are we have them recorded and I can pump those
out on a little keyboard I actually type the words and the computer speaks the
voices if they were in the studio and that's the way you and it pumps out
pheromones along with the signal so we have the right kind of see this much no
more not just everybody's radio but modern-day radios if you go listening on
any any turntable or
car
And that's why We Bharata

subliminal

remember squirrels by
Iจ�따
Reels group
he and
many
will or
Don't you, baby?
Oh, of course I do.
I remember all the squirrels.
From back on Earth.
Who, me?
When you were young.
Oh, yeah.
I remember the squirrels.
They weren't real squirrels.
They were squirrels on TV even then, baby.
Yeah, yeah.
Admit it.
You never touched a real squirrel, even when you were young on Earth, did you, baby?
How could they steal my nuts if they wasn't real?
Every day I had the same problem.
I'd wake up and some squirrels had stolen my nuts.
And I'd have to go out in the side yard and dig around and root around like a were-not-men
and try and see if I could.
And sometimes I'd find truffles.
And sometimes I'd climb up into the treehouse and wait for them to come down.
And you still never found your nuts, did you?
No, no.
I still ain't gotten them to speak of.
No.
Nutless wonder.
It's a wonder.
It's a wonder.
Plenty of cowboy day.
I was sitting up in that treehouse as a child.
It's a wonder.
Counting his squirrels that he didn't have and his nuts that had been stolen away.
But I could still procreate.
I didn't do it the normal way people did.
I just, well, any time I'd be institutionalized, I'd stare at the wall for a long time.
Maybe then one of Virgin Macarena County.
Or one of them eating vindaloo hats I used to wear.
And I would stare so hard.
And then copies would appear.
That's the way I did it.
The tiny little days would come spitting out, wouldn't they?
Yeah, like the whiskey fairies would dance around my legs and tell me songs and stuff.
Until they'd turn into a little puddle and you'd have to wipe them up before the nurse came.
Yeah, well, they were a little bit wet.
Did the nurse ever come in and catch you procreating days?
No, she never actually caught me.
But she knew something was up.
She'd see the puddles and she'd hear the little day voices.
She'd hear,
.
And they would be like dancing in soft laughter in the closet.
She knew something was going on.
Or maybe she just thought it was one of the weird tapes I make.
.
You never know when it might be just one of the weird tapes you make.
Yeah, and then you start rolling backwards.
How much of this is memory and how much of this is just some weird tape you make?
It's a rollout.
That's what they call it now currently.
A rollout.
In research.
Yeah, that's when they stick you real hard in that part of your brain and everything comes back like a videotape.
You can see everything that you haven't done.
How much did you pay for that back alley rollout, Dave?
Forty-five bucks.
I mean, it did feel like an eight penny nail.
What did you remember when they did that?
What other memories did that rollout bring?
I don't think I remember what it was.
Maybe it was dying.
I can't tell if I was going forward or backwards.
You know how it is.
Well, I know how it is.
This might be a rollout right now.
Are you sure that you don't have a tube in your brain causing a memory?
A memory of sitting in a radio station when actually you're just in a little tuna can in space on the way down to the territory?
And in truth, dear friends, Lonesome Cowboy Dave was, in fact, in a tuna can only remembering a false tape.
A taped memory of his very...
But now...
James Kochalka.
Twinkle, twinkle, Ringo Starr.
George and John and Paul.
I could be more famous-er than Redwoods are tall.
The Beatles came down in their spaceship.
And the whole world went apeshit.
Just be like the Beatles and let it be.
Be like the Beatles.
Let it be.
Twinkle, twinkle, Ringo Starr.
George and John and Paul.
I could be more famous-er than Adams are small.
The Beatles came down in their spaceship.
And the whole world got wasted.
Just be like the Beatles and let it be.
Be like the Beatles.
Let it be.
James Kochalka, superstar.
The pants are in the air.




The pants are up now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And, yes, dear friends, you can write to James Kochalka and see about getting his CD.
Here's the address.
Got that pencil ready?
James Kochalka.
Spell that however you please.
P.O. Box 8321.
That's P.O. Box 8321.
Burlington, Vermont.
05402.
Burlington, Vermont.
05402.
I've been to Burlington, Vermont.
I had to throw some...
I had to throw an Alamo full of drunken teenagers off of the stage just so I could quit preaching, friends.
That was the way it was.
I hate that.
We want it now.
We want Neptune and we want it now.
We want Uranus and we want it now.
We want Pluto and we want it now.
We want the sun and we want it now.
The 25-hour day.
We will enslave the sun.
We want the universe and we want it now.
Now?
Now!
Now!
We want the universe and we want it now.
We are, we are, we are, we are.
Well, at least in 80 days.
You can have it now.
If you're willing to spend that 30 bucks now, at least you'll have a...you'll be first in line practically.
I close my eyes and look at the inside of my eyelids.
Give me a focus.
Where am I now?
Where am I?
Where am I?
Open my eyes.
Oh, yeah, Mom.
Wait a minute.
I'm in a watery basement.
You don't like these memories, Dave?
No.
We can change them by stirring them around, unless this is really just one of your weird basement radio tapes and not a memory after all.
Well, do something with them, man.
I'm starting to want to...
Hey, look, I'm just a shipboard psychiatrist.
There's nothing I...I'm just a computer, Dave.
I'm a tool.
I'm one of your tools.
You control me.
You're a tool.
Why are you crying?
I'm just...I'm here to do therapy with you and so forth to keep you from cracking up completely.
I'm trying to keep from growing up.
Don't cry.
You did it again.
Look at the globules floating around.
Now how are you going to...turn the vacuum on, Dave.
You're puked again.
You're shining.
Zero G.
What can make them shiny like that?
I hate that.
Oh, man.
I bet you hate it, too.
And all the voices in your head probably love to see those globules of vomit floating around.
They're kind of pretty, actually.
Floating at zero gravity.
I'm going to do...I'm going to do the subgenius marriage ceremony.
Only everybody here has probably heard that same old, long, wonderful ceremony.
I'm just going to do the quick version of it.
Friends, find yourself a mate.
Just think of one.
If you have one nearby, grab it.
I've got mine.
And, uh, friends, if there are any gathered here today who object to having everyone in this room join together with whoever they want to be joined together with in holy matrimony, for better or for worse, but not for long, just hold your fucking peace because we don't want to be together.








We don't care.
And we're going to make this a short-duration marriage that will last only 24 hours.
That's the promise.
If only we could all test our marriages out when short-duration marriages start.
The lawyers would lose a lot of money.
If only we could sell short-duration divorces for as cheap as we give away the marriages, which is for free.
Friends, I'm going to marry you right now.
By the power invested in me as a holy man.
By J.R. Bob Doherty.
Don't try to fight me,уєn?
Does anybody want to do it?
No.
God, you just aren't going to let me be your pastor.
But I'm going to be.


You're a serving pastor and you can't have a man's sanctity.
But it kinda works.
The degree to which a Madame dear, if she's called a estoure with me, I think we're gonna focus on her family.
Do you think you care at this point?

I, I can aware very well but not in practice in my lifetime, and, and, and Ahí tampoco.
Well, you can tell them.

what we're going with is awesome stuff.
No, stop.
I wonder who's next.
In the name, Otis.
Otis.
In the name of Screamin' Jay Hawkins.
In the name of...
Wendy O. Williams.
In the name of Tammy Y. Neff.
I now pronounce all of us man, wife, fame,
man in car keys, wife and pet at home,
wife and dildo, man in right hand,
whatever the hell it is, you're all married now,
you can fuck with impunity, mom won't know,
and the law doesn't care, praise Bob.
Oh gosh, where's the squid?
Oh gosh.
I was just...

I'm gonna consummate my marriage up here, friends.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, praise Reverend Gordon Zola.
He brought the squid.
Friends, now.
This isn't the infant, this is just a larval squid.
This is actually, it's been stunned.
It's still alive, but it's, uh,
we've had it in the refrigerator.
This is a, for those of you who have,
you know, city kids,
Yankees, no offense,
for those of you who've never,
ever known the pleasures of life
out in the small towns,
in the woods and fields, the cattle ranches,
concentration camps,
this animal is known as a prairie squid.
You'll notice that it's got a sort of a penis-like appendage on the top,
and a little, almost like a vagina here in the, in the middle.
And you know, there's been many a subgenius lad and lass
who's gone out into the field
when Ma and Paul were busy going to church,
covered their laps with honey or molasses or something,
laid and started honking on their squid call,
laid back there in the grass,
waiting for that fecund, mighty little cephalopod,
that little mollusk, to come crawling up
and join you in sacred matrimony, holy love,
with this beautiful little animal.
Nowadays, most people, most people, if they even know what a prairie squid is,
they don't know what a prairie squid is.
They see him at the supermarket, dead, shaved, wrapped up in cellophane,
in the freezer, freezer compartment.
But friends, Bob Dobbs himself had a vision.
He had a vision that someday,
someday the skies would break open,
Jehovah One would have mercy on the human race,
and literally, prairie squid would rain from the sky.
Prairie squid, falling from the sky,
83-D squid, man, they get me so high,
83-D squid, now they're falling, oh no,
83-D squid, I'm gonna hit his home.
Oh, there's nothing like a rain in prairie squid.
We pulled off to the side,
we just knew they wanted to ride,
the sweetest squid you will ever know.
Blow you right through the door,
they'll blow you right through the hard door.
83-D squid, falling from the sky,
83-D squid, man, they get me so high,
83-D squid, well, they're falling, oh no,
83-D squid, I've got a tentacle.
Oh no! There's two!
Oh, there's a tentacle!
There's a tentacle!
There's a tentacle!
Hey, oh, a tentacle's a tentacle!
Oh my God, oh, oh, look at this!
It's little suction cups,
boy, those peel,
oh, first one to peel the suction cups off.
Oh, I like it so much.
Uh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
So, if you're ever out in your life,
don't think you have to run and hide
before you see some hairy people,
isn't that husband?


Anyny touch that creepy pink snow,
fallin' down, oh no!
Hairy pink snow fallin' down from the sky.
Oh, is that slipste writing?
Just fall on over the hollow inside.
83-D squids, from the sky,
83-D squid, man, they got me so high,
83D Squid, where the corns alone, 83D Squid, that's right, the Lord!
83D Squid fell from the sky in front of my car while I was driving down the I-9.
I pulled over, I opened my car door, but they were blowing my mind through the car door.
Praise to all the Perry Squids.
Ah, yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Ah!
Whoa!
Well, that's, there's somebody who knows somebody.
You notice I didn't mention anything about de-beaking the Perry Squid.
I like to see how many people go and try to have their way with that Perry Squid.
Sans de-beaking.
Oh, yeah.
I had my head up your ass.
The worms crawl through my brain, into your colon, on up through your throat.
Instead of no, I'll throw the one on your thug and through your mouth, on up into your head.
Friends, time is running out.
PM��딱
Until what?
Jason SEVENTINK.
Imagine getting anything you ever wanted internet.
Imagine getting anything you ever wanted in your wildest dreams.
Anything pretty wild, I know.
Anything you ever wanted for only $30!
kän그� במץ Grace.
Nhơi, Oakmari.
No.
Regina meek miner.
Imagine losing everything you ever wanted and ever had because you weren't sure you wanted to spend that $30.
Friends, the signs of the end times are nigh.
The end is indeed nigh.
Signs, there are signs in the heavens and signs in the earth.
Blood bunches up from the earth.
There are lights in the sky rebuking thee, my friends.
And if you think he's kidding, he's not.
Epic funny joke.
Have you been reading the book of Revelation lately, friends?
Have you been reading the book of the subgenius?
Have you been reading Revelation X?
Well, it's all there.
The signs are written there and you can read about them in the plain viewer this morning.
You can hear them on the radio every morning.
You can hear them talking about the signs of the end times.
And friends, you can read in your Bible, you can read in your book of the subgenius.
The seven seals shall rise up from the arctic ocean.
Barking and juggling and balancing a giant surface ball on the end of their noses.
Playing happy birthday to you on little bicycle horns.
The seven seals are coming.
And the seven fires are coming.
And the oils and bowls shall be emptying upon the earth.
The vials full of plague and viruses.
And friends, they've got some pretty cool viruses in store for you.
They've got some viruses that you'd probably pay 20% interest extra just to get.
There's some cool viruses and plagues on the way, friends.
For those of you who are saved.
Oh, for those who decided to die.
Oh, for those who decided to die.

Oh, for those who decided to die.
I like that Bob stuff.
I thought it was pretty funny, but not funny worth $30.
Oh, you will think it real funny, friends, when God's wine press crushes out the grapes of wrath.
And the blood of your sins flows out.
And God, or Jehovah One, takes the shoes off your sandals and starts squishing on that big fat full of dead human souls and bodies.
Squishing the blood of his wine press in between his toes just because it feels good.
And you won't think it's so funny when a giant can opener comes down and pries open the top of the globe and scoops out all the magma so that the earth freezes.
Except for the volcanoes that make it heat up to death.
And you won't think it's so funny when the great scouring pad and deep sea water.
And the dishwashing liquid comes to scour the highways of all the cars.
And my friends, you won't think it's so funny when the giant orange juice squeezer puts the heads of all the people on earth inside of it and squeezes their ill-begotten conspiracy-dude thoughts out into a nice little shot glass.
And some elder god can tip back just for a nightcap some night.
Oh, you'll think it's real fucking funny.
When a giant mop from outer space sweeps away the cities.
And when a great comet, a comet shall appear in the sky.
A comet toilet bowl cleanser will pour its hydrochloric acid down into the sinks and toilet bowls of your very mind.
Into your skull to wipe out the sin and the disgusting muddy crumbling lack of faith they've found.
You won't think it's so funny.
When you're thrown into the giant washing machine of Gabbro, France.
You won't think it's so funny when a giant vacuum cleaner comes down from outer space and sucks up all the cities of America.
America the unrepentant.
If America is too blind to see the truth of Bob, then let us finish ripping its eyes out.
Or at least pull its left eye out so you can turn it around and point it at the right eye.
Just long enough for it to look at its own eyes.
Because my friend, what else are you gonna do?
Are you gonna hide from God?
You can't hide from God, cause he's bigger than you are.
He's bigger than the whole universe. He's bigger than all infinity.
You can't hide from Bob Dogg, because he's stupider than you are.
You can't hide from Bob, because his face has been videographed and put up with more places than yours have.
You can't hide from God, cause he's bigger than you are.
You can't run, as J.R. Hypersleet said.
You can't run from your own legs, cause not much of your use is to run away from a leg.
How are you gonna run from your own legs? You can't run from your own legs.
You can't hide from God, cause he's bigger than you.
You can't think about your own brain.
Cause it's what's doing the thinking to think about it with.
How are you gonna think about your own brain?
You gonna, like, just put a computer in there and say, okay, reboot, now think about my brain?
You can't wash water, it's already the wettest thing there is.
You can't clean soap, it's already the cleanest thing there is.
You can't swallow your own throat, you can't digest your own stomach, you can't pee your own dick.
It's too big to go through that little hole, mine is anyway.
You can't pee your own dick, you can't swallow your own throat, you can't digest your own stomach.
You can't run from your own legs.
You can't hide from God, cause he's bigger than you, bigger than all infinity.
You can't hide from Bob, cause he's stupider than you are.
Huh, how many somebody my legs on fire pulled a lever down you go?
She ain't got no legs.
Praise J.R.
You can't rip off your own chain, cause he's what's already been ripping you off to begin with.
But friends, you know earlier I said there was only one unforgivable sin, and that was the sin of not sending in your $30.
Actually there's another unforgivable sin, and that's the sin of believing in Bob and nothing else.
Bob is not here to be your one true personal savior.
Bob Dobbs, that man J.R. Bob Dobbs, is here to be a short-term, personal savior.
He does not want more religious news.
He does not want more nuts in this world.
He does not want more curts and crackpots who cannot think for themselves,
leaning on him like a crutch.
If we wanted it to be a fan club, we would have called it the crutch of the genius,
not the goddamn church of the fucking sub-genius.
It ain't the intelligence that counts, it's the sense, God damn it.
Common sense, sense of humor, and of course dollars and a cent.
Now friends, I cannot tell you, and I cannot make it clear enough to you,
how important the concept of a short-duration personal savior is.
If Bob ain't giving you slack, kill Bob and find another personal savior.
It can be any goddamn thing you want it to be, but there's a personal savior for me right now.
A beautiful personal savior.
This is my personal savior for right now, a $1 bill.
But lest I become completely innocent.
I'm addicted to it.
Well, I'll do the same thing as Bob.
Friends, as long as the smoke from this dollar bill is still rising up to heaven,
the invisible spice monsters who really are up there know there's still something down here on earth worth saving.
Friends, you do have to make your own slack.
You make your own slack.
Bob will not make it for you.
Bob is not the answer, and neither is anything else.
Do you understand how important it is that you learn to think for yourself?
But only Bob can show you how.
Question authority.
Question authority.
Or else.
Praise Bob.
Or else.
But we're leaving the nest now, and as we conform to the sex goddesses,
we won't think about earths of stupid jobs and humans and pollution.
No, we'll think of the comic books, the fast food stores, the glorious forests and cities, and the...
...of passing time!
People don't have any power within them.
Nobody will think to themselves more mature and clever through the series.
No.
Especially those of us that have much experience in the space and in the solar system.
The behavior, the behaviour, the type of person that we want toaghve to go, iscé gal Bien다고.
All connected, but of course in another world.
Blo wus impeachment
Go to sleep and dream of pleasure ships from high above on July 5th this year.
Go to sleep and dream of twilight, my love of eyes, a dream so far back now.
Sex goddesses and squids shall ride your way.
The way of the moon keeps you safe until next day.
Sex goddesses and squids shall ride your way.
The smiling faces bow.
The way of the moon keeps you safe until next day.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
By counting sheepfolds, you will follow rules into the hell they build.
Go to sleep and dream of times when we will be to sing and praise the name of the Father.
Praise God.
God bless you all.
Amen.
