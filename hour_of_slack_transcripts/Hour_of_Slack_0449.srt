1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
I think...

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,360
I think we got it.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,680
I think we got it.

4
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,120
I think we got it.

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,840
I think she's a brawn.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,200
I think...

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,940
I think...

8
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,420
I think...

9
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:14,620
I think...

10
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,160
I think...

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,760
I think...

12
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,540
I think...

13
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,700
Before the sermon,

14
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,560
a message concerning

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,680
for Bob-Bots,

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,400
living avatars,

17
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,760
in seconds.

18
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,800
You have to

19
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,440
love Bob.

20
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,120
He loves you, but

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,400
you love Bob.

22
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,640
You have to.

23
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,420
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

24
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,180
He'll kill you.

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,120
He'll rob you out.

26
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,500
And I guess that was a big deal back in them days.

27
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,340
Back in them days.

28
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,340
Go back in them day.

29
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,080
Go back in them day.

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,980
We're now deep inside the brain cavity of Doug Smith.

31
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,120
As you can see all around you,

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,540
there are sparky-

33
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,100
There's a short circuit.

34
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,860
...seem to have recovered.

35
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,140
Now, there are sparking energy,

36
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,660
thoughts all around us.

37
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,120
Far more than the normal human brain.

38
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:43,780
But as we know, another misfire, we know Doug Smith is not a normal human.

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,060
No, and here inside the brain of Doug Smith, we can observe some of the differences that

40
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,040
make this man a unique leader among men.

41
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,780
Over here is the main printout.

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,220
This is the sub-channel of Global Women's Week.

43
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,600
I run it like Uncle Graze Bob.

44
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,260
To be a good man.

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,120
Turn on the machine.

46
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,960
This is three.

47
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,560
This is three.

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,860
And this is three.

49
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,280


50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,280


51
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,800
And this is a new one.

52
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,980
Oh, no, it's not.

53
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,360
But it is a new one.

54
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,840
It is the...

55
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,840
It's the hippie redneck nerds that hate everybody's show.

56
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,700
That's what kind of a show it is.

57
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,360
It is dark now.

58
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,380
And if you want to see the real news, come and see Doug Smith.

59
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:53,540
I've got a little piece of the story here.

60
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:53,600
And I'm going to tell you a story that I've written a couple of times.

61
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:53,600


62
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:53,600


63
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:53,600


64
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:53,620
This is the...

65
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:53,620


66
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,020
This is the...

67
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,020


68
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,020


69
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,020


70
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,020


71
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,020


72
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,020


73
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,320
As I sit here and watch the mist rise from the bottom of the earth, a new light shines

74
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,540
upon this rock where I was born.

75
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:23,540
I watch myself step out and find a new beginning.

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:38,160
Ah yes, dear friends, and that new beginning, that new light is

77
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,520
here.

78
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:48,520
Partly this new album in progress by the Southland Corporation, the new band with

79
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,180
Jayner Hyperkleets in Little Rock, Arkansas.

80
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,340
Baba, Baba doesn't live here.

81
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,660
Anymore.

82
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,360
Baba, Baba...

83
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,900
Baba doesn't live here anymore

84
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,740
Baba doesn't live here anymore

85
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,440
Baba doesn't live here anymore

86
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,360
My little tiny little creature of the planet

87
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,140
Because you are very different

88
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,280
I can tell you have some special needs

89
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,780
Baba!

90
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Baba!

91
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,700
Sometimes I can tell that you want to be my little friend

92
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,260
Baba!

93
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,480
Alright, if you can tell me something that I can learn for someone like yourself

94
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,140
Because you're

95
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,340
Baba!

96
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,340
Baba!

97
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,500
Baba!

98
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,260
I thought I could look into my mind

99
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,620
And find some way I can communicate with other people like my kind

100
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,260
That's...

101
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,160
I have some things I can think about sometimes when I'm sitting here

102
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,420
Because I'm a very special person

103
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,140
I'm...

104
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,480
Baba!

105
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,220
Baba!

106
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,720
Baba!

107
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,340
Baba!

108
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:33,800
Baba!

109
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,060


110
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,340
Baba!

111
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:34,580


112
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:34,800
Baba!

113
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,000
Baba!

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,140
Baba!

115
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,200
Baba!

116
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,200


117
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,360
Baba!

118
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,380
Baba!

119
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,580
Babe!

120
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,020


121
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,680
Baba!

122
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:47,880


123
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,440
Baba!

124
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,960
Baba!

125
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,020


126
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,060


127
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,060


128
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,380
And now...

129
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,080
The Soft Meer.

130
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,300
I...

131
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,180
I can't stand...

132
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,120
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to

133
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,020
is specially designed only to be played on radio station...

134
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,100
Right here.

135
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,380
And only in the city of...

136
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:29,900
This place.

137
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,980
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show,

138
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,960
the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials

139
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,680
in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled during broadcast.

140
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,060
Thank you.

141
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,840
Thank you.

142
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,900
Thank you.

143
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:49,700
Thank you.

144
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,900
Thank you.

145
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,040
Thank you.

146
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,640
Thank you.

147
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,260
It's summertime here in Dallas, Texas, yes.

148
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,420
We had to turn the air conditioning off, you know, in order to do this show.

149
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,840
So it's hot.

150
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,580
It's really hot.

151
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,260
And it's the year of the itch, it seems.

152
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,880
These days, you're the jiggers.

153
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:33,500
I mean, it's that season when things hurt you.

154
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,520
The mosquitoes, the zits, both blackheads and whiteheads,

155
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:49,240
the fleas, the poison ivy, the sunburn, the dry skin,

156
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:56,940
the allergies, the hives, the scabs, the nicoderm patches,

157
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:05,060
the cutaneous discoid lupus, the heat rash, the ringworm,

158
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:12,740
the eczema, the psoriasis, the diaper rash, the mites,

159
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,400
the body lice, the head lice, the bed bugs, the scabies,

160
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,920
the crab lice, the impetigo.

161
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:26,760
The hemorrhoids, the yeast infections, the poison oak,

162
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:33,200
the athlete's foot, the pinworms, the chicken pox,

163
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,380
the antabuse reaction, and worst of all,

164
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,020
the itch inside your ear that nothing can reach.

165
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,060
And the only way you can scratch that itch inside your ear

166
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,740
is to go...

167
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,760
And, uh, dear friends, uh, your host here with the nerve bumps,

168
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,500
the red bump syndrome, the king of scurf himself,

169
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,040
your host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang,

170
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,540
is, uh, so, so itchy.

171
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,460
But yet, but yet, dear friends, uh, it is, after all, a show of hope.

172
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:18,860
Yes.

173
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,180
Let's get some hopeful sort of music on in the background here.

174
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,440
Eh?

175
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,580
There we go.

176
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,940
Eh, there we go.

177
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,500
See, we can get this stuff to work.

178
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,840
Eh, eh.

179
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,080
Uh, thanks to the, uh, thanks to the listeners

180
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,140
in, uh, many, many different towns.

181
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,260
Those who donated, dear friends,

182
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,020
who donated either equipment or money to help us out

183
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,840
in our time of need.

184
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,080
And, uh, oh, we do have some...

185
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,160
Eh, some needs.

186
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,840
Oh, by the way, before I forget,

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,200
this music in the background is, uh,

188
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,620
by our good friend, uh, Dr. Kyle Cossop

189
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,500
and, uh, his band, uh, Severe Tire Damage.

190
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,880
Little piece in the background here called Psycho Bebop.

191
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,780
But I wanted to take this, uh, before we get on with the show,

192
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,220
which in this case is a...

193
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,200
Well, it's a Lonesome Cowboy Dave

194
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,220
version of...

195
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,320
Versus Janer type of show.

196
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,140
Uh, and also in this show,

197
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,440
we'll begin our Kooks profile series.

198
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,780
All taken from, uh, Donna Causey's new book, Kooks.

199
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:39,460
But first, I have to thank, uh, the, the donators.

200
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,420
And because this is gonna be a show of hope,

201
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,820
and it's, it's thanks to those who helped us out.

202
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,960
I've got a, a nice, uh, uh, TX,

203
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,360
six track here, uh, in conjunction with the Radio Shack deck.

204
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,140
Well, I could mix, I could be mixing eight things at once.

205
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,480
Now, I'm not gonna do that to you.

206
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,560
Don't you worry.

207
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,400
But, uh, I could.

208
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,220
And that's, we have to have that option, you know?

209
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,740
I gotta be able to have all the, what, the old beat-up turntable,

210
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
the destroyed CD player, everything.

211
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,500
And, uh, and the new, the new...

212
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,380
Oh, I just realized, I got another, another, uh...

213
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Uh, another name to add here for our...

214
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,200


215
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:19,840
New tape deck.

216
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,520
Okay, here's, here's the donators that I must thank on the air.

217
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,140
Reverend Gary Ingram.

218
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,240
The great, the beyond great, the, the...

219
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,280
The Jim Hoffwood.

220
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,960
The Dave Santovan.

221
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,300
I hope that I'm pronouncing that name right.

222
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,660
Dave Santovan.

223
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,040
There in the, or Santovine.

224
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,200
Uh, he's...

225
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,740
He's a saint of Veen.

226
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:59,260
Uh, Bob Payne, who has actually reduced our Bob Payne by quite a bit.

227
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,040
The fine Nathan Vincent of Dallas, who helped us out so much.

228
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,500
The great Reverend Zafod Rakitansky.

229
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,280
Uh, yes, he is a relation.

230
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,480
Uh, the anonymous 7177.

231
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,340
111st Street.

232
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,920
But I better not tell you what town it's in.

233
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,600
Uh, but we, we do appreciate.

234
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,020
Uh, and, and, uh, Reverend Mike Cole.

235
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,740
Uh, there in WCSB in Cleveland.

236
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,120
And, uh, uh, friends.

237
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,560
You know, who, whoever else helps us out in between then and now.

238
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,100
Uh, we hope to present to you proof tonight.

239
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,240
Uh, that it, it does indeed make a difference.

240
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,300
And, uh,

241
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,200
I hope to present to you proof tonight.

242
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,200


243
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,200


244
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,200


245
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:59,100
But before we go even any further than that, there's one other thing that I think you have to know first.

246
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,380
Hello, everyone.

247
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,820
This is Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

248
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,620
For Brain Rot Radio Theater here on ESO Radio in Cleveland on WCSB.

249
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,840
And I'd like to speak to you tonight about how I found Bob.

250
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,460
Tonight's moist sermonette is entitled simply, How I Found Bob.

251
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:41,260
And not the position I found him in, bent over a lightning struck stump brain in Arabic.

252
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,680
No, I found him in a spiritual sense.

253
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,180
I found him on a slack way wall in Chinatown.

254
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,020
But it was not the hate.

255
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:56,900
Poisoned, idiot-faced, graphic vestal wound, which I found him in the spiritual sense.

256
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,480
I found him in Cleveland, the shoreway.

257
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:08,100
In the twisted grimaces of Russians driving by in 78 Chryslers, masturbating and arguing, gesturing wildly.

258
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,560
I found him in a bad onion breath in a bodega in New York.

259
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,680
In a rancid po-boy in New Orleans.

260
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,140
So, you see, I truly found him.

261
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,380
In a spiritual sense.

262
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,320
The sixth sense, if you will.

263
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,620
And the seventh, performing seal in the zoo, if you won't.

264
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,560
And only those with ears who may hear their own ears have ears to hear what their own ears have.

265
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,340
And I say to them, I have been called a moron, moron, more than once.

266
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,000
I've been called a fool.

267
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,880
But I know in my heart what I found.

268
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,560
Phony letters indeed.

269
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
There are resonances.

270
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,200
There are phrases in the alphabet which only Bob can pronounce.

271
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,760
And these are startling, fearful letters.

272
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,980
And they don't pronounce themselves dead or ended with Z.

273
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,100
But they have the power to make you commit treason.

274
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,280
To inspire you to acts of heroic ugliness and abstruse martyrdom.

275
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,200
But only Bob knows the keys.

276
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,940
Bob called you on the psychic hotline.

277
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,240
And as you know, in any professional life,

278
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,580
in any...

279
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:17,960
In any...

280
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,360
There are good and bad psychics.

281
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,480
Hi, Stephanie.

282
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,780
I see you coming into your life now in the...

283
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,560
But will I ever go to the bathroom again?

284
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:36,000
The psychic hotline of Bob and the psychic salmon spread opened doors for me.

285
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,440
Why not you?

286
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,740
There are so many little fat cells in the life of any tumorous macro-organism.

287
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,100
Twice a day, the captains of the corner area...

288
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,920
I've heard voices.

289
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,120
How it happens.

290
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,240
We're still positive.

291
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,740
Messages from the stale fries and handy-packed ketchup stick.

292
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,600
Don't carminate or change your mind.

293
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,780
Stop working.

294
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,340
Give up your job.

295
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,260
You'll never get another chance to be a troubleshooter.

296
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,640
Or a headcat, for that matter.

297
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,760
I see you will be doing something on the stage in the future.

298
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,320
Maybe...

299
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,340
Behind a chicken coop, perhaps in this lifetime.

300
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,680
But I predict that this will make a lot of people...

301
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,740
If you can call them that...

302
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,520
Very, very...

303
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,460
Very happy.

304
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,140
Hear that sizzling sound?

305
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,120
That's...

306
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,040
That's my...

307
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,020
Baby angst.

308
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,900
Nauseous to be.

309
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,900
I'm much more depressed now than I ever was,

310
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,540
thanks to that hateful grimace on that slack-away wall.

311
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,180
Give me some article of your personality.

312
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,760
That's right.

313
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,540
A bag of vomit.

314
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,100
A phony eyeball in the glass.

315
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,680
A flying in an ice cube.

316
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,380
A plastic doggy do-do-will-do.

317
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,280
Anything will do.

318
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,040
Just an article to hold.

319
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,740
I am getting a feeling now.

320
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,780
I am getting a feeling now.

321
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,340
Of Bob as a hot, spicy, southwestern chili kind of guy.

322
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,520
Weird.

323
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,740
Because when I thought of the ham fest, I knew he would be there.

324
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,520
I'm getting messages now from...

325
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,060
All the diseased recipe.

326
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,840
Let's watch.

327
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,060
That feels so good.

328
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,440
Call the psychic hotline and...

329
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,540
And send the pants back.

330
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,960
Spray it on your bald spot.

331
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,340
An eight-and-a-half-foot jam sauce.

332
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,240
Ten-foot sandwich.

333
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,280
A deep-groove fasting belt and hamster holster

334
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,140
with wide-rimmed individually-squat square pendant

335
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,380
of the living fun god-da-da-ba-ba-da.

336
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,420
Da-da-bull.

337
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,480
It won't be long.

338
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,440
But I won't be attending.

339
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,200
I won't be there.

340
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,060
No Calumet City blues for me.

341
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,480
No Missouri mud flat plains rising the distance

342
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,280
or prairie dogs mushing up the feet of the little children.

343
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,940
Which I specifically, scientifically despoiled

344
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,100
in the name of Bob Dobbs in my errant dreams.

345
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,260
We all put on so many...

346
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:17,940
Masks.

347
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,720
And so many different soiled lingeries.

348
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,140
Imagine if your hair could look like this.

349
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,220
Well, it can.

350
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,820
Now if the world were truly your brooding, breeding,

351
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,620
brooding beauty playground.

352
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,200
But the hammy butt, the virgin of Guadalcanal wept,

353
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,540
the angels wept,

354
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,240
in Westro Senora de los...

355
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,040
De los 20 Terres.

356
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,660
En...

357
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,160
Es...

358
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,260
Pero para ti que...

359
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,060
Usted no vive con un higgy no más.

360
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,920
Tu madre y tu padre están muy triste.

361
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,140
Y abuela Laura is ahora completamente loco.

362
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,240
Pero mientras toda la oscuridad...

363
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,800
Tenemos esta esperanza que...

364
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,520
Hijo, ven a casa y...

365
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,140
Sincerely, your sterilized mother.

366
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,660
Another psychic message.

367
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,640
And finally, in concluding this moist sermonette,

368
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,900
I would like to say that the time you take

369
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:28,460
in reexamining each and every little layered word,

370
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,940
bringing deep, crunchy fish from the subconscious

371
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,620
to your plate so that you may eat.

372
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,820
Remember that Bob Dobbs worked on six days

373
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,600
and then the seventh he was a loafer.

374
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,440
And he gave fish so that you might eat and bite it.

375
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,080
The End

376
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,020
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

377
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,360
Angela Smith ESO Radio

378
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,640
and it is a beautiful thing.

379
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,840
I have to thank once again with Grand Funk Railroad.

380
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,940
And how heavy this is.

381
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,140
The grand cause of heavy metal.

382
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,500
I must once again thank Gary Ingram, Jim Hopwood,

383
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,140
and he would have us...

384
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:52,640
hopping, I'll tell you. Dave Santofin, Bob Payne, Nathan Vincent, 717 17th Street, Mike

385
00:22:52,640 --> 00:23:01,000
Cole, and the Lonesome Cowboy Dave. And coming up, Janger Hypercleeps and Sterno Keycaver,

386
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:08,500
Sterno Docs, with a new tape that's sort of like the Beatles getting back together again,

387
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,520
as it turns out. They were, actually, they were sitting around in Little Rock in this

388
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:25,440
a young Reverend Andrew of the Ogre Network came to visit them, and they just, somehow

389
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:37,040
they reacted to the presence of that youthful subgenius fan in the, it's the Beatles getting

390
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,920
back together again. Here it is.

391
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,400
But, but can't you see what's driving him into this cult in the first place? I don't

392
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,600
know if it was the Palmer head, or the Trevino head, or the Sam Snead head he's been smoking.

393
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,380
But Ben, can't you see it's, it's not the head at all? Well, I don't know, it just,

394
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,980
it makes me mad, ma'am. It, it makes me pee. I know. Well, there was eight boys in Immokalee,

395
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:14,740
Florida. They were theorizing about the effect of insecticides on their, their bell pepper

396
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,320
crop.

397
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,660
What is the 12th one?

398
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,480
But Bob came over, just in the nick of time, and then...

399
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,880
Well, you see, Bob just took that pipe into his mouth, and he took down the

400
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,100
prop for a while, and he sat there looking at them, and he said...

401
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,300
I have to rectify the situation.

402
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,440
But how are you going to smoke their soul, he said. He quoted, he quoted thusly,

403
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:40,160
O yea, verily, ye unto ye, the smiling pink false prophets. And then Jaynor spake thusly...

404
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,500
A prayer to Bob, be speaking, O Bob, please, I humbly, be speaking, O Bob, please,

405
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:45,500


406
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:52,840
piously grant, request that ye, in your righteousness, might grant mine humble request that I might

407
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,040
be allowed to wield infinite power over all other living...

408
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,200
And suddenly, Prince Yesoplavsky burst in upon the scene. Rasputin was eating the poisoned

409
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:11,120
cakes. O yea, the poison was imbued upon the wine. It had been dissolved, but yet it was

410
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,480
weak. The arsenic had lost all its power. The czar, we know, had been so much more powerful

411
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:15,480


412
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:15,480


413
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:21,140
than he had yet lived. But how are we to find this out? Tune in next time. Same bad time,

414
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,020
same bad channel.

415
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,500
Craigorfrans said, then that means I must kill you. Then your mother was the

416
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:34,360
czar's great aunt, which means that you were the aborted fetus of Adolf Hitler and not

417
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,460
Ava Braun, but Ava Braun's sister.

418
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:44,100
And in 1898, the protoplastic foot covering factory was founded in Moscow. And yea, verily,

419
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,700
they said...

420
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:50,980
If you'd like to see the real thing, you can fly across the railroad tracks, across

421
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,040
the railroad tracks to the hamburger store.

422
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,000
But don't forget the Stompenboot, who was suddenly...

423
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,520
Next is the hamburger store.

424
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:03,920
Finally...

425
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,620
Enough said. Enough said. Said, said, said. Said, said, said.

426
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,820
But I probably...

427
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,660
Oh, you thought you're going to do some acid and listen to us?

428
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,160
of genius tape, huh?

429
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:16,980
Well.

430
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,240
Thought he was going to hang a damn

431
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,680
pack up his ass.

432
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,520
I didn't know where that pack was.

433
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,860
But Gaprobe friend said.

434
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,480
I'm saying that you're from

435
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,420
ABC Electrical. Wherever you go,

436
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,760
defects are going, too.

437
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,640
If you're defective while you're going,

438
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,620
it can be very, very implausible.

439
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,960
Wherever you go. Or painful.

440
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,760
Sometimes it's colostomic,

441
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,560
which is like catastrophic in an imploding sense.

442
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,480
Colostomy?

443
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,060
That's classic.

444
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,680
That's colossal cold and imploding.

445
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,080
Yes, it does have a rather

446
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,100
yuck quality.

447
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,940
It does have a little ring of the thing, doesn't it?

448
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,940
It has a little twang of dang.

449
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,960
It's reeks of...

450
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,980
Well, let's turn

451
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,220
to another

452
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:03,900
concept.

453
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,820
If you have another concept.

454
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,820
Anyway, keep up the good work and remember.

455
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,700
Gaprobe friend said.

456
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,060
I'm from ABC Electrical.

457
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:12,800
I'm saying that you're from ABC Electrical.

458
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,120
And I'm saying that you're from ABC Electrical.

459
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,480
Yeah, I think there's a little bit of Russian mixed in there.

460
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,400
I certainly hope so.

461
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,800
I was not at Auschwitz.

462
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,980
I did not perform the experiments on the twins.

463
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,420
They danced on me.

464
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,220
I beg your pardon?

465
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,620
The twins. They were my dance partners.

466
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,340
Really, Dan?

467
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,180
Yeah, man.

468
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:32,960
That's all right.

469
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,780
Excuse me.

470
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,360
I'm sorry.

471
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,120
Are you trying to tell me you're in some sort of sealed vesicle

472
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,500
where phlegm floats around in the air as if it were like

473
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,460
tiny little snakes corrupting our brains?

474
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:46,880
Exactly.

475
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,180
Oh, man.

476
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,160
Once those snakes crawl in, they can't come out.

477
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,580
I've had...

478
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,340
Our parents are to blame for that.

479
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,160
Well, our parents are to blame.

480
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,860
Who else said it better than your own self when you just said it

481
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,480
just right in there?

482
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,600
I'm sorry.

483
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,300
Well, you don't have to apologize for saying the truth.

484
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,320
Yes, I do.

485
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:03,980
We're being watched.

486
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:04,980
Okay.

487
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, then apologize for all of us here, too.

488
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:07,540
Thank you.

489
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,220
Okay.

490
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,520
Thank you.

491
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,540
Now, I just wanted to say that when the corrupting snakes come into the brain of any vital organ,

492
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,480
asthma, ismism, or any other organ, it's not just the brain.

493
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:14,700
It's the brain.

494
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,480
It's the organism, as it is.

495
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,080
Right?

496
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,940
Why do you keep tittering in my direction?

497
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,900
I could see if there was a nipple at the end of it or something else, but this is nothing

498
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,680
more than explosion...

499
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,140
Oh, thank God for small favors.

500
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,840
Anyway, from our progalactic point of view, we think that it's very important to understand

501
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,900
that understanding is very important.

502
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,520
I'm glad you're not cyclical in your talk.

503
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,780
I'm glad you're not one of those people who just talks around in big, fat, stinking like

504
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,060
Indian wagon train circles.

505
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,640
You're welcome.

506
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,640
Oh, well, think nothing of it, you cynical boob.

507
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,660
What am I saying? No, I think you're actually a caller.

508
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,080
I beg your pardon?

509
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,920
I think you're actually a caller, aren't you?

510
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,940
Well, actually, I think you're a caller.

511
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,960
You mean this is not a tape loop?

512
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,780
I thought the voices were talking.

513
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,600
I thought we had a tape loop going the whole time.

514
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,980
Oh, I thought the little thing in my...

515
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,320
I hate using control like that.

516
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:06,900
Oh, yeah.

517
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,160
So this guy's real then, right?

518
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:09,920
Yeah.

519
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,740
Oh, I thought I was hallucinating.

520
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,360
Oh, great. This is great.

521
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,140
Then I've been interacting with another, well, in your case being.

522
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:18,840
I don't want to make my voice do that.

523
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,100
How do you make your voice do that?

524
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,920
Well, I think what you do is you just...

525
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,160
A little testicular spandex always helps.

526
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,760
It kind of, like, brings things down into a narrow focus.

527
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:32,820
Ah.

528
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,900
Now, that's what I like to hear.

529
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,300
Class 12.

530
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,720
Somebody said...

531
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,700
Submolecularly expanding and contracting like molten lava from...

532
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,820
Boobla.

533
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:47,980
Boobla.

534
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,100
Boobla.

535
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,220
Boobalo.

536
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,380
Boobala and boychick.

537
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,820
Boobalo.

538
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,540
Boobalo.

539
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,380
The old guys in the neighborhood used to say in Yiddish, they'd say,

540
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,920
boychick and boobala.

541
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:04,760
And the guy they called Boobala had a huge wart in the middle of his forehead.

542
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:11,300
And he used to argue vociferously about the most inane, absolutely absurd,

543
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,520
non-sequitur, totally stupid, psychical,

544
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:15,880
mean,

545
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,880
actions and action morons you could imagine.

546
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,880
Just back and forth,

547
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,400
yammy-yammering about this and that,

548
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,300
as if it all made a hell of a lot of sense.

549
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
And believe me,

550
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,280
to some of us down at the old,

551
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,820
the arm pit lunch diner,

552
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,600
the counter was always greasy and stained from his remarks.

553
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,580
He couldn't let up for a minute,

554
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,100
and therefore,

555
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,220
he spilled his ketchup.

556
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,580
He couldn't let up for a minute,

557
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:38,840
therefore,

558
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,120
the coffee hit the table as it drew,

559
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,240
and he pulled from his mouth as he splattered it endlessly skyward,

560
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,580
screaming these epithets over and over again.

561
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,700
Oh, boy, those were the days.

562
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,680
I can't remember anything about it right now.

563
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,500
Oh, I just, I just trespassed in that teeny tiny little zone where no one goes,

564
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,460
where you're not permitted to be.

565
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,360
That little teeny barbed wire unit,

566
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,520
that little mapped off area that everybody says is taboo-boo.

567
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,720
Well, I'm going there, pal.

568
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,600
I'm going there on a big, fat old jammin' wind surfer.

569
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,820
Surfer, surfer, surfer.

570
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,500
I'm going in a motorboat with all my friends.

571
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:26,080
No theory of origins can be considered a scientific theory in a strict sense.

572
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:31,420
Creation and evolution are inferences based on circumstantial evidence,

573
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:38,220
and predictions based on each model can be tested and compared with that circumstantial evidence.

574
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,840
Among creationists,

575
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,280
among those of almost all,

576
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:41,280


577
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,520
religious persuasions,

578
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,960
except atheists.

579
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,000
And among ev-

580
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,380
just are found those of almost all persuasions,

581
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,940
including atheists.

582
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,640
However,

583
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,980
since evolution is a mechanistic,

584
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,280
atheistic theory,

585
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,540
it is a basic dogma of agnosticism,

586
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,440
humanism,

587
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,960
and atheism in general.

588
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,280
The one-sided indoctrination of our students in this materialistic philosophy,

589
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,600
in the tax-supported public school,

590
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,100
in our pluralistic democratic society,

591
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,540
is a violation

592
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,860
of academic and religious freedoms.

593
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,340
Furthermore, it is poor science and poor education.

594
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,600
Come on everyone, join the fun.

595
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,660
We've got thinking on the run.

596
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,600
The Earth is circled by the sun.

597
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,220
Creation science polka.

598
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,660
Science classes in our schools taught by superstitious fools.

599
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,680
Jerry Fowell sets the rules.

600
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,240
Creation science polka.

601
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,220
The universe was fabricated in six letters.

602
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,280
The world is a virtual paradise.

603
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:49,260
The humans and the dinosaurs shared a condo in L.A.

604
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,760
Carbon dating makes us cringe.

605
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,640
We're the right-wing lunatic fringe.

606
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,680
Jesus died for our sins.

607
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,480
Creation science polka.

608
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,860
The Earth is circled by the sun.

609
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:08,860


610
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:08,860


611
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,620
Creation science polka.

612
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:09,820
Science classes in our schools taught by superstitious fools.

613
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,860
¶¶

614
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,780
According to the Big Bang Theory of the Origin of the Universe,

615
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,560
about 10 to 20 billion years ago,

616
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,720
all the energy and matter of this entire universe

617
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,040
were crammed into a cosmic egg of subatomic particles and radiation.

618
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,460
Of course, no one has the foggiest notion where this cosmic egg came from

619
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,540
or how it got there.

620
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,240
Zap! There it was.

621
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:07,360
Then, for some equally inexplicable reason, this cosmic egg exploded.

622
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,840
And out of this initial chaos,

623
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:14,760
our marvelously complex universe somehow created itself.

624
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,260
A relatively short time after this explosion, we are told,

625
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,900
the universe consisted of an expanding cloud of hydrogen

626
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,860
with a minor amount of helium.

627
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,320
The late Professor Harlow Shapley of Harvard University stated

628
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,360
that some people piously proclaim,

629
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,780
in the beginning, God.

630
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,480
I say, in the beginning, hydrogen.

631
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,220
He went on to say that starting with hydrogen,

632
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,800
natural laws in time,

633
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,200
one could explain the origin of the universe.

634
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,580
Of course, he could do no such thing.

635
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,920
But the idea was consistent with his philosophy.

636
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,880
This reminds me that someone has said

637
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,180
that hydrogen is an odorless, tasteless, invisible gas,

638
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,160
which, if given enough time, becomes people.

639
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,900
And, of course, that is exactly what evolutionists do believe.

640
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,580
In other words, some Christians think that it is just prayer

641
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,640
and just preaching that solves this problem.

642
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,260
It is prayer and preaching and picketing and petitions

643
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,760
and other forms of public outrage

644
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,780
that show that Christians are united

645
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:25,060
in our biblical commitment to stop the spread of homosexuality,

646
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,700
pornography, abortion, and so forth.

647
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,340
Now, we don't like to do that

648
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,180
because, as normal human beings, we like to be popular.

649
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,420
We like to be comfortable.

650
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,900
According to Evolution,

651
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:41,000
theory then, disorder spontaneously generated order.

652
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,960
Complexity arose from simplicity.

653
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,720
Chaos created the cosmos,

654
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,240
all by a process of self-transformation.

655
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,960
According to this theory,

656
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,960
the universe is an isolated system

657
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,200
which began in a state of disorder

658
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,820
and spontaneously transformed itself

659
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,320
into the present highly ordered and complex universe.

660
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,200
Now,

661
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:06,440
I,

662
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:07,540
yes,

663
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,700
dear friends,

664
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,680
and that reminds us of

665
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,640
something that was told to one of our friends

666
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,200
by a fundamentalist co-worker

667
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,060
about the Big Bang Theory.

668
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,160
He said,

669
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,980
he said to her,

670
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,520
you know, this Big Bang Theory,

671
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,340
that would be like this.

672
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,260
If I were to take this watch here

673
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,400
and take it into,

674
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,340
take it apart

675
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,280
into all its many, many tiny little gears and things,

676
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,400
then throw them up in the air,

677
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,700
and if they accidentally,

678
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,940
all came back together into a watch,

679
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,700
why then,

680
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,160
that's the Big Bang Theory.

681
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,220
Uh-huh.

682
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,980
Well, you know, friends,

683
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,280
if one could actually understand

684
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,160
what five billion years was,

685
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,500
you could, you know,

686
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,680
that watch would actually,

687
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,800
if you jumbled it around for five billion years,

688
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:00,320
it probably would turn back into a working wristwatch.

689
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:00,880
You know,

690
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,100
we've got all those monkeys

691
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,780
and all those typewriters

692
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,040
working away here,

693
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,620
friends,

694
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,820
and some of the,

695
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,500
oh, the results of some of the things

696
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,200
done by monkeys with typewriters,

697
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,080
glorious things,

698
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,720
which can be learned about

699
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,220
in this brand new book

700
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,060
from which we're going to be reading

701
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,380
for the next several shows,

702
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,420
Kooks,

703
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,880
A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief

704
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,120
by Donna Cossey.

705
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,660
And today's reading will start

706
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,720
with this,

707
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:35,920
uh,

708
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
well, the Kooks book

709
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,660
is broken down into so many wonderful categories.

710
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,740
We've got the, uh,

711
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:43,740
oh,

712
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,680
Anglo-Israelites,

713
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,300
Black Messiahs,

714
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,180
conspiracy theories,

715
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,240
and you name it,

716
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,300
but this is one of my very favorite sections.

717
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,580
We'll be reading directly from her book,

718
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,340
which then quotes the Kook books,

719
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,140
and this one is called

720
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,920
The Devil is...

721
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,700
A Dinosaur.

722
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:14,400
The scene could be taken from a Godzilla movie

723
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,460
or Journey to the Center of the Earth.

724
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,840
Two gigantic reptilian monsters,

725
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,420
Predator and Prey,

726
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,000
claw for their lives

727
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,500
in the steamy primordial jungle.

728
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,340
Blood disperse from powerful limbs

729
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,940
and furious, shrieking heads.

730
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,080
An armored tail whips out,

731
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,880
gutting,

732
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,700
and exposed,

733
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,420
torso.

734
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,440
Absorbed in the fight,

735
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,420
neither of the doomed creatures realize

736
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,480
until it's too late

737
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,820
that they've begun to sink

738
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,440
ever so slowly into quicksand.

739
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,160
As they go down,

740
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,160
their shrieks become deafening

741
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,360
and fury turns to panic.

742
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,100
Swallowed up by the earth,

743
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,420
their frames are locked in eternal combat,

744
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:00,360
suggesting an unholy suicide pact.

745
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,520
The scene, however,

746
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,920
is not from a Godzilla movie or any movie.

747
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,720
It really,

748
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,100
really happened.

749
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,360
The bones of the two unfortunate dinosaurs

750
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,440
were discovered in 1991.

751
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,900
Scientists tell us that the battle

752
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,100
between the carnivorous velociraptor

753
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,160
and its intended prey,

754
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,360
the herbivorous protoceratops,

755
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,760
took place approximately 75 million years ago.

756
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,340
Only 10 million years before the creation

757
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,100
of our ancestors, the Yeti, dear friend.

758
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,560
We might think that the world is a cruel place

759
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,020
now, but these two dinosaurs

760
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,200
lived in a world without mercy.

761
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:40,960
Quote,

762
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,020
a freakish hellish nightmare world

763
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,140
drenched in the blood and gore of violence,

764
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,000
death and destruction inhabited by abnormal,

765
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,700
grotesque creatures and monstrosities,

766
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,960
hell bent on destruction.

767
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,020
It was a world invented by the devil himself.

768
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,720
According to Damon Royce and Jason Zolot,

769
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,440
hmm,

770
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,280
the authors of this book,

771
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,400
Did God Destroy the Dinosaurs?

772
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,120
While millions of dinosaur lovers everywhere

773
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,160
delight in their gigantic proportions

774
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,040
and sometimes comic physiognomies,

775
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,720
Royce and Zolot are deeply disturbed by them.

776
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,100
Quote, even a cursory examination of the facts they write

777
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,440
produces the distinct feeling that something

778
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,120
was just not right with the dinosaurs

779
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,160
and the related reptiles of the air and sea.

780
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,900
It is as if they were not of this world

781
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,060
and did not belong in it.

782
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,480
It is as if they were travesties of nature,

783
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,120
monstrous caricatures of other creatures

784
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,340
and of life itself,

785
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,920
the result of some obscene joke played

786
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,100
by some perverted prankster.

787
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,240
They assert that it was the most perverted prankster of all,

788
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,440
Satan, who created these travesties, the dinosaurs,

789
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,480
and in his insatiable perversity became one, him.

790
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:05,540
Quote, even a cursory examination of the facts they write

791
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:05,540


792
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,200
results in a more pleasant conclusion.

793
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,300
Where the world's largest and most important

794
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,120
monster lives in this world,

795
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:17,380
there lies the skeleton of the giant multi-headed winged sea dragon.

796
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,860
For millions of years, it was the terror of the land, sea, and air

797
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,580
of the primordial world over which it reigned

798
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,440
as the bloodthirsty lord and master.

799
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:32,340
This monster, unlike anything the world had ever seen before or since,

800
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,420
was the physical manifestation.

801
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,400
of Satan.

802
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,340
So,

803
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,000
friends, sincerely horrified

804
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,980
by this bizarre scenario,

805
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,060
the authors are more than

806
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,220
sorophobic Satan bashers.

807
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,780
They are theologians

808
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,960
who carefully argue their case with due

809
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,040
consideration for science and religious history.

810
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,920
Their inevitable conclusion

811
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,980
that Satan created the

812
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,860
dinosaurs and that God destroyed

813
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,080
them brings together, they claim,

814
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,740
science and the Bible.

815
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,060
With greater sophistication than most

816
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,120
evangelicals, Royce

817
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,080
and Zollett borrow freely from

818
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,960
Gnosticism, Zoroastrianism, and

819
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,840
Paganism to form a Christian

820
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,200
heresy that features an obsession

821
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,760
with dinosaurs.

822
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,280
What are today's creationists

823
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,840
supposed to make of these creatures

824
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,680
who missed boarding the ark

825
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,020
and who didn't warrant so much as a phrase

826
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,960
in the Bible? Some of them

827
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,800
say that God actually

828
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,540
planted dinosaur bones

829
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,660
to test the faith

830
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,740
of believers.

831
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,660
Royce and Zollett rush

832
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,380
to the rescue, pointing out

833
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,760
that the dinosaurs did indeed exist.

834
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,120
And, uh, let's see.

835
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,420
This is quite

836
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,340
detailed and long. We'll skip to the

837
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,680
good bloody parts.

838
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,220
They're talking about how

839
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,540
God had delegated the overall

840
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,420
responsibility for the

841
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,700
administration and care

842
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,780
of all creation under his direction.

843
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,560
The universe which God had created

844
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,980
was to be brought to completion.

845
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,360
One might say that Lucifer

846
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,980
became a kind of subcontractor

847
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:12,780
for creation.

848
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,680
God's mistake was to give Lucifer

849
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,660
the exclusive power to create

850
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,720
life. It was only a matter of time

851
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,420
before Lucifer got a big head

852
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,500
and became Satan the rebel

853
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,740
and creator of dinosaurs.

854
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,720
Royce and Zollett,

855
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,300
let's switch over

856
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,020
to this.

857
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,100
Ah, Royce and Zollett,

858
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,660
quoted here,

859
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,060
the universe

860
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,040
must have teemed with

861
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,640
life, wondrous and beautiful

862
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,060
in its many varieties.

863
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,800
But then Lucifer began turning into

864
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,660
Satan by beginning to tamper with

865
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,440
the creation of life. Perhaps

866
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,340
it started initially as an amusement

867
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,780
or a prank or diversion for himself

868
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,600
or perhaps to impress

869
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,440
or to entertain the lesser

870
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,520
angelic beings who lacked his

871
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,360
power to create life.

872
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,700
What Satan had realized was that

873
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,560
not only could he create life,

874
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,760
he could also destroy it.

875
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,660
For his amusement, Lucifer

876
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,720
turned Satan, introduced the reality

877
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,620
and the curse of death to the

878
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,720
living, something God had

879
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,680
never intended. Satan turned

880
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,720
Earth into a freakish, hellish

881
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,960
nightmare world, drenched

882
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,580
in blood and

883
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,720
violence and gore, death and destruction,

884
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,380
an obscene parody

885
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,680
of what God had intended.

886
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,640
His blood,

887
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,740
lost, became

888
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:36,840
insatiable.

889
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,720
Lucifer abused his creative

890
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,460
powers by creating a planet with

891
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,700
steamy, wet, tropical climate,

892
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,740
a planet populated by dinosaurs,

893
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,640
sea reptiles,

894
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,640
flying serpents and other abnormal,

895
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,680
grotesque creatures

896
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,000
and monstrosities.

897
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,360
And, uh, let's see,

898
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,220
it goes on to say here,

899
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,000
uh,

900
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,620
God, after stalling,

901
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,480
so long, had an answer

902
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,700
to Satan's fun and games.

903
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,040
The heavens were completely

904
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,220
cleansed, at least for a while,

905
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,260
of the rebellious, demonic

906
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,300
host. God cast

907
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,400
Satan down to Earth, then destroyed

908
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,380
the dinosaurs and set about the renewal

909
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,440
of the world. Satan was

910
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,360
deprived of his power to create in the

911
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,400
physical realm, but he retained his power

912
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,180
to manipulate life.

913
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,380
Not all of Satan's creation

914
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,160
was destroyed at this time.

915
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,440
Certain areas were permitted to

916
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,400
retain their hot, steamy

917
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,640
climate, and certain abnormal

918
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,540
creatures, like

919
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,600
sharks and crocodiles,

920
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,460
were permitted either to

921
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,440
exist or to arise through

922
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,240
his genetic engineering.

923
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,420
God then pursued

924
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,060
Satan into the solar system.

925
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,440
Evidence of the battle can be found

926
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,520
on the pockmarked surfaces of

927
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,760
Mars, Mercury,

928
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,300
and the Moon.

929
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,620
And, uh, anyway, it turned out,

930
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,260
uh, that, uh, a book of Revelation

931
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,680
can be, uh, described as a graphic

932
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,400
depiction of this chaos and confusion,

933
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,280
although it's supposed to take place in the future,

934
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,380
I thought. And he opened

935
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,200
the bottomless pit, and there arose

936
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,340
a smoke out of the pit

937
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,500
as the smoke of a great

938
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,460
furnace. And the

939
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,460
sun and the air were darkened by

940
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,320
reason of the smoke of the pit.

941
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,500
And there came out of the smoke locusts

942
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,140
upon the Earth. Revelation

943
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,020
9, 13. Thus,

944
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,280
dear friends,

945
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,940
the great comet,

946
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,620
or, wait, where's my background?

947
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,640
Oh, the most horrible

948
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,080
Jurassic Park. What?

949
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,420
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?

950
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,080
There we go.

951
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:49,840
Thus,

952
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,220
the great comet, or meteor,

953
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,120
which devastated Earth 65

954
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,440
million years ago and put an end to all dinosaurs,

955
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,160
they write, was none

956
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,000
other than Satan himself,

957
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,280
being thunderously

958
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,300
hurled towards,

959
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,140
earth, confounding,

960
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,460
and destroying the whole ecosystem

961
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,280
of the planet.

962
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,640
The perfection,

963
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,280
beauty, and harmony

964
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,520
in Eden notwithstanding,

965
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,400
this was still a planet

966
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,600
with the remnants of Satan's

967
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,380
earlier creation. The once

968
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,480
planet-wide tropical ecosystem still

969
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,600
existed, but confined to the planet's

970
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,180
equatorial belt region.

971
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,080
In these tropical and

972
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,280
semi-tropical regions, there

973
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,440
still live such vile and

974
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,480
savage creatures like crocodiles

975
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,480
and alligators, puny cousins

976
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,340
of the dinosaurs and sea

977
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,340
reptiles, but no less

978
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,660
deadly and bloodthirsty.

979
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,380
Other vile creatures of the land and

980
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,260
sea also either survived

981
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,360
the metamorphosis or were

982
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,320
biologically engineered by

983
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,840
Satan afterwards.

984
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:55,380
And yes,

985
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,320
friends, even after his vile creations were

986
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,460
destroyed, Satan still wouldn't give up.

987
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,040
He sabotaged Eden

988
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,320
and continues to wage war with God,

989
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,180
even to this day. Satan,

990
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,880
after all, holds dominion over Earth,

991
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,720
can genetically engineer

992
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,120
evil versions of

993
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,280
already extant plants and

994
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,540
animals. Poison ivy,

995
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,700
venomous snakes,

996
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,220
saber-toothed tigers and vampire bats,

997
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,360
as well as harmful bacteria

998
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,460
and viruses such as syphilis,

999
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,040
AIDS, smallpox,

1000
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,220
and polio are just a few

1001
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,280
examples. But Satan is

1002
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,160
not satisfied with this mischief.

1003
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,740
He wants his old,

1004
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,120
power back.

1005
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,380
The proof that Satan

1006
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,280
still desperately tries to create

1007
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,080
is provided by the accounts of

1008
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,220
sightings of strange creatures

1009
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,280
or huge specimens of

1010
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,340
known creatures.

1011
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,380
Of all the creatures of Satan's

1012
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,140
menagerie, his most favored

1013
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,400
were and remain the dinosaurs.

1014
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,380
Satan has persistently

1015
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,640
tried to recreate dinosaurs.

1016
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,200
All such attempts at creation have failed.

1017
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,060
His most persistent attempt

1018
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,260
to recreate his old brood,

1019
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,020
has been at Loch Ness,

1020
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:05,940
Scotland.

1021
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,520
But the specimens

1022
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,300
are doomed due to the

1023
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,700
waning of Satan's power.

1024
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,460
This accounts for the repeated vanishing

1025
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,480
acts performed by Nessie

1026
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,400
and her ilk.

1027
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,200
Although Satan's attempts at creation

1028
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,880
remain comical and pathetic,

1029
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,140
less so are his weapons of mass

1030
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,440
destruction. However, even the plan

1031
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,980
to get humans to blow themselves

1032
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,500
off the earth could backfire.

1033
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,280
Uh...

1034
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,300
The modern science and weapons

1035
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,060
of destruction are double-edged swords.

1036
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,340
Satan would like to beguile man

1037
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,300
into unleashing mass destruction weapons

1038
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,200
upon himself, but he fears

1039
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,180
that man might unleash these very same

1040
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,760
weapons against his brood.

1041
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,060
Man already has the potential

1042
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,100
to eradicate all crocodiles

1043
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,340
and alligators from the wild, and indeed

1044
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,360
from existence!

1045
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,960
And man can already launch the

1046
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,960
expurgatory war against

1047
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,700
sharks, piranhas, lamprey eels,

1048
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,240
and other vile creatures of

1049
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,460
Satan's menagerie!

1050
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:07,420
To date, man has chosen

1051
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,040
to eradicate from the wild only

1052
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,160
one member of Satan's brood,

1053
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,260
smallpox.

1054
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,040
Under the guise of the generally laudable

1055
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,740
and beneficial conservation mentality

1056
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,760
of maintaining the balance of nature,

1057
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,740
man has unwittingly included

1058
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,120
conservation of Satan's

1059
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,020
life forms.

1060
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,900
Royce and, uh,

1061
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,060
Zollet finally warn about those

1062
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,940
who take pity on crocodiles

1063
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,000
and wolves, for they are dupes of Satan!

1064
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,300
God is destined to wrest

1065
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,980
the earth from Satan's grip,

1066
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,300
destroying his seed

1067
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,540
in the process.

1068
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,180
Nuclear holocaust will

1069
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,800
be the fulfillment

1070
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,980
of God's will!

1071
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,960
And, uh,

1072
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,620
yes indeed.

1073
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:53,320
Hoooooo!

1074
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,720
And, uh,

1075
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,440
that reading

1076
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,180
there was from this wonderful

1077
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,280
new book, Kook's Guide

1078
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,260
to the Outer Limits of Human

1079
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,140
Belief. Anybody who, uh,

1080
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,980
has been complaining to us about

1081
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,980
when you gonna do another high weirdness

1082
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,240
by mail? Well, you don't need one now.

1083
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,120
Uh, I'm gonna give the address

1084
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,080
of the publishers of Kook's.

1085
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,240
Uh, it's

1086
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,100
like a $17 book.

1087
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,480
And you can get that, uh,

1088
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,420

1089
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,240

00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,760
And, uh,

1104
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,480
uh,

1105
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,100
and, uh, that music, uh, in the background

1106
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,680
was by Kyle Kossop

1107
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,940
and Severe Tire Damage.

1108
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,820
Um, other background music

1109
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,540
there was from Miko,

1110
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,860
uh, Ultimate Bad Disco

1111
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,240
sound effects, uh,

1112
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,240
Jurassic Park,

1113
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,620
partly as performed by

1114
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,700
Zandy. And, uh,

1115
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,880
oh yeah, Creation Science Polka

1116
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,920
there was by, uh,

1117
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,900
Joe Newman, uh,

1118
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,280
Rudy Schwartz Project.

1119
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,260
Hey, uh, speaking of Portland

1120
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,980
as we were just a little

1121
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,740
while ago, uh, oh,

1122
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,980
by the time you hear this

1123
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,940
I will be, uh,

1124
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,600
attending the

1125
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,060
single most astonishing event

1126
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,980
in world history before

1127
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,540
X-Day. The Universal Subgenius

1128
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,140
Portland Pilgrimage.

1129
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,400
Uh, which we've given you plenty of, uh,

1130
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,280
warning about on this show, so you

1131
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,480
know, anybody who listens to this show should know about it.

1132
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,420
We just did a mailing.

1133
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,480
All subgeniuses will be getting the mailing.

1134
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,440
We just knocked ourselves out

1135
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,380
to finish. And, uh,

1136
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:58,620
eh,

1137
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,220
but here's what you're gonna be

1138
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,260
missing, dear friends. This is from the

1139
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,180
flyer here.

1140
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,300
It's what I'm looking forward to.

1145
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,900
can force yourself to eat

1146
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,140

00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,340
events. Free airfare

1150
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,280
and lodging for all major church

1151
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,420
hierarchites, ranters and rantresses,

1152
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,680

who desire them. Total

00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,300
fulfillment of every attendee's

1157
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,880
wildest dreams of attention,

1158
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:43,160
adulation, worship, and acclaim

1159
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,060
from the highest ranking members of the

1160
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,220
subgenius hierarchy. Public

1161
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,260
humiliation of stupid, ugly,

1162
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,120
horny college boy bobbies

1163
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,480
who publish stupid, insulting, would-be

1164
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,660
church material,

1165
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,880
unaware that they are only making an

1166
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,300
embarrassing spectacle of their inherent

1167
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,320
and inescapable inferiority

1168
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,300
to even the so-called

1169
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,360
pinks whom they despise

1170
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,420
but whose low level of wit and creativity

1171
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,880
they can never hope to attain.

1172
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,520
Free 24-hour

1173
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,340

Climactic fireworks

1175
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,940
and laser rock for Bob

1176
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:21,160
as the smashing conclusion to the most

1177
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,220
world-smashing revival of all past

1178
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,180
or future times before X-Day.

1179
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,400
Sexy naked men and women

1180
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,860
everywhere. No

1181
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,760
hangovers for anyone,

1182
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,680
no matter how much

1183
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,160
hideously excessive

1184
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,820
partying they do.

1185
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,640
Free immortality pills at

1186
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,220
the door. Global,

1187
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,520
total global dictatorship

1188
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,880
for him, Nenslow,

1189
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,600
who wrote this and is

1190
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,120
organizing this thing in perpetuity.

1191
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,000
Now wait a minute.

1192
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,680
Yes, as it

1193
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,820
says here, absolute unquestioning

1194
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,680
obedience to all my whims,

1195
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,560
however trivial, instantly before

1196
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,660
I even speak. The planet

1197
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,280
is in the way? Yes, sir.

1198
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,500
We'll see to it, sir. That pop star's

1199
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,280
voice too shrill? Consider

1200
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,660
her killed to death by mile-long

1201
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,480
pink horseshoe crabs, sir.

1202
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,580
That jerk who tormented you in

1203
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,660
fourth grade? Here are his genitals,

1204
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,100
sir. Universe

1205
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,660
bothering you, sir? We'll have

1206
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,260
it crushed into a tiny

1207
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,780
crumbled wad in just a moment, sir.

1208
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,180
Please forgive the delay!

1209
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,740
Yes, dear friends,

1210
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,520
Nenslow's big party, and it does

1211
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,500
sound like it's going to be great, although, as

1212
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,760
Nenslow himself said in a

1213
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,740
subsequent newsletter, as quoted

1214
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,580
here, the only difficult part

1215
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,600
of the entire conference, this is the

1216
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,540
pre-party conference,

1217
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,780
was refusing the constant

1218
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,660
offers of sex and drugs

1219
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,720
from persons of all genders and

1220
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,600
social classes. Thanks,

1221
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,760
but besides being a happily

1222
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,540
married man, we feel that

1223
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,720
one moment of pleasure, which

1224
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,660
is unearned by hours of

1225
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,500
arduous labor or meaningless

1226
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,600
suffering, would take the fine

1227
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,620
edge of hatred off our

1228
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,820
worldview and lull us into

1229
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,820
the belief that life is good

1230
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,540
and worth living.

1231
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,640
Then what would happen when it's time

1232
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,820
to die? We'd be screwed, that's what.

1233
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,860
No, we're, we save

1234
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,580
enjoying life,

1235
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,600
that most subtle of

1236
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,660
addictions, for our evil enemies

1237
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,540
or those who show by their blatant

1238
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,460
displays of stupidity that they truly

1239
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:28,320
deserve to be cruelly deceived

1240
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,860
for our sport.

1241
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,500
Paul Mervridis, bon mot,

1242
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,500
in regard to the frightening

1243
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,260
drug we know as hope,

1244
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,680
deserves to be run down

1245
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,500
the halls of posterity

1246
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,440
to the sagely nods

1247
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,860
of future philosophers.

1248
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,720
As Paul Mervridis said about hope,

1249
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,560
a killer

1250
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,360
high, but

1251
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,400
what a crash.

1252
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,600
And, well friends, I think it's time now

1253
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,680
to teach you

1254
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,660
the post office box number to write to for free

1255
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,740
information from the Church of the Subgenius.

1256
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,820
Yes, this mighty Church

1257
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,780
can tell you about everything.

1258
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,900
You got that pencil ready, my friend?

1259
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,940
Do you have that pencil ready?

1260
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:09,540
Uh,

1261
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,780
mmm, I want you

1262
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,600
to write that, just a

1263
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,420
self-dressed stamped envelope to Bob

1264
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,140
at post office box

1265
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,140
140306

1266
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:22,720
That's box

1267
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,660
140306

1268
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:26,720
in lovely

1269
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,740
Dallas, Texas

1270
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:29,440
uh,

1271
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:34,040
7-5-2-1-4

1272
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,260
Ah, yes,

1273
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:36,960
and uh

1274
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,320
...

1275
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:38,820
...

1276
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,460
...

1277
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,300
A prayer

1278
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,820
to J.R. Bob Dobbs

1279
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,860
O Dobbs,

1280
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,680
canst thou not

1281
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,580
hear my plea

1282
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,220
in my

1283
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,180
utter humbleness

1284
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,560
For lo, Dobbs, I'm nothing but a loathsome

1285
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,380
lowly piece of

1286
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,700
before thy

1287
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,760
ultimate and divine power

1288
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,360
thy

1289
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,420

1293
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,400
in the smoke of the pipe

1294

Heareth my

1295
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,120

mercy and righteousness

1302
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,900
that thy might allow me

1303
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,300

1304
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,280
power over all other living

1305
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,320
beings in the universe

1306
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,940
and Dobbs that

1307
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,600
I humbly beseech that I might

1308
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,400
be allowed to control

1309
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,760
the food source

1310
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,960
for all nations on earth

1311
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,240
in order that

1312
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,780
every person of every

1313
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,780
country, of every city

1314
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,560
of every town, of every

1315
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,020
neighborhood

1316
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,820
might find it necessary

1317
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:05,020
to kiss my ass

1318
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,600
in order to obtain

1319
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,080
food

1320
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,420
their

1321
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,220
minimum daily requirements

1322
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,760
for nutrition for that day

1323
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,640
and Dobbs

1324
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,540
from the beginning of time

1325
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,800
mankind has had a vision

1326
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,600
a vision of

1327
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,760
all men, of all

1328
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,700
nationalities, of all races, of all

1329
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,740
four sexes coming together

1330
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:32,560
and joining hands

1331
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,020
and

1332
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,380
singing together in harmony

1333
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,360
and Dobbs I humbly

1334
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,400
request that you

1335
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,320
just totally ignore this vision

1336
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,460
because it really has no interest to me whatsoever

1337
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,440
and Dobbs I selflessly

1338
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,300
humbly request

1339
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:50,920
that you

1340
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,340
instead by

1341
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,400
ignoring this vision you will be able to

1342
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,520
channel more of your psychic and spiritual

1343
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,440
energy into myself

1344
00:59:58,700 --> 00:59:58,880
and I will be able to

1345
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,300
fulfill all of your selfish requests

1346
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:03,240
and Dobbs if I had but one wish

1347
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,600
for mankind it would be this

1348
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,300
that I would be able to just blow off

1349
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,760
the whole one wish fairy tale

1350
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,720
syndrome and that instead I might have

1351
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,340
an infinity

1352
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,260
of wishes

1353
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,280
and I'd never have to exist

1354
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,100
in some kind of storybook reality

1355
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,100
where a guy gets a pudding

1356
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,600
stuck on his nose or something like that

1357
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,560
Dobbs

1358
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:28,520
furthermore

1359
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,320
I request that

1360
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,080
humbly Dobbs

1361
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,160
I beseech thee

1362
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,040
on bended knee

1363
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,540
looking up unto you as the

1364
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,980
true and one and only source of wisdom

1365
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,320
I do humbly request

1366
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,320
thy humble servant

1367
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,540
I request that

1368
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,780
I be allowed to replace ye

1369
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:49,760
Dobbs

1370
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,420
and that it shall be me that

1371
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,340
smoketh the pipe of knowledge

1372
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,320
and in fact ye that

1373
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,160
stand on bended knee

1374
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,280
before me

1375
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,480
begging

1376
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,180
mercy before me

1377
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,300
in which case

1378
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,860
I will just laugh in your face

1379
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,620
Dobbs and turn you

1380
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:11,960
down even though it was ye

1381
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,480
ye

1382
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,620
who granted me this power in the first

1383
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,740
place and lo Dobbs

1384
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,580
I request that

1385
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:21,840
I might be able to

1386
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,620
merge with the concept

1387
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,560
of hate that I might

1388
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,600
in fact be able to

1389
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,760
become one with

1390
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,700
hate and lo Dobbs

1391
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,960
that the concept of

1392
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,380
conscience might be

1393
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,740
strucken from my mind that I would

1394
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,960
never again be able to

1395
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,640
feel guilt and lo

1396
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,580
the word guilt could be

1397
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,620
struck from my very vocabulary

1398
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,760
so that I could in fact

1399
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,620
never feel guilt

1400
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,760
for demanding

1401
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,880
any of these selfish things

1402
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,860
oh just little

1403
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:57,940

power over all life in the universe

1405
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,640
and lo Dobbs

1406
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,040
I request that

1407
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,460
ahahaha

1408
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,540
