00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
The Self-Genius Power of Bob

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,300
Friends, the virtual online X-Day drill was lots of fun.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,480
It's going to take some editing, though.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:26,000
But Reverend Susie the Flusie saved my boot-all by doing a superb, brand-new X-Day and Plague episode of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse on WREK Atlanta, as follows.

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,180
Enjoy the show, for one day, we shall die.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,900
The 25.

7
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,600
I slept for 25 hours?

8
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,100
No, 25 weeks.

9
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,660
But you mean to say since January you've put me into a medically-induced coma?

10
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,020
Well, sort of, kind of.

11
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,580
Less medical, more cast-iron skillet with a little help from the street corner stop and cop.

12
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,220
But you needed the beauty rest, love.

13
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,840
Oh, that explains the headache.

14
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,700
Ah, when is right now?

15
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,360
Anyway.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,400
Oh, it's Sunday around midnight.

17
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,100
Uh, which Sunday?

18
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,160
The Sunday that's July 5th this year.

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,500
It's July 5th?

20
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,800
Oh, holy hell!

21
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,280
My house is supposed to be an X-Day.

22
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,080
I gotta go.

23
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,440
Hey, hold your horse, Flues.

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,640
You can't go out.

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:42,860
What?

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,720
Why?

27
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,540
No one can go out.

28
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,660
What's going on?

29
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,780
Oh, that's right.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,820
I guess you've missed a few things.

31
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,040
Let me help you get caught up.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,320
Ah!

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:53,900
Ah!

34
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,900
Oh, yeah.

35
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,240
Nothing like sleep learning.

36
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,500
The day it all began.

37
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,840
The day what began?

38
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,680
Oh, yes, yes.

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,480
It began far, far away from this lovely palace.

40
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,340
Far below the Earth's surface at the Institute.

41
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,660
Come on in.

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,200
Didn't mean to disturb your lunch.

43
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,760
Welcome to the Lymph Node Institute.

44
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,740
I'm Doc.

45
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,580
I'm Bugsy.

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,960
Governments don't dare try to kill me.

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,440
I've let them all know that I've planted biological bombs in seven major cities around

48
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,000
the world.

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,220
And, uh...

50
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,400
And released a biological attack on the population which will kill hundreds of thousands.

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,380
Then...

52
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:36,780
Oops.

53
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,260
Broke open.

54
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,500
Ain't that a bitch?

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,060
Run!

56
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,700
You ain't got a chance.

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,060
But that was just a prelude to what was to come.

58
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,060
You got to hurry.

59
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,740
There's a storm!

60
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,300
Storm coming!

61
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,020
In storm!

62
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,020
Huh?

63
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,580
And his name?

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,820
The Horned King!

65
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,360
The Darkman!

66
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:01,940
Oh, no.

67
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,940
Well, we're born.

68
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,900
Come on down.

69
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,320
And meet your maker.

70
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:32,300
Come on down and make the stand

71
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,560
Oh, I had been out searching with a black book in my hand

72
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,480
And I've looked between the lines and I know the pages that I've read

73
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,560
Left me walking to the edges and it's worn out cowboy boots

74
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,280
And it won't fly, no matter that way or no next way

75
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,580
Come on down and meet your maker

76
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,400
Come on down and make the stand

77
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,240
Come on down, come on down

78
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,260
Come on down, we'll make the stand

79
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,460
Look down, dark despite the wrong

80
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,820
In the shadow of a deemed dead

81
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,200
No secret of your damn strength

82
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,620
In your MY BIG HAND

83
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,160
And you're on the streets

84
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,460
Bet that you don't earn two crescent стать

85
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,560
In life

86
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,160
And you may not little Elliot

87
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,360
Oh

88
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,780
constant

89
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,360
Core

90
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,460
school

91
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:52,460
This is the night

92
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,460
course

93
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,360
pharmacies everywhere.

94
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,660
Flu buddy!

95
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,540
And now, let's get back to the Lone Star.

96
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,760
State patrol, Hap.

97
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,580
Hey, Joe Bob.

98
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,640
Want me to fill her up for you?

99
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,520
No, sir. I come by on other business.

100
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,900
Was that old geezer here last night?

101
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,420
He's here about every night.

102
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,260
Maybe he ought to hear this, too.

103
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:16,940
Hear what?

104
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,780
There's strangers crawling all over Braintree.

105
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,260
They're supposed to be U.S. Health Service guys,

106
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,560
but they came in a C-5A transport plane,

107
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,180
and they look like regular Army to me.

108
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,000
And then there's been three more big transport planes

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,620
land over Starland in Arkansas since noon.

110
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,060
It was, Collar. I knew it was.

111
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,040
I don't know nothing about that.

112
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,120
I'll tell you one thing, though.

113
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,980
If the feds are thinking about a quarantine,

114
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,820
then you might have a little bit more to worry about than cholera.

115
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,460
I just thought you ought to know what's stirring in the weeds, Hap.

116
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,460
If any of them other old boys that were here

117
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,080
last night come by, you ought to pass a word along to them.

118
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,080
Just don't mention my name.

119
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,560
Hap!

120
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,320
You ought to take care of that old-timer.

121
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,180
Them summer colds are the worst.

122
00:05:59,420 --> 00:05:59,760
Oh.

123
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,540
What if it ain't a cold?

124
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,880
What if I got whatever he had?

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,140
That guy last night?

126
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,300
Oh, it's probably just the sniffles, that's all.

127
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,460
Hap!

128
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,320
Come on down, we'll make the stand.

129
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,140
As I crawl beneath the surface,

130
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,180
looking through the promos of this life,

131
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,560
I may cut this brain, but it's coming in full,

132
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,080
the box of time.

133
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,340
Hey, trash can, where I don't mind,

134
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,940
your eyes will be the path.

135
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,240
As at the end, you're a character.

136
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,860
Play the few marks.

137
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,500
Play the marks.

138
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,800
Play the few marks.

139
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,440
Come on.

140
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,440


141
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:50,780
Come on down.

142
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,560
And make the stand.

143
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,600
Maybe I ought to close up the station for the rest of the day.

144
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,060
Call the other fellas and see how they're feeling.

145
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,680
Might not be a bad idea.

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,340
Yeah.

147
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,680
All survivors gotta come with us.

148
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,220
What the?

149
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,380
Run, Jesse, run!

150
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,640
Federal marshals, head to the air!

151
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:20,620
Yeah!

152
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,360
Let's go, let's go!

153
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,840
You're on up-to-staff time now.

154
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,340
Move it!

155
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,640
Go!

156
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,300
Go!

157
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,000
Go!

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,000


159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,020
Move up!

160
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,300
And it comes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

161
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,740
Being hijacked by a bunch of government sons of bitches in spacesuits

162
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,160
does that to me every time.

163
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,060
It's okay.

164
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,320
It's okay.

165
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,540
We're here in quarantine with the other survivors.

166
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,560
Where is here?

167
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,440
The old army base.

168
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,760
What the hell's wrong with us?

169
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,880
Vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, kidney failure.

170
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,820
Is it cholera?

171
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,040
Absolutely not.

172
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,880
You'll be getting all the details...

173
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,320
When?

174
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,160
Who told you to ask that question?

175
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,900
This press conference is over.

176
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,360
If that ain't true, I've never been this scared.

177
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,860
Us, our families, people we've been around since.

178
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,600
What's going on here?

179
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,900
It isn't the man with the little clipboard and the armed escort.

180
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,220
No, no, no, no, no, we don't take camps here.

181
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,880
Just a precaution.

182
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,800
Would you get the doctor a mask?

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,360
Wait, wait, wait.

184
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,200
We're moving this man to isolation.

185
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,020
According to who?

186
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,320
He's been misdiagnosed.

187
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,980
Health services has no authority here.

188
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,480
Actually, in a communicable case, I do.

189
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,300
You're making a big mistake here, honey.

190
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,300
I don't think so.

191
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,940
And it's doctor, not honey.

192
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,920
So, when are we gonna go public?

193
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,600
Well, we're not.

194
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,960
Not until we have some kind of solid information on how this thing is spreading.

195
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,420
We gotta keep a tight lid on this thing with the press.

196
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,120
This kind of an outbreak can easily cause a panic.

197
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:49,860
Meenakshi.

198
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,560
Now, in Washington, D.C.

199
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,320
Yes, sir.

200
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,300
On the outskirts of a one-stop light town in east Texas.

201
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,380
They killed him in a hurry down there.

202
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,380
Telemetry suggests even the ones that managed to get their respirators on died within 12 minutes.

203
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,780
The rest of them were gone in five.

204
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,620
You believe that?

205
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,660
Do I have a choice?

206
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,540
No.

207
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,420
Apparently, none of us do.

208
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,600
The National Disease Control Center, the Pentagon, says we'll know if it's actually gonna jump to the outside.

209
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,820
He says it'll probably mutate.

210
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,580
But that's not gonna help the people that catch it.

211
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,460
Listen, General, I have what might be something...

212
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,700
It'll just take them longer to die.

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,560
That's all.

214
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,480
Most people are gonna think they've got the plain old non-lethal flu right up to the very end.

215
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,320
And that's the biggest break we've had so far.

216
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,300
Contact with townspeople was minimal.

217
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,360
That doesn't matter.

218
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,660
We gotta shut that town down, lock it up, dig a moat around it.

219
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,820
That operation's already on the launching pad, sir.

220
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,820
What kind of cover did you come up with?

221
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:47,780
Anthrax.

222
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,840
New strain.

223
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,580
Ha ha, yeah, it's a new one, all right.

224
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,060
It's real new.

225
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,140
It's very good at its job, too.

226
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,260
I don't know, but the important thing is right now we got a shot at containing this.

227
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,820
Oh, God, this stuff has a communicability level of over 99%.

228
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,020
You understand what that means?

229
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,420
Any chance we had of containing it wouldn't...

230
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,000
But that was just a prelude to what was to come.

231
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,140
The time is now.

232
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,320
A nightmare is about to begin.

233
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,040
Demons were linksrix awesome cloud.

234
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,040


235
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,040


236
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,040


237
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,040


238
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,040


239
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,040


240
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,780
Galaxy

241
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,380
Here are the니까

242
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:00,820
Thank you.

243
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,660
Thank you.

244
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,540
Thank you.

245
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:34,400
Thank you.

246
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,760
Thank you.

247
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,240
Thank you.

248
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,660
Thank you.

249
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,180
Thank you.

250
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,180


251
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,460
Thank you.

252
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,880
Thank you.

253
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,000
Thank you.

254
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,440
Thank you.

255
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,780
Thank you.

256
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,080
Thank you.

257
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,140
Thank you.

258
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:37,140


259
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,300
Sir, we keep getting orders to let the virus win.

260
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,680
Sir, we keep getting orders to let the virus win.

261
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,520
Lay down your arms.

262
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,880
All right.

263
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,280
Let's make some puffs.

264
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:47,600
Let's make some puffs.

265
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,100
Ew.

266
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,580
Chronic viral ulcerative lesion.

267
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,820
No, don't touch him.

268
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,240
Why not?

269
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,380
He's infected.

270
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,920
Viral infections.

271
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,240
Highly contagious.

272
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,940
I only hope there's no leak.

273
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,560
And suddenly things turned ugly.

274
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,360
I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.

275
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,540
We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong.

276
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,120
We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong.

277
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,280
Dark rooms glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials.

278
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:20,560
Dark rooms glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials.

279
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,620
Well, I think...

280
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,420
NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.

281
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,460
I think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health care.

282
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:27,880
Yeah.

283
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,780
A new disease. No one's immune.

284
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,500
It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic.

285
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:34,920
It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic.

286
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,620
And instead of summer, it's all the time.

287
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,520
Now, I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.

288
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:41,680


289
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,220
He loves being that guy.

290
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,780
But, Janice, we do have standards.

291
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,620
This can't be a made-up disease.

292
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,680
The only moral thing to do

293
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,580
is to release a deadly virus into the general public.

294
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,340
We do have something we've been holding on to.

295
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,380
But it hasn't been tested.

296
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,520
Get over here, NBC.

297
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:02,720
Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I...

298
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,840
Wow!

299
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,260
So, we've got our deadly disease.

300
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,260
Now we just have to blame it on something that's in every household...

301
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,760
now we just have to blame it on something that's in every household...

302
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:15,760


303
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,860
that people are a little bit afraid of already.

304
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,140
Well, now, look here.

305
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,820
Thursday nights at 8 p.m.,

306
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,800
America's favorite TV show,

307
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,580
There's a Bat in My House.

308
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,780
Betty, Betty, Betty.

309
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,760
Starring America's favorite funny man,

310
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,760
the hilarious, zany B.B. Sanders

311
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,740
as Betty Boy.

312
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,200
Oh, absolutely.

313
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,620
I couldn't agree more.

314
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,260
Love it, love everything about it.

315
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,900
Excellent.

316
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,420
Betty, Betty, Betty.

317
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,480
Bat-a-jum-ba-ay, bat-a-jum-ba-oh-ah

318
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,640
Bat-a-jum-ba-ay, bat-a-jum-ba-oh-ah

319
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,880
Bat-a-jum-ba-ay, bat-a-jum-ba-oh-ah

320
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,800
Bat-a-jum-ba-ay, bat-a-jum-ba-oh-ah

321
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,700
Bat-a-jum-ba-ay, bat-a-jum-ba-oh-ah

322
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Bat-a-jum-ba-ay, bat-a-jum-ba-oh-ah

323
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,740
Bat-a-jum-ba-ay, bat-a-jum-ba-oh-ah

324
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,840
Bat-a-jum-ba-ay, bat-a-jum-ba-oh-ah

325
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,060
Bat-a-jum-ba-ay, bat-a-jum-ba-oh-ah

326
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,480
The reports of the supposedly lethal flu epidemic continue to spread.

327
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,740
Many downtown shopping areas in southern Florida are virtually empty this morning.

328
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:15,580
And the flu rumor actually seems to be gaining credence despite statements from health officials in Atlanta and Vermont.

329
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,640
It's as simple as this.

330
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,160
An unknown bat germ is being blown around the world.

331
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,520
It's highly contagious and it's reached great proportions.

332
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:37,040
I don't know about all those people down in Texas, but you sure sound like you've got a dose of the flu, Johnny.

333
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,080
You better let me take a listen.

334
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,040
Listen, forget that.

335
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,500
Oh, come on.

336
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,240
You know how hot it makes me when you take your shirt off.

337
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,500
Here's something else.

338
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,040
You've heard about the bats they have here.

339
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,080
Animal bats, the kind that fly?

340
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,580
Yes, yes.

341
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,560
Look what it says in this magazine.

342
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,380
This is a report from the state health department and it says some of them bats is rabbit.

343
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,320
Well.

344
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,220
And that ain't all.

345
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,080
Now there's a rumor going around that it was the rabbit bats in this neighborhood.

346
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,900
Oh, that's ridiculous.

347
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,320
Oh, my goodness.

348
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,080
Blah, blah, blah.

349
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,720
Um, what?

350
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,340
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

351
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,100
I'm gonna bite you.

352
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,340
No, I don't want that.

353
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,640
Do I scare you?

354
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,880
Yeah, you do.

355
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,520
I hope so.

356
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,180
Why are you trying to scare me?

357
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,460
Because I'm gonna bite you, man.

358
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,220
Why do you want to bite me?

359
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,780
Because I'm hungry.

360
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,940
Because I'm a bat-pire.

361
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,060
I'm a bat-pire.

362
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,360
I'm a very polite bat-pire.

363
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,340
Get my stick, there's a bat in the house.

364
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,540
Ready, ready, ready.

365
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,700
Eating a bat cause the Chinese flu.

366
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,620
But don't knock it if you try it is my message to you.

367
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,220
I eat them flying rodents and I get a lot of flack.

368
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,060
But once you go bat, you never go back.

369
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,520
You may think I'm some sort of ghoul.

370
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,460
But I'm just a man who's a bat-eating fool.

371
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,760
I eat that bat all over this town.

372
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,960
You can find me sleeping, hanging upside down.

373
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,000
I like girl scrugs, but I prefer Lester Flatt.

374
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,060
I like a T-bone steak, but I love me a bat.

375
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,280
I never was much of a heavy metal dude.

376
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,420
But me and Ozzy Osbourne got the same taste in food.

377
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,700
Georgia, they gave me a ten-gallon hat.

378
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,860
First man ever ate a ten-gallon bat.

379
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,800
When normal folks go hungry, they go to a dunkin'.

380
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,800
When I get hungry, I go spelunkin'.

381
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,740
I've read all this stuff and it's not funny.

382
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,380
It's based on fact.

383
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,200
Wait a minute.

384
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:38,840
Whoa, whoa.

385
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,520
You don't actually believe this crap, do you?

386
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,760
All I'm saying is that there are some things beyond the can of mortal man that shouldn't

387
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,400
be tampered with.

388
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,280
It's terrible.

389
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,200
It's science run amok.

390
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,020
It isn't.

391
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,400
Is that what you really think or just what you'd like to think?

392
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,420
I cannot accept half-baked theories that sell newspapers.

393
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,960
I'm a scientist, not an alarmist.

394
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,560
I just can't accept the idea of universal disease.

395
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,820
Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret

396
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,080
truth.

397
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,880
Those people out there buy that crap and I thought you were smart enough to see what

398
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,740
was really going on.

399
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,180
We don't know everything, Andy.

400
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,580
There's plenty going on right now in the Twilight Zone that we don't know anything about and

401
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,660
I think we ought to stay clear.

402
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,480
This is a scam on a global scale.

403
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,360
Do you f***ing get me now?

404
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,460
Oh, Dad.

405
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,260
None of this is true on any level.

406
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,460
It's just something that I thought of when I asked him.

407
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,880
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah.

408
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,060
What can you do?

409
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:47,960
Dude, do you know wow or someday you'll»

410
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,180
You know?

411
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,060
C'mon, dude.

412
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,060


413
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,060


414
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,080
to them, I don't feel like I'm coming out.

415
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,080


416
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,120
I mean, I'm like, well, I just feel like they hell wanted me to call mom."

417
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,320
The other thing is, in the Science Fictionakin' smoothie, I like to call it Momatra and Twitter

418
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,320


419
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,320


420
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,760
It's the one that I recently reading super high quality movies about.

421
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,660
Can you guess where they go, Grant?

422
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:05,920
I don't have a clue.

423
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,020
Oh, stunning.

424
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,020


425
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,040
It's called See You and Meet the Secrets by Ross Harris and forçaIshom.

426
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:11,660
I tripped down a cloud and fell eight miles high.

427
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:17,300
I tore my mind on a jagged sky.

428
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:26,320
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in.

429
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:35,320
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, what condition my condition was in.

430
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,220
guitar solo

431
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:52,900
I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in.

432
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:04,700
I watched myself crawling out as I was crawling in.

433
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:13,720
I got up so tight I couldn't unwind.

434
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,300
I saw so much I broke my mind.

435
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:28,180
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in.

436
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,220
guitar solo

437
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:55,560
I pressed my shoulder and my although was broken.

438
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,060
I もっと UFFEEDED

439
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,060


440
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,540
You say this is dark.

441
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,040
Yeah,первых, I think you are.

442
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,040


443
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:06,040
is sleeping, Man겠어

444
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:13,520
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, what condition my condition was in.

445
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:30,680
Someone painted a poor fool in pink black letters on my dead inside.

446
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:43,280
I had my foot on the gas as I left the road and blew out my mind.

447
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:52,540
Eight miles out of Memphis and I got no spring here.

448
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,640
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere.

449
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,660
I just dropped my gun.

450
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:00,660


451
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:06,700
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in.

452
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:18,440
I said I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in.

453
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,080
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah.

454
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:46,380
Oh chain just flows fast like a wave.

455
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,320
maisÉ

456
00:26:51,120 --> 00:27:00,380
Everybody bottom and poor were smilesing,

457
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:00,660
Andrea

458
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,560
Well, if I told you, you probably wouldn't believe me.

459
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,840
I'm very polite vampire.

460
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,660
With all this trouble, I won't eat a bat.

461
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,840
So that should answer how I got so fat.

462
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,260
I'm like Trump, the way he gets grouchy when he's corrected by Dr. Fauci.

463
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:25,200
Dr. Fauci said earlier this week that the lag in testing was, in fact, a failing.

464
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,240
Do you take responsibility for that?

465
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,400
Yeah, no, I don't take responsibility at all.

466
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,100
This is an outrage.

467
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,540
My life for him.

468
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,700
My life for him.

469
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
Well, how do you feel, Ms. Breske?

470
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:49,340
The U.S. itself has overtaken China now as the country with the most cases of the virus.

471
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,480
It is the new global epicenter.

472
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,860
85,991 confirmed cases in the United States.

473
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,160
And I think our economy will start to pick up very substantially.

474
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,760
As soon as the states get open.

475
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,240
And it's happening as we speak.

476
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,460
And it's actually very exciting.

477
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,820
And people are just thrilled to see it.

478
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,420
Stay prepared.

479
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,900
Like the scouts taught me.

480
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,660
One step ahead.

481
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,880
Because they still haven't caught me.

482
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,560
Keep your hands to yourself.

483
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,820
And your money on the shelf.

484
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,460
It's a pandemic.

485
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,240
Stay sane.

486
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,160
In a world gone crazy.

487
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,360
We'll stand up to the challenge.

488
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,140
And we ain't lazy.

489
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,960
We'll do what we have to do to stand up to this pandemic.

490
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,220
The greatest generation is still around.

491
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,920
You can hear them every night.

492
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,720
If you listen for the sound.

493
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,560
If you can't.

494
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,100
They'll squeeze off another round.

495
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,640
It's a pandemic.

496
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,920
It's a pandemic.

497
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,600
Biochemical weapons.

498
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,180
Also known as Project Terror.

499
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,360
Designed to take out an entire populace in a controlled landlocked area.

500
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,800
You're supplying it to them?

501
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,940
What about countering with atropine and PAMP2?

502
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,860
Interferes with the neurotoxin delivery.

503
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,900
Sets off the cell blaster.

504
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,640
And you're gushing blood and pus through every sacred hole in your body.

505
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,720
Hepatizing.

506
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,480
Correct.

507
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,440
But we found that a small percentage of people are not affected.

508
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,080
And within this small percentage lies a cure.

509
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,960
We have to get back to my lab.

510
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,380
This infection will spread all over the world to every man, woman and child.

511
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:50,560
All of the sickness of the world and its people are here in one motion picture for you to witness.

512
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,620
Yes, it's a sick, sick, sick world.

513
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,160
Follow this motion picture and its unbelievable cast.

514
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,660
As the camera takes you through a maze of unforgettable sights.

515
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,640
Sights that you will never, never forget.

516
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,900
History teaches us that when the great plague hits, those who don't die alone usually die in church.

517
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,680
So, we may find nothing in this one, but if we do, try to think of the bodies as cordwood.

518
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,060
Make it easier.

519
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,460
Cordwood.

520
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,620
We are dead.

521
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:31,540
And this is hell.

522
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,880
Come on down and meet your maker.

523
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,500
Come on down and make the stand.

524
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,580
Come on down.

525
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,360
Come on down.

526
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,320
Come on down.

527
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,340
And move it.

528
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,380
Make it stand.

529
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,380
Come on down.

530
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,400
Make it stand.

531
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:54,440
Yeah.

532
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:55,140


533
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:09,880
Oh, come on down and meet your maker.

534
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,480
Come on down and make the stand.

535
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,520
Come on down.

536
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,340
Come on down.

537
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,300
Come on down.

538
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,300
We'll make the stand.

539
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,660
Bring out your dead!

540
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,580
The monster's coming!

541
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,600
He's coming!

542
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,640
Bring out your dead!

543
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,300
Bring out your dead!

544
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,180
The monster's coming!

545
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,700
Bring out your dead!

546
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,380
We're damned.

547
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,300
Yes.

548
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,240
I know.

549
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,920
Oh, turn on the radio, will you?

550
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,020
Hello there. I guess this morning there's only one topic of conversation.

551
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:03,480
You can call it the superflu, or by its West Coast name, Captain Trips, but it means the same thing either way.

552
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,660
There have been some horror stories about the Army clamping down on everything.

553
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,820
The Army?

554
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,760
Just be patient with me. Remember, I'm running the show all by myself. Everyone else called in sick.

555
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:20,700
The numbers are the same as always, though. 555-TALK and 555-CHAT. So let's go.

556
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,360
Hello there. This is Ray Flowers, and it's time to...

557
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm calling from Portsmouth.

558
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,040
What's your name?

559
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:33,480
Leonora. Listen, Ray, I just want everyone to know that there are soldiers burning bodies across the state line in Kittery.

560
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,920
Also, my little girl died this morning.

561
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,940
I guess she's with Jesus now.

562
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,100
I'm sorry as hell, Leonora.

563
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,100
Ray, I think the soldiers did it. I think they made a bug that's like killing people.

564
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,440
That wouldn't be very American now, would it?

565
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,980
No, I guess not.

566
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,180
Of course, that's never stopped the real patriots among us.

567
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,120
Does it? You try to hang in there, Leonora.

568
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,100
I'm trying, Ray. But have you ever smelled bodies on fire?

569
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,740
I can't say that I have.

570
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,240
It's awful, Ray. It's just...

571
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,720
You just try to hang in there, hon. You're on the air, and it's time to speak your piece.

572
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,860
First of all, I just want to tell you that I love your show, Ray.

573
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,260
You say you saw these G.I.s gunning down unarmed civilians?

574
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,120
You're not going to tell me that you saw these G.I.s gunning down unarmed civilians?

575
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,360
You're not going to tell me that you saw these G.I.s gunning down unarmed civilians?

576
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:28,360


577
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,100
Open in the name of the United States government!

578
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,740
Tell you what, Portland, it looks like the Marines have landed.

579
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,720
They don't look too happy.

580
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,260
This is a joke! Right? I mean, this has got to be a joke!

581
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,060
I don't think so, Franny. I really don't think so.

582
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,360
I don't think so, Franny. I really don't think so.

583
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,220
Hi there, you're on the air.

584
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,560
Ray, you alright?

585
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,600
Well, to tell you the truth, honey, it doesn't look real good for the kid right now.

586
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,360
Several soldiers have just broken into the studio.

587
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,640
They're fully armed and they're dressed in some kind of protective clothing.

588
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,120
They're wearing respirators on their faces.

589
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:57,960
They're wearing respirators on their faces.

590
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,680
Shut it down!

591
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,300
Hey, Bluto, you ever heard of a little number called Freedom of Speech?

592
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:02,760
Hey, Bluto, you ever heard of a little number called Freedom of Speech?

593
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,660
Bill of Rights? Any of that ring a bell?

594
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,540
Folks, I've just been ordered by my uninvited fascist guest to shut down.

595
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:09,940
Folks, I've just been ordered by my uninvited fascist guest to shut down.

596
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,580
And I've refused.

597
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,880
Oh, Ray, shut the door!

598
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,140
Oh my God, what's happening?

599
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,400
I don't know, honey.

600
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,200
I don't know.

601
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,260
He's closer now!

602
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,440
The hard case!

603
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,280
The dark man!

604
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,700
He's coming!

605
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,840
He's closer now!

606
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,780
The dark man!

607
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,540
Whether a state of war between China and Russia still exists is not important any longer.

608
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:35,960
Whether a state of war between China and Russia still exists is not important any longer.

609
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,200
Our fellow countrymen are dying.

610
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,720
Naturally, we'll have more on this story as soon as it develops.

611
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,920
We now return you to the President's address already in progress.

612
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,520
Winning!

613
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,040
Winning!

614
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,640
You are going to get so sick of winning!

615
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,300
USA! USA! USA!

616
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,240
My life for you!

617
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,900
There were a couple times when I didn't think you were buying him.

618
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,220
But this was an emergency.

619
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,160
This is a class one emergency.

620
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,040
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.

621
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,380
Stay in your homes. Stay in your homes.

622
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,400
Those found without specific military orders are subject to summary execution.

623
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,700
Stay in your homes.

624
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,080
Repeat, Conrad Channel.

625
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,760
This is a class one emergency.

626
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,520
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.

627
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,520
Please remain calm. Stay in your homes.

628
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,560
I am officially declaring a national emergency.

629
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,340
I am officially declaring a national emergency.

630
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,900
Two very big words.

631
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,100
It will go away. Just stay calm.

632
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,020
It will go away.

633
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,180
And it will go away.

634
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,560
And we're going to have a great victory.

635
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,000
It's going to go away. Hopefully at the end of the month.

636
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,280
And if not, hopefully we'll be soon after that.

637
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,900
He says a coronavirus is a hoax.

638
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,100
The fact is, the President himself is a hoax.

639
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,840
The White House has done a con.

640
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,460
The White House has done a con.

641
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,400
She scoffs at holiness!

642
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,780
Punisher! Punisher!

643
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,820
Punisher! Punisher!

644
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,300
Punisher! Punisher!

645
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,360
I am an epidemiologist,

646
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,060
and I'm telling you, you are going to listen.

647
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,760
Now, if you would like to call a private physician, you can.

648
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,020
You're damn right I can.

649
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,620
I can walk right out of here, too.

650
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,820
Oh, no, you can't.

651
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,420
This is an infectious disease,

652
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,540
and if you do not cooperate,

653
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,080
I have the authority to detain you here for public safety.

654
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,840
Shall I call security?

655
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:09,620
No.

656
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,100
You won't take it.

657
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,480
This is a very serious disease.

658
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,560
Now, you can either take this medicine and hopefully not get sick,

659
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,780
or you can just sit here and wait to see what happens.

660
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,640
A cure?

661
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,020
That is not until we found somebody from the other side

662
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,280
who almost saw us batches at it.

663
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,460
Science comes first, but business comes first.

664
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,120
Then you realized

665
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,640
if you could infect a large enough populace

666
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,100
and experiment then at survivors,

667
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,200
you'd find a cure.

668
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,400
I swore to my men

669
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,020
that I'd do everything in my power

670
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,840
to keep them alive.

671
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,300
That's what I intended to pray.

672
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:44,940
Understand?

673
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,540
Understand.

674
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,500
I never had a choice.

675
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,700
I never had a choice.

676
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,580
It's real pretty.

677
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration,

678
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,640
kidney failure,

679
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,160
complete circulatory collapse,

680
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,400
your blood pressure plummets,

681
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,460
body goes into shock.

682
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,540
Within 24 hours, without medical treatment,

683
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,300
you are dead.

684
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,160
You're dead, you're dead, you're dead,

685
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,420
you're dead and out of this world.

686
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,700
You'll never get a second chance.

687
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,280
Plan all your moves in advance.

688
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,680
Stay dead, stay dead, stay dead,

689
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,160
stay dead and out of this world.

690
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,140
Run faster, stand in the fire.

691
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,920
There's too much work to be done.

692
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,380
You're down, you're down, you're down,

693
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,680
you're down and out of this world.

694
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,520
I'm a killer.

695
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,380
I'm a killer.

696
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,120
I'm a killer.

697
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,540
I'm a killer.

698
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:47,540


699
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:47,540


700
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:47,540


701
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,000
Don't ever talk with your eyes.

702
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,320
Make sure that you compromise.

703
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,280
You're dead, you're dead, you're dead,

704
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,580
you're dead and out of this world.

705
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,540
You hear the unloved

706
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,540
weeping like rain

707
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:17,540


708
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:17,540


709
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:17,540


710
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:17,540


711
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,840
Thank you.

712
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,420
Thank you.

713
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,100
Thank you.

714
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,900
I'm a businessman, not military.

715
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,840
You haven't had to do it.

716
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,120
But we have to get back to my lab.

717
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:01,920
No!

718
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,500
I don't suppose there are any other biochemical engineers around?

719
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,420
No.

720
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,080
No.

721
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:13,640
No.

722
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,800
Yeah, me neither.

723
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,720
What's going to happen, Dr. Wilson?

724
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,480
Is everybody in the world going to die before someone finds the answer?

725
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,120
No.

726
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,460
I don't think so.

727
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,020
We'll find an answer.

728
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,880
When, Doctor?

729
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,200
We need it right now.

730
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,220
I need it.

731
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,020
I don't deny there's some strange evolutionary process going on.

732
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,120
But mankind won't be destroyed.

733
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,640
Unless...

734
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,620
Unless...

735
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,400
Unless what?

736
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,720
I don't know.

737
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,900
If you're a smart guy, you'll figure something out.

738
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,100
Those cells are still living off one another.

739
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,840
I'm sure you're right.

740
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,680
I'm sure they're still alive.

741
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,880
You heard that all communications are ended outside the Continental Limits?

742
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,820
Yes, I heard.

743
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,560
That leaves it in our laps.

744
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,980
So we keep trying.

745
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,680
You two stay on this virus theory until I decide it's exhausted.

746
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,500
Right.

747
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,480
And until further notice, this station will continue.

748
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,780
It's around the clock coverage of this national disaster.

749
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:15,200
And now we switch you to the State Capitol where the Governor is speaking from the Executive

750
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,040
Mansion.

751
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,080


752
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,080


753
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,080


754
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,080


755
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,080


756
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,080


757
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,660
The Federal Government declared this state to be a disaster area.

758
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,200
Public health is dependent on bodies of the deceased being burned.

759
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,720
You must notify the Health Department immediately.

760
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,720
Have a plague victim in your home.

761
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,160
Under no circumstances should you gather public.

762
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,300
If you're the dire emergency that exists, I intend to...

763
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,720
What's the matter with you?

764
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,160
Nothing, and I'm going to keep it that way.

765
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,560
Look, let's talk about this.

766
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,100
There's nothing to talk about.

767
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,540
You think I'm out of my mind.

768
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,100
You might be one of them.

769
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,940
Look, you're ill.

770
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,960
You ought to see a doctor.

771
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,780
No doctors.

772
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,940
You take care of your life, I'll take care of mine.

773
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,180
Now get away from here.

774
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:49,840
You understand?

775
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,900
Get away from here!

776
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,740
I'm going to combine you all into the station.

777
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,440
Being quarantined isn't that bad, is it?

778
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:00,700
Lonely.

779
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,920
So very lonely.

780
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,060
So very, very, very, very lonely.

781
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,660
Why must I stay here?

782
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:15,760
Why must I stay here?

783
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:15,760


784
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,960
Why do I have to be in this lonely room?

785
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:25,000
Watching the gong show and thinking of you.

786
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:32,500
Loneliest chair, loneliest bed, loneliest deja vu

787
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,960
In the loneliest, loneliest, loneliest, loneliest room

788
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,420
In the world

789
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:53,380
I tried marijuana, cocaine and heroin

790
00:42:53,380 --> 00:43:01,140
But they just can't seem to get the thought of you out from under my skin

791
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:07,980
I'm lonelier now, lonelier than I've ever been

792
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:13,840
In the loneliest, loneliest, loneliest, loneliest room

793
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,520
In the world

794
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,440
Phone never rings

795
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,880
Postman never brings the thing

796
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,880
Even the singles clubs won't give me a whirl

797
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,580
Plants all dead, even my cactus

798
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,140
Beer cans round my bed

799
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:46,640
In the loneliest room in the world

800
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,380
I tried marijuana

801
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,760
Cocaine and heroin

802
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:02,740
Can't seem to get the thought of you out from under my skin

803
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:09,300
I'm the loneliest man, lonelier than I've ever been

804
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:19,840
In the loneliest, loneliest, loneliest room in the world

805
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,640
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

806
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,600
I'm not sorry for myself.

807
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,800
I'm sorry for that Miss Wright who can't find me.

808
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:45,880
Miss Wright, I'm thinking of you tonight.

809
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,240
And you alone at night.

810
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,080
And you alone.

811
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:54,180
And some of the stuff won't even answer your phone.

812
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,940
You got the blues.

813
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,420
The low-down singles club blues.

814
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,620
And the lonely blues.

815
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,720
You might even be lonely.

816
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,940
My darling baby.

817
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,040
It's lonely.

818
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,180
Lonely.

819
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,240
Lonely.

820
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:18,820
Lonely.

821
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:30,480
And as soon as they bring back pork rinds and Monday night football, I'm going to be in redneck heaven.

822
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,660
Stay sane in a world gone crazy.

823
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,920
We'll stand up to the challenge.

824
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,620
And we ain't lazy.

825
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:44,500
We'll do what we have to do to stand up to this pandemic.

826
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,220
The Cougar.

827
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:48,220


828
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:48,220


829
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:48,220


830
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:48,220


831
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:48,220


832
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:48,220


833
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:48,220


834
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:48,220


835
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,720
The greatest generation is still around.

836
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:55,240
You can hear them every night if you listen for the sound.

837
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,640
If you can't, they'll squeeze off another round.

838
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,020
It's a pandemic.

839
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,840
With our gloves on, we reach our hands to heaven.

840
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,520
Wearing masks like we're robbing a 7-Eleven.

841
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:16,320
We keep our distance to secure our existence.

842
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,680
It's a pandemic.

843
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:24,220
It crept upon us like a thief in the night.

844
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,480
But we got what it takes to win this fight.

845
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,180
We'll do what we can and we'll do what's right in this pandemic.

846
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:45,400
Sacrifices are the price we pay for another chance to live another day.

847
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,220
Stay together, but stay strong.

848
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:48,220


849
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,100
Stay six feet away.

850
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,700
It's a pandemic.

851
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,300
Another question being asked forcibly is whether now is the right time to reopen the U.S. economy.

852
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:05,920
In Georgia today, hairdressers, nail salons, tattoo parlors were able to resume business,

853
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,620
even though coronavirus is still a serious problem in the state.

854
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,040
Now we're opening it up and it's opening up far faster than anybody thought even possible.

855
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,340
And there now.

856
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,440
It's a life.

857
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,360
It's got a life.

858
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,900
And we're putting out that life because that's a bad life that we're talking about.

859
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,760
Yeah, well, just don't forget what you promised when you get back.

860
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,600
Dinner, dancing, and all the paparazzi I can smile at.

861
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,340
Yeah, yeah, you got it.

862
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,800
Be ready in five minutes.

863
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:34,860
You bring the towels.

864
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:35,780
I get the penicillin.

865
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:47,320
Sick World is the story of vice, perversion, degradation that has infested the earth since the time of the pandemic.

866
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:47,320


867
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:47,320


868
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:47,320


869
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:47,320


870
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:47,320


871
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:47,320


872
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:47,320


873
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:47,320


874
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:47,320


875
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,120
We have a question that Adam and Eve send in the Garden of Paradise.

876
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:03,260
This is the shocking story of the world and its unholy inhabitants, feeling no pain or shame for the life that they lead.

877
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:11,360
Well, looks like things are finally going to get back to normal, I think we learned a lesson here.

878
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:12,080
What's that?

879
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,140
I don't know.

880
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:28,080
The unquenched desires of sex and the sensualists in their search for pleasures are unparalleled in this motion picture.

881
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:37,560
For a ringside seat that takes you into the lust-filled caverns of life, see, it's a sick, sick, sick world.

882
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,540
This motion picture has something for everyone.

883
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,140
This is a picture you must not miss.

884
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,340
A picture you will always remember.

885
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,760
It's a sick, sick, sick world.

886
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,700
And it's waiting for you.

887
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:07,720
This event will force us to totally restructure our intelligence system.

888
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,580
The Atlanta Disease Control Center told me that these masks wouldn't stop a flu germ with a hangover.

889
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,200
Oh, no, no, no. Shake hands, kid.

890
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,180
Sure. You old dog. How's that golf games?

891
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,300
That's nice.

892
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,660
I think that at some point that's going to sort of just disappear, I hope.

893
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,640
You still believe so?

894
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,740
I do. Yeah, sure.

895
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:35,760
In the thick of this crisis, the president travels to South Dakota July 5th for an X-Day celebration at Mount Rushmore.

896
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,380
There won't be any social distancing and mask wearing will be up to the attendees.

897
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:46,080
You are going to get so sick, sick, sick.

898
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,220
Please go.

899
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:47,940
And get tested.

900
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,360
Please wear a mask.

901
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:52,180
You're not listening to some loser public health doctor.

902
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,780
They destroyed the world.

903
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:54,960
Get them out the way.

904
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:55,640
Isn't that the...

905
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,920
We'll find an answer.

906
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,700
When, doctor?

907
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,340
Tonight.

908
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,440
It's a special night.

909
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,140
What's so special about tonight?

910
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,180
Let's see. What date is it?

911
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,560
What's the date?

912
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,820
July 5th.

913
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:08,940
We're in luck.

914
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:15,860
It says here the planet is going to be hit by a huge asteroid and blown to smithereens on this very day.

915
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:16,300
Hmm?

916
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:16,300


917
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,420
What's the date of July?

918
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,900
What the hell it is? It's Sunday.

919
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,260
Sunday?

920
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,520
Sunday I always dress for dinner.

921
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,900
Well, you turned something on. I'm starting to think.

922
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,760
The plague took the people, but it couldn't take the gadgets, could it?

923
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,920
No, they're all still out there.

924
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,760
Just waiting for someone to come along and pick them up.

925
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,140
Everything from electric can openers to cobalt bombs.

926
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,700
And we'll devour to him, brother, just a little nitro.

927
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,720
I can get the cannons out of the old God Armory.

928
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,620
We can have him out of there in no time.

929
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,500
I said no.

930
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,280
I said no.

931
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,140
We could.

932
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,520
But then the curse will begin all over again, don't you see?

933
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,320
Here is evil.

934
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:53,500
Evil.

935
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:58,340
Unless...

936
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,560
What's wrong with this picture?

937
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:02,980
It's the old way.

938
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,440
And the old way was a death trip.

939
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,260
We say fine.

940
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:14,580
And then we go right back to tinkering with the power station, trying to recreate the world that damn near choked the human race to death.

941
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,280
And the sea is gone.

942
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,360
And the scavenger hunt starts today.

943
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,820
Big day today.

944
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,060
We should've thrown a party.

945
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:27,240
All he needs is one guy to target some scutt missile with an A-bomb on it.

946
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:30,820
Meanwhile...

947
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,320
God, I fear you.

948
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:38,480
Bombed him.

949
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:39,660
Bombed him.

950
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,480
Bombed him.

951
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:42,840
Bombed him.

952
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,940
Bombed him.

953
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,100
Bombed him.

954
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:45,800
Bombed him.

955
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,380
I, if not a robot, stick to this.

956
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:51,100
Stuck in my room.

957
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,100


958
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,100


959
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,100


960
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,100


961
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,100


962
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,100


963
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,100


964
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,100


965
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,100


966
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,100


967
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,100


968
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,320
Call me Genevieve.

969
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,340
Call me Lanceceğiz.

970
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:53,840
Call me Bruce.

971
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,980
My life for you.

972
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,300
My life for you.

973
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:58,700
Humph!

974
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,400
Surprised.

975
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,180
A big loud one?

976
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:04,660
Well...

977
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,120
It's time...

978
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,580
To make you stand.

979
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:11,420
Come on town, come on town

980
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,340
Come on town, we're gonna make this right

981
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,340
Come on town, come on town

982
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,340
Come on town, we're gonna make this right

983
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,700
The challenge

984
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,860
Has just begun

985
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,960
The song must now be sung

986
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,400
For the world

987
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,780
Has now been spoken

988
00:52:54,780 --> 00:53:00,500
The chance has just begun

989
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,840
On the wheels, on the wheels of life

990
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,700
On the wheels, on the wheels

991
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,720
On the wheels of life

992
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,000
Segway to the present

993
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,540
Morning

994
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,840
July 5th

995
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:11,700
South Dakota

996
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,760
Mind you, it's now 5 a.m.

997
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,840
It's a roadway in

998
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,360
The most disgusting hellhole on earth

999
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,740
For the room adjacent to it

1000
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,560
Smelled like pee

1001
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,140
And it was nasty

1002
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,920
I didn't realize how thin these walls were

1003
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,300
We heard people fighting in the other room

1004
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:30,200
It's all slipping through your fingers

1005
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:35,380
Everything you've made here is falling apart

1006
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,600
Your time will end

1007
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,740
And I'll be watching from hell

1008
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,560
With your baby in my arms

1009
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,260
Shut up!

1010
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,020
It's daddy, stupid!

1011
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,060
Where's my book?

1012
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:47,600
Good evening, sir

1013
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,920
Actually, I was only kidding

1014
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,740
Everything all right?

1015
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,960
The gracious, uh, is being handled

1016
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,440
Like a child, put his hands over his ears

1017
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,880
Now get the hell out of here

1018
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,140
Is that all it has been?

1019
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,020
Only three years

1020
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,320
Seems like a hundred million

1021
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,200
Oh

1022
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,820
So why'd you get me out of here?

1023
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,960
Me and some of the others are cutting loose

1024
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,360
Cut loose where?

1025
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,600
South America

1026
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,020
It's nice

1027
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,380
Fresh water, fresh fruit

1028
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,400
And just plain folks

1029
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,980
Once you want to forget they ever hooked up with

1030
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,180
His infernal majesty

1031
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:23,920
So what do you say?

1032
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:24,800
I'm sticking

1033
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,280
Why?

1034
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,080
It's going bad here, can't you feel it?

1035
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:28,520
Maybe

1036
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,520
But it changed me, you know?

1037
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,000
Man, you're nuts

1038
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,760
You're probably right

1039
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,420
The time is...

1040
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,220
The president's next day celebration at Mount Rushmore

1041
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,220
Ladies and gentlemen

1042
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,540
The president of the United States

1043
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,480
Very importantly

1044
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,020
Very important

1045
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:52,460
And

1046
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:56,480
This kind of, uh, an event

1047
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,760
He's been sick

1048
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:04,680
I think his wife is gonna bring him some chicken soup

1049
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,680
He's been sick

1050
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:05,680


1051
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:08,560
He's been sick

1052
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:08,560


1053
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:08,560


1054
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:08,560


1055
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:08,560


1056
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:08,560


1057
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:08,560


1058
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,000
Oh, sir

1059
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,180
Sir

1060
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,720
This man is dying

1061
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,060
Someone got a doctor

1062
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:14,880
Suddenly

1063
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,520
Now what?

1064
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,600
Fading away

1065
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,900
It's going to fade away

1066
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,000
Apparently the joke's on you

1067
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,900
What?

1068
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,460
Just a few moments

1069
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,440
Your entire planet is going to be destroyed

1070
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,260
Oh!

1071
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,160
We tried to warn you, Magnifico

1072
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,040
But you would have none of it

1073
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,400
You know it is going away

1074
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,500
Wait a minute

1075
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,680
Wait just a minute

1076
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,820
One damn minute

1077
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,060
Oh my God, no!

1078
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,580
Oh, my God!

1079
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,140
Oh!

1080
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,660
Oh, my God!

1081
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:44,660


1082
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:48,540
Come, come, nuclear bomb

1083
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,100
Oh, my God!

1084
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:51,260
Oh, my God!

1085
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,080
Oh, my God!

1086
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,720
Oh, my God!

1087
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,200
Oh, my God!

1088
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,960
Every day is like Sunday

1089
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:04,860
Every day is like Sunday

1090
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:04,860


1091
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,840
Every day is like Sunday

1092
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,100
On your face

1093
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:48,460
Every day is like Sunday

1094
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:57,080
Win yourself a cheap trade

1095
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,040
Share some grease to you

1096
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:04,840
With a nice drink

1097
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,660
With a nice drink

1098
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,100
With a nice drink

1099
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:09,960
Every day

1100
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,580
Is like Sunday

1101
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,600
Camping actively

1102
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,740
Is like Sunday

1103
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:27,880
What are you doing?

1104
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,420
Parking actively

1105
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,340
Don't cry

1106
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:34,760
What the fuck?

1107
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,740
I'm not sorry!

1108
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,640
I'm not sorry!

1109
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,080
Did you see that?

1110
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,340
Yeah, he blowed up.

1111
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,120
Blowed up good.

1112
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,180
Blowed up real good.

1113
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,400
It is finished.

1114
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,280
White magic.

1115
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,900
That's all that's left.

1116
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:01,980
The flu.

1117
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:03,840
Who says it's gone?

1118
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,660
Who knows if our babies are going to be immune?

1119
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,060
Anyone here not a downer?

1120
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,280
I thought you were going to be fine.

1121
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,180
Why this is important.

1122
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,820
In the event of a nuclear attack, there will be a three minute warning.

1123
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,360
But everything will work out because

1124
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:21,160
if at the moment that warning sounds you can take enough acid,

1125
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:24,420
that three minutes will last for about 60,000 years.

1126
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:31,060
The white light of the explosion will creep towards you very gradually over the centuries like an ice sheet.

1127
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,480
The missiles will hang in the sky like the moon.

1128
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:41,840
Over the years, a white hot bus will gradually inch its way through the front of your conservatory.

1129
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,540
Your dead neighbour strapped to the front like Garfield on a bin lorry.

1130
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:55,500
Many of your later years will be spent at quite a high altitude, watching your body gradually disassemble.

1131
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:59,820
When your organs start to leave, you will have time to wish them goodbye.

1132
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:04,740
You will say farewell to your penis like a first born son who's been off to work.

1133
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:04,740


1134
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:04,900
You will say goodbye to university.

1135
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,000
You will wonder if there's a tear in your eye.

1136
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:12,020
But it will just be the fact that your actual eye is boiling.

1137
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:17,320
As you finally die, your consciousness will touch that of Buddha.

1138
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,600
Someone will finally have understood you.

1139
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,360
Buddha will have understood you.

1140
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,440
And he will thank you for teaching him the meaning of contempt.

1141
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:31,500
Flicking out a long frog-like tongue, he will consume you.

1142
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,860
And a sign will appear in the sky that reads,

1143
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,120
You have mastered 2% of this adventure.

1144
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,960
Oh Jesus, when are you going to cut me some slack, huh?

1145
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,900
Goodnight, sewers.

1146
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,340
Thank you, Susie the Floozy and WREK.

1147
