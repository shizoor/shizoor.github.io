1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Once again, dear friends, because our new virtual studio is undergoing renovation,

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,600
and because it's better this way anyway,

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,580
the Hour of Slack makes way for Reverend Susie the Floozies,

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,580
Bob's Slacktime Funhouse from beautiful WREK Atlanta.

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,480
This time, show number 195 from August 1997,

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,380
Susie's Boot Camp War-O-Rama.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,040
The address was this, Slacktooth, Synth.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,940
Slacktooth meant slaughterhouse.

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,560
Synth was good old five.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,480
Oh, what's wrong with my alarm clock?

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,120
Oh, hey, what am I doing sleeping in a cot in a room full of losers?

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,320
Oh, no, where's my hair?

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,040
Oh, wait, now I remember.

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,980
Today, my company and I are getting married.

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,300
I'm shipped off to the front lines in Tierra del Nigi.

17
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,740
How the hell did I wind up here?

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,500
Oh, no.

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,180
It all began so innocently.

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,700
I'd wanted some novelty in my life,

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,440
but I was torn between getting a tattoo or a body piercing.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,820
So I settled on having my labia tattooed.

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,980
I was sad.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,480
I was so deliriously excited

25
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,200
that I didn't notice I was two doors down from the tattoo parlor.

26
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,920
I did notice the weird decor.

27
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,560
Just a couple of tasks and some majorly tacky posters on the wall.

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,880
Oh, but I sure could relate to their message.

29
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,080
Looking for a few good men?

30
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,960
Tell me about it.

31
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,600
Yeah, I thought the attendants were way overdressed.

32
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,980
The one I could trust.

33
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,200
The one I could talk to.

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,200


35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,200


36
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,040
The one I got was going on and on about something

37
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,100
but you know how I never listen anyhow.

38
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,140
Oh, I was too busy anticipating all that delicious pain.

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,360
Oh, and then there were so many copies of the release forms to sign

40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,000
and then I was directed through the door

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,060
at the back of the room.

42
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,660
Oh, and then the horror really kicked in.

43
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,060
Oh, I'd been looking for a painful life ouiiife commitment,

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,120
but instead now I'm in for four years of absolute hell.

45
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:29,960
Brook SiIfish Bit I've Only Been Flowing from the Immortal on Stage

46
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


47
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


48
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,780
Because now I'm private force class Susie the floozy.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,220
And I'm going to Paris.

50
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,620
Paris Island Marine Boot Camp.

51
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,080
Ah!

52
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,300
Ah!

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,880
This is beautiful, eh?

54
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,920
Yeah, but it's hot.

55
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,620
Oh, we'll have a swell town.

56
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
Yeah, hot time.

57
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,300
Just like the movies, eh, Nivocki?

58
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,040
Yeah, just like the movies.

59
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,640
It's lovely here, Bob.

60
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,840
How far is it to the barracks?

61
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,920
All on the beach a little ways, north to your right.

62
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,160
Are you comfortable here, Bob?

63
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,340
Sleeping under a palm tree isn't so bad.

64
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,280
Oh, I can't believe it.

65
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,340
It's like a little paradise.

66
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,080
Complete even to the serpent.

67
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,600
Serpent?

68
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,360
But don't worry about anything.

69
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,120
We've rented a fortified chaperone.

70
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:19,980
Ah!

71
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,660
Ah!

72
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,800
Come on, eh!

73
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:22,920
Woo!

74
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,460
All right, men, listen up.

75
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,800
For over 200 years, American servicemen have prepared for, and in many cases, had to face

76
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,760
the ultimate challenge.

77
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,380
That is why we in the oil courses have become experts in fitness.

78
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,820
Now, we don't have any choice.

79
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,040
We have to be.

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,460
During my career in the United States Marines, I've had the opportunity to visit numerous

81
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,900
countries, and I've noticed that many people in those countries share a myth, a myth that

82
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Americans are weak, that Americans are lazy, and Americans are out of shape.

83
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,280
Well, start your day with a little bit of a break.

84
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,280


85
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,380
I mean, right now, we're going to do something about that myth.

86
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,920
We're going to take it, we're going to put it in the palm of our hands, we're going to

87
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,060
crush it, we're going to annihilate it, and we're going to kill it.

88
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,260
Now, this oil forces workout is designed for men and women, boys and girls.

89
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,360
Now, you don't need no leg warmers, fancy running suits.

90
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,700
Now, you don't even need headbands to do the oil forces workout.

91
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,240
I'll tell you what you need.

92
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,760
What you need is discipline.

93
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,420
What you need is desire.

94
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,900
Now, are you ready?

95
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,740
Yes, sir!

96
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,440
Are you motivated?

97
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,220
Yes, sir!

98
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,960
All right, then.

99
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,220
Let's whip it on!

100
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,020
Who raised the frigging flag on Iwo Jima?

101
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,920
On Iwo Jima, on Iwo Jima.

102
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,400
Who raised the frigging flag while the Japs were playing tag?

103
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,380
The United States Marines.

104
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,160
Well, that's more cursing than I like to hear from a cadet in peacetime.

105
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,460
I met a bullet in Paris, France, had a big hole in her underpants.

106
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,780
Wait, wait, wait, wait, where did you pick up that filth?

107
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,320
We heard Sergeant Clark's company singing it, sir.

108
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,480
Yes, well, there will be no smut in my company.

109
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,120
You're in this man's army to learn.

110
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,660
I don't know, but I am told the Parthenon is mighty old.

111
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,780
How old?

112
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,080
We don't know.

113
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,060
Well, that's real good, but needs improvement.

114
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,240
When you've got an obligation and you have to serve your nation, you can get an education.

115
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,160
There's 300 jobs in fighting, some are guaranteed in fighting.

116
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,740
For a future more exciting, just choose Army.

117
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,680
Launch a missile, fly a plane, make a movie, drive a plane.

118
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,500
No matter what you want to do, choose Army and the future's up to you.

119
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,900
So for 300 jobs in fighting, some are guaranteed in fighting.

120
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,400
And a future more exciting, just choose Army.

121
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
The future's up to you.

122
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,220
You've got a future, the future's up to you.

123
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,100
See your Army recruiting.

124
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
Your future, your decision.

125
00:05:59,420 --> 00:05:59,860
Choose Army.

126
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,400
You've done good, but we're not going to stop there.

127
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,080
We're going to continue to whip it on.

128
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,840
You've had some, now you're going to get some more.

129
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,320
Are you ready to whip it on?

130
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:10,720
Yeah!

131
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,700
Are you still with me?

132
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,300
Yes, sir!

133
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,700
All right.

134
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,340
We're going to move it up to 13 repetitions of the daily seven.

135
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,840
And I want you to get mad at it.

136
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:17,660
Ready?

137
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,280
Exercise.

138
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,200
Come on now.

139
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,740
One, two, three, one.

140
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,060
One, two, three.

141
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,740
I don't want no more of the U.S. Marines.

142
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,200
I don't want no more of the U.S. Marines.

143
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,200


144
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,940
Gee, but I want to go home.

145
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,600
Well, cadets, it's been a great year.

146
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,420
You've all worked very hard developing academic skills and general killing skills.

147
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,440
My killing teacher says I'm a natural.

148
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,060
But these skills are nothing without courage and stamina.

149
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:50,640
Traditionally, the Academy tested these virtues by pitting you against each other in a two-day battle royale.

150
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,380
That was prior to 1957.

151
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,100
Thank you very much, State Supreme Court.

152
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,140
Consequently,

153
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,860
no cadet can receive a passing grade for the academic year without first conquering this.

154
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,940
Meet the Eliminator.

155
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,180
That's a 150-foot hand-over-hand crawl across a 60-gauge hemp-tute line with a blister factor of 12.

156
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,560
The rope is suspended a full 40 feet over a solid British acre of old-growth Connecticut Valley thorn bushes.

157
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,600
Gentlemen, welcome to flavor country.

158
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,600
This wasn't in the brochure.

159
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,040
All right, you guys.

160
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,880
You're in the cup on these guys.

161
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,620
I have to be.

162
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,420
Discipline is one of the first things they have to learn.

163
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,200
When a guy graduates from Army OCS, he'll be able to lead men anywhere, in the field, in a civilian career.

164
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,200
That stuff about born leaders just isn't so.

165
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,640
Leaders are made, not born.

166
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,020
Army Officer Candidate School teaches leadership.

167
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,960
It's tough.

168
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,680
It's worth it.

169
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,660
For more details, see your Army recruiter.

170
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,300
Your future.

171
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:42,940
Your decision.

172
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,020
Choose Army OCS.

173
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,600
I have only comparatively recently emerged from the United States Army, so that I am now, of course, in the Army.

174
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:55,600


175
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:55,600


176
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:55,600


177
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:55,600


178
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,640
I'm the Army Radioactive Reserve.

179
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:07,600
The usual jokes about the Army aside, one of the many fine things one has to admit is the way that the Army has carried the American democratic ideal to its logical conclusion,

180
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:14,840
in the sense that not only do they prohibit discrimination on the grounds of race, creed, and color, but also on the grounds of ability.

181
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,080
To say that is a nice thing.

182
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,880
Some of you may recall the publicity a few years ago, attendant upon the Army's search for an official Army song,

183
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,200
to be the counterpart of the Navy's Anchors Away and the Air Force's Up in the Air Junior Birdman song.

184
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:51,100
I was in basic training at the time, and I recall our platoon sergeant, who was an unfrocked Marine,

185
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:02,460
actually the change of service had come as quite a blow to him, because it meant that he had to memorize a new serial number, which took up most of his time.

186
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:13,540
At any rate, I recall this sergeant informing me and my roommates of the...

187
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,040
of this rather deplorable fact that the Army didn't have any official, excuse me, didn't have no official song.

188
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,940
And, uh, suggested... suggested that we work on this in our copious, free time.

189
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,240
Well, I submitted the following song, which is called, It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier, which I think demonstrates the proper spirit, you'll agree.

190
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,240
However, the fact that it did not win the contest, I can ascribe only to blatant favoritism on the part of the judges.

191
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,780
The heart of every man in our platoon must swell with pride,

192
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,260
For the nation's youth, the cream of which is marching at his side.

193
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,660
For the fast and aging rules and regulations that we share,

194
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,260
And the quaint and curious costumes that we're called upon to wear.

195
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,120
Now Al joined up to do his part, defending you and me.

196
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,700
He wants to fight and bleed and kill and die for liberty.

197
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,220
With the hell of war he's come to grips, policing up the filter tips.

198
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,000
It makes a fellow proud to be a soldier.

199
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,700
When Pete was only in the seventh grade, he stabbed a cop.

200
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,220
He's real R.A. material, and he was glad to swap

201
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,100
His switchblade and his old zip gun for a bayonet and a new M1.

202
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,900
It makes a fellow proud to be a soldier.

203
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,420
After Johnny got through basic training, he

204
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,000
Was a soldier through and through when he was done.

205
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,120
Its effects were so well-rooted that the next day he saluted

206
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,580
A good humor man, an usher, and a nun.

207
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,380
Now Fred's an intellectual, brings a book to every meal.

208
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,000
He likes the deep philosophers, like Norman Vincent Peale.

209
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:13,220
He thinks the Army's just the thing because he finds it broadening.

210
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,100
It makes a fellow proud to be a soldier.

211
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,200
Now Ed flunked out of second grade and never finished school.

212
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,580
He doesn't know a shelter half, but he's a soldier.

213
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:25,580


214
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,920
He's a soldier from an entrenching tool, but he's going to be a big success.

215
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,780
He heads his class at OCS.

216
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,660
It makes a fellow proud to be a soldier.

217
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,660
Our old mess sergeant's taste buds have been shot off in the war.

218
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,980
But his savory collations add to our esprit de corps.

219
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,940
To think of all the marvelous ways they're using plastics nowadays.

220
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,000
It makes a fellow proud to be a soldier.

221
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,640
Our lieutenant is the up-and-coming type.

222
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,060
Played with soldiers as a boy, you just can bet.

223
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,200
It is written in the stars, he will get his captain's bars.

224
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,860
But he hasn't got enough box tops yet.

225
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,880
Our captain has a handicap to cope with, sad to tell.

226
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,280
He's from Georgia, and he doesn't speak the language very well.

227
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,980
He used to be, so rumor has, the dean of men at Alcatraz.

228
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,560
It makes a fellow proud to be, what as a kid I vowed to be,

229
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,900
what luck to be allowed to be a soldier.

230
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,240
And to be a soldier is a great lesson.

231
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,240


232
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,240


233
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,320
So, my friends, if you can see that long line,

234
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,580
the long, long line from the various wars

235
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,880
that have protected this nation to give you this right.

236
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,320
And then you'll have some little cock-a-doodle-doo

237
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
that will walk up and say, I just hate war.

238
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,120
Well, idiot, if we hadn't have gone during World War II and stopped the Japanese, you'd

239
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,660
be speaking Japanese now.

240
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:02,620
You wouldn't be having the freedom of working and so forth.

241
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,760
You'd be pulling a rickshaw, you think?

242
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:14,620
And I jest in a way, but those people really turned this old Marine off when they start

243
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,040
that malarkey, okay?

244
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,440
It's a long line that have gone on that fought for that freedom, that standard.

245
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,260
Who led the bloody slaughter in Tarawa?

246
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,080
In Tarawa, in Tarawa.

247
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,640
Who led the bloody slaughter while MacArthur walked on water?

248
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,460
The United States Marines.

249
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,960
Well, what are you waiting for?

250
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,100
Open fire.

251
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,240
Kelly, keep that firing going.

252
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,800
I'll cut across the yard and see if I can knock out that machine gun station.

253
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,260
Once we get them, we can make a run for the truck.

254
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,420
The time's running out, Lieutenant.

255
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,880
In a few minutes, this place will be hotter than the inside of our tank at high noon in

256
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,140
a disc.

257
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,400
Keep firing, Kelly.

258
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:04,700
That's it.

259
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,940
The Lieutenant did it.

260
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,940
Let's get out of here.

261
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,320
No, I got fed up on the war one day and I went up to the CO.

262
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,240
The what?

263
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,340
That's the company commander, they call him.

264
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:15,560
Oh.

265
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:15,840
CO.

266
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,020
Oh, yeah.

267
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,020


268
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,020


269
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,020


270
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,020


271
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,020


272
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,020


273
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,020


274
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,020


275
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,020


276
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,020


277
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,020


278
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,020


279
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,020


280
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,900
I said, if you give me a camel and some water and a gun, I'll go capture this Rommel

281
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,840
and we'll get the war over.

282
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,880
Whoa, whoa, hold it just a minute.

283
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,880
Just, just back up there.

284
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,540
You're gonna take a camel and what, a canteen of water?

285
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,840
Yeah, and a gun.

286
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,940
And you're gonna capture General Rommel, the Desert Fox?

287
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,680
Yeah.

288
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,660
Surely you jest.

289
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,200
Surely I jest said it.

290
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,220
I'm gonna have to repeat it all over again.

291
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,780
No, you don't.

292
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,120
I didn't.

293
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,160
No, I, the CO said, well, it's a crazy idea, but I think, you know, this could happen,

294
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,460
you know.

295
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:59,260
So he, he gave me a, or he gave me the, the camel and the water and the gun.

296
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,540
I took off across the desert.

297
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,080
There she goes.

298
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,000
The whole depot is in flames.

299
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,380
And so is Rommel's plans for continuing the fight in North Africa.

300
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,960
The job's done.

301
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,940
It's finished.

302
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,200
It was finished.

303
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,200


304
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,200


305
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,200


306
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,200


307
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,680
The battle at the Kasserine Pass was stalled for only a few days.

308
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,040
It was all a matter of time.

309
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:29,040
And by May 7th, 1943, the U.S. Second Corps broke through and captured Berserker.

310
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,220
While at the same time, the British First Army took Tunis.

311
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,100
By May 13th, the North African campaign was over.

312
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,200
And they found me out there about two weeks later.

313
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,580
Almost dead, dying of thirst.

314
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,060
Yeah, it was sunburned and everything.

315
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,080
Boy, I had third degree plus plantas and everything.

316
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,280
Yeah, man, you might as well have had flat feet.

317
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:57,600
Yeah.

318
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,760
Anyway, the CO picked me up and fanned me and gave me a drink of water.

319
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,340
And he says, T5, Haynes?

320
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,760
That's what it was.

321
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,840
It was a T5.

322
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,460
He says, we got your message.

323
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,140
Returning immediately.

324
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,180
Thank you.

325
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,480
Returning immediately.

326
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,280
Rommel captured.

327
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,880
I said, that ain't what I sent.

328
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,960
I said, returning immediately.

329
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,260
Camel ruptured.

330
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:44,720
Down through the years, there have been men, brave gallant men, who have died that others

331
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,340
might be free.

332
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,100
And even now, they do it still.

333
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,540
Brave gallant men know that someone might, and so they will.

334
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,000
Gallant men have built us a nation.

335
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,200
Passed us a torch of flame.

336
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,000
Let us hold it high and light up the sky.

337
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,200
With praise.

338
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,380
With faith.

339
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,800
Of our gallant men.

340
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,900
The colonel coughed and coughed.

341
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,100
Then he said to Billy, you one of my boys?

342
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,760
This was a man who had lost an entire regiment, about 4,500 men.

343
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,760
A lot of them children, actually.

344
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,140
Billy didn't reply.

345
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,560
The question made no sense.

346
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,900
What was your outfit?

347
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,680
Said the colonel.

348
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,940
He coughed and coughed.

349
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,520
Every time he inhaled, his lungs rattled like greasy paper bags.

350
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,980
Billy couldn't remember the outfit he was from.

351
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,960
You from the 451st?

352
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,560
451st what?

353
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,080
Said Billy.

354
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,180
There was a silence.

355
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,180
Infantry regiment, said the colonel.

356
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,180


357
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,180


358
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,180


359
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,180


360
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,180


361
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,180


362
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,180


363
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,500
At last.

364
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,780
Oh, said Billy.

365
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,800
There was another long silence, with the colonel dying and dying, drowning where he

366
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,020
stood.

367
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,760
Then he cried out, wettly, it's me, boys.

368
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,520
It's Wild Bob.

369
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,380
That is what he had always wanted his troops to call him.

370
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,340
Wild Bob.

371
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,000
None of the people who could hear him were actually from his regiment, except for Roland

372
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,340
Weary.

373
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,520
And Weary wasn't listening.

374
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,080
All Weary could think of was the agony in his own feet.

375
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,320
But the colonel imagined that he was addressing his beloved troops for the last time.

376
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,800
And he told them that they had nothing to be ashamed of, that there were dead Germans all

377
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,160
over the battlefield who wished to guide them.

378
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,700
And, oh my God, they'd never heard of the 451st.

379
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,880
He said that after the war, he was going to have a regimental reunion in his hometown,

380
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,340
which was Cody, Wyoming.

381
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,560
He was going to barbecue whole steers.

382
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,080
He said all this while staring into Billy's eyes.

383
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,340
He made the inside of poor Billy's skull echo with balderdash.

384
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,160
Cog me with you, boys, he said.

385
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,660
And that echoed and echoed.

386
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,000
And then he said, if you're ever in Cody, Wyoming, just ask for Wild Bob.

387
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,180
Well, Dawson, you got it made.

388
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,240
Pretty nurses.

389
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,260
No duty.

390
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,360
It's probably back to the States for you.

391
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,120
Ah.

392
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,000
I'll be patched up in no time.

393
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,820
There was a lot of blood, but the bullet didn't penetrate that deeply, and I'll be fit for

394
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,700
duty in no time.

395
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,960
Lieutenant, what's going to happen now?

396
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,340
What kind of person can fall thousands of feet through the air and land on a two-inch

397
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:00,700
target?

398
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,920
We've read of you at Lexington and at the Alamo.

399
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,140
You cross the river I know.

400
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,940
You're a man of the time and held the beach at Anzino.

401
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,340
Whenever you've been called upon, you've always proved a man.

402
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,360
In the army of your country, country boy, you're now a man.

403
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,740
There was a movie about American bombers in the Second World War and the gallant men who

404
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,100
flew them.

405
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,740
Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this.

406
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,360
American planes full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an

407
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,060
airfield in England.

408
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,660
Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell

409
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,300
fragments from some of the planes and crewmen.

410
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,140
They didn't even have a gun.

411
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,140


412
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,140


413
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,140


414
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,140


415
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,180
They did the same for erect American bombers on the ground.

416
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,820
And those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.

417
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,080
The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames.

418
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:57,360
The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires,

419
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,240
gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies

420
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,600
of the planes.

421
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,580
The containers were stored neatly in racks.

422
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,620
The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes.

423
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,360
They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes.

424
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,500
But there were still a few wounded Americans.

425
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,460
And some of the bombers were in bad repair.

426
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,800
Over France, though, German fighter planes came up again, made everything and everybody

427
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,640
as good as new.

428
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,560
When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks

429
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,240
and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day,

430
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,440
dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals.

431
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,780
Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work.

432
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,600
The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas.

433
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,900
It was their business to put them into the ground to hide them cleverly, so they would

434
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,400
never hurt anybody ever again.

435
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,340
American fliers turned in their uniforms, became high school kids.

436
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,940
And Hitler turned into a baby, Billy Pilgrim supposed.

437
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,480
That wasn't in the movie.

438
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,800
Billy was extrapolating.

439
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,620
Everybody turned into a baby, and all humanity without exception conspired biologically to

440
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,100
produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve.

441
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,180
Not all of the detachment's missions are this dramatic.

442
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:08,740
The 283rd's unique mission allows them to stay combat ready while helping the civilian community.

443
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,480
This is the United States Army Forces Command.

444
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,300
People helping people.

445
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,040
Billy Pilgrim was down in a meat locker on the night that Dresden was destroyed.

446
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,240
There were sounds like giant footsteps above.

447
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,580
Those were sticks of high explosive bombs.

448
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,840
The giants walked and walked.

449
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,240
The meat locker was a very safe shelter.

450
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,680
All that happened down there was an occasional shower of calcimine.

451
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,340
The Americans and four of their guards in a few-dress carcasses were down there, and nobody else.

452
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:47,600
The rest of the guards had, before the raid began, gone to the comforts of their own homes in Dresden.

453
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,900
They were all being killed with their families.

454
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,240
So it goes.

455
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,960
During the raid, a guard would go to the head of the stairs ever so often to see what it was like outside.

456
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,880
Then he would come down and whisper to the other guards.

457
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,360
There was a firestorm out there.

458
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,440
Dresden was one big flame.

459
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,340
The one flame ate everything organic, everything that would burn.

460
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,320
It wasn't safe to go there.

461
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,680
The guards didn't come out of the shelter until noon the next day.

462
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,500
When the Americans and their guards did come out, the sky was black with smoke.

463
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,400
The sun was an angry little pinhead.

464
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,300
Dresden was like the moon now, nothing but minerals.

465
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,840
The stones were hot.

466
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,020
Everybody else in the neighborhood was dead.

467
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
So it goes.

468
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,820
The guards drew together instinctively, rolled their eyes.

469
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,180
They experimented with one expression and then another,

470
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,100
said nothing,

471
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,760
though their mouths were often open.

472
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,400
They looked like a silent film of a barbershop quartet.

473
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,140
So long forever, they might have been singing.

474
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,860
Hey, Schultz, we're gonna walk right out that front gate.

475
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,100
Please, get a hold of that mercy.

476
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,660
Mercy. Mercy.

477
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,900
Oh, yes, the idyllic days of World War II,

478
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,340
when men were men and bombs were bursting everywhere.

479
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,820
Oh, our last glorious war,

480
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,760
the last war that you could really believe in,

481
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,520
the last war that everyone wanted in on.

482
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,900
It truly was the big one.

483
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,820
Oh, right.

484
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,000
Oh, excuse me, seekers,

485
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,240
if my perspective about the big one is a bit skewed,

486
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,480
but let me give you a little bit of personal background

487
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,640
from the Fluses family tree that might explain it.

488
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,040
You see, my mother was born in Great Britain in 1921,

489
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,080
the oldest of four daughters.

490
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,900
And, oh, I heard about it all while I was growing up, seekers,

491
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:53,060
about how these four girls got to grow up during the Blitz in London.

492
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,000
And, oh, it was major fun, let me tell you.

493
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,900
My mother got to experience a myriad joys of war widowhood

494
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,960
real early in the game

495
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,880
when her husband was killed in Sicily with the Royal Air Force.

496
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,400
Oh, yeah, it wasn't like it was combat or anything.

497
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,440
See, there's this thunderstorm,

498
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,660
and he's standing under the wing of a plane lighting a cigarette,

499
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,100
and, yep, you guessed it,

500
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,960
the wrong damn place at the wrong damn time.

501
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,880
And because black cloth was rationed,

502
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,840
my mother didn't have enough

503
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,960
to make a black maternity dress of mourning because,

504
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,020
oh, yes, I forgot to add,

505
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,080
she was carrying her first child,

506
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,860
a son who was born in December of 1921.

507
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,420
And she was a mother of 1921 in an alley in London

508
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,100
during an air raid delivered by strangers.

509
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,800
Ironically enough, her sister Joan could have helped,

510
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,840
but that 15-year-old girl was busy driving an ambulance

511
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,360
through the rubble-strewn streets at the time.

512
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,800
Oh, yeah, the glory of war.

513
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,460
Oh, besides a constant terror of death raining from the skies,

514
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,700
what impressed me most about hearing the stories

515
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,700
was just the absolute inconvenience of it all.

516
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,680
Yeah, like the inconvenience of my current predicament.

517
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh, I forgot that I'm in the Marines now.

518
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,260
Oh, maybe if I pray to God, he'll get me out of this.

519
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,800
God? Oh, what am I saying?

520
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,040
I guess that just goes to prove

521
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,380
that there are no atheists in foxy holes.

522
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,460
Oh, hey, whose panties are these under my bunk?

523
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,940
Oh, the Sarge's.

524
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,340
Oh, wait.

525
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,720
Oh, I forgot.

526
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,620
I just violated the don't-ask-don't-smell rule.

527
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,720
Dang!

528
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,580
Oh, there are just too many damn rules and regulations

529
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,160
to remember here, and I keep losing ground.

530
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,280
I didn't even know they had a private 10th-class rank.

531
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,560
And I thought FTA stood for the Philadelphia Transit Authority.

532
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,880
Oh, yeah, the Military Industrial Inferiority Complex

533
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,860
is taking a toll on us all.

534
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,380
Oh, but I know too well that you can't get out of it.

535
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,220
The only ex-Marine was Lee Harvey Oswald.

536
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,660
Oh, yeah, back in the 40s,

537
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,760
there were ideals worth fighting for,

538
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,520
but, hey, back then, Frank Capra movies were big.

539
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,860
Oh, now ideals like truth and freedom

540
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,920
have been replaced with corporate logos,

541
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,160
and battles are nothing more than

542
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,320
rabid pep rallies with casualties.

543
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,960
Just this morning at the diner,

544
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,480
I found myself holding the door open

545
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,560
for a paralyzed veteran of some recent oil war,

546
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,740
and I wondered just how it evened out.

547
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,100
You know, his legs in exchange for my full tank of cheap gas.

548
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,660
Oh, I don't know, maybe I'm a bleeding heart,

549
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,560
but it just didn't seem right to me,

550
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,400
even though everyone else accepted it as a fact of life.

551
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,300
Yep, all's fair in the end.

552
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,080
War and love and war,

553
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,840
and the lucky ones die.

554
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,300
I mean, I go for a man in cuneiform

555
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,180
just as much as the next guy,

556
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,620
but I'm not getting shipped off to Babylonia

557
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,560
to get my ass shot off to get it,

558
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,560
if you know what I mean.

559
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,520
Aw, hell, this is where we came in.

560
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:27,660
Yeah.

561
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,420
This is where we came in.

562
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,860
And chapter four?

563
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,460
It could be.

564
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,000
It can happen again.

565
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,220
You'll see ruins.

566
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,720
You'll see flowers.

567
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,680
You'll see some mighty pretty scenery.

568
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,040
Don't let it fool you.

569
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,820
You are in enemy country.

570
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,040
Be alert.

571
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:51,840
Suspicious of everyone.

572
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,560
Take no chances.

573
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,180
You are up against something more than tourist scenery.

574
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,480
You are up against German history.

575
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,380
It isn't good.

576
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,120
They may deny it now,

577
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:04,900
but they believe it,

578
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,860
and will try to prove it again.

579
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,220
Don't argue with them.

580
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,980
Don't try to change their point of view.

581
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,660
Other allied representatives will concern themselves with that.

582
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,200
You are not being sent into Germany as educators.

583
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,660
You are soldiers on guard.

584
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,760
You will observe their local laws,

585
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,440
respect their customs and religion,

586
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,280
and you will respect their property rights.

587
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,880
You will not ridicule them.

588
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,760
You will not argue with them.

589
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,420
You will not be friendly.

590
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,120
You will be aloof, watchful, and suspicious.

591
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,340
Every German is a potential source of trouble.

592
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,520
Therefore, there must be no fraternization with any of the German people.

593
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,860
Fraternization means making friends.

594
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,260
The German people are not our friends.

595
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:01,260


596
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:01,260


597
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:01,260


598
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:01,260


599
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,040
You will not associate with German men,

600
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,480
women,

601
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,220
or children.

602
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,980
You will not associate with them on familiar terms,

603
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,440
either in public or in private.

604
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,460
You will not visit in their homes,

605
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,000
nor will you ever take them into your confidence.

606
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,120
However friendly, however sorry,

607
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,160
however sick of the Nazi party they may seem,

608
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,240
they cannot come back into the civilized world.

609
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,240


610
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,540
They will not be able to come back into the civilized world

611
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,720
just by sticking out their hand and saying,

612
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,720
I'm sorry.

613
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,960
Don't clasp that hand.

614
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,940
It's not the kind of a hand you can clasp in friendship.

615
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,480
To our Israeli allies,

616
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,020
let us raise a toast.

617
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,640
Sing the Eibusnacht, a Nazi polka.

618
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,300
Sure there was some Nazis,

619
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,600
two or three at most.

620
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,200
Sing the Eibusnacht, a Nazi polka.

621
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,280
We tried to throw out Hitler right from the very start.

622
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,780
That's what every history book should tell.

623
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,800
We hated Heinrich Hitler, Martin Borden too.

624
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,100
We believe as Sherman did that Bohnen's hell,

625
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,180
hell, hell, hell, hell, hell,

626
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,640
Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil.

627
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,960
But there are millions of Germans.

628
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,900
Some of those guys must be okay.

629
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:21,780
Perhaps.

630
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,440
But which ones?

631
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,900
Just one mistake may cost you your life.

632
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,100
Trust none of them.

633
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,600
Someday the German people might be cured of their disease.

634
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,900
The super race disease.

635
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,060
The world conquest disease.

636
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,340
But they must prove that they have been cured

637
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,340
beyond the shadow of a doubt

638
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:47,920
before they ever again are allowed to take their place among respectable nations.

639
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,200
Until that day,

640
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,020
we stand guard.

641
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,680
We are determined that their plan for world conquest shall stop

642
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,900
here and now.

643
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:04,340
We are determined that they shall never again use peaceful industries for warlike purposes.

644
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,960
We are determined that the vicious German cycle of war,

645
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,500
phony peace,

646
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,360
war,

647
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,620
phony peace,

648
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,420
war,

649
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,440
phony peace,

650
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,460
shall once and for all time

651
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,920
come to an end.

652
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,820
Come to an end.

653
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,860
That is your job in Germany.

654
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,480
Germans are as gentle as flowers in the spring,

655
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,760
Sing, gee, I was not a Nazi for God.

656
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:44,920
Achtung!

657
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,060
The Nazi whom we did abhor is now gemütlich geiter.

658
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,440
For when he isn't making war, no one could be politer.

659
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,220
He woos Miss Liberty with zeal.

660
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,540
He bowels with grace and rigor

661
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,240
to kiss the hand and click the heel

662
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,580
before he clicks the trigger.

663
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,280
That is why you occupy Germany.

664
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,680
To make that next war impossible.

665
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,060
No easy job.

666
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,240
In battle you kept your wits about you.

667
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,120
Don't relax that caution now.

668
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,500
The Nazi party may be gone,

669
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,720
but Nazi thinking, Nazi training,

670
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,160
and Nazi trickery remain.

671
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,460
The German lust for conquest is not dead.

672
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,200
It's merely gone undercover.

673
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,480
Sing, gee, I was not a Nazi for God.

674
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,120
Gee, hey!

675
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,240
I will obey the laws

676
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,940
that God and man have made.

677
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,680
And I will respect the flag

678
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,280
of the United States.

679
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,200
I will march in the army

680
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,600
for the red, white, and blue.

681
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,740
I will march in God's army

682
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,080
in honor and in truth.

683
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,180
I will obey the Lord.

684
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,740
I will obey the Lord.

685
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,340
I will obey his word.

686
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,100
I will obey the Lord.

687
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,600
I'm going to raise a family

688
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,340
when this cruel war is through.

689
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,700
I hope I'll have a bouncing boy

690
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,100
to tell my stories to.

691
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,620
But if someday when he grows up

692
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,120
he joins the Marine Reserve,

693
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,720
I'll kick his ass from dawn to dusk

694
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,940
because that's what he'll deserve.

695
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,500
Way up in Korea

696
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,420
amidst rocks, ice, and snow,

697
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,360
the poor Chinese commie

698
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,980
is feeling so low.

699
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,220
As our corsairs roar by overhead,

700
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,320
he knows that his buddies

701
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,920
will all soon be dead.

702
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,680
Dinky die!

703
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,540
Dinky die!

704
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,480
Dinky die!

705
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,300
Dinky die!

706
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,300
He knows that his buddies

707
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,000
will all soon be dead.

708
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,620
Min Pao went way up to Kolkoto-ri.

709
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,980
His prized Chinese army in action to see.

710
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,440
He said that his soldiers no battle could lose.

711
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,880
But all that he found was their hats.

712
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,800
And their shoes.

713
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,620
Dinky die!

714
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,420
Dinky die!

715
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,360
Dinky die!

716
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,100
Dinky die!

717
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,020
But all that he found

718
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,720
was their hats and their shoes.

719
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,880
Now Uncle Joe Stalin,

720
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,700
your stooges have found

721
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,900
it just doesn't pay to invade foreign ground.

722
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,260
When you disturbed the serene Asian calm,

723
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,060
you brought on the rockets,

724
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,680
the bombs, and napalm.

725
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,420
Dinky die!

726
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,220
Dinky die!

727
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,220
Dinky die!

728
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,900
Dinky die!

729
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:08,980
Dinky die!

730
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,900
You brought on the rockets,

731
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,900
the bombs, and napalm.

732
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,120
So here's to Pyongyang into old Higaru.

733
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,580
To Kumwa and Kisang and Uijangbu.

734
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,060
To all gyrene pilots and carriers at sea.

735
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,300
And the Death Rattlers Squadron 0-3-23.

736
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,180
Dinky die!

737
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,160
Dinky die!

738
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,140
Dinky die!

739
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:32,820
Dinky die!

740
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:32,940
Dinky die!

741
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,400
And the Death Rattlers Squadron 0-3-23.

742
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,060
Dinky die!

743
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,980
Good times.

744
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,520
Oh once I was happy,

745
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,100
I had a fine home.

746
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,000
MacArthur then called me

747
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,480
And soon I was gone.

748
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,840
Was off to Korea,

749
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,540
it's not very far.

750
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,500
It's just a police action,

751
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,000
It isn't a war.

752
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,720
Don't call out the army,

753
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,300
Don't call out the navy,

754
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,240
Don't call out the coast guard,

755
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,680
Just call out the Corps.

756
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:14,940
Those good boys found their way out of East LA they can find their way back into this goop Valley, right?

757
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:22,380
Something's moving up in the woods where that sector in okay. Give them the password Sanja. Yeah, I better disguise my voice

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,060
You gotta take it easy

784
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,260
It's not your fault

785
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,720
What are we gonna do?

786
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,440
Porgie! Porgie!

787
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,060
I went up there and I said shrink

788
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,320
I wanna kill

789
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,340
I mean I wanna kill

790
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,760
I want kill

791
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,840
Kill kill

792
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,400
I started jumping up and down

793
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,640
Kill kill

794
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,180
He started jumping up and down with me

795
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,040
We both started jumping up and down

796
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,500
Kill kill

797
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:40,420
And the sergeant came over pinned the metal on me set me down and said you're our boss

798
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:48,260
I'm helping as much as I can in the government that I am the government that I know about my Teddy Roosevelt and

799
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:53,600
my my sergeant and my lieutenants and all that kind of stuff

800
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,000
You know, I never grew up to do all that kind of stuff, but I seen other people doing it. I always wanted to you know

801
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,260
It'd been nice if I could have gotten the service, you know and been

802
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,800
some kind of military guy United States Marshal or something, you know

803
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:15,460
But I've been stuck in jail watching everybody else live their life. So then as I grow up

804
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:21,480
I begin to see that I've been out there just as much as I'm in here to sometimes, you know

805
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,520
And even though I don't make sense right now

806
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:33,000
Later on sometimes like this filter somewhere those with hearts of rock and brains of barbarians can review our armory

807
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,360
sacrifices and sufferings in World War two in Europe and the South Pacific now being spit on and their victories being

808
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:47,640
frittered away by puppet politicians in the service of Global Power elites who can deny that our troops were betrayed in Korea and

809
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,680
Vietnam who can see that and not join a resumption of the American Revolution

810
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,740
Did you know that?

811
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,280
those ancient Roman citizens

812
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,820
hearing Antony's funeral oration

813
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,980
over the body of Caesar

814
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,180
and beholding the bloody tunic

815
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,580
with its gapping mouths

816
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,040
through which the deadly daggers

817
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,560
did pass to pierce the flesh

818
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,640
and crack the mighty heart of Caesar,

819
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,220
did those in that funeral audience

820
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,000
who had tears to shed,

821
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,020
shed them?

822
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,000
Our nation

823
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,800
has kept wars

824
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,060
so far away from this soil

825
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,680
when we have perpetrators

826
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,300
that would try to take this nation over

827
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,980
that have had to kill

828
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,780
to keep our freedoms

829
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,980
that it is absolutely spoiled rotten.

830
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,460
I lied.

831
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,680
Well, come on, fess up.

832
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,100
I smoked pot in college.

833
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,860
My great-grandfather was just in the law twos.

834
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,900
My father pulled strings

835
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,300
and got me into the National Guard.

836
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,640
Well, there's just love, love, love

837
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,380
by a bunch of these panty-waisted preachers

838
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,040
in the middle of the night

839
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,920
in this generation

840
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,400
that can't touch anything controversial

841
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,420
that all they can talk about is,

842
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,960
oh, sweet, sweet, sweet.

843
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,200
And it's so sugary sweet

844
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,080
that it's sickening.

845
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,360
That it sells short

846
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,860
the men and women

847
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,980
that fought in Vietnam,

848
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,260
that fought in Korea,

849
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,200
one of the combats

850
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,160
that various services

851
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,300
suffered really some rough times

852
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,240
till some of these

853
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,740
love, love, love people

854
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,280
try to make,

855
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,160
put a slander even upon it.

856
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,600
When those two wars following World War II

857
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,240
broke the back of communism

858
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,300
where we have all the more freedom

859
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,040
in this nation.

860
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,200
So, to a serviceman,

861
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,600
it's kind of an insult for someone to say,

862
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,440
why would God tell people to kill people?

863
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,000
Kill, kill.

864
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,220
He started jumping up and down with me.

865
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,400
We both started jumping up and down with him.

866
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,960
Kill, kill.

867
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,460
I may never much

868
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:49,880
live.

869
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:11,620
Our self-belief large enough

870
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,280
to actually be comfortable

871
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,660
because I've lived

872
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,560
those floating wsp Trust children

873
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,580
was judging world war I,

874
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,360
why would they

875
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:19,440
deal with my beguile before

876
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,080
the same good person

877
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,260
who, say,

878
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


879
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,240
that I'm in the Lord's army.

880
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,220
Yes, sir!

881
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,800
God still gives us the victory.

882
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,780
That's why we win every war we go into,

883
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,400
including Korea and Vietnam.

884
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,580
It broke the back of communism.

885
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,000
Hey, what's this?

886
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,560
Oh, that's my old unit from Vietnam.

887
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,400
I was their sergeant.

888
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,780
They were my loyal troops.

889
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,720
That photo was taken shortly before I was shot in the back,

890
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,740
which was very strange because it was during a Bob Hope show.

891
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,160
I was trying to get Joey Heatherton to put on some pants, for God's sake.

892
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:51,880
And we win.

893
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,060
Come on.

894
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:35,280
I got into bed, then some sleepboarding yet.

895
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,720
She said, no sleep, flyboy, I know, tired yet.

896
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,300
Well, I woke the next morning a quarter past ten.

897
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,620
I was missing my wallet and 10,000 yen.

898
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,140
Cigarettes and sake and wild, wild jokes

899
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,040
and they'll die.

900
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:50,900
They'll drive you crazy.

901
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,520
They'll drive you insane.

902
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,920
Cigarettes and sake and wild, wild jokes

903
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,940
and they'll drive you crazy.

904
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,280
They'll drive you insane.

905
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,320
Oh, won't you help me, sergeant?

906
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,000
Get me out of play to jail.

907
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,200
I don't know how I got here.

908
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,780
I was drunk from the Ho Chi trail.

909
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,260
It was ba-me-ba, ba-me-ba, ba-me-ba.

910
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:20,260


911
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,560
Ba-me-ba-wa-oo.

912
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,540
Ba-me-ba, ba-me-ba, ba-me-ba-wa-oo.

913
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,040
I didn't mean to be drunk

914
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,900
and bringing you all this shame.

915
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,480
But I had a fight with a cyclo girl

916
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,800
down in Old Nut Frank.

917
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,700
It was ba-me-ba, ba-me-ba, ba-me-ba-wa-oo.

918
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,260
Ba-me-ba, ba-me-ba-wa-oo.

919
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:50,260


920
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,900
Now this Dunning jail has rats and fleas

921
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,040
And snakes crawl on the floor

922
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,760
Take me back to Camp Sarge

923
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,880
And I won't get drunk no more

924
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,100
On Bommie Baa, Bommie Baa, Bommie Baa

925
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,200
Bommie Baa, Bommie Baa, Bommie Baa

926
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,540
There's D.C. all around us

927
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,140
It's looking bad, I think

928
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:29,200
We can't do our thing, Sarge

929
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,980
So let's have a little drink

930
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,840
Cigarettes and sake and wild, wild chocos

931
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,060
They'll drive you crazy, they'll drive you insane

932
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:44,360
Now back in Chitose, I'm limping about

933
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,180
Me and the doctor are sweating

934
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,700
It out, he gave me some pills

935
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,400
From a jug on the shelf

936
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,880
Then he poured out a dozen or two for himself

937
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,700
Cigarettes and sake and wild, wild chocos

938
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,740
Cigarettes and sake and wild, wild chocos

939
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:07,440
I was captured by the gorillas

940
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,760
They tried hard to teach me their way

941
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,960
But I know of heaven eternal

942
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,380
That God will save me someday

943
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:25,320
The green parade, God bless them

944
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,340
Will excel to the left and the right

945
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,860
The Lord stands right there beside them

946
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,880
They pray to God every night

947
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,660
They captured me and my buddy

948
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,700
They tortured us night and day

949
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,180
They tortured us night and day

950
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,100
They tortured us night and day

951
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:49,100


952
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:49,100


953
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,960
Finally beheaded my buddy

954
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,060
Ah, they'll have me patched up in no time

955
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,820
That was a lot of blood

956
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,280
Didn't penetrate that deeply

957
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,200
And I'll be fit for duty in no time

958
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,960
But oh, the universal curse

959
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,140
From Vietnam to Korea

960
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,300
The bug of bugs that bugs us still

961
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,100
And begs for panacea

962
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:12,000
Oh who will find the antidote for

963
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,460
Pantagon-erea?

964
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,980
I'm just a typical American

965
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,180
I'm just a typical American

966
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:17,180


967
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:19,160
Boy from a typical American town

968
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,980
I believe in God and Senator Dodd

969
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,640
And in keeping old Castro down

970
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,280
And when it came my time to serve

971
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,060
I knew better dead than red

972
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:31,140
But when I got to my old draft board, buddy

973
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,560
This is what I said

974
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:33,980
Sergeant, I'm only eighteen

975
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,280
I got a ruptured spleen

976
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,840
And I always carry a purse

977
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,600
I got eyes like a bat

978
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,560
And my feet are flat

979
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,320
My asthma's getting worse

980
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,940
Consider my career, my sweetheart dear

981
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,800
My poor old little at-at

982
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,360
Besides, I ain't no fool

983
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,320
I'm a-going to school

984
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,060
And I'm-a working in a defense plant

985
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,220
I got a dislocated disc

986
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,340
And a racked-up back

987
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,980
And I'm allergic to flowers and bugs

988
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,680
And when a bombshell hits

989
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,820
I get epileptic fits

990
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,540
And I'm addicted to a thousand drugs

991
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,260
I got the weakness woes

992
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,340
And I can't touch my toes

993
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,020
I can hardly reach my knees

994
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,660
And if the enemy ever came close to me

995
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,600
Why, I'd probably start to sneeze

996
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,000
Sergeant, I'm only eighteen

997
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,260
I got a ruptured spleen

998
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:15,780
And I always carry a purse

999
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,580
I got eyes like a bat

1000
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,520
And my feet are flat

1001
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,300
My asthma's getting worse

1002
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,880
Consider my career, my sweetheart dear

1003
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,700
My poor old little at-at

1004
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,300
Besides, I ain't no fool

1005
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,260
I'm-a going to school

1006
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,960
And I'm-a working in a defense plant

1007
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,700
I hate Joe and I

1008
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,780
And I hope he dies

1009
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,380
But I think you gotta see

1010
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,140
That if someone's gotta go over there

1011
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,840
That someone isn't me

1012
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,940
So have a ball, Sarge

1013
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:41,620
Watch him fall

1014
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,260
While you kill me a thousand or so

1015
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,960
And if you ever get a war

1016
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,760
Without any reason

1017
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:45,760


1018
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:45,760


1019
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:45,760


1020
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:45,760


1021
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:45,760


1022
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:45,760


1023
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:45,760


1024
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:45,760


1025
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:45,760


1026
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,000
I'll be Gore

1027
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,680
Well, I'll be the first to go

1028
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,260
Once upon a time

1029
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,740
There was this little boy

1030
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,780
Who wanted to grow up

1031
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,540
To be a soldier

1032
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,620
And serve his country

1033
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:58,700
In whatever way he could

1034
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,880
He would parade around the house

1035
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,140
With a saucepan on his head

1036
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:02,740
For a helmet

1037
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,720
A wooden sword in one hand

1038
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,840
And the American flag in the other

1039
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,260
As he grew up

1040
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,120
He put away the things of a child

1041
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,420
But he never let go of the flag

1042
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,720
My name is Will

1043
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:15,740
And I'm the man

1044
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:15,740


1045
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:15,740


1046
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:15,740


1047
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:15,740


1048
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:15,740


1049
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:15,740


1050
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:15,740


1051
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:15,740


1052
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:15,740


1053
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:15,740


1054
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:15,740


1055
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:15,740


1056
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,360
William Kelly

1057
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,880
I'm a soldier of this land

1058
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,260
I've tried to do my duty

1059
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,520
And to gain the upper hand

1060
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,960
But they've made me out a villain

1061
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,280
They have stamped me with a brand

1062
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,840
As we go marching on

1063
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:38,400
It is so short and jumbled and jangled, Sam,

1064
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,700
Because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.

1065
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,200
Everybody is supposed to be dead,

1066
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,740
To never say anything or want anything.

1067
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:45,740


1068
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,660
Ever again.

1069
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,380
Everything is supposed to be very quiet

1070
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,360
After a massacre

1071
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,980
And it always is,

1072
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,080
Except for the birds.

1073
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,160
And what do the birds say?

1074
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,280
All there is to say about a massacre

1075
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,520
Things like,

1076
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,140
Poo-tee-wee?

1077
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,560
I have told my sons

1078
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,760
That they are not under any circumstances

1079
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,780
To take part in massacres

1080
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,240
And that the news of massacres of enemies

1081
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,120
Is not to fill them with satisfaction or glee.

1082
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,400
I have also told them

1083
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,520
Not to work for companies

1084
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,740
Which make massacres

1085
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:15,740


1086
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:15,740


1087
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:15,740


1088
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:15,740


1089
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:15,740


1090
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:15,740


1091
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:15,740


1092
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:15,740


1093
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:15,740


1094
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:15,740


1095
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:15,740


1096
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:15,940
But to work for the people

1097
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:15,940


1098
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:15,940


1099
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,700
And to express contempt for people

1100
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,800
Who think we need machinery like that.

1101
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:21,460
Whoa!

1102
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,700
Holy cow!

1103
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,700
It is very quiet right now

1104
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,080
And this is eerie

1105
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,940
It looks like a Fourth of July display

1106
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:28,780
Some are red

1107
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,800
Some are white

1108
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,920
You can see explosions

1109
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,240
You know, airburst explosions

1110
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,080
Oh, that was a huge

1111
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:34,360
Whoa!

1112
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:35,600
Holy cow!

1113
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,120
That was a large airburst

1114
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:37,860
Whoa!

1115
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:38,980
Holy cow!

1116
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,420
And that is a very bright,

1117
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,580
Bright, enormous explosion

1118
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,720
The remarkable thing

1119
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:45,720


1120
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:45,720


1121
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:45,720


1122
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:45,720


1123
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:45,720


1124
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:45,720


1125
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,220
To be here tonight

1126
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:47,940
Ladies and gentlemen

1127
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:48,520
It is beautiful

1128
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,420
Red and orange

1129
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,860
All around us now

1130
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:51,580
This explosion

1131
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,540
Way back here

1132
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,520
Is the massacres

1133
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,040
And it is

1134
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,280
Really, really

1135
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:55,940
Holy cow!

1136
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,800
It is good to have another

1137
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,180
Combat veteran around here

1138
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,400
I myself received

1139
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,240
A number of medals

1140
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,420
For securing

1141
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,700
That Montgomery ward

1142
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,580
In Kuwait city

1143
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,600
Yes, Colonel

1144
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,640
Now, I understand

1145
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,260
It will be my duty

1146
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,320
To mold the new recruits

1147
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,420
Into a well-disciplined

1148
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,940
Highly trained infantry unit

1149
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,880
Sure, I guess

1150
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,260
Here to come

1151
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:15,700
You are here

1152
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:15,700


1153
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:15,700

In a그된

1155
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,320
Look, Sheriff

1156
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:23,320


1157
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:23,320


1158
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,140
I am a man

1159
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:25,140


1160
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:25,140


1161
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:28,440
And i'm

1162
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:35,000
Every man

1163
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,400
Should think

1164
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,600
About his

1165
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:36,600


1166
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:36,680
And selfish

1167
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:36,680


1168
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:36,680


1169
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:36,680


1170
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:36,700
I am

1171
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:36,700


1172
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:36,700


1173
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:36,700


1174
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:36,720
In hou

1175
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,060
Making

Close

The

My

來

1183
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:44,520
Our

1184
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:44,920
acaks

1185
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,420
iant

1186
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:45,680
Have

1187
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:52,740
in chief at this time, but I assure you it would seem that he is fond of handling abominations

1188
00:51:53,900 --> 00:52:05,420
and trying to bring them upon our people. There must be a stop put to the abomination

1189
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:12,460
in the military. It is against God's law. I'm going to tell you why. In other words,

1190
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:19,800
the military must be kept clean and the unclean kept out of it because God visits it. That

1191
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,680
being the reason. Let me just lay that down right good and heavy on you before we get

1192
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:30,860
started here. Verse 10, you must keep the military clean to have God's blessings or

1193
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:37,980
you're going to receive cursing such as terrorist attacks in the Twin Towers as you've already

1194
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:41,960
seen when this abomination that we have.

1195
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,320
I'm going to tell you why. The first thing that God wants to do is to keep the military

1196
00:52:53,320 --> 00:53:00,780
clean. I'm going to tell you why. You must keep the military clean to have God's blessings

1197
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:05,580
or you're going to receive cursing such as terrorist attacks in the Twin Towers as you've

1198
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,360
already seen when this abomination that we have. You must keep the military clean to

1199
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:12,040
have God's blessings or you're going to receive cursing such as terrorist attacks in the Twin

1200
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,600
Towers as you've already seen when this abomination that we have. You must keep the military

1201
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,960
clean to have God's blessings or you're going to receive cursing such as terrorist attacks

1202
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:28,960


1203
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:36,160
keep the military clean to have God's blessings or you're going to receive cursing such as

1204
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,260
terrorist attacks in the Twin Towers as you've already seen when this abomination that we

1205
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:37,260


1206
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,840
that's Trek, that's the war history. We're, one of the three main until you particularly

1207
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:40,280
citations in the New Testament, you can do.

1208
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,540
You've got to be a minimalist. You've got to love.千 If I'm avisible man.

1209
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:41,940
How do you connected the two of us who have alienated you

1210
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:46,820
You can't be faint-hearted and be in the military, all right?

1211
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,220
For as God said, send them home, verse 15.

1212
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,060
One question remains, how do I get out of the army?

1213
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,840
No problemo. Just make a pass at your commanding officer.

1214
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,300
Done and done.

1215
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:59,400
If there's a war, just blow on it and I'll come help you.

1216
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,480
And I mean done.

1217
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,940
Cry it out, Wetley. It's me, boys. It's Wild Bob.

1218
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,400
Ah! Ah!

1219
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,660
Let us hold it high and light up the sky

1220
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,440
with praise of our gallant men.

1221
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,800
Tyrants must know.

1222
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,140
Now, just as then,

1223
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,400
they cannot stand

1224
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,940
not as long as there are gallant men.

1225
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,740
Let's resume the American Revolution

1226
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,620
for the sake of the present

1227
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,380
and the future of the future.

1228
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,820
Not for the past.

1229
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,960
Let's water the tree of liberty

1230
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,660
with the blood of tyrants.

1231
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,060
Hitler's National Socialism

1232
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,740
brought a tyrant to the world.

1233
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:49,220
The end result of all forms of royalism

1234
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,100
is tyranny.

1235
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,900
Socialism is a modern form of royalism.

1236
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,640
It will bring tyranny.

1237
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,060
Socialism cuts across human nature

1238
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,920
and our will to liberty.

1239
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,020
We resist.

1240
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,440
Then comes the ovens and the Siberias

1241
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,620
and the Hungarian massacres.

1242
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,360
We resist.

1243
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:06,360


1244
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:06,360


1245
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:06,360


1246
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:06,360


1247
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:06,480
Then comes the ovens and the Siberias

1248
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:06,480


1249
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:06,480


1250
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:06,480


1251
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,320
The rebellion against tyrants

1252
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,660
and would-be royalists, socialists

1253
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,080
is obedience to God.

1254
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,300
Hats off to the founding fathers,

1255
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,920
but sleeves up to the future.

1256
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,900
The wars of the future

1257
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,680
will not be fought on a battlefield or at sea.

1258
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,840
They will be fought in space

1259
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,840
or possibly on top of a very tall mountain.

1260
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,080
In either case,

1261
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,780
most of the actual fighting

1262
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,580
will be done by small robots.

1263
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,020
And as you go forth today,

1264
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,100
remember always,

1265
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,880
your duty is clear.

1266
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,160
To build,

1267
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,780
and maintain those robots.

1268
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,380
Thank you.

1269
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:39,940
Yeah!

1270
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,380
Smart!

1271
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:42,920
And dark!

1272
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,660
We're smart!

1273
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,140
We're smart!

1274
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,580
We're smart!

1275
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,160
We're smart!

1276
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:57,240
Smart weapons work perfectly and always save the day.

1277
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,400
The idea is to let smart weapons do the job

1278
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,220
and do it more efficiently, decreasing the risk.

1279
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,080
Soldiers and pilots don't have to get right on top of their targets to destroy them.

1280
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:13,620
Not surprisingly, the development of smart missiles has revolutionized military strategy.

1281
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:21,060
The U.S. has more than 50 varieties of robotic missiles, bombs, and torpedoes.

1282
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:26,140
Robotic weaponry is designed to replace human friends with electronic ones.

1283
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,200
Smart!

1284
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:29,680
And dark!

1285
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,520
We're smart!

1286
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,200
We're smart!

1287
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:33,200


1288
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:33,920
We're smart!

1289
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,340
We're smart!

1290
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,240
We're smart!

1291
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,460
You will not die!

1292
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,420
You will not die!

1293
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,900
You will not die!

1294
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,300
You will not die!

1295
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,940
I will teach you!

1296
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,180
I will teach you!

1297
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:59,200
It's military term that all the ground forces here in America,

1298
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,380
both our own U.S. ground forces

1299
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,000
and

1300
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,420
and these alien forces,

1301
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,600
Now we're going to examine the war itself.

1302
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:11,440
World War III in the Middle East,

1303
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,700
when Russia marches on Israel.

1304
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:19,780
I'm going to be using tribulation texts because most prophetical Bible teachers believe

1305
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:25,420
that Russia marches on Israel during the tribulation hour.

1306
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,620
And I'm going to say immediately that what I'm about to picture is horrible.

1307
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:34,560
The conflict raised in the Middle East will make World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam,

1308
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:38,280
or anything else that we might have before it happens look like a Sunday school picnic

1309
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,620
by way of comparison.

1310
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,540
The first thing we see is the largest armies in the history of the world.

1311
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,520
The number of the army was 200,000,000.

1312
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,180
200 million!

1313
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,080
That's the population of the United States of America.

1314
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:56,420
M-O-U-T. Military Operations in Urban Terrain.

1315
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,420
That means controlling our populaces of our city.

1316
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:05,680
And that's a major training that's going on down at Fort Polk, Louisiana.

1317
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,820
But it's not just there, David.

1318
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,680
There's a live-fire war going on in the city.

1319
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,140
Now, they do this repeatedly.

1320
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:18,820
They did one, the Marines did one at New Orleans.

1321
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:22,200
At the same time, they were doing one in Biloxi,

1322
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:25,260
out from Biloxi in Mobile, Alabama.

1323
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,300
I've already been down to their tent city where they're preparing

1324
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,400
to attack two of our cities.

1325
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:32,780
Don't be a big dung-head.

1326
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:33,800
Don't kill me.

1327
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,540
There's no military take-off in the United States, is there?

1328
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,940
The Army, Navy, and Air Force couldn't agree on what to serve on a shingle,

1329
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,900
let alone how to take over the country, right?

1330
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:46,680
Right.

1331
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:47,900
I lied.

1332
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:48,420
Right.

1333
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,760
Impossible, fantastic, ridiculous, absurd, really?

1334
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,740
Gentlemen, this is just a magician.

1335
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,940
And only the persistent will be victorious.

1336
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,480
I want you to keep this record by your record player.

1337
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,500
You understand that?

1338
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,240
Yes, sir.

1339
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,740
I want you to play this record every day.

1340
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,360
You understand that?

1341
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:08,940
Yes, sir.

1342
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,960
I want you to keep a log of your progress and make the Armed Forces

1343
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,540
Workout a positive part of your life.

1344
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,620
Now, men, I'm counting on you to get in shape, stay in shape,

1345
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:17,920
and keep America strong.

1346
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:18,620
Yes, sir.

1347
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:19,200
All right.

1348
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:23,780
Now, I want to see you back here at the same time tomorrow with the same purpose,

1349
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,300
with the same motivation.

1350
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:26,540
Do you understand?

1351
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,560
Yes, sir.

1352
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,380
I can't hear you.

1353
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:29,300
Yes, sir.

1354
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:29,820
All right.

1355
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:30,700
That sounds better.

1356
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,380
Come here.

1357
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,080
I'll get dismissed.

1358
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:42,820
Damn, I still don't see why I didn't get to go home with everybody else.

1359
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,420
Oh, at least it's air conditioned down here.

1360
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,700
Oh, great.

1361
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,160
These missile silos are all computerized now, just when I need.

1362
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,360
Oh, the Mac missile program.

1363
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:58,360


1364
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:58,360


1365
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,200
Oh, great.

1366
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,940
The manual is as big as a damn phone book.

1367
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:04,740
Let's see.

1368
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:08,280
About Nuke Launcher 3.5 Software.

1369
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:10,980
Okay.

1370
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,380
Mount the SCSI probe.

1371
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:18,500
I set preferences and network options.

1372
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:19,920
Let's see.

1373
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:24,560
Shift Option Command Backslash Enter.

1374
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,720
Damn, I'm out of appendages.

1375
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,340
Oh, my gosh.

1376
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:28,340


1377
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:28,340


1378
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:28,340


1379
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:28,340


1380
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:28,340


1381
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:28,340


1382
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:28,340


1383
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:28,340


1384
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:28,340


1385
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:28,940
Oh, my gosh.

1386
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:28,940


1387
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,340
Calibrate trajectory extrapolations.

1388
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:38,200
Input elevation and wind speed of target area.

1389
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,040
Histogram of launch vectors.

1390
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,100
Oh, damn.

1391
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:47,240
This is harder to learn than Adobe Illustrator.

1392
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:52,360
I thought all I had to do was hit this little red button here.

1393
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:57,820
I'm out of appendages.

1394
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:58,160
I'm out of condensers.

1395
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:58,180
You're out of condensers.

1396
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:58,180


1397
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:58,200
All right.

1398
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:58,200


1399
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:58,200


1400
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:58,200


1401
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:58,200


1402
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:58,200


1403
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:58,220
All right.

1404
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:58,220


1405
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:58,220


1406
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:58,280
Oh, man.

1407
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:58,320
I think I'm out of condensers.

1408
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:58,320


1409
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,360
Who do we?

1410
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:26,740
And more information is to be had from www.subgenius.com.

1411
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:29,020
I'm a praiseable.
