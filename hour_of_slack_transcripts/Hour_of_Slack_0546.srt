1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:08,780
We vow that racial minorities wailing in the name of tolerance will no longer upset our justice and our traditions.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:16,360
We will not cringe for one second before the charlatan or harlequin bluff of federal courts.

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,800
We'll swamp those courts with every legal process to halt their tyranny.

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,900
Every legal process.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:29,140
And we will impeach every man or woman who supports the majesty of law in the name of politics.

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,460
We will impeach them.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,000
Immediate legal action will be ready for anybody in 24 hours.

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,120
After X day.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,000
To meet every Little Rock or Albany, Georgia or Oxford, Mississippi.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,760
Or Dallas, Texas.

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,360
Oh, put on the brakes!

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,260
Close one.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,320
Gosh.

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,540
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slap.

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,900
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,180
Sweet hour of slack.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,400
Sweet hour of slack.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,820
Oh, yes.

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,720
We call upon every American businessman who has the dream of leaving his business to his children.

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,060
Support us in whatever capacity you can afford.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,760
Hey, how about just leaving your business?

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,140
While the expense will be costly, every attorney accepted by us must agree in writing to serve without fee other than bare minimums.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,000
Praise God.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,040
American lawyers drew our glory.

25
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,040
The glorious declaration and our constitution.

26
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,160
American lawyers are going to defend them and prevent traitors from destroying them.

27
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:37,760
Are you...

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,660
What's one group you can trust as a lawyer, friends?

29
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,140
We're in the name of...

30
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,660
Some of those at workforces.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,120
On a safe...

32
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,200
Our bar crosses.

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,380
Some of those at workforces...

34
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,620
On a safe and bar crosses.

35
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,020
Some of those at workforces.

36
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,640
On a safe and bar crosses.

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,920
Some of those at workforces....

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,340
Draw the same that bar crosses.

39
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,480
Oh

40
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,140
Killed in the name of.

41
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,560
U.S.A.

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:28,560


43
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,080
U.N.A.

44
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,080


45
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,080


46
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:36,100
Uh, yes, dear friends, uh, some, one of my favorite bands here, uh, and I can't play

47
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,680
the rest of that song because he starts cussing like a sailor, I'll tell ya, and, uh, well,

48
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:47,980
we just, we can't, conspiracy still holds a certain hammer above our heads, I suppose

49
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:54,380
you might say, yeah, that's, uh, Rage Against the Machine, um, I've heard them on the radio

50
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,760
once, and I liked what I heard so much that I started asking around amongst the kids,

51
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,500
you know, the kids, we're doing all of this for the children, for the little children,

52
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,740
and we know lots of them, and, um, and they, uh, some of them actually listen to stuff

53
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:18,100
like that, and, uh, I do too, but, but, friends, we'll, to tell the truth, what I really have

54
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,540
to show off to you are my new Hendrix bootlegs.

55
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,180
I score.

56
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,800
I scored big time.

57
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,560
Uh, studio outtakes, the, the, the whole mess, I'm, I'm gonna have mercy on you, I'm just

58
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,880
gonna, you know, have that running in the background as we figure out something to do

59
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,940
with this show, I've gotta flip this one out real quick, there's so much preaching and

60
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,480
so many different media that remains to be done at any given time, dear friends, and,

61
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,360
uh, you know, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one,

62
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:00,500
one reason that I know is that Jimi Hendrix was a, a, a, a latent subgenius, an unsaved,

63
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,260
classic high unpredictable is the way he died.

64
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:13,900
Um, he died by, uh, the dumbest screw-up that a brilliant genius could, could, uh, possibly

65
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:19,280
pull off just about, and that is how you know that the man was a subgenius, and not just

66
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,360
one of these normally warmly, uh, incredibly talented, uh, uh, geniuses.

67
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,360


68
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,360


69
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,420
or something like that.

70
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,660
And hey, hey, sir, you can hear it.

71
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,420
You can just hear it.

72
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,420
You can hear that potential for the greatest screw-up in the world

73
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,540
right in the midst of that beautiful...

74
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,220
I've got to listen to this.

75
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,020
I don't know, friends.

76
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,200
Just recently, September 18th is the Hendrix death day,

77
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,620
and us Hendrix freaks and nuts get all...

78
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,120
You know, some of us get all weepy,

79
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,200
and some of us jump up...

80
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,940
and down and say, praise Bob, he was reincarnated

81
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,340
as an entire tribe of exists and all that kind of thing.

82
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:23,440
But, you know, it just makes me want to say thanks to the guy.

83
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,560
He actually helped me out a whole lot this week, personally.

84
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,580
Yes, yes, because there's always an escape, you see.

85
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,060
There has to be an escape.

86
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,220
Every subgenius must have an escape

87
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,980
because of the nature of the beast.

88
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,060
The beast.

89
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,220
That we are, yes.

90
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,400
We will walk on all fours.

91
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,900
We will snuff up water from the stream itself with our tongues, yes.

92
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,300
When Bob isn't looking, we will not be men.

93
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:52,920
Nay!

94
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,900
Because, friends, you know there's two kinds of people in the world.

95
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,520
Those who say there are two kinds of people in the world,

96
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,900
and those who say there's two kinds of people in the world,

97
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,920
and the other kind,

98
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,420
and those who don't say.

99
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,860
And then, well, there's Bob who said that.

100
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,260
And Bob said that.

101
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,660
Because, as Bob also said,

102
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,960
if you have a pipe, I will give you one.

103
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,720
If you do not, I will take it away from you.

104
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,720
For Bob is he who hath wisdom.

105
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,080
Let he who hath wisdom know it is the wallet of a man, dear friends.

106
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,080
And as Pope Sternodoc's key caver said,

107
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,720
the only reason any subgenius is still alive

108
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,200
is that all pigs are such craven, cringey,

109
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,800
and godless wonders.

110
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,520
Actually, I don't think those were his exact words.

111
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,780
We had to kind of clean that down a little bit.

112
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,860
But, as Bob said, in 1954 on a radio broadcast on WFMU,

113
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,940
howdy WFMU in East Orange, New Jersey,

114
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,660
Bob said, you can forgive them first,

115
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,980
but then kill them.

116
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,760
And, you know, that's the open-hearted, tolerant way

117
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,000
that we the subgeniuses like to think.

118
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,760
Because there's a difference.

119
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,360
There is the difference.

120
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,000
And that's what we are.

121
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,840
That's what we make.

122
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,180
Because subgeniuses are different.

123
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,260
In a way that makes so sexuality,

124
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,000
creed, or mental health,

125
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,920
or taste and color,

126
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,220
those are all inconsequential, meaningless,

127
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,800
compared to the difference between the subgenius and the human.

128
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,100
Now, we've all heard of the derogatory,

129
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,900
terms any young subgenius growing up in school hears.

130
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,840
The words like bobobbies,

131
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,740
dobsies,

132
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,920
pipefaces,

133
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,680
submorons,

134
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,580
subhumans,

135
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,500
subpenises,

136
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,960
and so forth and so on.

137
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,060
And such insults usually stem from dunderheaded misreadings,

138
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,320
conscious, deliberate misreadings, I might say,

139
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,920
of the word subgeniuses,

140
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,020
meaning either super intelligent or stupid.

141
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,420
And actually, those have nothing to do with it.

142
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,180
The word encompasses the word,

143
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,220
and encompasses almost any IQ level.

144
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,680
We are not friends saying that we're smarter than the normals.

145
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,660
We've never said that.

146
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,420
We're only saying that we are better,

147
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,420
better,

148
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,920
than the human.

149
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,560
They're the only ones that measure,

150
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,540
that think they can actually measure intelligence.

151
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,980
And they usually use income as their main yardstick, of course.

152
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,160
The subgenius form of intelligence would be calibrated,

153
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,240
calibrated in intangible units.

154
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,280
Units of intangibles.

155
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,800
And we cannot stress this enough.

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,720
It's not that the normals are unintelligent.

157
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,320
It's that they're not even all there.

158
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,300
They're half there.

159
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,960
It's not the lack,

160
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,860
but the non-use of it.

161
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,620
It's like they're wandering through a dream.

162
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,220
Characters in somebody else's cartoon world.

163
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,460
In my case, my cartoon world.

164
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,620
The things that we recognize as mere convenient,

165
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,660
convenient mental constructs,

166
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,440
such as jobs or money,

167
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,740
are totally real to the poor humans.

168
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,200
Pity them not.

169
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,360
You know, we see the bars of a cage that they don't even know they're in.

170
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,040
But to them, we look crazy.

171
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,160
Because our response to that cage,

172
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,020
such as what I'm saying right now,

173
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,700
cannot,

174
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,340
cannot, my friend,

175
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,980
make sense to them.

176
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,960
And it never, ever will.

177
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,980
Now, you know, we might as well be living on two different planets.

178
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,120
If only we were.

179
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,860
Oh well.

180
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,080
Thanks, Jimmy.

181
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,900
Well, hell, I'll just keep reading from Revelation X.

182
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,280
I've got plenty of tapes to play, but

183
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,760
I love this old,

184
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,900
unreleased tune in the background,

185
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,960
Valley of Neptune.

186
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,640
You know, true intelligence lies in knowing what you don't know.

187
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,480
We know that!

188
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,240
And that's what makes us twice as smart as all the know-it-alls.

189
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,480
That's our curse.

190
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,740
The curse of Bob.

191
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,380
They say ignorance is bliss, my friend,

192
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,260
and they are right about that one.

193
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,420
When you're the only one in the crowd that knows that the showers are really gas chambers,

194
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,760
it's kind of hard to look forward to getting clean now, ain't it?

195
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,140
Do you think it is fun?

196
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,460
Do you think it is funny?

197
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,140
For us to know something that no one else knows,

198
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,820
even when that something is the mass murder of billions, including yourself?

199
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,140
We know.

200
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,700
We know, and yet,

201
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,980
we cannot tell.

202
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,320
Why?

203
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,480
Because no one will listen.

204
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,540
Once, Swami Bhagwananda said to Dobbs,

205
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,520
Are you not interested in discovering that which lies beyond the veil of illusion?

206
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,520
And Dobbs said,

207
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,140
Hell no!

208
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,460
I'm interested in what's behind the veil of ordinary reality.

209
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,000
Friends,

210
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,480
mundane ordinary perception

211
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,480
is a lack of perception.

212
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,900
In ordinary consciousness,

213
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,660
the most trivial things become ulcerously stressful.

214
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,720
Lost in a world of illusion,

215
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,020
fixated on superficial fantasies like the job,

216
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,720
any interruption of the daily routine

217
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,700
throws the pink into a frenzy of paranoia.

218
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,200
The pink loses sight of the rich texture of the all,

219
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,420
and frets all out of proportion over transitory setbacks

220
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,560
and silly obstacles that exist only within its cramped,

221
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,420
blinkered frame of reference.

222
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,340
The subgenius, on the other hand,

223
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,800
maintains a perfect objective detachment such as mine,

224
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,120
and never loses sight of the magical bull-dada

225
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,860
which infuses every daily experience.

226
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,900
For instance,

227
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,940
a subgenius suffers a blowout on the highway.

228
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,440
Well, while pulling off the road and watching out for the other cars

229
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,020
out of everything else that's happening,

230
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,380
she happens to notice that the tire is flapping in perfect time

231
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,820
to the beat of the music on the car radio.

232
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,220
Do you hear that flapping, my friend, out there driving in your car tonight?

233
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,700
Is it flapping in time to the music on the car radio?

234
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:27,340
Or are you just now rolling and bumping off to the side of the road,

235
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,360
left behind by all the other traffic,

236
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,040
the other traffic which one might say was closer to mom at that time,

237
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,460
but for the fact that they don't know what the hell they're doing

238
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,280
and weren't listening to this show, and you were!

239
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,280
So it's worth it if you have to get out of that car and change that tire.

240
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,980
Just don't do it until this show's over with.

241
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,520
Just sit there by the side of the road until the cops come up,

242
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,720
and then pretend you're crippled and have them do it for you.

243
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,580
Praise Bob.

244
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,500
Ask not what the conspiracy can do for you.

245
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:54,980
No, wait.

246
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,480
Ask not what you can do for the conspiracy.

247
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,200
Ask what the conspiracy can do for you.

248
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,580
An old, old saying, and all of this stuff that I'm reading tonight

249
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,340
from our Bible revelation ex, it's old, old stuff,

250
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,580
but you know, you cannot get enough of it!

251
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,620
No subgenius can ever hear enough of the word of Bob.

252
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,260
Especially if read by the voice of Reverend Ivan Stang.

253
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,500
Because the subgenius, you see, benefits from a residual racial memory

254
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,020
that can be reached by certain paths and used as a new sense.

255
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,180
But because the subgenius, you see, benefits from a residual racial memory that can be reached by certain paths and used as a new sense.

256
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,460
But because the subgenius, you see, benefits from a residual racial memory that can be reached by certain paths and used as a new sense.

257
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,180
Because it is a new sense.

258
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,660
It cannot be described to pinks or defined in any human language or system of symbols,

259
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:37,920
It cannot be described to pinks or defined in any human language or system of symbols,

260
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,580
but must be felt through to be properly understood even on the most basic level.

261
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,740
And only latent subgeni have that capacity, that sense of appreciation,

262
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:55,900
of values, of real values, which transcends prices, fashion, social status, or even, even looks.

263
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,180
Yes, even, even looks.

264
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,540
Sigh.

265
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,960
Well, thank you.

266
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:15,820
I think the jam just sort of fell apart, and we'll continue with these readings at some point.

267
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,380
Now, where, what was I going to put on next?

268
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,520
Now I'm completely, well, when in doubt, when in doubt, turn to the experts.

269
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,940
So I got black Irish and he's Chinese today.

270
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,020
And the sport enthusiast in Euclid.

271
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,160
And then I got a story by a scientist.

272
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,160


273
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:39,660
I got a story by a school teacher going up to Mayfield Village Idiots and checking on them Norwegian beauties with Brani.

274
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,760
There's another Brani lad down at a police station.

275
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,500
I got a guy that called you strange in a restaurant.

276
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,440
That's the one with the tea bag that told you he couldn't handle anymore.

277
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,680
He was with safety provisions.

278
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,640
He'd get filthy again.

279
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,040
After I have the Center for Infectious Disease, I got some cops.

280
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,700
I got Cuckoo for Cocoa Puff cops.

281
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,520
And there are Bushy Bushy Bond hairdos.

282
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,220
Trying to draw attention to my oxygen case.

283
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,620
I got the Center for Infectious Disease story.

284
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,940
They laughed it off.

285
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,040
Then I got the one, I'm in grade school.

286
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,120
It's a story in the 80s.

287
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,600
This guy's still calling a page in a book on me.

288
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,060
A group of cops who I want restoration of moments and shut back.

289
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,920
Do I know where I'm at?

290
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,780
Now get off your lazy seats and go to work and save America.

291
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,500
Send a big fat check to the one determined out there.

292
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,660
I'm a man of faith that calls a spade a spade.

293
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:39,000
And has sworn to defeat the cause of every evil in the world today.

294
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,620
Humanity.

295
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,020
Every time I have to tinkle, I like to hold my tinkle.

296
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,180
The children start to whimper when I do my dinkle dance.

297
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,320
The ladies get embarrassed when they see me stand embarrassed.

298
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,580
I iron out the wrinkles when I do my dinkle dance.

299
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,980
Now jeepers goodness gory, they see fat men are jolly.

300
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,500
I like to turn the lights on.

301
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,060
When I do my dinkle dance.

302
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,580
Don't laugh, it isn't funny.

303
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,980
So come on everybody.

304
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,480
There's too much time a waste, but now let's do my dinkle dance.

305
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,800
That's when I take down my.

306
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,360
That's when I take out my.

307
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,920
That's when I take down my.

308
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,480
That's when I take out my.

309
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,300
That's when I take out my.

310
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,480
I hope you're all happy and comfortable.

311
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:54,480


312
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:54,680
And down the lane again I'll Ride the horse.

313
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:54,680


314
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:54,680


315
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:54,680


316
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:54,680


317
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:54,680


318
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:54,680


319
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:54,680


320
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:54,780
They're singing, podob powered forward,

321
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,180
Mademoisellebi Red 되리 베� Danger Lady mmhmm.

342
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,380
Can I get an amen?

343
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,540
Amen!

344
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,060
Can I get a hallelujah?

Hallelujah!

346

Oh yes, brothers and sisters.

347
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,240
What I am going to say will shock you.

348
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,280
It will disturb your sleep.

349
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,740
It will make you worry for your loved ones.

350
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,660
It will give you nightmares of disaster, plague, and horrible death.

It will make you rethink the priorities of your life.

352
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,780
It will change the way you look at yourself and the world.

353
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,420
There is a killer loose in the land.

354
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,400
The killer cuts down all that he touches.

355
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,520
If he touches you, you will die.

356
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,760
If he touches your child, your child will die.

357
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,120
His victims die a slow, horrible death.

358
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,860
They waste away.

359
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,780
They drown in their own bodily fluids.

360
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,820
They lose control of their bowels.

361
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,920
They lose their memories.

362
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,000
They become demented.

363
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,660
They die.

364
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,720
They die in agony.

365
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,600
There is nothing that can be done to save them.

366
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,760
That killer's name is Jesus Christ.

367
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,580
The false Jesus.

368
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,920
When he starts to kill you, it is said that you are a heathen.

369
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,540
An insensate meat puppet with no soul.

370
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,540
An occupant on an earth ship heading headlong into Armageddon.

371
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:57,900
This killer and his cult of followers first emerged on the American scene almost 500 years ago.

372
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:15,440
Rising like an angel of gritting death out of the oozing rivers of bodily fluids that spilled like fetid waterfalls into the streets of our beloved America from the sick and sleazy pleasure houses of the killer Jesus and his twisted Christian cult.

373
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:25,340
Yet despite this heinous assault on all of the good and pure and virtuous traditions that made America a shining beacon of freedom to all of the world,

374
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:32,760
the authorities have done nothing to stop this terror from washing over this great land like a sea of evil blood.

375
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:43,160
In fact, the leaders that you elected are aiding and abetting their cause, claiming these evil false Christians have the same rights as regular people.

376
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:52,080
Our elected officials are daring to let these freaks and perverts hide behind the protection of the Constitution of the United States.

377
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,320
Most of the government's efforts have been to protect the people of America.

378
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:06,520
They have been directed towards protecting the freedom of religion of this cult of immoral and unscrupulous sex-madding fiends, rather than toward the total annihilation that these scum deserve.

379
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:13,480
The government withholds vital information about this false Christ which could save millions of lives.

380
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:25,300
By their acts of commission and omission, they have become in effect the protectors and guardians of this cult of death and its blond-haired, blue-eyed leader, Jesus Christ.

381
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:33,840
And as such, they may well become your murderers, or your child's murderers.

382
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:46,500
It has been speculated that between 80 and 90 percent of children that disappear from our homes due to kidnapping are converted to this false Christian faith by means of drugs, torture, and starvation.

383
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:52,800
These children are smuggled out of the country and sent to one of the cult's overseas slave labor camps.

384
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,300
Cruel sweatshops where children are killed.

385
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:55,300


386
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:07,800
Children are forced to spend 16 hours a day making fake miracle trinkets, which their false prophet leader, Jesus, peddles to his followers, making over 17 billion dollars in 1993.

387
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,300
Many of the children are sent to Thailand to stalk the false Christs.

388
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,500
Many brothels.

389
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:23,080
Some are sent to one of the 13 Christ-town training centers to be indoctrinated, to learn the dark secrets of their cult,

390
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,220
and to work in the jungle laboratories manufacturing crack.

391
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,540
How many innocent people must die so that the sick sex games of these pervert false Christians can continue?

392
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,720
How long must we wait before the police and the military take matters into their own hands and stop this madness?

393
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,600
What can you do to save your family and your country from this deadly menace?

394
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,480
There's a lot you can do.

395
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,060
If you live in a rural area or small town,

396
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,060


397
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,660
that has preserved traditional American values,

398
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,820
stay there.

399
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,020
Watch your family for signs of disobedience or strange behavior.

400
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,160
Stay away from the television.

401
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,620
It has become infested with subliminal messages that lure you and your loved ones into the cult.

402
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,960
Do not go to airports alone.

403
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,200
If you must, however, be sure not to drink anything.

404
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,760
Bring bottled water.

405
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:22,640
Many airport water supplies are tainted by the Christians' evil hallucinogenic crack.

406
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,080
Teams of Christians work at every airport in America,

407
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,000
waiting for the drug to take effect,

408
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,280
loading their helpless victims into waiting planes while airport officials and the FAA do nothing.

409
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,640
Make your children stay at home after school.

410
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,640
If they try to sneak out, beat them severely.

411
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,480
This is very important as this blood cult of evil targets places where teens congregate.

412
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,300
Shopping malls are among the best recruiting grounds for young people to be lured into...

413
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,680
Oh, brothers.

414
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,300
Oh, sisters.

415
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,100
Oh, yeah.

416
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,780
Thank you, Pete, for flipping that tape.

417
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,400
And, uh, friends, what were we listening to on the other side of show?

418
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:10,800
Well, my gobs, just to prove we don't just listen to Hendrix all day and all night,

419
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,500
I ran some beautiful Zugx Riff there, his little song about the Dinkle Dance.

420
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,000
And it's, actually, it's called Idiots on the Miniature Golf Course,

421
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:31,080
followed by the instrumental Lobotomy II from Looser Than Clams, one of the classic Zoox Rift albums.

422
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,400
We also heard there, I believe, a little bit of the great Legal Documents guy.

423
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:44,520
And Dr. Legume on Reverend Edward Strange's show there in Pennsylvania.

424
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:51,980
Dr. Legume outlining the dangers of this strange cult that has almost destroyed us.

425
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,400
I believe they were playing some Sergio Leone in the background there a lot of that time.

426
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,880
It's a lovely, lovely thing.

427
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,220
And I don't know what we're going to do next because we don't have to know what we're going to do next.

428
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:11,280
That's the most important right that a subgenius has, to be able to just plunge right in and just keep talking no matter what.

429
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,380
And whether you know what's on the next tape coming up or not,

430
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,700
it just doesn't matter. You just keep going and going.

431
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,820
And I don't want to be one of these Chainer-type people.

432
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:25,640
You know, I mean, I'm not going to just keep talking on and on and on about how I'm, you know,

433
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,060
going to shut up any minute or anything like that.

434
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:34,220
Hey, boys and girls, this is Einstein's Secret Orchestra live in your face right now.

435
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,980
Well, you got me singing now. I'm an anarchist singleist from way, way back when.

436
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,080
I was riding Joe Hill in Utah. I took down the deputy sheriff's office.

437
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,500
Three years ago, I was on the same train as Joe Hill.

438
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:44,500


439
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,360
Three National Guards, a state militia, and we also cracked the bank.

440
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,420
We gave the money to the poor. Pretty boy Floyd didn't have nothing on us.

441
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,700
Yeah, I rode with old Joe Hill. Hardly understand a word a man said.

442
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,700
Big, brawny, sweet he was. Old Joe Hill.

443
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,300
Gave the workers hope he did.

444
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,340
Gave the workers some hope.

445
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,420
What we need to do is organize. Organize.

446
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,520
The man's keeping still.

447
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,200
Taking money away.

448
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:14,500
Taking money away.

449
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:15,920
Taking money away.

450
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,780
We gotta get it back.

451
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,300
Hi, folks. I'm Vladimir Ilyas, Ilyas, Ilyas, Ilyas Lennon.

452
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,020
Just call me Vlad.

453
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,000
Vlad.

454
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,840
And for one week only.

455
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,900
They're explaining the purr.

456
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,440
From the heart of the former evil, former evil, former evil, former empire.

457
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,180
Vlad, leave.

458
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,040
They're taking my cross.

459
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,520
Vlad, leave.

460
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,880
I'm not only.

461
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,380
I'm not only.

462
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:44,380


463
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,620
I'm my own son.

464
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:45,620


465
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:45,620


466
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,220
2020, Vladimir See f a second.

467
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:53,680
So they asked Vladimir Wh they asked Vladimir When would he give a new coat.

468
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,260
And Lennon replied.

469
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,320
When all of the workers have new coat.

470
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,020
I will wear a new full coat.

471
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,980
They didn't People knew is Buddha.

472
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,500
He also Chose to not wear a New coat.

473
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,420
And he found it satisfactory because it was not cool.

474
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,680
Don't kid yourself.

475
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,960
They are coming for you.

476
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,500
I don't mean they are looking for you.

477
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,460
I'm coming to get you.

478
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,140
I mean they are coming for you.

479
00:33:45,420 --> 00:34:00,340
I'm coming to get you.

480
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,460
I'm coming to get you.

481
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,800
Seven, there is much pressure.

482
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,360
I come to you and know God name that thou art our only king.

483
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,880
Coming holidays.

484
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,380
Just look for the special get them together ad.

485
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,020
And there we go.

486
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,980
Halli Gallagher, deputy,

487
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:06,940
New York city, New York City, radium,

488
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:06,940


489
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:13,240
The pit...

490
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,700
Like you are now,

491
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,100
trans,

492
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,360
like.

493
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:22,180
Hitler who just said that change has taken place, which we are witnessing today, that

494
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,300
it will be up to the future generations to value it.

495
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:30,380
It has often been stated that we have to fulfill a mission.

496
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,120
And now the Chancellor is explaining which mission shall and must be fulfilled.

497
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,160
Joe, your own nightlife.

498
00:35:54,380 --> 00:36:00,240
Hi, listen, you know, as far as the Clintons are concerned, their position on abortion

499
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,680
seems to be, you know, absolutely incorrigible.

500
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:08,480
There's no way they're going to ever allow for any kind of prohibitions to be placed

501
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,100
on abortion while they're in office.

502
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,880
My question for you is, are our tactics correct right now to deal with them?

503
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,620
What tactics are you making reference to?

504
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:23,180
Legislative tactics and, well, you know, Operation Rescue, clinic defenses.

505
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:31,120
Okay, of course, now legislation and legislation tactics and Operation Rescue tactics are two

506
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,480
separate, distinct programs.

507
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,140
But they have the same purpose, you know, put two types of pressure on the government

508
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,540
to do what they really should be doing all along.

509
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,580
I have been reluctant to criticize Operation Rescue.

510
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:50,140
I know that they have probably made some mistakes and done a few things that I disagreed with

511
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,600
personally.

512
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:56,380
However, I think that Operation Rescue has accomplished, there have been some good accomplishments.

513
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,180
They have done some things that have been good.

514
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,500
They have, in effect, they have talked some young women out of abortions.

515
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,320
They probably saved some children that would have been aborted.

516
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:10,300
So I'm reluctant to criticize Operation Rescue, even though they do, there are some things

517
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,020
they do that I do not agree with and that I personally would not confront the abortion

518
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,160
issue in that manner.

519
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:21,440
Are you familiar with the new anti-abortion group called Birth First?

520
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:30,620
Apparently they insert, they take a hold of male nurses who work in abortion clinics.

521
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:36,440
They get hired there and then they induce pregnancies in women during their third trimester

522
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,720
who come in for abortions.

523
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,040
No, I'm not familiar with that.

524
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:45,140
Yeah, well, apparently their motto is, you know, better a deformed woman.

525
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,200
Christian than none at all.

526
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,160
No, I'm not familiar with anything like that.

527
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,980
I don't think you can be a deformed Christian.

528
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,480
I don't think there's any neutrality in the kingdom of God.

529
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:59,180
I think you're either in the ship or out of it, your own or off, hot or cold.

530
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,720
There are no in-betweens.

531
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,360
I'm on the ship to stay, sir.

532
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,400
Well, and I am too.

533
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,040
I hope I'm doing the best I can.

534
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,240
Well, anchors away.

535
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,380
Thank you very much.

536
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,080
I appreciate your call.

537
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,580
Thank you.

538
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,160
Thank you.

539
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,300
Thank you.

540
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,500
Thank you.

541
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,400
sensei

542
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,700
hey

543
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:30,740
Whoo

544
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,560
Wow

545
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,780
Bye

546
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,020
Bye

547
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:37,020


548
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:37,140
Bye

549
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:37,200
Bye

550
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,360
Bye

551
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,100
Bye

552
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,060
Bye

553
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:39,500
Bye

554
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:39,920
Bye

555
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,580
Bye

556
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,560
Bye

557
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:41,600
Bye

558
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,560
You are truly a little bit young.

559
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,500
And call me the strong one.

560
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,980
You are the strong one.

561
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,880
And I will be your hero.

562
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,360
You are the strong one.

563
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,760
You are the strong one.

564
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,440
You are the strong one.

565
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,900
You are the strong one.

566
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,000
And I am ready, I will begin to bring you a gift.

567
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,380
I've got a gun.

568
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,460
I've got another gun.

569
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,640
A dagger hunting rifle.

570
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,420
I hope you use all of these gadgets.

571
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,580
Targas warranty.

572
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:34,780
Full speed Screen purposely managed...

573
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,760
Oh, pretty rich and varied little rug of sound in the background there, friends.

574
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:56,260
That's a band, I guess you could call it that, in Madison, Wisconsin,

575
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,360
called Feast of Maximum Occupancy.

576
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:07,700
And they're hard-working boys in some strange respect.

577
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,880
Now, let's see, what else did we have here tonight?

578
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,060
Of course, we heard some ESO there. They announced themselves.

579
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,600
And they were doing that Russian stuff, Joe Hill and Vladimir Lenin.

580
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,920
And then we had the Crystal Methodists doing some Hitler.

581
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,400
And, yeah, they were running up some Hitler.

582
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,940
And then they also, I think, did the...

583
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:35,500
I guess it might be just a sincere recording off of some Christian radio show.

584
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,780
I'm not sure what. But here is VABOOM!

585
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,240
Let the word go forth.

586
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,680
Let the word go forth from this time and place.

587
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,220
Good evening, my fellow citizens.

588
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,760
I speak to you tonight in a spirit of hope.

589
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,340
The human spirit.

590
00:41:59,360 --> 00:41:59,660
The human spirit.

591
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,240
The human spirit.

592
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,360
Lee Harvey Oswald.

593
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:05,580
Oh, no!

594
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,520
Jack Ruby.

595
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,040
Oswald and Ruby.

596
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,820
Oh, no!

597
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,140
To friend and fo' the life.

598
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,100
Oswald and Ruby.

599
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,760
My God, have you heard?

600
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,900
The president is dead.

601
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,740
Oswald and Ruby.

602
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,480
They do not eat prison spirits.

603
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,900
Oswald and Ruby.

604
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,780
They do not eat prison spirits.

605
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,000
The president is dead.

606
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,020
Well, I know where that third shot came from.

607
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,280
The grassy knoll behind the picket fence.

608
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,160
The grassy knoll behind the picket fence.

609
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,360
Oh, oh, no!

610
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,860
My God, have you heard?

611
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,000
The president is dead.

612
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,320
Let the word go forth.

613
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,720
Let the word go forth.

614
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,760
Let the word go forth.

615
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:52,280
Let the word go forth.

616
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,440
Good evening, my fellow citizens.

617
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,980
I speak to you tonight in a spirit of hope.

618
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,040
The human spirit.

619
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:08,340
The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it.

620
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,600
And the glow from that fire can truly light the world.

621
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,860
History will record the fact.

622
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,080
Lee Harvey Oswald.

623
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,460
I didn't shoot anybody, sir.

624
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,460
I didn't shoot anybody, sir.

625
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,920
Lee Harvey Oswald.

626
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,000
Jack, Jack, Jack Ruby.

627
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,100
Jack Harvey Oswald.

628
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:25,760
Oh, no!

629
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,060
My God, have you heard?

630
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,220
The president is dead.

631
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,080
Well, I know where that third shot came from.

632
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,500
The grassy knoll behind the picket fence.

633
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,380
The grassy knoll behind the picket fence.

634
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,580
Oh, oh, no!

635
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,100
My God, have you heard?

636
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,220
The president is dead.

637
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,560
Let the word go forth.

638
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,940
Let the word go forth.

639
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,680
Good evening, my fellow citizens.

640
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,220
I speak to you tonight in a spirit of hope.

641
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,820
A spirit of hope.

642
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,960
Lee Harvey Oswald.

643
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:00,820
Jack Ruby.

644
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,580
Two prim, then foe alike.

645
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,660
Oswald and Ruby.

646
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,600
They do not imprison spirits.

647
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,920
Oswald and Ruby.

648
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,740
Two prim, then foe alike.

649
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,380
They do not imprison spirits.

650
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,140
History will record the fact.

651
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,480
Lee Harvey Oswald.

652
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,840
I didn't shoot anybody, sir.

653
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,840
I didn't shoot anybody, sir.

654
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,260
Lee Harvey Oswald.

655
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,360
Jack, Jack, Jack Ruby.

656
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,500
Jack Harvey Oswald.

657
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,160
Oh, no!

658
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,460
My God, have you heard?

659
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,600
The president is dead.

660
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:32,520
The president is dead.

661
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:38,100
We have learned in times past that the spirit of one moment or place can be gone in the

662
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,360
next.

663
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,480
My God, have you heard?

664
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,620
The president is dead.

665
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:52,020
Mr. Joseph Kennedy bought up all the Hague and Hague, scotch, whiskey industries in England.

666
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,140
He bought all the English-speaking countries in the world.

667
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:54,140


668
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,540
Millions and millions and millions of dollars worth.

669
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,460
Actually, all of their money.

670
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,800
That day that prohibition was stricken from the books

671
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,200
and the river of swill began to pour through this nation once again.

672
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,280
Joseph Kennedy's tankers, huge ship tankers,

673
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,780
were sitting in New York Harbor filled with scotch whiskey.

674
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,200
And for many, many years, brother, every jigger of whiskey,

675
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,840
every pint of whiskey, every half pint of alcohol

676
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,620
that Americans consumed in this nation,

677
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,460
that broke hearts, that blasted lives,

678
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,400
that damned so many souls,

679
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,640
that caused so many children to go without something to eat,

680
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,380
that caused so many mothers to weep in hell and horror and sorrow

681
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:41,060
because of a drunken husband that drove so many to a Christless grave,

682
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,380
that filled a penitentiary with men and women,

683
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,840
that put men and women in an early grave and an early demise.

684
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,740
Joseph Kennedy pocketed millions of phones,

685
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,400
and tens of millions of dollars from his ill-gotten gain.

686
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,800
Every ounce, every pint, every drop,

687
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,080
Mr. Kennedy profited by it,

688
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,560
and millions rolled into his coffers.

689
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,040
And then Jack Kennedy, the millions of dollars bought it,

690
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,860
the hundred million that rolled in and purchased for him

691
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,860
the highest office in the land.

692
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,400
And his son was the president of the United States of America.

693
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,620
They called it the New Frontier.

694
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:21,820
And then on the other side,

695
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,680
a madman's bullet blew the brains out

696
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,160
of possibly the most powerful man in the entire world.

697
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,700
And the prancing horses pulled the caisson

698
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,020
containing the body of this powerful man,

699
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,420
and it was laid beneath the eternal flame.

700
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,740
Robert Kennedy would take a pledge.

701
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,240
He was married.

702
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,720
The strings would pass.

703
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:47,820
But it was also true that the assassin missed his target,

704
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,000
for he wanted John Kennedy to die,

705
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,800
and that he was unable to do.

706
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,460
For no man could take away years of lightning

707
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,260
with a single day of drugs.

708
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,980
Well, the truth, young man,

709
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,340
you don't really sound that way, do you?

710
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,560
Well, yes, that's true, Mr. President, I don't.

711
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,840
But then again, you don't really speak that way, do you?

712
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,380
Well, young man, something is going to have to be done about this.

713
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,380
Well, Mr. President, that's awfully nice of you

714
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,740
to want to do something about it.

715
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,460
Yes, young man.

716
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,800
Well, why don't you sit here and make yourself at home?

717
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:19,840
I'll be back in a minute.

718
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,180
I'll be back in a minute.

719
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:31,520
More than 16 people who seemingly had nothing to do

720
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:40,000
with that awful event have died under mysterious conditions.

721
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,100
He's short to tenure.

722
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,520
He, more than any other American leader,

723
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,980
galvanized a nation and caused its corrugated ironsides

724
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,140
to swell with pride.

725
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,220
Yes, yes, yes.

726
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:51,220


727
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,420
And a vision of new Americanism extending far out

728
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,580
into the blackness of outer space.

729
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,420
With a better understanding of the practical problems associated

730
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,220
with conducting these deep underground seabed nuclear

731
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,420
experiments, we now have to be true.

732
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:10,600
Folks, the reason you might hear little voices doing

733
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,040
odd and unrelated talking in the background

734
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,760
is because these people also produced a radio show.

735
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,720
We had the information on the overman.

736
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,920
It was one considered a segue.

737
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,200
I love it.

738
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,820
I don't know how he's gonna do it.

739
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,520
Apparently he says that he has a wonderful ability

740
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,300
that none of the rest of us have, such as powers of flight

741
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,500
and invisibility, commando command and other things.

742
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,400
Yes, he has the power of flight and invisibility.

743
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,440
In fact, he flew over to see you, and he's standing behind you right now.

744
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,020
Woo hoo!

745
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:47,820
Actually, if you're ever up Saturday very early in the morning, 4.30 to 6 a.m.,

746
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,800
you should definitely turn in KPFA and you'll hear.

747
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,640
one of the stranger things on radio, one of the more brilliant things on radio.

748
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,600
It's good morning. It's time to give a show.

749
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:06,340
Alive! The television is a liar. Just listen to your radio.

750
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:07,700
In Berkeley.

751
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,680
Sensor-censored radio.

752
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,880
Listener-censored radio station in Berkeley, California, and it's, uh, what's the show?

753
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,360
Okay, good.

754
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:13,940
Everybody.

755
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,280
Hey, wait. They heard us and they went away.

756
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,920
It's only bought us a little time, but before the battle begins again,

757
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,200
I want you to have peace.

758
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,700
Maybe they can help you.

759
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,420
What is this?

760
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,520
Yeah, thanks a lot, Hal.

761
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,860
Hey, do me a favor, though.

762
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,960
Would you return my EC comics before the world ends?

763
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,120
I'm sorry, I had to sell them.

764
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:36,060
Okay, Hal, well, you're a real pal, so let's just go kick the living

765
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,180
bean out of these monsters.

766
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,080
Safety off.

767
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,780
Okay, guys, let's jump.

768
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,240
Okay, the show's down there.

769
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,040
Let's get the tar and pour the hot tar.

770
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:47,820
Whoa!

771
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,000
If that didn't do it, nothing will.

772
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,560
We poured boiling hot tar all over the show.

773
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,720
And if that didn't destroy it, nothing will.

774
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,100
I think we're safe again.

775
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:57,620
Yeah.

776
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:00,440
And the show, you know, is just a show.

777
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,040
Ha ha.

778
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,400
Gravity motor is decreasing.

779
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,900
It's, uh, we need a program four here.

780
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,560
Ha ha ha.

781
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,600
We don't really want you to kill all the presidents.

782
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:09,300
Okay.

783
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,700
But seriously, folks, no, we really have to get down.

784
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,380
I want information.

785
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,380
I'm a news person, and I want some hard facts.

786
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,360
So let's start over here.

787
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:25,220
It's dead-eyed Brugos rudiment of a head shaking from side to side.

788
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:25,760
Ha ha.

789
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,560
You should have seen it.

790
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,880
Ugly as sin and a big dumb thing.

791
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,800
But we don't like these big dumb things that are as ugly as sin.

792
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,260
We want to banish them.

793
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,620
Banish them from our midst.

794
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,520
Make them steal away from our comforting campfire.

795
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,820
Out into the cold, eternal dark, where they orbit us eternally howling.

796
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,380
Lonely and cold in the blackness.

797
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:49,560
The darkness of the pure, ultra-black velvet night.

798
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:53,300
Oh, my friends, if I could only tell you what these monsters do for recreation,

799
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,660
you wouldn't wish to listen to this program ever again.

800
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,340
These monsters do not play by the rules we know.

801
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,300
These monsters do not play fair.

802
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,000
They are dealing from the bottom of the cosmic deck.

803
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,100
Let's take a look at one of these monsters at home.

804
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,100
Such a strange dream.

805
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,440
I used to think they all worked at the same time.

806
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,120
I used to think about something on the radio and to me.

807
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,080
What do you mean?

808
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,080
The feeling of...

809
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,280
A sense of foreboding.

810
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,020
Like something awful is about to happen.

811
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,160
I don't like this dream.

812
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,240
Hello again.

813
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:42,340
You go to something that says subgenius and you expect real music.

814
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,400
Or real anti-music or something.

815
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:44,920
I'm going to get her playing.

816
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,840
But I've heard better anti-music.

817
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:47,680
Yeah, me too.

818
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,120
Well, of course you have.

819
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,280
That's the idea.

820
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:52,560
Believe me, we haven't played better anti-music.

821
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,700
Now we're examining a typical monster.

822
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,680
About 40,000.

823
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,500
But we'll increase the magnification and go in with a search.

824
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:07,420
Hello, this is Nankar Feld and I'd like to remind you to stay tuned for more of Elevator Girls in Heat.

825
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,320
After this message from the Sons of Painful Lightning.

826
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,240
Take it away, dog.

827
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,880
There's a flame and then nothing.

828
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,580
Yes, that's the arm train.

829
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,020
Please do not touch it before it cools down.

830
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,440
On board was a stowaway.

831
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,340
Yes, Gary Garbrokian had stood away aboard his own tiny tape recorder.

832
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,280
And was on his way to that unfriendly planet to see for himself what was there.

833
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,120
Who goes there?

834
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,160
Who's in the corner?

835
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,360
Come off of that airlock.

836
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,120
Go away, Philo.

837
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,600
Yes, in fact, he's turned into a salesman almost equaling that of Dobbs.

838
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,160
If Dobbs was the saint of sales, Philo was the...

839
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,320
Vicar.

840
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:44,700
Vicar of sales.

841
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,520
Yes, that's right.

842
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,980
The vicar who does not dicker.

843
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,380
The suspense is killing me.

844
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:50,920
What would he want to sell us?

845
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,200
Sell you?

846
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,080
Actually, we're...

847
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,240
Probably a Yellow Page ad from the sound of your voice.

848
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,620
He's a subliminal salesman.

849
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,320
He has already made the sale and you have already paid.

850
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,500
What are you kidding?

851
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:01,520
Pretty bad, huh?

852
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,560
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

853
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,520
God cause me hyperpagy.

854
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,000
Stretch of time.

855
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,340
Oh, don't worry.

856
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,580
We're going to edit it all out when we send these snappy cassettes off to our friend.

857
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,200
What is Bob?

858
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,120
Bob's a salesman.

859
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,300
Just a salesman.

860
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,320
Well, he's a special person.

861
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,940
John Carroll said that Bob was a tree or a car or...

862
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,220
That's right.

863
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,320
That's what John Carroll said.

864
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:24,000
Whatever happened to that guy that wanted to marry me that he called up a long time ago?

865
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:24,260
He did.

866
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,160
You can call and be hung up on.

867
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,380
Just listen to your radio.

868
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:34,860
Yeah, I wanted to know which of the disparaging remarks against our president caused the

869
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:38,620
Secret Service to visit one of the subgeniuses.

870
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,800
I just had a question.

871
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,040
Anyway, it's my estimation of the age.

872
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:44,280
Dave?

873
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:44,280


874
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:56,960
Oh, this has been a long time.

875
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:08,420
Fifteen years later, shucks, Dave James came down to jail.

876
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,360
I'm not talking about that old relationship that wasумp in Zip.

877
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:14,280
I'm talking about ***

878
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,280


879
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,280


880
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,400
not so many new ones.

881
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,200
It's really a different show these days.

882
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:26,080
But back in them days, boy, there was some intense psychedelia that happened.

883
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,600
And I sure did enjoy it.

884
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,740
We just happened to get a new old stash of those.

885
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:38,560
One of our listeners out there, St. Dave Santovan,

886
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:43,300
whose mailings to us we do not understand in any way at all.

887
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:48,740
Sent me a stack of 12 KPFA tapes that I could tell by the handwriting

888
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,800
had come to him from puzzling evidence himself.

889
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,920
And now they've been sent back to me and shared with you,

890
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,980
whether you like it or not, whether it makes a damn bit of sense.

891
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,600
Actually, I kind of believe that it does.

892
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,460
And that's why we do these things.

893
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:09,020
But if it doesn't, you can always find out the basic core truth behind it all

894
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:13,200
by simply writing for free information from this religion.

895
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,040
The Church of the Subgenius.

896
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:19,020
And I'm about to give you that post office box number and email address.

897
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,900
That post office box number, friends, as you know, probably by now,

898
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,000
you can just write to Bob at

899
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:33,360
Post Office Box 140306.

900
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,640
That's Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

901
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,140
Yes, where we teach a mischievous president.

902
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,640
And that people who shoot at presidents.

903
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:53,340
That zip code, once again, 75214.

904
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,240
There, now you've heard it twice.

905
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:01,820
And for email, you can just simply send that little bit of data

906
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:07,600
to slack at metronet.com.

907
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,880
Oh, yes.

908
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,580
Well, let's see what else has been.

909
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,140
We've listened.

910
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:16,220
We've listened to a lot of subgenius and subgenius-related radio.

911
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,620
Most of the last 15 or 20 minutes was edited by puzzling evidence, I think,

912
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:27,180
and played at some point there in Berkeley, as I say, about 12 years ago.

913
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,400
But now...

914
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,360
Good evening, friends.

915
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,840
Good evening, friends.

916
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,580
This is Evan Rockingham.

917
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,200
Tonight I bring for you a fight to win.

918
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,760
This is a time of a great war, friends.

919
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:42,340
Today we're here.

920
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,180
Today we're here.

921
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:43,720
Today we're here.

922
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,040
We're here.

923
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:44,680
And we're here for the invasion.

924
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,120
But we're here to win.

925
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,060
We're here for the arms of the population.

926
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,820
We're here to fight.

927
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:54,620
We're here to start.

928
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:54,920
We're here for the onions.

929
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,780
We're here for the allergic.

930
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,820
We're here for the back.

931
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,260
We're here for the begins.

932
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,520
We're here for the end.

933
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:06,360
And today, we're living for the reasons nobody anders.

934
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,900
So now there's only one thing we're here for aquí.

935
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:07,980
We're here today to lead another war.

936
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,040
And to bring death as a Steinbach.

937
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,020
Now I'd like to thank my friends atобщach.

938
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,080
And to remind you that we have to do this every week.

939
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:13,260


940
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:13,280
And you have to definitely listen the following.

941
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:13,280


942
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,100
There is the true word of Bob in Revelation X.

943
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,500
Turn to page 50.

944
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,500
The great big black letters appear in the following passage.

945
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:30,320
All normality must be cleansed from the face of the earth.

946
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,380
The text goes on to read,

947
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:38,360
Normality is what really averts unnatural disease and evil.

948
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,940
Now, there are many interpretations of the word Bob,

949
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,800
and then there are the hardcore Simjee,

950
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:49,540
except Simjee is fundamentally the dirty king and the Bob.

951
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,120
And yes, friends, I am one of those.

952
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,120
And from this passage, I will take my cue.

953
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,120
Seven, seven, speaks to life.

954
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,440
Seven down on Benedict.

955
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,900
Taste the whip.

956
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,600
In love not given lightly.

957
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,420
Taste the whip now before me.

958
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,100
Taste the whip now before me.

959
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,980
I am tired.

960
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,560
I am weary.

961
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,460
I sleep for a thousand years.

962
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,300
A thousand dreams that would awake me.

963
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:52,420
Different colors made from the two worlds.

964
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:17,840
Different colors made from the tears.

965
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:23,080
Different colors made from the tears.

966
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,560
Different colors made from the tears.
