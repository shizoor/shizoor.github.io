1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is really amazing.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:13,960
Let's get ready for the final, we hope not really the final, adventure as we put our hands on the screen and our testicles down on the mouse pad.

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,200
We want to make sure no rodents are biting down there and we begin now.

4
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,180
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

5
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:57,140
As most of you can probably deduce from your surroundings, this last July 5th wasn't July 5th, 1998.

6
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,640
So, 1998.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,920
It hasn't happened yet.

8
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:11,980
And instead of having the alien AI called Muom do it all for us, we have to edit these hours of recordings from 19X Day ourselves.

9
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:25,320
Luckily, the night before we left Cleveland for the drill, we guested on Dr. Sinister's show Radio Synesthesia at WCSB for two hours, of which this is the first.

10
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,700
Participants include Dr. Howell, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,060
Princess We Are Doe, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and several of Dr. Sinister's frequent callers.

12
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,240
Thank you.

13
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,040
Teary Eyes

14
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,040


15
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,380
been,

16
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,680
bai,

17
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,300
rak

18
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,440
Soon as its open,

19
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,780


20
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,880
fully grabbed,

21
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,540
loaded,

22
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:28,580
,

23
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,780
Mind you, atoms under

24
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,100
Mind you, destroy everything you touch

25
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,040
Today, destroy me

26
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,840
This way, everything you touch

27
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,800
You don't feel, do not know

28
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,560
What you steal

29
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,600
Shake your hand, take your gun

30
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,540
Watch you out of the sun

31
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,760
Watch you touch

32
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,800
You don't feel, do not know

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,500
What you steal

34
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,980
Destroy everything you touch

35
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,940
Today, please destroy me

36
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,980
This way

37
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,000
Destroy everything you touch

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,900
Today, destroy me

39
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,860
This way, anything that may delay you

40
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,940
Might just save you

41
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,660
You only have to know

42
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,760
Behind you, atoms under

43
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,960
Mind you, destroy everything you touch

44
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,800
Today, destroy me

45
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,620
This way, everything you touch

46
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,580
You don't feel, do not know

47
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,340
What you steal

48
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,460
Shake your hand, take your gun

49
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,400
Watch you out of the sun

50
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,500
Watch you touch

51
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,540
You don't feel, do not know

52
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,300
What you steal

53
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,740
Destroy everything you touch

54
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,740
Today, please destroy me

55
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,760
This way

56
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,500
Everything you touch

57
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,240
You don't feel

58
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,440
Do not know

59
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,780
Destroy everything you touch

60
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,600
Today, please destroy me

61
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,220
This way, através to the past

62
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,220


63
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,220


64
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,220


65
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,220


66
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,220


67
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,220


68
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,220


69
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,220


70
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,140
Touch, you don't feel, do not know, what you steal.

71
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:36,200
Shake your cup, take your cup, wash you out of the sun.

72
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:44,100
Watch you touch, you don't feel, do not know, what you steal.

73
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,400
Destroy everything you touch today.

74
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,580
Please join me this way.

75
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:16,860
I figured it was appropriate to play a song by a British band called Destroy Everything You Touch in honor of the Brexit.

76
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,720
Stay tuned.

77
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:17,980
We've got it.

78
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,600
A couple more songs on the way and we're going to start the talk show early tonight because we have some very special guests in the studio.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,360
And that was the wrong track.

80
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,520
How do I do this to myself?

81
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,540
Right album.

82
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,360
For those of you who are metalheads, you immediately know what album I'm playing off of.

83
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,780
All right.

84
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,200
Let's try this track instead.

85
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,380
All right.

86
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,260
Let's do it.

87
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,360
All right.

88
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,480
Let's go.

89
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,620
Come back the world until they fall in love comes flowing through.

90
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,600
Children now tomorrow.

91
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:14,600
schnell prokofiev työces.

92
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,660
You see that of all today.

93
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,380
You see that of all today.

94
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,360
Will the sunrise of tomorrow bring in peace in any way?

95
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,480
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?

96
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,340
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?

97
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:36,460
Yeah!

98
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,320
guitar solo

99
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,300
guitar solo

100
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,360
So you children of the world

101
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,440
listen to what I say

102
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,480
If you want a better place to live

103
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,960
it's better what you need

104
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,620
Know the world and love is still alive

105
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,360
You must be brave

106
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,040
For you children of today

107
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,600
are children of the grave

108
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,520
Yeah!

109
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,220
guitar solo

110
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,960
guitar solo

111
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,520
yachting

112
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:28,520


113
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:28,520


114
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,860
children of the grave

115
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,840
piano solo

116
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,520
guitar solo

117
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,520
piano solo

118
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,360
I can hear.

119
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,000
Can I be heard here?

120
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,200
My goodness, that microphone appears to be working.

121
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,080
Well, you see, it was always ready to go.

122
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,240
It had a potential for working, which has now been freed.

123
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,520
But the last time we tried it, it didn't work.

124
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,280
That was when they were not ready to hear our message.

125
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:31,680
Ah.

126
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,960
Yes, the microphone has finally fulfilled its potential.

127
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,660
Yes, we got it straightened out.

128
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,300
Actually, I'm going to say something here real quick.

129
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,500
This is Synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland.

130
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,360
Very special edition here, the annual X-Day preview.

131
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,340
And portions, if not all, of the following broadcast will be objectionable to some members of the audience.

132
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,620
And views or opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of WCSB or Cleveland State University

133
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,200
or anybody with their head screwed on straight.

134
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,100
Listener discretion is advised and all that.

135
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:09,100
But I just remembered this track in the background right now is off an album called Witching Hour by Ladytron,

136
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,960
which is one of my favorite albums of all time.

137
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,880
And I remember when we got the promo copy of it, it had this sticker on it that says,

138
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,760
they have...

139
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,460
Finally fulfilled their potential.

140
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,440
And I thought that was like the worst thing you could possibly write on a sticker on a promo copy of a CD.

141
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,280
Like, what, does that mean their previous album sucked?

142
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,540
And does that mean they're not going to get any better than this?

143
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:30,960
Like, I don't know.

144
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,680
That's just not very good promo language.

145
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,980
But anyway, this microphone over here, which is occupied by Dr. Howell.

146
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,480
Beep.

147
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,860
Howell or Hal.

148
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,440
I don't know.

149
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,140
I can...

150
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,500
You can go either way, right?

151
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,520
Whatever you're comfortable with, that's just fine with me.

152
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,180
That microphone.

153
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,720
That microphone has finally fulfilled its potential.

154
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,500
We also have Princess We Are Doe and the Reverend Ivan Stang here in the studio.

155
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,440
Right over there.

156
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,040
And it looks like we have Lonesome Cowboy Dave here on the line.

157
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,060
Hello, you are on the air.

158
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,500
I am on the air.

159
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,940
You are on the air, sir.

160
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,520
I am glad to be on the air, sir.

161
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,180
This is where you belong.

162
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,120
All together again.

163
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,760
He's on, in, and through.

164
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,520
Well, you and I did.

165
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,680
He's dancing on air.

166
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,720
I feel so flashy and fleshy now.

167
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,680
I feel like a hippopotamus came and just overtook my feelings.

168
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,660
Easy, son.

169
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,100
Easy.

170
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,540
Well, uh...

171
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,820
Um, you know, this is just a temporary feeling.

172
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,300
We've got to be more or less clear-headed for what's coming down the track.

173
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,340
It may be a temporary feeling now, but you can make it permanent

174
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,320
when you have the proper Havafrop Zipulops in your system.

175
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,520
That stuff's hard to get.

176
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,240
One dose is a permanent transformation.

177
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,480
Why is it?

178
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,440
In my yard that I had to go and get,

179
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,140
and that's what took me so long calling some back.

180
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,980
I had a little...

181
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,480
Betting holy men hang out in your yard?

182
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,480
They actually call it an invasive species here in Ohio,

183
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,520
and what are you talking about?

184
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,100
It's hard to get.

185
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,400
It's like what kudzu is in the South.

186
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,400
We can't get rid of it.

187
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,620
But this is the metaphorical usage,

188
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,280
since, as any true subgenius knows,

189
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,600
Havafrop Zipulops is not marijuana,

190
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,680
except by metaphorical extension.

191
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,800
So we use it for...

192
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:15,960
Here.

193
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,840
That, you know, just idle chatter,

194
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,440
but actual Havafrop Zipulops is a very rare herb

195
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,640
which only grows on the droppings of certain Tibetan holy men,

196
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,460
like the Marifasa Luminasa, or werewolf plant,

197
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,240
which was collected by Dr. Yogami

198
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,420
and brought to England in the 1920s.

199
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,880
And that's what I thought that...

200
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,100
Yeah, I thought all the werewolves were dressed like that.

201
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,720
At least...

202
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,760
Three or four of them.

203
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,420
Well, in the 50s, they used to be dressed differently,

204
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,860
but they tend to rip and surge through your clothes.

205
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,800
Their clothes.

206
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,840
Well, and yours, too.

207
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,280
But that's...

208
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,800
Inspiration for mostly raiders.

209
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,140
I think they were, a lot of them.

210
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,300
The neopanicoids.

211
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,500
Well, what about the mysterious phantom werewolf battalions

212
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,920
after World War II,

213
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,600
where it was thought that in the Alpine Redoubt,

214
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,980
fanatical Nazi werewolf groups were going to cause trouble

215
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,900
to the Allied forces?

216
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,580
It turned out that that was only an idle rumor, or was it?

217
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,720
I heard that the Nazi zombies interfered with the Nazi werewolves.

218
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,440
Yes, yes.

219
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,240
The Third Reich was less coordinated than people give it credit for.

220
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,760
Various departments actually competed against each other,

221
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,980
thus weakening the war effort.

222
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,140
According to Colonel...

223
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,700
Hauptmann von Kirsteiner.

224
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,040
So there was inter-ministry friction going on,

225
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,280
and that's what caused the slowness of the retardation

226
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,400
of returning back to solving the problem.

227
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,720
Yeah, but they all got to wear snappy uniforms.

228
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,640
And as I think puzzling evidence pointed out,

229
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,580
the side that has the coolest uniforms always loses in wars.

230
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,420
Did you ever hear him say that?

231
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,820
Yeah, I have.

232
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,920
No, but it does add up, I suppose.

233
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,220
Yes, when you consider the various conflicts we can keep in mind.

234
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,720
The ones with the fanciest weapons win, usually.

235
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,760
Or the fanciest brains.

236
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,860
I think it's why we lose now.

237
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,460
We dress like Nazis now,

238
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,440
and we're more aggressive and foreboding and evil and so forth and everything,

239
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,880
but we look too cool to actually win.

240
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,420
Who dresses like Nazis?

241
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,840
And I guess even the beginning of the Korean War,

242
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,720
the American soldiers...

243
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,600
Yeah, Joe looked kind of like just a guy off the street with a funny helmet on.

244
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,660
USA out of America, now!

245
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,600
Now.

246
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,700
Now.

247
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,280
Well, it turned out those helmets were more efficient

248
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,760
than the old half-watermelon types that dog faces used to wear.

249
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,200
A little neck protection might increase some protection

250
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,480
to the grunt in the field by some slight margin.

251
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,420
Well, the Star Trek...

252
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,940
Troopers, they have pretty fancy uniforms, and they didn't lose.

253
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,560
Yeah, look where it got them.

254
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,860
Yeah, they ultimately lose.

255
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,540
Those Empire guys do pretty good.

256
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,260
Well, there are a lot of them.

257
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,500
More where they came from.

258
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,060
Cannon fodder from many planets,

259
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,800
from podunk planets of the stakes of the galaxy,

260
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,240
poured into these conflicts.

261
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,400
And the...

262
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,040
Cannon men's square syndrome,

263
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,900
where you go out and...

264
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,020
You go out in the sticks and you tell everybody

265
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,080
that Lucifer has attacked the Virgin Mary,

266
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,500
and then you reproduce as many as you can

267
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,780
before the last cycle is through.

268
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,500
But it's not like you're washing your clothes or anything,

269
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,260
like you're actually being brainwashed, kind of.

270
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,500
Yes, first the brains and then the clothes.

271
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,460
In the case of the Tiananmen Square street party,

272
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,600
the country soldiers who were brought in to...

273
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,640
Because the city soldiers wouldn't shoot at the students,

274
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,880
or they'd talk about it if they...

275
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,040
They did.

276
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,980
They brought in soldiers from the country

277
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,040
and then shot them up with meth

278
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,460
and said,

279
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,820
go in there and kill them protesting leftists,

280
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,680
or whatever they call them there, you know.

281
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,860
And then the National Guard went to the university

282
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,740
and shot those students.

283
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,340
Can you believe that would happen?

284
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,320
What a horrible country where a thing like that could happen,

285
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,060
where just people, just students protesting,

286
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,700
and they get shot.

287
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,240
Yeah, National Guard shooting students.

288
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,820
I'm glad that can never happen here.

289
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,280
That's crazy.

290
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,420
I'd leave a country like that.

291
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,080
We're going to make this country grape again.

292
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,220
Yes.

293
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,300
And some cherry, too, and apples.

294
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,780
Worst flavor ever.

295
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,480
Grape is the bottom of the barrel for popsicle flavor.

296
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,020
Make America grape again.

297
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,140
Yeah, terrible.

298
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,220
Everyone agrees it's the worst tasting popsicle flavor there is.

299
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,020
I don't agree with that.

300
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,060
I agree.

301
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,960
I like grape popsicles.

302
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,420
You do?

303
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,140
Yes.

304
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,740
And I like grape juice.

305
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,880
Well, that means there's all the...

306
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,800
the banana and root beer left over for me, then.

307
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,580
That's right.

308
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,440
We'll make America bananas again.

309
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,960
I think durian would probably be the worst popsicle flavor.

310
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,640
Yes, it would certainly last.

311
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,060
Durian.

312
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,700
Durian.

313
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,940
Durian, that would be the worst.

314
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,380
Stinky.

315
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,340
At least in terms of things that are actually based on food.

316
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:31,960
You know, you could...

317
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,900
You know, with the chemistry we have nowadays,

318
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,200
you can make artificial flavors out of any smell that you can think of.

319
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,140
Yes, and then make them into...

320
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,800
What do they call those?

321
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,880
You can even make a popsicle that tastes...

322
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,100
tastes the way a booger smells.

323
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,280
Yeah, they have booger-smelled candies now and stuff, too.

324
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,340
Yeah, our grandchildren have a game where you...

325
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,600
Yeah.

326
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,480
You pick these little candies, and it might...

327
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,860
The brown one might taste like coconut,

328
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,320
and it might taste like something really, really horrible.

329
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,180
Mm-hmm.

330
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,160
They have pukey-tasting ones and rotten egg-tasting ones.

331
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,460
There were some Harry Potter candies that came out that were vile.

332
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,000
Yes.

333
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,820
And that's part of the game.

334
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,400
Grass flavors.

335
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
One that was flavored like earwax.

336
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,420
Yeah, earwax, grass, flavors like that.

337
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,840
They were pretty accurate, too.

338
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,340
Yes.

339
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,200
It's funny that people are eating...

340
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,100
When we were little, they didn't have things like this,

341
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,840
like puke-flavored candy and stuff.

342
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,900
No, we didn't have puke-flavored candy.

343
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,520
It's funny that they would do grasses of flavoring because...

344
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,360
We had to make our own in those days.

345
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,760
I used to know people who would actually drink shots of wheatgrass juice, like...

346
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,420
Yeah, it's like Nebuchadnezzar.

347
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,020
I used to drink wheatgrass juice.

348
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,880
That was the cool...

349
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,740
That was the coolest thing you could do in Los Angeles in the year of 1984.

350
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,500
I could swear when I was getting a cold, if I took that, it made me feel better.

351
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,400
By the time you're feeling the symptoms of a cold, it's too late to do anything about it.

352
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,540
Oh, I know, I know.

353
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,640
It's all psychological.

354
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,080
The first time I heard about wheatgrass juice,

355
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:11,160
Martin Mothersbaugh of Devo was buying me one at a fancy cafe in Hollywood.

356
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,660
And what was your reaction to tasting it?

357
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,360
Bleh.

358
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,820
Yeah.

359
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,060
Well, you know, it tasted healthy in a strange...

360
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,980
It's so healthy, I might kill myself.

361
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,780
...grassy way.

362
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,260
You know what?

363
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,380
It didn't taste nearly as bad as some other things.

364
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,200
Once upon a time, I tried to eat a psychedelic cactus, but I didn't know how to prepare it properly.

365
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,620
You take the thorns out of it.

366
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:31,940
Yeah.

367
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,060
So, you know, I ended up like...

368
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:42,200
I ended up putting the psychedelic cactus into a juicer because I thought maybe I could just chug it all at once.

369
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,660
Blah.

370
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,540
Oh, no.

371
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,040
No.

372
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:44,480
No.

373
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,980
I immediately started to vomit and like it was...

374
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,020
But with pretty colors.

375
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,560
It was all in one strand, you know, like I was actually pulling this long strand of stuff out of my throat.

376
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,200
Yes.

377
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,580
Once you swallow...

378
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:54,940
Wow.

379
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,740
Compared to that, the wheatgrass juice was so easy.

380
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,860
And you did see Quetzalcoatl after...

381
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,180
And not to mention the pond scum.

382
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,420
We used to do shots of pond scum back when I was a snake oil salesman.

383
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,240
But those killer amoebas are in there.

384
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,340
But it wasn't just pond scum.

385
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,380
It was certified organic pond scum from a pristine lake in Oregon.

386
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:11,840
Yes.

387
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,780
Blue-green algae.

388
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,240
Of course, it's organic.

389
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,980
It's not a dirty lake.

390
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,300
It's not a dirty lake.

391
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:14,340
It's not a dirty lake.

392
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:14,620
It's not a dirty lake in Ohio.

393
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,380
That simply means the presence of living tissue.

394
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,760
And only the inorganic is clean.

395
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,920
Anything having to do with life produces dirt.

396
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,320
He's right, you know.

397
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,880
That is true.

398
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,860
Dirty things produce life.

399
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,140
That's why dirty bitch, naughty bitch, all that stuff.

400
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,580
Well, let's not go into personal examples.

401
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,540
What?

402
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,500
Well, we're talking about pregnant waitresses right now.

403
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,520
And some of them are over 300 pounds.

404
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,260
And over 400 years old.

405
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,060
I'm glad to know what we're talking about.

406
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,180
I didn't know we were talking about pregnant waitresses.

407
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,700
Yeah, so they are.

408
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,360
Excuse me.

409
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:50,620
Excuse me.

410
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,680
Is that your rationale for not giving them the tip that they think they are entitled to?

411
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,180
No, they usually get a tip.

412
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,620
Just the tip.

413
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,860
They just come by your table and smile.

414
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,160
And you get the idea, you know.

415
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,460
Hmm.

416
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,120
Why?

417
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,820
You know the tip letter.

418
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,680
Mm-hmm.

419
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,620
But pregnancy is, just think of the foul biotics.

420
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,320
Wait, Trit.

421
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,300
Please wait, Trit.

422
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,220
Well, fortunately, the developing embryo is insulated.

423
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:14,320
Oh, my God.

424
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,320


425
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,320


426
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,320


427
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,320


428
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,320


429
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,320


430
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,900
From these odors.

431
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:23,620
And there's nothing to disturb his olfactory senses.

432
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,960
Oh, if only I could be here again.

433
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,980
In a warm womb.

434
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,820
Drifting in the womb.

435
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,060
It's floating.

436
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,140
Womb with a view.

437
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,360
Listening to my parents fight, but not knowing that was what it was.

438
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,020
Thinking it was some sort of revelation rock and roll game.

439
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,460
I mean...

440
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:51,380
You know, I kind of wish my parents had fought in front of me, then their divorce wouldn't have blindsided me the way it did.

441
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,960
Just get your ear close to the navel and you can hear all that stuff.

442
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,100
Oh, my.

443
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,260
Yes, I prefer the navel orange, but it comes in all colors.

444
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,580
Pink is...

445
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,760
Now, what was my line?

446
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,180
Orange is the new pink.

447
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,020
Well, orange and black is the new seersucker.

448
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,000
Yes.

449
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000


450
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000


451
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000


452
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000


453
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000


454
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000


455
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000


456
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000


457
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000


458
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000


459
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000


460
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000


461
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000


462
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000


463
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,440
Pink and black are...

464
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,400
Are we going to have...

465
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,340
What is seer, anyway?

466
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Like, I mean, like, let's say that you have the power of clairvoyance or something, and, like, is that like getting head?

467
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,520
Well, seer...

468
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,460
Is that what a seer sucker does?

469
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:32,520
Yeah, a seer is withered and dried out and rustling and crumbling and used up and...

470
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,180
Doesn't mean they don't need to be sucked.

471
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,460
Well...

472
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,400
Or wouldn't like to be.

473
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,040
I don't think so.

474
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,780
I don't think so.

475
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:39,860
I don't think so.

476
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:39,860


477
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:39,860


478
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:39,860


479
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:39,860


480
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:39,860


481
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,140
Don't let me keep you back.

482
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,520
I finally found out the name of the hat.

483
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,360
The hat?

484
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,140
The hat.

485
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,940
You see people wearing them in political rallies, and you see them worn by guys in barbershop

486
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,600
quartets.

487
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,520
I always...

488
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,620
Straw hats?

489
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,520
They might be made of straw...

490
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:58,880
Boaters.

491
00:25:59,180 --> 00:25:59,920
Exactly, yes.

492
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,220
For years and years, I went, what the hell is that hat called?

493
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,340
Anyway, I finally found it out.

494
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,380
Yeah, they're called boaters.

495
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,620
I figured you would know that.

496
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,380
In Washington, D.C., unregistered boaters.

497
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,660
Yeah, there's a lot of ignorant boaters out there.

498
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,200
Yeah, boy, I'd like to...

499
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,160
Low-information boaters, we call them.

500
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,020
They don't know what a paddle is, and they don't know what kind of creek they're in.

501
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:26,180
Messing around in boats, just paddling and splashing on a lazy summer day.

502
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,720
You can see them at Mirror Pond in Washington, D.C.

503
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,640
Dwelling flies on summer eve.

504
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,080
USA out of America now.

505
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:34,480
Call a boater.

506
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,700
I'm sorry, it's too dangerous.

507
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,560
We can't let you go out on that lake.

508
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,000
You might injure yourself.

509
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,320
It's a frozen euphemism.

510
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,240
Don't go there.

511
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,020
Don't look in the basement.

512
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,040
Keep telling yourself it's only a movie.

513
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,480
Only a movie.

514
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,760
Don't go into the woods.

515
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,660
Don't look in the attic.

516
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,480
Don't get on the bus.

517
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,520
Don't do anything.

518
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,060
Don't get on the subway.

519
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,640
Just stay home.

520
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,620
Don't go to the grocery store.

521
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,020
Fiddle with your little screen.

522
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,460
Don't go out.

523
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,260
Don't do anything.

524
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,180
Don't do anything but look.

525
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,640
It's easier to have the mediated experience.

526
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,020
I'm not loving everything right now.

527
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,000
And just think, there's a world at your fingertips.

528
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,980
A frozen, disheveled world.

529
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,060
Let your fingers do the walking.

530
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,160
The stomping through miniature cities.

531
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,840
Like cargoes of old, back in the day, I remember.

532
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,360
I remember.

533
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:34,440


534
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,200
I remember anything.

535
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:41,760
They spoke of Atlantis, but actually it was an archipelago of many different islands.

536
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,580
The larger one was also called Atlantis, or by its inhabitants, Poseidonis.

537
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,460
Dr. Howell, I have developed a theory.

538
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,800
I don't want to go into it in great detail with you here.

539
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,480
But I have reason to believe that Skull Island,

540
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,720
it was, in fact, the very last,

541
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,200
disappearing remnant of what had once been the continent,

542
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,780
the lost continent of Atlantis.

543
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,100
Hi, Brazil.

544
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:10,920
I believe...

545
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,880
But how did they get on the other side of Africa?

546
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,240
I believe it was actually off the coast of what is now Namibia.

547
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,640
It was very large.

548
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,440
And it went further south than the southern tip of Africa does.

549
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,660
It was beyond the Pillar of Hercules.

550
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,180
Oh, I get it.

551
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,500
The Pillar of Hercules, according to Plato.

552
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,060
It was named after the Atlantic Ocean.

553
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,680
I get it.

554
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,560
Well, the Atlantic Ocean named after it.

555
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,000
But we know the Atlanteans,

556
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,060
were the center of a seafaring empire.

557
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,600
One of their outposts was the city of Opar,

558
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,860
you know, of the jewels of Opar.

559
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,680
You know, that's where that came from.

560
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,700
And so, it is possible that they actually achieved

561
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,720
the other side of the African continent.

562
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,580
But Skull Island was west of Sumatra.

563
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:54,980
Right.

564
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,040
And I consider it to be similar to the Malagasy's,

565
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,500
to Madagascar, a large, isolated island,

566
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,600
on which evolution went its own way.

567
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,380
Of course, on the map, there's nothing for thousands of miles,

568
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,920
as Captain Englehorn said.

569
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,340
But, unless you believe the second movie,

570
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,640
that it sunk a year later, it should be found.

571
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,340
Oh, come on, Hal.

572
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,400
It sank.

573
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,180
That's pretty much established.

574
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,100
Oh, really?

575
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,380
Well, Atlantis or Skull Island?

576
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,580
I maintain that the two are, in fact, the same.

577
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,040
Did Edgar Cayce not say?

578
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:33,480
There are two.

579
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:33,900
There are all those.

580
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,220
They're beasts of men and men of beasts.

581
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,460
The giant monsters of those ruins.

582
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,800
Yeah, that's Atlantis.

583
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,820
The bearded giraffes and the Slovenians and Croats and the different...

584
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,380
The former capital was on the second island,

585
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,920
which at one time was part of the main island,

586
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,400
but it subsided and eventually sunk,

587
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,760
causing Sea Girt Poseidonis to be the...

588
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,400
Oh, what's this?

589
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,280
Oh, Atlantis journeyed to the center of the Earth,

590
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,020
the time machine.

591
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,820
We've got it all.

592
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,480
And we'll be showing these frightful classics at X Day

593
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,840
at the special Grindr house,

594
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,960
where you can rest your red-rimmed eyeballs

595
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,080
on cinematic visions of away, far and beyond.

596
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,520
Hal, I don't know if this is true of you,

597
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,340
because you're a few years older than me,

598
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,000
but these three movies kind of made me what I am today.

599
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,060
The George Pal Atlantis from the 60s,

600
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,420
his...

601
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,600
The Time Machine.

602
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,180
And he didn't do Journey to the Center of the Earth,

603
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,600
but it came out about the same time.

604
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,700
It came out around the same time as Mysterious Island

605
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,920
and in the whole Jules Verne revival of the 60s,

606
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,440
also when we were celebrating the centennial of the Civil War.

607
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,920
And in my lifetime, as I'm sure as well as in yours,

608
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,400
the last Civil War guy died.

609
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,580
Do you remember that?

610
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,620
Yeah, that was quite a few years ago.

611
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,960
He was a Confederate drummer boy who lied about his age to get in.

612
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,340
And he was the last one to perish in the war of Southron independence.

613
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,100
And so, since the Union Army didn't have anyone,

614
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,780
you could argue that they won,

615
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,700
since their guy was the last to drop down.

616
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,220
Well, what about the one that ended up going to Mars,

617
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,220
mentally, John Carter?

618
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,160
He never came back and is considered a Quisling

619
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,300
and not a part of Earth.

620
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,040
Also, there's some oddness about his early life,

621
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,600
which he, by his own ignorance,

622
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,720
his own relation couldn't even remember.

623
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,260
He couldn't remember his early life.

624
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,540
He said, as far as I know, I've always been about the age that I've been now.

625
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,640
Jules Verne of Opar?

626
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,100
No, Opar was visited by Tarzan

627
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,000
and in recent years covered up by Tarzan to be invisible from the air.

628
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,280
But it was where Tarzan got his bars of gold

629
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,000
that he used to continually rebuild his home

630
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,160
after Arabs would burn it down and things.

631
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,920
Ah, that was back in the day.

632
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,040
Doc Savage had an endless supply of gold,

633
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,140
but it was in South America somewhere,

634
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,200
an ancient, hidden tribe, city, Mayans or Arabs.

635
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:16,500
Doc Savage? You mean the erstwhile encumberment of TV or radio?

636
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,580
Son of Clark Savage. Doc Savage.

637
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,640
A good savage, not a diaphanous, fine-tinted...

638
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,120
He was a super-scientist and also a physical culturer.

639
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,220
He was a super-scientist in the days of Bernard MacFadden

640
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:35,620
and the idea of mens sanae in corpore sanoe.

641
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,680
Anticipating Superman, he had a fortress of solitude

642
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,980
in regions of intense cold,

643
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,860
which he'd sit outside in a swimsuit to toughen himself up.

644
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,480
He had a utility belt. That's where Batman got the idea.

645
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,380
Yeah, Batman got the utility belt from Doc Savage.

646
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,400
He was in New York in 1933,

647
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,100
when King Kong fell down.

648
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,180
He was in New York in 1936,

649
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,300
when King Kong fell off the Empire State Building,

650
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,140
because according to one account,

651
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,980
he drove up to examine the corpse,

652
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:08,840
but made no comment except for a shrill, trilling sound.

653
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,860
Well, they're saying now that that's what counts.

654
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:17,300
A lot of the recent research on mens sanae in corpore sanoe,

655
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,720
that it does make parts of your brain brain grow,

656
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,540
to do exercise.

657
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,580
Yes, one should exercise all parts of one's person,

658
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,280
because the phrase, use it or lose it,

659
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,800
is among the truest number of syllables that have ever been spoken.

660
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,480
That's what accounts for the bearded giraffe

661
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,120
and the other different species that haven't evolved yet.

662
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,740
Well, remember, no individual can evolve.

663
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,980
Once you're decanted, that's it.

664
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,460
You are developed.

665
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:49,920
Decanted.

666
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,320
You can only be somatic,

667
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,060
but not passed on to future generations.

668
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,260
We're working on changing that.

669
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,700
Well, yes, because Le Mans should have been the way to go.

670
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,140
On the Isle of Kaspach, of course, it's different,

671
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,960
but everywhere else we have to tow the Darwinian line.

672
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,820
Darwin doesn't apply there in the middle of the Melee.

673
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,220
Kaspach, known as Caprona,

674
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,940
two navigators named after the Italian navigator Caprona,

675
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:25,820
who followed Cook and first discovered that giant island

676
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:30,240
below the Antarctic Circle, surrounded by impassable cliffs,

677
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,820
a huge volcanic crater,

678
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,720
which some believe was created by a meteoric impact.

679
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:42,120
But inside, evolution progresses in a different way.

680
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,740
How beautiful.

681
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,240
And not only all creatures of past eras live there,

682
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,740
but some creatures of the future era live there,

683
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,100
including the very sinister future humans.

684
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,620
Winged, murderous men.

685
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,860
Anyway, it's something that need not concern us,

686
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,260
because some of us have already put claim on Caprona's shores

687
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:13,860
to take along in the infinitely large spacecraft heading our way.

688
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,740
Do you have dubs on that?

689
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,280
Yes, I put that in some time ago.

690
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,100
Does that make dubs?

691
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,100
Do you actually take a female version, perhaps,

692
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,540
of these large winged humans?

693
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,120
They had no females.

694
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,100
They had no females.

695
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,040
They had to raid the highest developed type of humans,

696
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,720
or Galus, and mate with them.

697
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,500
Like Smurfs.

698
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,200
They had many problems.

699
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,180
The Wirius of Kasbah on the land of U'o.

700
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,100
The city entirely built out of human skulls, their victims.

701
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,880
And the more people you murdered, the higher you got in their priesthood.

702
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,940
But they had some good things.

703
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,280
They were good cooks, and they had written language,

704
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,920
and they were quite advanced.

705
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,500
And I believe they were intended by the author to represent a type of future man.

706
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,240
When this book was written, which was in the 1920s,

707
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,200
the novels of Olaf Stapledon were common.

708
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,540
And in his Last and First Men,

709
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,480
you may recall that Stapledon posited a future generation of winged humans

710
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,900
who would one day evolve.

711
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,800
Well, he postulated every damn type of human you can think of.

712
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,500
That's right.

713
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,740
And the novels are also unusual in not having any characters.

714
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,920
Those things.

715
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,260
That makes it hard to read.

716
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,900
You just read about the vast episodes of the future.

717
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,640
It always helps to have it happening to somebody.

718
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,100
And a girl.

719
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,340
There's no boy meets girl stuff going on in there.

720
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,660
A buddy, Krummerhager, and Susie, your sweetheart.

721
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,200
Yeah, it all happened to them.

722
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,960
And then you get the million seller.

723
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,700
Well, who wrote the one you were talking about?

724
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,360
Edgar Rice Burroughs.

725
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:55,720
Oh, okay.

726
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:59,360
Well, that's The Land That Time Forgot trilogy.

727
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,940
I saw the movie, but I didn't read the book.

728
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,040
Oh, you should read the book.

729
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,540
I read the Pellucidor ones.

730
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,000
Those sort of poop out, though.

731
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,560
It's a magnificent concept.

732
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:15,680
But The Land That Time Forgot trilogy has great unity.

733
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,080
With Doug McClure.

734
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,620
No, you've got to forget that.

735
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:18,760
Hammer film.

736
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,020
No, it wasn't.

737
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,420
It wasn't Hammer.

738
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,420
It was Amicus.

739
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:30,780
And it had a fairly good broth in its construction from a Michael Moorcock screenplay.

740
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,080
But then they had almost no budget.

741
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:38,640
They had heroic efforts to create prehistoric life by Roger Dickon in puppet form.

742
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,840
But there, too, they ultimately fell down on their chest.

743
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:41,840


744
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,260
There's two names with phallic overtures going on.

745
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
There's Moorcock and there's Dick.

746
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,420
Everything that's interesting about the movie came in from its sources.

747
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,400
But everything that they added sort of didn't.

748
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,140
They degraded it.

749
00:37:53,580 --> 00:38:00,080
By the way, the Baron Friedrich von Schoenvortz is not a good guy in the book.

750
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,780
Doesn't sound like one.

751
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,580
But a despicable Prussian villain.

752
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,040
But he's a very...

753
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,920
He says all the prettiest words, though, doesn't he?

754
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,580
The movie had to make him into a good German.

755
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,120
I agree.

756
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,620
He was thoughtful.

757
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,200
I never saw that movie, actually.

758
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,760
And worried about people's problems.

759
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:17,780
No, in the book he slashes you across the face with his quirt and so forth.

760
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:22,380
And was previously a fiancée to the...

761
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:22,380


762
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,600
The lovely woman who was the object of the...

763
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,640
Man, this is America.

764
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,740
Why are you using French words like that, man?

765
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,540
Well, I'm trying to make it easier.

766
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,560
Lise LaRue, the heroine.

767
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:41,940
It's like a swagger stick that the Bosch struts around with,

768
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,780
maltreating his robotic minions.

769
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,380
I'm the greatest!

770
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,900
I'm the greatest!

771
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,380
And, you know, this, you think, is silly.

772
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,340
But the Kaiser and his brood were like that.

773
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:04,900
And it could come back again if elitism is allowed to gain its sway.

774
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:09,240
Well, hey, the Church of Subgenius is the ultimate elitist group.

775
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,640
Yes, but we don't slash people with swagger sticks.

776
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,780
We hand out the swagger sticks and they can do the slashing on their own.

777
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,640
Or just let them slash each other.

778
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,340
Yes, exactly.

779
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,100
And they do.

780
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,360
Which counts for a certain amount of money.

781
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,240
And there's a certain amount of attrition at this year's X-Day.

782
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,880
Many are laid up and recovering from the last slash-a-thon.

783
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,260
And they expect when they're asked for a quirt, they expect you to ask for a squirt.

784
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,000
And some of them are expecting the wrong thing when they get slapped in the face.

785
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,780
It's a quirt in the universe.

786
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,880
That's right.

787
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,040
Now prepare to receive the kiss of the lash.

788
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,480
And the Wiktionary says that it's the third person singular present of Queren.

789
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,520
Well, they sure know their onions.

790
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,620
So I'm not going to...

791
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,820
I'm not going to dispute that.

792
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,600
Er quirt.

793
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,960
Sie quirt.

794
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,780
Es quirt.

795
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,060
And remember...

796
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,880
Second personal plural present of Queren.

797
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,240
An imperative plural of Queren.

798
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:08,840
And used by Quisp, alien eater of sugary cereal.

799
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,580
Ah.

800
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,460
I don't know...

801
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,260
We'll see Quisp on X-Day.

802
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,120
Yes, and the three spoon men.

803
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,640
Munchy, Crunchy, and Spoonsize.

804
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,600
Because, as William Blake said, everything's a spoon.

805
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,320
Everything which is possible to be believed is an image of truth.

806
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:29,200
And it will all be unspeakably resolved.

807
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,000
Brought out into the light of day.

808
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
Oh yeah, whoever said it wasn't going to be...

809
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,060
If you can dream it, it can be there on X-Day.

810
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:48,980
We're not providing Namby Pamby silly kitty unicorns, but actual dangerous run-em-through stamp on you with their silver hooves unicorns.

811
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:49,700
Yep.

812
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,140
You know, no male human could catch one of those things.

813
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,760
They were deadly.

814
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,960
Well, this is what people have been living and dying for for so many years now.

815
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,960
And this is why the Church of the Sub-Genies is so popular.

816
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,760
And why X-Day is so popular.

817
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:10,580
They know that when they dream of some fierce mythological animal, it's going to really, really be there.

818
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,840
It's not going to be like some plastic dodo bag or like a pooled noodle or something like that.

819
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,440
Well, all the...

820
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,320
There will be a real ferocious monster to contend with.

821
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,360
Unimaginative conceptions will also be realized and also be there.

822
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,460
It'll be quite a crowd on that embarkation dock.

823
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,860
And delusional thinking will also be represented.

824
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:33,420
People will think of their past and change the things they didn't want that they did wrong.

825
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:42,960
Well, I think in Darwinian competition in the New World, the good ideas that survive will kill and eat the bad ideas that mill around...

826
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,160
And get indigestion shortly after.

827
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,160
You know, they...

828
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,060
Natural processes will not stop just because the old nature dies away.

829
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,240
Yep, back to farting corpses again.

830
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,320
Well, it's inherent in all matter that they let loose with that final blast.

831
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:09,020
Well, unless the mortician uses that little plastic plug thing that they were handing out one fine X-Day as gifts.

832
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,140
Yes, the tampion, the plug that they use.

833
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,240
But also you can...

834
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,820
Just the way they can stab a sheep and let out gas, they can also do that to the corpse.

835
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,180
If they are paying attention.

836
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:30,200
When corpses break wind, it's when they're waiting to be treated by the exponents of mortuary science.

837
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,720
And not after, unless they're dumb and don't know their skill.

838
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:38,640
You know, for those of you looking for a good career out there, a recession-proof career, mortuary science.

839
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,680
That's one job that's never going to go away.

840
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,320
Yeah, really.

841
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,020
Until no one bothers to embalm them anymore.

842
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,140
People better keep on keeping on.

843
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,060
Sure enough.

844
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,480
You can take people's life-saving...

845
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,660
You don't always have to embalm them completely.

846
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,780
You just have to exsanguinate them, I believe.

847
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,800
Exsanguinate them? That means to remove their blood.

848
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,300
You remove the blood, yes.

849
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:02,500
But you are supposed to embalm them because all sorts of regs have been put in place.

850
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,500
It varies wildly from state to state.

851
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,860
In some states, it's legal to have sex with a corpse.

852
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:14,320
If you request cremation, you still have to have the expensive embalming first, thanks to the...

853
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:14,880
Really?

854
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,520
In many states, as he says, not all, but in many, if you look into it...

855
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,100
Oh, man.

856
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:28,780
The death industry has really got the laws tied up.

857
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:33,500
Necrophilia is also an up-and-coming sport in most towns.

858
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:43,220
Now, the best thing to do is just to get yourself so lost that you can't be retrieved for somebody to make money out of.

859
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,860
If you're airplane-focused...

860
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:44,860


861
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:56,300
If you're flying into the side of a mountain, just think of how that will help your loved ones not pay expensive fees from the ghoulish undertaking industry.

862
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,220
If you die on Mount Everest, you become a landmark.

863
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,140
Yes.

864
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,620
Turn left at the dead guy in the red ski suit.

865
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,380
Yeah.

866
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,680
And then you go on until you see the dead guy in the blue ski suit.

867
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:11,260
I don't know which hiker sickle you're talking about because there are so many of them up here.

868
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,480
Each one more grotesque than the last.

869
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,560
Each one pointing in a different direction, leading the way onto the top to the Viceroy of the vociferous.

870
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,480
Boy, have they messed that place up.

871
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,100
You know, I don't know how to clean it up.

872
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,260
There's walls of frozen human excrement.

873
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,080
Yes.

874
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,280
Hills.

875
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,680
Because what else are you going to do?

876
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,060
And what's worse, global warming is coming.

877
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,400
You're right.

878
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,200
Well, the Arctic is going to be farting.

879
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,820
A lot of mysterious ancient gases and viruses.

880
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,280
Yes, from the mountains of madness.

881
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,340
The old tundra will reemerge.

882
00:44:50,200 --> 00:45:01,420
Siberian tundra is going to blurp out tons and tons of methane to rise into the upper atmosphere as it thaws from its age-old icy permafrost.

883
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,440
You know what this means?

884
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,100
All right.

885
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:12,180
If we're worried about global warming and there's going to be a massive outbreak of massive farting, okay, if we care about the environment, we all care about the environment.

886
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:12,180


887
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,460
We all know that methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2.

888
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,620
That means we have to light our farts on fire.

889
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,040
Right. Big lighters.

890
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:20,440
We have to.

891
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,920
But how can Mother Earth do that?

892
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:23,740
Provide about a government.

893
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,180
That's a really big match.

894
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,080
And where do you hold it?

895
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,740
How do you handle the timing?

896
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:29,880
It happened once before.

897
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,260
If you don't already know, I'm not going to tell you.

898
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:39,300
At the end of the Paleozoic, creating massive fires which actually changed the content of Earth's atmosphere.

899
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,620
Lucky for us.

900
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,480
That's what already happened in Southern California just recently.

901
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,080
Almost 150 houses were cased in fire.

902
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,660
A flatulent's gone awry.

903
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,900
All these fires should be seen in context of a warming planet.

904
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,980
The hotter we get, the more of these fires we're going to have.

905
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:56,920
It's a hoax!

906
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:08,120
At the end of the Paleozoic, the atmosphere had so much oxygen that it made giant, continent-spanning fires an easy proposition.

907
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,960
Most life died.

908
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,160
More than 90% of life died in that one.

909
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,460
Which happens when you just get a little bit too hot.

910
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:21,480
But there are always some critters that survive.

911
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,640
Plus if you have like a...

912
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,520
And those are our grandparents.

913
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,040
If you have a much higher oxygen concentration in the atmosphere, you end up with much larger insects.

914
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:35,840
Yes, but when after these fires, the age of giant insects was effectively at an end.

915
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,680
Unable to...

916
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,500
They breathe through their sides.

917
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,800
No more trilobites.

918
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,200
Yes, that was sad.

919
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:59,860
But the giant Megarachne spiders, Gigantoscorpio, the Megalo cockroaches, the giant dragonflies, the enormous millipedes and centipedes all had to take that long, cold dive into the deep six.

920
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,860
Yep, the long, greasy spoon into the earth.

921
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,880
Good thing that could never happen to humans.

922
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,760
We're such geniuses.

923
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,420
Well, it'll happen to the humans.

924
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,900
And the subgeniuses will remove themselves.

925
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,540
An epiphenomenon of humanity.

926
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,420
A footnote in the human story.

927
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,100
But perhaps the foundation of yet another story.

928
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:20,800
Really?

929
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,460
As they become the Okies and Sternobums of the galaxy.

930
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,260
Now how can you compare Okies and Sternobums?

931
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,780
They're two mutually exclusive schools of thought.

932
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:38,480
Well, they're the people who you don't necessarily welcome effusively into their community.

933
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,700
And this is the way the subgeniuses might find themselves.

934
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:51,040
There doesn't seem anything heroic to alien intelligences about weaseling out on your own planet and its problems.

935
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,080
But when you consider the alternative, make mine weaseling.

936
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,200
That's correct. Well spoken.

937
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,720
Just think of the way, you know, we have to keep all the migrants out with a huge wall.

938
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,940
And you think of the other ones having to have a huge wall.

939
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,920
And we all need to wear a huge wall.

940
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,540
And there's a huge wall in front of my eyes right now.

941
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,240
That wall is to keep us in.

942
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,080
It's not actually to keep anybody out.

943
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:20,680
It's not to keep the huns out.

944
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,840
It's to keep us in.

945
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,300
Yes, well, that wall, of course.

946
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,200
I'm afraid that I might be deported by Trump.

947
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,260
Why would he want to do that?

948
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:29,680
Oh yeah, he will be.

949
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,320
Well, I mean, he did a full 180 on the whole abortion question.

950
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,740
You know, he's right there with the most extreme people.

951
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,420
Saying that life begins at conception.

952
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,420
He hates all the illegal immigrants.

953
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,660
I mean, I have...

954
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:46,620
I think you're an engorged fetus that has to manage to make a birthday or two.

955
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,780
My birthplace may have been here in the United States.

956
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,520
And I have a birth certificate to show it.

957
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,420
Although, Trump doesn't believe anybody's birth certificate.

958
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,420
So, the fact of the matter is I was conceived in Mexico.

959
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,780
I was smuggled into this country illegally in my mother's fallopian tube.

960
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,060
So, that makes me an illegal immigrant.

961
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,740
Well, you'll have a sombrero.

962
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,380
Sombrero issued.

963
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,400
And then you can go lean picturesquely against the cactus.

964
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,340
In the new world to come.

965
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:18,360
You know, how does that leaning against a cactus work?

966
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,520
I don't know.

967
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,520
That's a demonstration of just how macho you are.

968
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,000
Yeah.

969
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
That's what it comes down to.

970
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,940
He is mas macho.

971
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:26,780
Yes.

972
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,800
And arrested.

973
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,100
Howie.

974
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,980
A few short later, a few short hours afterwards, arrested.

975
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,540
For being in the wrong.

976
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,780
Wrong spot at the wrong time.

977
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:44,660
Wearing a colorful serape and huaraches while eating tacos and albondigas.

978
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,200
Mangoes and rupture fruit.

979
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,680
Poison pig meat.

980
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,360
Argumentative weasel wipers.

981
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,620
I invented a new kind of taco yesterday.

982
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,640
And that is?

983
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,420
A nacho omelet taco.

984
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,440
I made an omelet that included various vegetables and jalapeno slices.

985
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,900
And what kind of tortilla shell did you use?

986
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,860
A soft corn tortilla, of course.

987
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,900
Oh, okay.

988
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,000
Chinango style.

989
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,540
Soft corn porn.

990
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,420
Sounds delightful.

991
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:17,840
Yes, it does.

992
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,620
You know, I was not stoned when I came up with the idea.

993
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,560
No.

994
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:27,800
You know, that's nice that you can share that with an audience that stretches across the vast oceans as far away as we can see.

995
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,520
And everybody in their mind just had a piece of that taco.

996
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,480
They're all heading for the larder now to make an imitation.

997
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,680
Their own version.

998
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,600
The recipe needs work, though.

999
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,740
I've got the scramble.

1000
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,040
There's no theremin music.

1001
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:40,380
Scramble?

1002
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,800
Can you buy scramble around here?

1003
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,520
Don't you have to go to Pennsylvania?

1004
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:42,660
Yeah, you sure can.

1005
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,220
I've got some at Dave's Supermarket.

1006
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,040
Oh, I get it.

1007
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:47,340
I get it.

1008
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,520
You can only buy it on the east side.

1009
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:49,720
Could be.

1010
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,680
Because the Midwest begins at the Cuyahoga River, apparently.

1011
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,740
So you have a market of your own, Dave?

1012
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,960
At the store, I saw that.

1013
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,500
I thought you could only get it in Pennsylvania, I thought.

1014
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:58,340
No, no.

1015
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,220
No, Pennsylvania.

1016
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,460
In east Cleveland, you can get everything good.

1017
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,740
All the good stuff.

1018
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,460
Pig knuckles.

1019
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,460
Booped out pinwheels.

1020
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:08,800
Yeah, yeah.

1021
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,080
There's some junk.

1022
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:10,440
Crack.

1023
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:11,980
Well, no.

1024
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:12,860
Pork on conclusions.

1025
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:13,860
Yeah.

1026
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,380
Dingleberries.

1027
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,080
Gallon-sized jugs of hot sauce.

1028
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:17,960
Mmm.

1029
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,760
A shiv in the gut.

1030
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:27,860
But yeah, I really do have two packages of scrapple ready to cook up on whenever we do the pancake party.

1031
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,060
I just had black pudding for the first time last week.

1032
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,520
That must be pretty good.

1033
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,800
That's made of blood, right?

1034
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,580
Unfortunately, it's good.

1035
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,700
It does include some blood.

1036
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,520
Yeah, that's what makes it plain.

1037
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,060
So blood is the life.

1038
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:36,620
That's what it is.

1039
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,640
You know what?

1040
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,440
It all came down to the seasoning.

1041
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,200
I don't know.

1042
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,180
Some kind of spices they put into it.

1043
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,120
Just, I don't know.

1044
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,380
Ja, das Blutwurst.

1045
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,360
Which kind of Blutwurst was it?

1046
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,680
Die Wurst, not das Wurst.

1047
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:51,740
English?

1048
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,800
The blackness is of the richness.

1049
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,940
I'd have probably the only thing in there.

1050
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:02,460
But yeah, it has various scraps of pork fat and pork blood and oatmeal.

1051
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,420
My neighbor is Finnish and he loves blood sausage.

1052
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:12,880
Yes, well you see, man, my children, is made in the image of God.

1053
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,100
And God likes blood.

1054
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:19,400
And so we too enjoy consuming it in small quantities in our food.

1055
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,980
But as you know, Jehovah demands a blood sacrifice and the more blood the better.

1056
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:32,280
You know how at a seance when you're raising a ghost you put out a bowl of blood and then you see the blood?

1057
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:37,160
Moving down slowly in the bowl as it is consumed by the thirsty spirits?

1058
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,520
Well that's just a miniature of what God wants.

1059
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,320
Who wants a giant amount of blood.

1060
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,940
You know, I mean, seriously, they call God the good shepherd.

1061
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,340
Like, I fear not because the Lord is my shepherd.

1062
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,960
Well what does a shepherd end up doing to his sheep?

1063
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,520
He'll steal the clothes off your back and he'll end up selling you to a butcher.

1064
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,040
Right.

1065
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:00,740
Well we call him good just the way the Irish call the little people good.

1066
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,260
Because they might be listening.

1067
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,400
It's, oh, they're really good.

1068
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,280
They're good little folk.

1069
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,220
Yes, they're so good.

1070
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,580
Uh, they're good.

1071
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:16,060
They're as good as those temple priests that would rip out hearts and teach Cheatlin'

1072
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,840
Green jacket, red cap and white owl's feather.

1073
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:23,600
They stole little Bridget these seven years long.

1074
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:27,680
When she came down again her friends were all gone.

1075
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,160
They took her lightly back between the night and morrow.

1076
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:35,700
They thought that she was fast asleep but she was dead with sorrow.

1077
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:43,880
They have kept her ever since deep within the lakes with frogs as their watchdogs all night awake.

1078
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,520
Wow.

1079
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,520
I feel like I was here in the Celtic nation hearing an elderly person saying that somewhere.

1080
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,520
Ever seen the Leprechaun horror movie series?

1081
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:00,080
First he comes from Ireland and he leaps through the air and bites your face off.

1082
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,360
Who knew that Leprechauns were into that?

1083
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,760
Then you get the Leprechaun in the hood and he raps, you know.

1084
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,900
And if that's not as bad as it could be, the next one he's in space.

1085
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,720
He's bothering astronauts.

1086
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:13,960
When was it in?

1087
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:14,920
Leprechaun rappers in space?

1088
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:22,340
Well, a little greenie fellow played by Warwick Davis in the absurd 19th century Leprechaun suit.

1089
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,060
It's, hey, you should run that in the Grindhouse series.

1090
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:25,360
Which one?

1091
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,380
The Leprechaun series.

1092
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:28,360
I've never seen any of those.

1093
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,960
You know, the first Leprechaun movie.

1094
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,900
Called Leprechaun.

1095
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,700
Introduced Jennifer Aniston to the world.

1096
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,080
It was her first role.

1097
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:40,700
She, a miniskirted ingenue, can be seen.

1098
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:48,760
The script calls for her to lust after some forgettable lummox while the Leprechaun antics are going on.

1099
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,740
And the Leprechaun turns out to be the actual love interest of Jennifer Aniston?

1100
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,020
No, the Leprechaun is an improbable monster.

1101
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,220
You know, the Leprechaun motivation, I never thought.

1102
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:04,940
I mean, none of Darby O'Gill's buddies would leap through the air with a boing sound and bite off your face.

1103
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:11,540
But in modern movies, you have to have different goals, different parameters, different expectations.

1104
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:16,360
So should we all offer up a rap, perhaps a Leprechaun space rap?

1105
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,300
Like, we're going past Venus, boing past Mars.

1106
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:22,460
No, you know, why give them any publicity?

1107
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,680
It's that Leprechaun franchise.

1108
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:28,700
It enabled a sawed-off actor to work, okay?

1109
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:36,440
After he was the hero of the George Lucas movie, the one with the two-headed turkey dragon.

1110
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:37,560
Willard?

1111
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,540
Willow, yes. Willow, not Willard.

1112
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,560
Willard, right.

1113
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,760
You're talking about Warwick Davis?

1114
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,420
Warwick Davis, yes. He later played the lead role in the Leprechaun series.

1115
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,120
Speaking of short things, time is short right now.

1116
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:56,060
We have reached the 11 o'clock hour, so portions of the following broadcast will be objectionable to some members of the audience.

1117
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,940
Therefore, WCSB advises listener discretion.

1118
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:05,140
The views and opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of WCSB or Cleveland State University or anyone affiliated with either one of those fine institutions.

1119
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,220
You're listening to a special edition of Synesthesia here.

1120
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:13,560
I'm Dr. Sinister. We have our special guest, Dr. Hal, Princess Weardot, and Reverend Ivan Stang.

1121
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,520
We're going to pause here real quick.

1122
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,520
And LonesomeCowboyDave on the phone, thank you for speaking up here.

1123
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:23,720
I'm sorry, I'm just looking around and I couldn't see you, man. I was hoping to see you today.

1124
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,260
Out of sight, out of mind.

1125
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,840
Out of mind is right.

1126
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,320
I think we're all a little bit out of our minds here.

1127
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,460
Dave, if you wouldn't mind holding for just a moment here, I think we need to pause real quick.

1128
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,620
Would it be better if I called back in two minutes?

1129
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,080
If that works for you, you could do that as well.

1130
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:42,440
Oh, okay. I will call back in three minutes because I know how things usually really go.

1131
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,500
All right. We'll talk to you soon, Dave.

1132
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,760
Thank you.

1133
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,500
You're welcome.

1134
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,380
Bye-bye.

1135
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:35,860
Bye-bye.

1136
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:36,280
Thank you.

1137
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:36,300
Bye-bye.

1138
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:36,940
Bye-bye.

1139
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,060
Bye-bye.

1140
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,100
Bye-bye.

1141
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,920
Bye-bye.

1142
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,400
Bye-bye.

1143
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:54,520
Bye-bye.

1144
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,420
Bye-bye.

1145
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,520
Bye-bye.

1146
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,440
Bye-bye.

1147
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,120
Bye-bye.

1148
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,500
Bye-bye.

1149
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,580
Bye-bye.

1150
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,620
Bye-bye.

1151
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:35,860
