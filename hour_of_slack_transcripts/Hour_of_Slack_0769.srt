1
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,600
You hear that?

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,660
Well, it's a high-frequency test sound.

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,200
We often use them in our business.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,720
It's nothing to worry about.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,120
I've got to go to the government.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,060
Get some rest.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,820
It's very important to get vital rest

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,060
and to recharge with dreams.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,100
Wonderful, wonderful dreams.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:27,960
Get some rest.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,880
The purpose of rest and sleep is to dream,

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,200
to refresh the psyche

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,940
with new scenes and images

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,260
which makes sense of your personal inner life.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,100
We'd like you to lie down in the provided bed of sponge.

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,620
There you will be massaged by a thousand tiny quivering fingers

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,360
telling you to let go.

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,220
There we go.

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,520
Now the zombies caress you.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,220
As you fall asleep on the layer of sugar.

21
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,220
Sizzling zombies.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,960
Overhead, weird caterpillars void frass.

23
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,700
They got my father.

24
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,180
Yes, they come for your family.

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,340
They first came for my cat and dog,

26
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,640
but I did not care because I was not a cat or dog.

27
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,160
Then they came for my grandpa,

28
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,320
but I did not care because I was not a grandpa.

29
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,320
Then they came for...

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,740
my local subgenius pastor,

31
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,800
but since I was not a subgenius...

32
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,920
That's a free way to be, man.

33
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,980
And then when they came for me,

34
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,840
there was no one to care.

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,960
I'm going for it.

36
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,880
But I cared a lot.

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,680
And now,

38
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,640
the subgenius hour of

39
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,440
SWAC!

40
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:50,900
SWAC!

41
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,660
SWAC!

42
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:58,880
SWAC!

43
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:04,880
SWAC!

44
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,200
SWAC!

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,200


46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,200


47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,220
SWAC!

48
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,220


49
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,240
SWAC!

50
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,240


51
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,240


52
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,240


53
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,240


54
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,240


55
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,240


56
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,240


57
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,260
SWAC!

58
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,260


59
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,260


60
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,260


61
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,260


62
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,260


63
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,260


64
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,260


65
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,260


66
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,260


67
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,260


68
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:10,840
Dr. Dobbs is known worldwide as a foremost spokesman for Christian and family values.

69
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,280
So plan to attend this rare personal appearance of Dr. Dobbs.

70
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,920
Even if you never intend to write your name again,

71
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,440
one sure way to impress folks is to stay a little bit over their heads

72
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,300
because it was better than looking stupid.

73
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,640
This fear of looking stupid...

74
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,980
less than brilliant is a major communication simple familiar incidents if we put these three

75
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,280
elements under the microscope we can't help but sharpen the focus on our communication effort

76
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,660
it's natural that we follow the circle around and around and around helping to create a nice

77
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:49,240
round world of confusion and misunderstanding resist the temptation to feed your ego have you

78
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:59,920
seen our shuttle you'll find it on the bureau so many demands everyone grabbing for a part of me

79
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,200
and now these new voices encouraging me to spend time developing my own talents

80
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,020
how can i possibly please them all

81
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:19,140
slack is dollar bills slack is drugs slack is a warm home slack is the car you drive

82
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,880
slack is the job you do for money slack is that which the conspiracy stole from you

83
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,840
they don't love you bob they don't love you bob they don't love you like i do

84
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,320

87
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,220
i love it when i get really bored

88
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,960
i like to drive around and see how many squash thaws i can count on the freeways

89
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,620
poor pete one man and two women want him what a predicament for a man to be in

90
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:07,300
we are friendly our aims are peaceful and we seek to establish cooperation and eternal friendship

91
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:14,900
between our two worlds our actions are controlled by electronic computers not by human emotions

92
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,680
this is unbelievable

93
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,820
no it's not

94
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,560
it's aliens and they're everywhere and that guy's obviously been zapped

95
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,980

96
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,460

97
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,640
yeah it's just as i suspected those mosquitoes are making these radio acts

98
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,100
so

99
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,140
ellen gonzalez he is the media dog

100
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,100
it's a very Prepare tolica

101
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:03,480
it's a lot more ridiculous

102
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,480


103
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,480


104
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,700
it's a vaz

105
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:05,700


106
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,220
people

107
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,640
if you собственно

108
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:14,640


109
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:14,640


110
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:14,640


111
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:14,640


112
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,220
they are

113
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,120
a lot

114
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,100
to get this amara

115
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,620
Cutting me off on the freeway because he can't drive

116
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,040
He should not be alive

117
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,280
Here comes George Jr.

118
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,740
Constructing sentences is badly while he smirks and grins

119
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,620
Will he get in?

120
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,980
All the stupid people

121
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,540
Where do they all come from?

122
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,160
All the stupid people

123
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,540
Where do they all belong?

124
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,340
I look at all the stupid people

125
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:01,460
I look at all the stupid people

126
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,660
Monica Lewinsky

127
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,940
Down on her knees in an office that's oval in shape

128
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,720
They have her on tape

129
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,420
Limbaugh and Laura

130
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,860
Turning it into a radio moral crusade

131
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,720
They need to get laid

132
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,280
All the stupid people

133
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,100
Where do they all come from?

134
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,520
All the stupid people

135
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,960
Where do they all belong?

136
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,580
All the stupid people, friends

137
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,780
All the stupid, stupid people

138
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,840
From Phineas and Ferb

139
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,700
And all the stupid, stupid, stupid people

140
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:49,700


141
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:49,700


142
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:49,700

cuss-filled show tonight.

155
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,480
A cuss-filled show because

156
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,380
Susie the Floozy is here.

157
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,460

Friends, we've got the brag of the subgenius

00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,320
as a rock song

164
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,040
created by Archbishop

Wilf. And you won't believe it when you hear

167
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,400
we've got the new truth

168
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,160
about Dobstown by

And now, and now, let us go.

184
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,260
Back in time to 1983.

185
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,800
The Denseteria

186
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,140
in New York City.

187
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,340
In an order like this, we may have guidelines

188
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,220
but you must remember not to

189
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,340
be literal minded. No subgenius

190
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,120
follows any two rules exactly.

191
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,100
You must also remember that anything any

192
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,420
subgenius says at any time

193
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,160
is sacred dogma

194
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,780
automatically. And now,

195
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,800
the rules of the Church of the

196
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,080
Subgenius. The first rule of the Church

197
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,600
of the Subgenius is, the subgenius

198
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,260
must have

199
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,220
What must he have?

200
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,780
What must he have?

201
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,280
What must the subgenius have?

202
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,300
Dog, what must he have?

203
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,080
He must have slack.

204
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,940
Help me out here.

205
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,340
The second rule of the Church of the Subgenius

206
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,060
is, too much is

207
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,160
always better than not enough.

208
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,160
Can I get a too much?

209
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,500
Too much! Can I get another too much?

210
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,140
Too much! Can I get another too much?

211
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,560
Too much! Too much!

212
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,120
Too many of those children. It's always better

213
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,140
than not enough.

214
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,720
The third rule of the Church of the Subgenius is,

215
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,140
a rule violated every day, every way you go.

216
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,080
People say to me, who is a conspiracy?

217
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,640
Look and see who violates this rule

218
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,920
and you will know them by their actions.

219
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,000
The third rule of the Church of the Subgenius is,

220
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,640
if you don't have a sense of humor,

221
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,720
don't try to be funny.

222
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,020
Don't try to be funny!

223
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,060
The fourth rule of the Church of the Subgenius,

224
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,940
thank you, Buck,

225
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,120
and the most important rule of the Church of the Subgenius,

226
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,500
and the supersedes all other rules is,

227
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,060
fuck them! If they can't

228
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,560
take a joke, fuck them!

229
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,000
Woo!

230
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,900
Huh! Huh!

231
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,120
You must draw

232
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,540
your own conclusions.

233
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,920
My every hour is a lie.

234
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:16,500
My every hour is a lie.

235
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,460
I say, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

236
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,460
I say, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

237
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:23,460


238
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,840
They're eating from life, I say!

239
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,740
I am the last remaining

240
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,180
I am the last remaining

241
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,660
of all characters.

242
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,840
I am the goddamn man of the future.

243
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll drive a mile so as not to walk on foot.

244
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,920
I am a human being

245
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,220
I am a human being of the first goddamn water.

246
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,180
I am too intense to lie

247
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,700
I am too intense to lie

248
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,660
for I speak only the fucking truth!

249
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,120
I'm here to defend the land of the free!

250
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,060

I cook and eat my dead

291
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,620
I swam up into the triangle

292
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,980
and didn't get wet

293
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,340
I kidnap the future

294
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,520
I'm ransomed into the past

295
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,300
I wait time, wait up for me

296
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,060

297
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,640

Come and get me

310
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,360

311
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,840
I wouldn't go to church

312
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,940
and he shook my head

313
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,840
I have my own personal saviors

314
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,380
I change them every hour

315
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,200
I don't give a fuck

00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,540

317
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,640

328
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,620

I hate those colors

343
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,060
I used to hang around an airport

344
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,800
and I used to sell books and I'd stand on the street corner with flowers and I would

345
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:14,580
do anything that my religion asked me to do but now I've got more sense now I've got Bob Dobbs

It is the stuff that dreams are made of

366
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,320
It's what makes Tinker Bell and the Lost Boys fly

367
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,880
It's what makes Tinker Bell and the Lost Boys fly

368
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,800

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:00,840
It powers the Starship Enterprise

370
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,940
It's the hidden code in Windows and Mac OS though not yet available in Linux

Dobbs Town

378
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,000
It is your brain

379
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,320
It is your brain on drugs

380
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,680
It's learning to work as a team and as a slave

381
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:42,300
It's where there is a lake in which resides the sword excalibur kept by the lady of the lake Connie Dobbs

382
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:49,760
And if you think it's hard to pull that stone from out of that sword out of that lake it's easy to pull a fig from a donkey's anus

383
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,740
Dobbs Town

384
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,960
It is where all the flowers have gone

385
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,440
It is the home of John Dillinger's real penis

386
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,880
It is the home of John Dillinger's real penis

387
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,060
Dobbs Town

388
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:07,160
It is a mystery wrapped in an enigma smothered with sautéed mushrooms and onions in a savory gravy

389
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,940
Dobbs Town

390
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,380
It is John Dillinger's penis

391
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:16,540
The savage and in muscular gravy surrounded by mushroom people

392
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,820
Dobbs Town

393
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,560
The home of both Lemurians and Cenobites

394
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,740
My proper home

395
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,880
I'm going back someday

396
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,840
I've got to get back to my home

397
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,240
Dobbs Town

398
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,920
It's near the coast of Honalee and the land of Fredonia

399
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,940
Dobbs Town

400
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:51,080
It's the world's largest producer of manna, ambrosia, froth and the green stuff that Dave injects into the brain to reanimate dead tissue

401
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,340
Spiritual bliss with open-loam bowling every night from midnight to dawn

402
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,820
Dobbs Town

403
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:58,820


404
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,020
It's the residence of J.R. Bob Dobbs part of the year

405
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,320
It's creamy and crunchy

406
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,340
It tastes great and it's less filling

407
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,420
It is margarine and it is butter

408
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:16,600
But if it were to fall into enemy hands it would mean the destruction of us all

409
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,720
Ah yes, Stang, but it is the downfall of us all

410
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,340
And it tastes bad on bread because man, those that go don't come back

411
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,440
They're losers, losers

412
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,940
No man, those who graduate from Dobbs Town come back changed

413
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,820
In a new form

414
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,240
You can't see them like you can see others

415
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,900
Graduated like a chrysalis to the elf

416
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,700
All the way up to a higher being

417
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,720
They growl and growl

418
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:55,660
Their tiny skins hardly large enough to pop them as they begin expanding into that new form

419
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,940
Dobbs Town

420
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,840
It's where UFOs are not just a fact of life, they're the law

421
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,980
Of course it's a law here, of course it's a law

422
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,280
Everyone needs to live by laws, by rules

423
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,820
We need to have our lives governed by

424
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,480
Dobbs Town

425
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,120
It's where the bad little girls and boys go

426
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,640
Oh, Dobbs Town

427
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,900
It's where something is happening all the time

428
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,300
And most of it unsolved

429
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,140
Some of it is so hard to locate

430
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:41,520
Many of the people from the Saucer Ship emblem itself have been sucked out and left here

431
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,780
Dobbs Town

432
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,140
I didn't want them to be oblique

433
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:53,500
When I strapped them down in the chair and started asking them questions about Dobbs Town

434
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,540
I, I, I gave them...

435
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,060
I gave them a new location, but the...

436
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,940
The website

437
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,180
Dobbs Town

438
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,080
It's Nwatsbod spelled backwards

439
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,160
It's Brigadoon without the haggis

440
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,260
It is surrounded by the seven cities of Cibola

441
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,640
Which are its slums

442
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,280
And it has a ferry to Monster Island

443
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,400
And what a delightful pair of individuals you'll never find there

444
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,240
The ferries of Monster Island

445
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,860
Tiny little happy people who do things for other people

446
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,820
Who live for other people

447
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,480
So big are their hearts and so tiny is their stature

448
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,660
They...

449
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,140
Dobbs Town!

450
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,900
That's where Amelia Earhart crashed, friends

451
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:47,160
It's where the Tunguska meteorite came out after bouncing around inside the Earth for a while

452
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,960
Yes, if you're waiting for another salubrious comet

453
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,980
Can you just illuminate that stupid passage?

454
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,720
Just read it again, Stan, just see what you just said

455
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,740
What, the Dobbs Town is where the Tunguska meteorite came out?

456
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,700
After bouncing around inside the planet for a while

457
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:11,200
The Tunguska meteorite was, of course, as you know from reading your book of the subgenius, Dave

458
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,260
Was a miniature black hole

459
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,100
Shot by Dobbs, the young ten-year-old J.R. Bob Dobbs from his slingshot

460
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,640
Completely by accident...

461
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,080
Out of rage?

462
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,200
No, he didn't even know he was doing it

463
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,080
It was just, you know, I mean, he picked up a...

464
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,080
Other kids might pick up a pebble or a cat skull for their slingshot

465
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,760
Yeah, a cat skull, that makes a lot more sense

466
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,760
What would Bob pick up? A tiny black hole, a singularity

467
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,640
A singularity...

468
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:43,400
Glowing essence of nothingness, sucking in all that is not Bob

469
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,900
And that is what he shot into the Tunguska plains of Siberia

470
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,640
And then, past the event horizon

471
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,820
The little thing itself went and then became like a bigger thing

472
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,320
And it went into the earth, Bob's tiny black hole did

473
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,460
And it bounced around like a cue ball on a pool table

474
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,700
Back and forth until finally it exited at the place we now know as

475
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,400
Dogstown!

476
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,840
Dogstown, friends!

477
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,200
It is where a thing of beauty is a joy for a while

478
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,080
It's where you are better than you were in high school

479
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,620
It's where you get all the love you want

480
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,260
It's where you get all the pets you ever wanted

481
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,440
It was never a colony of France

482
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,100
It is where science and magic are the same things

483
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,300
It is the unfolding of miscalculations

484
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,940
It is the dawning of the height, weight, hair and eye color of Aquarius

485
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,060
It is the fizzling, crackling, hip newt

486
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:50,220
It is the dissonant fifth vortex disrupting the harmonic convergence

487
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,640
It is where the early worm gets away

488
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,560
It is where the grave diggers leave their shoes in the middle of the night

489
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,240
Dogstown!

490
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,420
It is for when you are too lazy to kill yourself

491
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:05,780
Dogstown!

492
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,220
Where there are no lawyers

493
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,900
And where the government never tries to be helpful

494
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Dogstown, friends!

495
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,320
It is where you can make your imaginary friends fight to the death

496
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,780
Dogstown!

497
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,900
It's between the dark and daylight

498
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,500
When the night is beginning to lower

499
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,340
It is where neither heredity nor environment matter

500
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:38,520
It is where the lamb and the lion lay down and have sex together, friends

501
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,940
Dogstown!

502
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,680
You can only follow and listen

503
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,380
It is proof that hell is full

504
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,620
And the dead walk the earth

505
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,780
The fabric is worth cleaning

506
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,220
Like yourself

507
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,580
One thread can back me to thousands of other threads

508
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:10,360
That is our caustic solution for you as members of this solemn group gathered together

509
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,380
Squandered and quashed and pushed under heavy stones

510
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,160
So that you may not know the truth that we speak

511
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,460
And yet here we are speaking it to you

512
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,140
Dogstown is not a place where a man or woman dwells

513
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,400
But a place in the heart

514
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,560
As big as that mighty elephant yoke

515
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,600
And twice as tasty as all the trees that you could imagine

516
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,700
Now imagination is not a place you want to stay

517
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,340
It's not a place you want to bring home

518
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,700
Bring the kids, grandma, ride the ferris wheel with

519
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,440
It's not the kind of place you want to leave for a better home

520
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,440
It's a place you visit over and over again

521
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,560
With your pants on, your pants off

522
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,940
And your heart ripped right out hanging from your chest

523
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,020
Dogstown

524
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,640
Where Bob comes home

525
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,760
After an easy day's work

526
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,860
And where you can come home too, friends

527
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,120
Where you'll be home

528
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,920
Where you'll finally realize why

529
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,280
Why

530
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,800
Why

531
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,100
And why you can find out more about beautiful Dogstown

532
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,040
When you join the Church of the Subgenius

533
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:36,260
The world's only first, true, last, final, one, true religion

534
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,240
Because it admits it is true

535
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,120
It is the only one that's not full of crap

536
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,220
It is the only one that's not full of crap

537
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,460
And I can try to find the age

538
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,080
I know it's coming each time

539
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,960
I can tell it, you tell it

540
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,940
It's where Ennio Morricone was delivered

541
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,480
Of his inspiration for this music in the background

542
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,600
Huge, huge mandibles

543
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,060
Large, large, fresh, gammy legs

544
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,220
And now the matador Dobbs steps in

545
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:10,220


546
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:10,220


547
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,240
And he whips out before the enraged Triceratops dinosaur

548
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,560
Flashing his red Dobbs-headed cape

549
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,620
In front of the maddened beast

550
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,160
The furious creature stomps its feet and paws at the ground

551
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,840
Dobbs grins, he smokes, the creature charges

552
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,540
Dobbs whips out his pipe

553
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,880
And gives it a little conk on the noggin as it runs by

554
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,520
And after that

555
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,780
It sits and pants like a little puppy dog

556
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,860
And the monster is dead

557
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,660
And the monster is dead

558
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,180
And the monster is dead

559
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,500
And the monster is dead

560
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,760
Another type of false compensation

561
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,220
Or over-assertiveness

562
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,360
Is exemplified in the one who always comes late to every gathering

563
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,640
In order for everyone to notice him when he arrives

564
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,900
And who leaves early so that people will notice when he leaves

565
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,840
Or who is constantly name-dropping

566
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,100
After he said that, then he said, arise

567
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,320
Take up your bed

568
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,520
And go your way to your house

569
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,920
Take up your bed and walk

570
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,620
Then he stretched out on the floor

571
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,460
Remember to take your matador first

572
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,980
Matador first

573
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,300
Well, sometimes when I'm with a guy

574
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,280
I wish they'd tie me up with red licorice ropes

575
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,100
And then spank me

576
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,900
And then he'd eat the ropes

577
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,080
And then he'd eat the ropes

578
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,080


579
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,380
And then he'd free me

580
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,180
And then we'd make love with a philharmonic played bolero

581
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,720
I have a lot of fantasies about being tied up and spanked

582
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,100
Okay, let's see

583
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,480
So she's gonna make love to me, that's good

584
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,180
But she's gonna kill me and eat me

585
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,660
That's bad

586
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,160
I've never seen such nervous chickens

587
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,740
Well, either that or the animal that attacked him was a chicken

588
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,340
It's all done with a little scientific magic

589
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:16,060
You see, each little blueberry is coated with a thin layer of goat embryonic fluid

590
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,420
I'll get you, get the Senator some water

591
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,840
You've been watching too many of them Italian zombie flicks

592
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,600
As do I you

593
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,400
They're idle

594
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,340
They're lazy

595
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,540
They need to work

596
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,340
You're a very, very sick man

597
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,360
Boy, you ever seen a bloke with a foot up his nose?

598
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,540
Woomera, woomera

599
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,840
Babalook, boomerang, crocodile, kookaburra, wombat, orangutan

600
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,820
Wee-ho, way-ho, taramunga mine

601
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,720
Kwondong, billabong, gandablui, pine

602
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,780
Platypus, emu, wallaby, roo

603
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,460
Ivus, bulgar, white cockatoo

604
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,320
Marabara, caracola, mine, fangirl

605
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,000
Bogobrine, pyromine, never-crying yanker

606
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,300
Hoopra, hoopra, ha, ha, ha

607
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,880
Yanker, white cockatoo, ya, ya

608
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:07,880
Yaaaaa!

609
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,020
Oh sure, he came back from the dead, he raped her, then bit her to death, is that what he did?

610
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,720
Oh yeah, now I remember

611
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,840
You threw up on me

612
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,280
How sweet

613
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,660
You're supposed to be setting a good example, now will you get back to your coffin immediately

614
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,160
Being a dick is a 24 hour a day job

615
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,060
If my head wasn't hurting so much I'd have sworn I was in heaven

616
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,460
Heaven for guys who like big tits

617
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:45,860
Speaking of which, dear friends, Reverend Susie the Floozy was in the Tampa Divival thanks to the queers for Bob

618
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,680
And here's...

619
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,580
She is for Bob

620
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,640
Oh, that's what brings me to my subject tonight, Seekers

621
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,120
What there is to love about this church

622
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,300
What is it, Pat and Max?

623
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,500
Absolutely fucking nothing, I hate those fucking church stuff!

624
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,880
Oh, what a goddamn thing

625
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,800
From my perspective, on my knees in the trenches out there

626
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,080
Trying to bring some fucking slack to my slack-star block

627
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,860
The things I take on in myself

628
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:30,080
In the performance of this ministry, dear, dear, dear Seekers

629
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,140
Jesus Christ, it sucks

630
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,620
I mean, I've been out there for years

631
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,580
On my knees in the trenches

632
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:46,040
Oh, trying to bring you to the bounteous teeth of dogs

633
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,740
Oh, but when I get around to getting my share

634
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,140
That ain't a teeth

635
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,840
But you know I gotta suck anyway like a leaf blower in rivers

636
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Or I'm gonna lose my fucking job

637
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,720
Oh yeah, the wonders of this damn church

638
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,940
You know, doing a good job as a Christian

639
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,780
Is a lot like pissing your pants in a dark suit

640
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:19,280
It gives you a warm feeling and nobody notices

641
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,180
But, doing a job as a subgenius

642
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:30,500
Is like taking a shit in your own pants

643
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,900
Except, you ain't wearing pants

644
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,780
And honey, that ain't your shit

645
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,420
Oh, peed as it may

646
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,140
And I assure you, Seekers, it does pee

647
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:53,520
Oh, the sad fact is that it falls to someone to be the Judas guard

648
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:59,460
Who's going to lead you into the warm embrace

649
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:05,180
To take you away from this tag-team blusterfucked-in-nowheresville

650
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,440
That the conspiracy dares to call alive

651
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,500
Someone has to bitch-slap you butt-whites on all five of your cheeks

652
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,720
When Bob's Hallelujah Train comes a-humpin' in

653
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,540
To that station of opportunity's sake

654
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,100
Somebody's gotta be playing in that bell

655
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,900
Because the express train to Dobstown

656
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,380
Don't always run

657
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,640
On time, kids

658
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,140
And I'm down there trying to get your asses on board

659
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,580
Somebody's gotta be there to shove your bobby asses

660
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,940
On that train, yeah

661
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,580
Like one of those Tokyo subway packers

662
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,860
Like a Taipei green bay packer

663
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,320
Like a psychotic fudge packer

664
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,860
Urging you on into those recto-cranial convulsions that say

665
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,140
Wee!

666
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,220
Oh, thank you, Bob

667
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,140
And that's exactly what he said back

668
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:17,940
Because it's gonna take something to force-pump all that energy into your lobes

669
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:23,720
To clean out the insidious mind-controlling allergens that they've put in there

670
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,380
Oh, yes

671
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,580
Oh, she said buying time

672
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:34,300
Oh, it's sort of like getting an undercoating

673
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,640
But not quite as much of a rip-off

674
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,540
And, but, Seekers, you need protection

675
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,160
Because you're out there every day

676
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,200
Running a terrible risk of infection

677
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,000
Dealing with that normal human element

678
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,680
Oh, and you're out there

679
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,960
And you've gotta shoot the conspiracy's log flume rod

680
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,360
But maybe watch out for those blogs

681
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,140
Because it's like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride in a septic tank out there

682
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,680
Now, you may not believe me

683
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,340
You know, I've been maybe getting on in years

684
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,900
I am more than all of you fuckers put together

685
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:20,780
But I assure you that I still have all of my teeth

686
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:22,980
Oh!

687
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,540
And both ends are smiling as I promised you

688
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:33,800
But Bob is gonna tear those shit holes a new navel to contemplate

689
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:39,220
Yes, because yes, there's beauty in the world if you know where to look

690
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:44,400
And if you know where to look, you can avoid that shit entirely

691
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,400
Sure, it's an ugly job

692
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,220
But I'm up to ugly

693
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,100
Yes!

694
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:55,740
Yes, and I may be stupid for leaving in some

695
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:00,960
Glad-handed, grinning, half-toned, bunco artist

696
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,880
Who left all of our asses in the lurch on that day

697
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,500
Yes!

698
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,340
Fucker!

699
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:05,540
Yes!

700
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,140
I may be a total moron

701
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,840
We're still looking to the stars

702
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,640
And hope in my five-chambered little heart

703
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,580
That something's coming to get us up on Oliver

704
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,040
Yes!

705
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,100


706
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,600
I may be a shit-nosed turd-goblin retard

707
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:34,420
For not waking up to smell that freshly-pinched loaf of dobson he lays on my upper lip every morning

708
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,340
Every day!

709
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:35,960
Woo!

710
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:44,340
Sure, I may be a pathetic, brain-damaged, drooling, pissing, moaning, sublet-tail wacky

711
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,800
Any of it

712
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,560
For not throwing in my lot with some better-connected titty

713
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,320
Oh, but Seekers, being a sub-dub genius

714
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,760
It's a higher calling

715
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,400
And as long as Bob keeps getting me high

716
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,220
Who the fuck do you think I'm gonna call?

717
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,840
Because sure, he's a lying son of a bitch

718
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,540
But he's our lying son of a bitch

719
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,720
Sure, he's got one hand in your wallet pocket

720
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,140
And the other one up your toe into the eighth knuckle

721
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,600
But some dead playwright guy

722
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:41,160
Eugene O'Neill wrote Frosty's Orgasm or Iceman Cummins

723
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,960
Something like that

724
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,080
This dead fucker, anyhow, whoever the hell he was

725
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,540
He said something that had the Colonel's name on it

726
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,300
And there's a whole great truth inside of it

727
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,600
Seekers, the lie of a pipe dream

728
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:02,040
Is what gives life to the whole misbegotten mad lot of us

729
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,940
Drowned or sober

730
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,440
And as long as Bob's pouring those fucking drinks

731
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,180
I'm gonna belly up to his bar

732
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,780
Praise Bob!

733
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,500
Kill her

734
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,320
Obviously you won't

735
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,180
I wanna kill you, Connie

736
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,360
You're responsible for the pain of these four

737
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,240
I'm so tired, get your hands off me

738
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,420
How can we tell whether our friends are ready to walk the path of Dobbs?

739
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,960
Surely just not by the t-shirts they wear or the pipes in their mouths

740
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,200
You sins killed him!

741
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,760
You sins!

742
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,520
The devil!

743
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,780
The devil!

744
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,880
You killed him!

745
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
God's son is dead, the blood is red on your sins

746
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,820
You have vindicated yourself for murder

747
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,160
You are the Satan's child, smashing heads and ripping limbs from Christians

748
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,120
You died for you

749
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,740
How many more will die for you?

750
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,980
You killed Satan, the son of God

751
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,620
We did!

752
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,300
You sins killed him

753
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,520
Our sins killed him!

754
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,340
How long will he die for you?

755
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,100
He will always be dead for you!

756
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,420
Those were your original sins of death

757
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,080
The result is our sins and killing

758
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,300
For you sins the world will die

759
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,280
Yes, and flesh will burn

760
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,640
Babies will die

761
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,860
How many babies will die?

762
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,680
When sponsored by government, abortion is genocide

763
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,140
Yes, in China they killed babies like that

764
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,100
They will make nothing to save money and contraceptives

765
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,240
Nor will they keep the righteous children of God from being born

766
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,500
Imagine piles of gurgling bloody protein

767
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,480
Sin for abortion

768
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,800
Gargoyles have come up from hell and lay feces that will cause great plagues

769
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,420
Leprosy which we have seen in the Bible will permeate society

770
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,140
And limbs will fall from their bodies in great numbers

771
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,760
Appendages on the streets

772
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,320
People dead

773
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,220
No more children

774
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,540
Masses, newborn, choristers

775
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,760
Cries going onward

776
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,540
Cries in first Christians will fund those inflicted with the devil's plague

777
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,120
Uh, their sins killed you friends

778
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,740
Church of New Faith

779
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,140
Post office box

780
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,620
You got that pencil ready?

781
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,040
Church of New Faith, my God man!

782
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,000
P.O. Box 9152

783
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,040
Virginia Beach, Virginia 23450

784
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,920
Yes, Church of New Faith

785
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,080
We used to play them all the time on this show

786
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,900
And now they've got a CD out and it's all sounded better

787
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,860
That's uh, Virginia Beach, Virginia 23450

788
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,760
Uh, yes, yes

789
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,740
Confess and we won't hurt you anymore

790
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,680
We don't like doing this at all

791
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,420
No urinating on the wall

792
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,100
Any offenders will be prosecuted

793
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,900
Urinating is not allowed

794
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,760
Urinating is not permitted

795
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,860
I think one of you space guys or whatever it is you are

796
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,460
Could have dropped me a note or something

797
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,680
You know, just to let me know that I'm not crazy

798
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,900
You will speak when spoken to

799
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,680
I will deactivate your vocal mode

800
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,620
Well, that's, that's not what I wanted to say

801
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,260
I wanted to say something about

802
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,100
How freedom demands responsibility

803
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,240
And how like Tom Paine

804
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,300
In the days of old when there was

805
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,700
So much res-revolutionary fervor

806
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,520
Going on around the place

807
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,180
A lot of people were like throwing their shoes

808
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,740
In the harbor and stuff

809
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:25,000
And waving flags and dancing

810
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,000
But most of the people were just suffocating

811
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,840
Underneath those abstruse tunnels they created themselves

812
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,300
And the lobster

813
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,780
But now

814
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,300
We've got to fight not only tanks

815
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,840
We have to fight computers with our bare knees

816
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,120
We have to not only like

817
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,680
Get down on all fours and crawl across the ocean

818
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,560
But crawl under barbed wire

819
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,200
We've got to become wired ourself

820
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,340
So that we can stop

821
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:56,340
The next few acts of the play before

822
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,160
The demon goes down

823
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,840
Don't worry about it

824
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,500
Don't worry about the future my friend

825
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,700
There, there is no future

826
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,240
For you anyway

827
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,480
You will ride out

828
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,080
On the wave of occurrences

829
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,660
That have been set in motion

830
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,280
Years and years ago

831
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,000
Perhaps thousands of years ago

832
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,600
Have you ever seen the 35 degree bus

833
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,300
Can shake

834
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:26,900
Check it out baby

835
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:27,640
Yes

836
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,700
It's one of the few things you want to know

837
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,400
If you want to climb it's the circles

838
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,640
It's in your elite

839
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,940
Do you know what CFR means

840
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,260
It doesn't mean college in fluid replacement

841
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,080
No it's the council for foreign affairs

842
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,040
I mean

843
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,900
No

844
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,340
Do you know who the Bilderburgers are

845
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,120
No

846
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,580
They are not people who make huge sandwiches

847
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,980
On the west side

848
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,160
The Bilderburgers

849
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,840
Are a group of

850
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,680
Well to use the phrase used earlier

851
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,740
Mushroom men

852
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,840
People with dildo sized heads

853
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,460
Much bigger than the top

854
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,880
I'm afraid we're going to have to disclose the

855
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,660
Resettlement plans there Captain Yolk

856
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:23,860
And here we get to something very important

857
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,120
In the Church of the Subgenius

858
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,080
And that is

859
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,840
All of you that have been raised here

860
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,280
Whether you're Buddhist or Mohammed

861
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,100
Or Jewish or Christian

862
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,480
You've been taught that

863
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,700
Your leader

864
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,440
Your God

865
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,700
Your savior

866
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,580
Your Messiah

867
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,860
Is a man worth imulating

868
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,040
Bob

869
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,660
Bob is not a man to copy

870
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,500
And Bob says

871
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,560
I don't practice what I preach

872
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,360
Because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to

873
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,000
Bob also says

874
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,560
I'd rather be lucky than good any day

875
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,800
You see Bob

876
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,460
See children

877
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,560
One of the most important rules in the Bible

878
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,380
That the Church of the Subgenius is

879
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,420
That the Church lets you

880
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,640
Pull the wool over your own eyes

881
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,760
Now children

882
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,380
When you pull the wool over your own eyes

883
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,660
It's not like the Church is doing it

884
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:28,780
Why the great Churches want you to pull the wool over your own eyes

885
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,200
And keep it there

886
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,900
We want you to pull the wool over your own eyes

887
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,820
And relax in the safety of your own delusions

888
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,460
And after a while children

889
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,560
You're going to get saved

890
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,660
You're going to get sick of those delusions

891
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,260
And you're going to start thinking for yourself

892
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,760
Praise Bob!

893
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,160
Praise Bob!

894
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,520
That's what Bob wants to do

895
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:54,220
And I say as long as you're alive

896
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:59,000
Shout, make noise, all efforts

897
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,280
Because when you do

898
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,720
You shut up like hell

899
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,560


900
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,860
Kassu pullonkorki otta sakilsi

901
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,700
Otta sakilsi aluspajan

Helema mua tajo

903
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,680
Velsi lentävä poliukko

Väkijuoma pullon piniästä ostin

905

Piniästä ostin pullonkaulan

906

Heti huulille nostin lentävä poliukko

907

Tyrät ne rytköivät

908

Tanssiin käy tie

909
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,180
Rytkut vain rytköivät

910
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,580
Sit urme lukseen vie

Nämä sammune tyypin naapurin poliukko

Kortistosta eilen korvauksen nostin

915

Korvauksen nostin viinakaupassa

916

Näin naapurin kostin lentävä poliukko

917
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,360
Eka pakasta minä naikkosen iskin

918

Naikkosen iskin

919
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,580
Tarjos mulle vielä kalijan

a dumb shit.

961
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,180
They'll treat you unequal.

962
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,180
They will drown you in their mediocrity.

963
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,740
They will force you to kneel at their level.

964
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,200
But you will fight.

965
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,720
You will not be alone, but you will fight.

00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,140
The next rule of the church of the subgenius is

967
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,480
a rule that's only become necessary in the last 10 or 12 years.

968
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,680
Have movements have appeared.

969
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,020
Vast ships, clippers upon the horizon

970
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,680
to bring the rest of us to salvation.

971
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,120
Will ships attract mollusks and barnacles, as you well know?

972
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,900
And here in the church of the subgenius,

973
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,980
those mollusks and molecules take the form of hip wimps.

974
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,340
And the next rule of the church of the subgenius is

975
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,660
no hip wimps.

976
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,240
No what?

977
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,640
No hip wimps.

978
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:48,740
What?

979
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,140
No hip wimps.

980
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,060
No hip wimps, children.

981
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,100
No hip wimps.

982
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,040
Don't join this church looking to get cool off us.

983
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,760
Don't join this church looking to suck the scottabob

984
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,020
because he won't help.

985
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:04,460
Don't join this church looking to suck the scottabob

986
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:04,700
because he won't help.

987
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,240
Kill me.

988
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,180
There are people beyond redemption.

989
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,800
Yes, there are even people whose money will not let them into the church.

990
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,540
They might not have membership.

991
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,080
Yes, they might attend meetings.

992
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,320
They might even yell when the pope calls upon them,

993
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,460
but deep in their heart, they're hip wimps.

994
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,380
Hi kids, it's me, Casey Sausage Casey.

995
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:27,580
Remember the 1990s when clinical depression and self-mutilation were all the rage?

996
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,520
Well, now you can relive those self-deprecating golden years

997
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,360
with KTEL's new record offer entitled, I Suck.

998
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,100
That's KTEL.com.

999

1002
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,400
The letter I and the word suck.

00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,800
Silverchair's I'm a freak.

1008
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:45,920
I'm a freak.

1009
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,380
And I'm a complete and total frigging moron.

1010
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,560
Need some record, record, record.

1011
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,180
But think, think, think you could go back in time.

1012
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,760
I am and I am right now.

1013
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,080
I'm just wishing I hadn't come tonight because I...

1014
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,080
Because you did come back in time to get here?

1015
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,980
Well, yeah, because I'm, well, I'd have to be here already now

1016
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,300
or else this part wouldn't make sense.

1017
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:08,060
The rest of it, but I'm already full of oblique little passages of time

1018
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:08,860
that don't make no sense.

1019
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:09,720
How about yourself?

1020
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:20,200
Hi, if I could, if, if time control as, as prophesied by Dobbs were ours now,

1021
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,900
what would, what would one do with such a power?

1022
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,080
If you could go back in time, would you go back in time, for instance,

1023
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:31,980
and kill Hitler to prevent terror or, or...

1024
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:32,960
Or kill Hitler.

1025
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,020
Or kiss Hitler to prevent...

1026
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,120
Or kiss, right, to make him a...

1027
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,220
Because some people said, you know, Ava Brown was just like his front

1028
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,760
because he didn't have a girlfriend to hang out with,

1029
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,360
the Burkish guy, and he'd rather be hanging out with Goring or Himmler.

1030
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:44,340
Really?

1031
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:45,520
Yeah, they said...

1032
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,580
Oh, that, well, well, you know, he has a lot of enemies.

1033
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,100
You know, the old frustrated rage thing, you know, like he must be wanting to be with boys.

1034
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,740
You know how he used to kiss those Hitler youth, those young men on the cheek, you know,

1035
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,860
these 12-year-old boys?

1036
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,600
Well, so did I.

1037
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,080
So did I.

1038
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,780
I saw you do it too, David.

1039
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,180
I was forced to.

1040
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,360
I was forced to.

1041
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,560
I was a political dissident.

1042
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:08,240
And that was one of the jobs they made us do besides ripping the clothes off the stiffs.

1043
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,320
We'd up-gassed the stiffs, pull their clothes off, and then we'd have to go and kiss the

1044
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,040
Hitler youth boys.

1045
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,460
And believe me, that was not hell.

1046
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,940
But, you know, if you could go back...

1047
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,440
Well, would you go back in time?

1048
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,920
Could, would you dare to change history?

1049
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:26,880
Because say you did kill or kiss Hitler, maybe the world would be a much better place for

1050
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,160
lots of people, but perhaps Hitler was the madman who also killed the world.

1051
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,880
The one who would have been worse than Hitler.

1052
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,640
The one who would have won.

1053
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:40,140
What if Hitler, at some point in his career, was indirectly or directly responsible for

1054
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:43,740
killing someone else who might, in fact, have destroyed the entire world?

1055
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,120
How could you have had someone...

1056
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,580
But Hitler was going to go for it.

1057
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,060
Would you play God?

1058
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,980
If you could, if you could go back in time, would you play God?

1059
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:57,820
I would probably play God or I would play Henry VIII.

1060
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:58,800
Lieutenant.

1061
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,140
We're in a conflict.

1062
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:01,140


1063
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:01,180
We're in a conflict.

1064
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:01,680
Time, time, time.

1065
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,580
Transported back hundreds of years.

1066
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:07,940
Oh, what I saw that got that glass knight, his tongue was as long as this.

1067
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:08,900
Wait a minute.

1068
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:14,020
You mean this stuff reproduced itself inside the decontamination chamber, and then as we,

1069
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:18,740
as we stepped up the current, it just, it just grew?

1070
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,280
Precisely.

1071
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,300
A monster!

1072
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:26,460
A monster will set fire to the city and trample on the people who try to run away.

1073
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,520
Who are you?

1074
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,760
Commander for conquest of Earth.

1075
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,680
From the third planet of the black hole, I will now speak.

1076
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:33,960
You know what?

1077
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,920
If I fuck up, I will break you.

1078
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,400
Another terrible way the Earth might suddenly come to an end would be...

1079
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,020
Oh, yeah.

1080
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,000
Oops, okay, now.

1081
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,040
Category two, plastic soldiers.

1082
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,520
What is when you go away from your house and the plastic soldiers come alive?

1083
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,380
They lack discipline.

1084
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,240
They need to be forced to march in order.

1085
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,660
But, uh...

1086
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,800
Excited by the boom of the van.

1087
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,940
And the towel forces them with a big lighter and a...

1088
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,440
They, uh, scatter across the floor.

1089
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,880
And a little hot paperclip.

1090
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:11,140
And those little bayonets can hurt when they come out and they stab your barefoot when

1091
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:11,700
you're laying on your bed.

1092
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,200
At 3 a.m.

1093
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,120
Yes, that's right.

1094
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,520
As they're marching around or caught running down the hallway.

1095
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,680
They'll come up and attack your face on the bed while you're asleep.

1096
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,280
Oh, really?

1097
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:23,460
You know, they're very resourceful little beggars.

1098
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,960
Just like in the movies, folks.

1099
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,360
All science fiction movies have a moment of truth, especially in the movies.

1100
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:29,520
I mean, I've seen a lot of science fiction movies where they're like, oh, I'm going

1101
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:29,520


1102
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:29,520


1103
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:29,520


1104
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,600
to jump in and rob little toys that you've never the inside of.

1105
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:30,600


1106
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:30,600


1107
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:30,600


1108
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,700
Hmm, I missed.

1109
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,080
That one.

1110
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,400
That one about the little action figures and so forth.

1111
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,240
Yeah, that's pretty fun.

1112
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,140
Have you seen that one?

1113
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:37,540
They come alive.

1114
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,380
That's a good one, yeah.

1115
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:42,300
And, uh, well those scenes are pretty amazing where they come alive and are your worst

1116
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:42,700
nightmare.

1117
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:47,080
Little toy soldiers who just walk in the state of verse 10.

1118
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,660
Well, I haven't seen A So many films to see.

1119
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:59,100
But perhaps none of us have time anymore, because, uh, we might have to wait for it.

1120
00:52:59,200 --> 00:52:59,300
Would it be like before Metro?

1121
00:52:59,300 --> 00:52:59,500
We would be real happy watching.

1122
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,720
see that coming. Yeah.

1123
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,060
A long way away. Unless you're in the theater

1124
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,180
watching Toy Soldiers or something. Even a gamma

1125
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,020
ray post. Then you cannot

1126
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,060
see the last droid.

1127
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,480
And if you're in your car, you can't see it.

1128
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,140
But if the vacuum of space

1129
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:14,920
suddenly collapses,

1130
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,240
we would have no warning. And it would be

1131
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,260
over instantly. It's a 3D version of frogs, right?

1132
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,180
Yeah. And if you were

1133
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,400
in the bathroom, you wouldn't see the end of the droid.

1134
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,480
It's not such a strange idea.

1135
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,260
The vacuum of space itself

1136
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,360
would suddenly collapse. I heard there was a naked

1137
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,340
person in here.

1138
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,820
It might happen.

1139
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,240
Suddenly, the establishment

1140
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,480
is filled with police.

1141
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,280
The Third World War might begin

1142
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,940
any minute. We'll all be killed.

1143
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,080
Why should we bother about giant turtles?

1144
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,900
Yes, maybe you're right.

1145
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,220
I know how much you love your turtles.

1146
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,500
But there are other things in life just as

1147
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,420
important, like having fun friends.

1148
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,140
Our ancient legend

1149
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,620
did mention fire-eating turtles.

1150
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,360
Remember, the next time

1151
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,460
if you are naughty again,

1152
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,460
I'll shave your head.

1153
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,180
And we can't waste any time

1154
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,620
because while they are sleeping,

1155
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:06,660
we'll eat their brains raw.

1156
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,120
Let's see the kids later, and let's fix

1157
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,060
the spacecraft first.

1158
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,100
See, Bob is a businessman, and Bob is going to try to

1159
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,760
prevent the planet Earth from being sold.

1160
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,240
So when Bob goes to talk to these men from Planet X,

1161
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,780
he has to have a representative

1162
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,860
constituency here on Earth.

1163
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,400
Because the men from Planet X, well,

1164
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,240
they're businessmen. Pure and simple businessmen.

1165
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,860
And they're going to say, Bob, your proposal

1166
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,940
sounds good, but I gotta see numbers.

1167
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,140
I've got to see hard data.

1168
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,460
Show me the numbers of subjugates on this Earth,

1169
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,480
and it's your planet.

1170
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,040
And we'll know it's worth saving.

1171
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,240
See, that's Bob's

1172
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,920
job, is to

1173
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,100
someone's got to explain to those

1174
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,880
aliens in ways they can understand

1175
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,340
why the human Roman race

1176
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,920
is the way it is, so that they

1177
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,220
don't put us out of our means.

1178
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,260
And they understand the bottom line.

1179
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,920
Which is why we're the world's first industrial church.

1180
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,680
The church of love and money.

1181
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,020
It certainly is.

1182
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,780
Sheriff, are you nuts?

1183
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,320
You'll have a swamp full of hicks out here

1184
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,300
shooting at each other.

1185
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,680
Let me tell you something, boy.

1186
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,400
Better shooting out here in the swamp

1187
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,820
than in town there.

1188
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,920
What do you want me to do, go out there

1189
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,740
and get bit by all them mosquitoes?

1190
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,040
That meteorite didn't kill those people.

1191
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,040
It turned them into a bunch of goddamn monsters.

1192
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,880
I saw it. I saw it.

1193
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,820
It came from the sky.

1194
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,780
Kato, calling command ship.

1195
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,340
Send advance parties immediately.

1196
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:26,960
I've now established

1197
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,320
humans high in protein.

1198
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,080
And easy prey.

1199
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,920
Welcome to glorious Cincinnati.

1200
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,080
Queen of Ohio's alpine ski resorts.

1201
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,840
Welcome to polka hell.

1202
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

1203
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,600
I know this sounds crazy,

1204
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,960
but the Superstation Studios

1205
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,620
have been taken over by creatures

1206
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,600
from another planet.

1207
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,560
Stick all the bits of brain in a plastic bag, Barry.

1208
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,080
We'll need your analysis.

1209
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,060
No bloody way, mate.

1210
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,100
You can come down here and do that yourself.

1211
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:56,780
Hi, friends.

1212
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,340
I'm Heinrich Himmler, and boy, when it gets hot,

1213
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,000
it's hard to understand.

1214
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,640
It really gets hard.

1215
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,660
And when it gets big, it gets really big.

1216
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,720
We like to make it big and hard

1217
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,960
for you to understand.

1218
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,240
So zip up your zip suit

1219
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,560
and check it out, kids.

1220
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,700
Is that why my tongue got this way?

1221
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,140
It's all big and hard.

1222
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:17,040
I can't hold it.

1223
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,080
You thought it was light?

1224
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,580
And you thought that it was something mutant and ugly.

1225
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,740
Really, in the subgenius church,

1226
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,880
that hanging, lollygaggy tongue

1227
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,860
and that twisted face,

1228
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,500
is the sexiest thing you've ever seen.

1229
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:33,900
That's what subgenius women call beautiful.

1230
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,560
And wait till you see what the men go for.

1231
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,320
Oh, my God.

1232
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,380
Oh, my God. Can you imagine?

1233
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,120
Have you ever seen a woman with that many lips?

1234
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:42,980
He's coming over here.

1235
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,560
Have you ever seen women with that many lips

1236
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,080
there?

1237
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,520
And look, each one of them

1238
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,200
has its own separate personality.

1239
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,340
That's what you want, guys.

1240
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,400
Believe you me.

1241
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,180
Once you've gone there,

1242
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,920
you'll never go,

1243
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,240
to the other place.

1244
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,760
Anytime, time, ever again.

1245
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,360
I'm speaking to you professionally

1246
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,260
as a sex professional now.

1247
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,980
Now, professionally speaking,

1248
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,820
what is the best sex position

1249
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,160
for a subgenius to take?

1250
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,440
Under Bob.

1251
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,440
All is under Bob.

1252
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,420
Bob is always on top.

1253
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:23,940
Yeah.

1254
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,020
And if one has earned

1255
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,220
a reach around

1256
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:28,900
for sex,

1257
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:28,900


1258
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:28,900


1259
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,320
for sex,

1260
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,920
from that great super salesman,

1261
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,420
that living avatar of slack,

1262
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,680
then one should leave

1263
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,140
a special tip for him.

1264
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,700
And it's important to leave that tip

1265
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,200
in the right jar, isn't it, Reverend?

1266
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,100
Yes, that's right.

1267
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:45,260
And use a nice, clean knife

1268
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,420
when you separate the tip

1269
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,580
from all the rest.

1270
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,280
A clean, clean, clean

1271
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,400
and sterilized knife.

1272
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,900
Apparently, Bob came

1273
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,760
and did something

1274
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,960
with all of us.

1275
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,780
And, of course,

1276
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,420
our lives could instantly be

1277
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,020
snuffed out by

1278
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,640
flood basalt volcanism.

1279
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,220
What if the show just stopped?

1280
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,820
Suddenly, we would go

1281
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,780
flying off the planet.

1282
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:12,560
That's true.

1283
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,480
A show is traveling

1284
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,240
at such a rate

1285
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,360
that a sudden stoppage

1286
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,020
would cause

1287
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,320
a relativistic shift.

1288
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,900
We'd be flung forward

1289
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,300
like bags of laundry.

1290
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,740
And our landing

1291
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:23,920
would not be gentle.

1292
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,440
The really bad laundry.

1293
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,600
Yeah, the durian fruit

1294
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,280
smelling laundry.

1295
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,140
Oh, little special

1296
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,000
frozen durian fruit thing.

1297
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,700
Some say the world

1298
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,600
will end in fire.

1299
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:42,820
Some say in ice.

1300
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,680
Is that obvious?

1301
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,460
Oh, my God.

1302
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:47,940
Monster.

1303
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,620
These are apparently

1304
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,540
a part of your work in space.

1305
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,340
Monster live in magma

1306
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:53,920
of underground

1307
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,080
in huge volcanoes.

1308
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,100
And look, there is its mate

1309
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,700
sitting also in the lava.

1310
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,540
This is why we did not

1311
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,320
see it the first time.

1312
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,420
We could not read

1313
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,100
through the magma

1314
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:08,580
of underground.

1315
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:10,500
Progressive

1316
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,400
fading coloration

1317
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,060
makes monster

1318
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,220
a confusing sight.

1319
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,660
There is monster 2000.

1320
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,020
I know you think

1321
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,000
you thought you saw

1322
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,820
a monster,

1323
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:20,720
as you call it,

1324
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,940
but I'm sure

1325
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,820
you only need

1326
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,080
to get some rest.

1327
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,020
It'll all look different

1328
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:29,260
in the future.

1329
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,080
You know,

1330
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,440
we put a man on the moon.

1331
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,480
Monsters just

1332
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,060
don't exist anymore.

1333
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,020
He says he saw

1334
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:36,880
a monster.

1335
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,200
And thanks to

1336
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,020
KPFA

1337
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,380
and Doug

1338
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:47,400
and Howell

1339
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,080
and WCSB

1340
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:49,980
and Chaz

1341
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:50,680
and Dave

1342
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,160
and friends.

1343
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,320
Thanks to Bob.

1344
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,640
And you can learn more

1345
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,320
about Bob

1346
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:54,920
and what this church

1347
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,080
is all about.
