1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,120
You know how you get a song stuck in your head sometimes, usually a real stupid song.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,600
It just keeps, a loop of it keeps running through your brain and drives you nuts.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,020
Well, all day I've had a phrase stuck in my head and I can't get rid of it.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:23,440
The phrase is, Saddam's much vaunted berms.

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:31,100
And by saying that phrase to you, it will now go out and be stuck in your heads,

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,120
thousands of other people's heads, and I'll be free of the curse.

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,900
I hope.

8
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,580
I'm going to make sure of that during this show.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,200
Remember, that's Saddam's much vaunted berms.

10
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,380
They've been vaunting them berms, dear friends.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,260
And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth.

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,180
By the means of those miracles, which he had power to do in the sight of the beast,

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,540
saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,000
Bob?

15
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,220
Bob?

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,140
Let there be light.

17
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,220
That's right, they're going to split.

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,440
All free, let me know when you're going to split.

19
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,320
And they could.

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:23,940
That's right.

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,640
They're going to split.

22
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,180
Oh, let the spirit of Bob come in.

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,220
Let the spirit of Bob blow it all over the parking lot.

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,840
Let the spirit of Bob move it out of here.

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,880
For all friends.

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,180
We want Bob!

27
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,920
We want Bob!

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,540
We want Bob!

29
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,000
Have you ever wondered about your neighbors?

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,140
Maybe wondered about the weird thumps and bumps or chants emanating from their apartment?

31
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,600
Well, they may be followers of Bob.

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,480
That's the fastest growing cult here in the Southwest.

33
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,420
Channel 4's Kelly Lane has this.

34
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:53,760
story

35
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:14,020
the message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,260
every time you say see hear or think what about slack

37
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:27,320
that's your key phrase it will trigger the entire message without your being

38
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:33,740
aware of it and now the subgenius

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:59,440
the subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played

40
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:07,620
on radio station uh this station only in the city of this area should any other shows be heard from

41
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,840
or contacted in the course of this show the listener is advised to remain calm and only

42
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,580
contact listed or unlisted officials in the event of any material that one before having

43
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,940
shared dear friends but what you haven't heard ever before is about

44
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,240
the subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on

45
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,380
saddam's much vaunted berms

46
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:36,140
uh yes dear friends we have indeed gone back in time again this hour of slack number 1203

47
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:49,200
is in fact a rerun of episode number 276 from the year of 1991 we're in week five of eight

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,040
weeks of the subgenius history

49
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:59,960
slash how to run your own cult class at maybe logic academy and thus the reruns also the

50
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:05,460
conspiracy has been keeping dave from making it to the station but nonetheless these old shows

51
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:12,340
have their own special charm for instance even though the george bush you'll hear us refer to

52
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:20,140
is actually the first one not the relatively recent one with the war but an older one with a

53
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,020
slightly different name and a slightly different style of music which is the subgenius hour of slack

54
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,740
different war

55
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:30,760
i guess it's really the same war and and it's the same saddam with the same much vaunted berms

56
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,560
then came the fighter's fist a horrible blast causing all in this path to disintegrate

57
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,080
i became interested in the show when i was 20 years old at the same time as my studies which

58
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,000
led to a doctorate in child psychology i devoted a good deal of my time to the show

59
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:58,160
i learned the traditional show moves composed doings and i remember how the silence was bursting

60
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,200
into my brain how it sounded as it began to stop the lyricism of the subgenius poets and musicians

61
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:09,760
i sought to develop the show by subtle changes in the format the silence the manner in which it is

62
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:16,520
played i produced a special show of three and a half scales in the diatonic mode which can be

63
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,000
played with two independent radios a method which apparently i am not a fan of but it's a way to

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,180
myself created now I don't remember doing it my love and my terrible

65
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,140
mouth burning the jury of the international subgenius competition of

66
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:36,320
Iranian virtuosity and burning flesh awarded me a premier peak which to all

67
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:43,160
you illiterate sodbuster poebuckers out there means first prize and so I say you

68
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:53,180
fondly from the very bottom of my heart you can just kiss my that is to say I wish to

69
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,880
express my profound contempt for all you listeners who know that is to say perhaps I

70
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,120
need to freshen up no I'm trying to say is that yeah let me put it you know as

71
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,000
Ralph Fielding Snell the great Armenian peach picker once said you can find one

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,140
peach pit in every peach pit

73
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,140


74
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,940
but you can't find two peach pits where there aren't no he didn't say that no no

75
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,480
what he actually said was better to throw the food in the street than give

76
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,380
the kiddies too much to eat but better belly burst than good meat spill no he

77
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,440
didn't say that no no no I think what he meant to say was that

78
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,020
oh god I have it all wrong what he actually said or what he would have said

79
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,800
yeah had he thought about it or actually not him but me I would have said it if I'd been there

80
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,060
you were there yeah of course I wasn't I was born a hundred years too late but uh

81
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,040
in any case I would have said something more in the

82
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,140
next few years

83
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,400
I'm sure that's the nature of this coming message from your local sponsor

146
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,460
Bob. football.

147
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,300
Bob Nobs.

148
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,180
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

149
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:41,580
Yeah, dear friends, the anonymous Fort Worth drug-using teenager edited that together.

150
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,440
Isn't that lovely?

151
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,860
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

152
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,760
A work of devotion in the name of guess who?

153
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,600
Yes, you're right, Bob.

154
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,720
More praise.

155
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,980
You know, they'll just praise Bob all day and on into the night,

156
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,000
and yet half the time they never explain who Bob is.

157
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,020
So here we are with the Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

158
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,900
Of the First Church of the Subgenius in Dallas, Texas.

159
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,060
I'm the radio pope, the first radio pope of the Northeast.

160
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,720
Pleased to be at your service here today.

161
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,720
It's an honor to actually be here on WBAI

162
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,220
because I have for many years been monitoring your broadcasts,

163
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,580
and I know that Bob has exposed himself on your station before,

164
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,140
and this is an honor and a privilege to be able to expose him further.

165
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:28,620
Right.

166
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,640
Excuse me, Reverend Bleepo, who is Bob?

167
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,320
Can you maybe clarify that a little bit?

168
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,880
Oh, Bob is the saint of sales, the avatar of slack.

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,980
He is the smiling, benign man with the pipe

170
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,800
that you may see in many of this anarchist graffito

171
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,700
that he's been doing.

172
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,440
Many of your young people are putting up on the walls

173
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,880
and dormitories of America.

174
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,840
He's also featured in videotapes and music experiences

175
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,280
of these young people as well.

176
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,420
Well, you may recognize Bob.

177
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,940
You've probably seen his face thousands of times as you were growing up.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,380
He was a male model from the 1930s to the 1950s

179
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,580
until, of course, his contact with the men from Planet X,

180
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,440
at which time he decided to sort of drop out of most of the modeling,

181
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,360
although you still saw drawings of him after that.

182
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,600
He sort of had this...

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,460
sort of Ward Cleaver look with the pipe and the smile

184
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,800
and the black hair.

185
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,060
And as a salesman, he also, of course, was a salesman

186
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,940
and an insurance agent and many, many jobs he held.

187
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,300
It was said that he could sell an Eskimo a freezer.

188
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,920
It was said that he could sell a fly.

189
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,140
Well, I can't say what he could sell that fly,

190
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,820
but he could sell the fly what the fly likes to lie around on

191
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,980
inside a hot field on a summer's day.

192
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,680
Now, is Bob the person who started the church of the subgenius?

193
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,900
Well, yes, it was...

194
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,720
Or is he someone you just stumbled upon

195
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,580
who you thought would be...

196
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,240
Is it good to focus?

197
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,980
Well, stumbling upon is a good key word here, Paul,

198
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,660
because Bob came about much of his best success entirely by accident.

199
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,000
And it was in 1981, I believe,

200
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,660
that he contacted two very bland people,

201
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,640
that is, the Reverend Ivan Stang

202
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,360
and the Reverend Philo Drummond from Dallas, Texas.

203
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,980
And he emanatinized them

204
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,400
and made them the sacred scribes,

205
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,640
and the people who would spread the word of Bob throughout the world.

206
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,960
And since that time,

207
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,360
Reverend Stang and Reverend Drummond have been instrumental in...

208
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,180
Of course, there's their book in the bookstores,

209
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,100
the book of the subgenius,

210
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,400
which is a real McGraw-Hill book,

211
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,060
which you can buy in the humor section for some reason.

212
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,760
They usually put it there.

213
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,380
I don't know why.

214
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,580
Yeah, it's something so serious as your church.

215
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,740
And in video stores, there is, of course, the Arise video,

216
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,120
which you can also purchase at this time.

217
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,600
Now, did he, like, manifest himself to these gentlemen in Texas

218
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,380
through a channel?

219
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,660
Did he appear in a channeler, or did he appear in a dream,

220
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,040
or did he appear...

221
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,140
Well, I think an actual encounter with Bob is so shocking,

222
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,660
it makes it impossible to describe.

223
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,240
And those who have actually seen Bob in the flesh or non-flesh,

224
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,680
they're dazed for many, many, many weeks afterwards

225
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,540
and can only say the word Bob, Bob, Bob

226
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,040
over and over again for weeks at a time

227
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,740
until they sort of snap out of it.

228
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,360
And then they're just slaves to the church.

229
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,640
But they're slaves of their own free will, of course.

230
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,220
See, the whole point of the Church of the Subgenius

231
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,320
is they want you to pull the wool over your own eyes.

232
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,500
And the Church of the Subgenius, I want to point out,

233
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,600
I've been listening to this program

234
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,440
and monitoring what you've been saying on this program.

235
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,280
The Church of the Subgenius, I want to point out, listeners,

236
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,600
believes in everything.

237
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,280
They do not want you to not believe in Jesus.

238
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,060
They do not want you to not believe in Santa Claus.

239
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,700
They want you to believe in Jesus, Santa Claus, Buddha, the devil,

240
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,400
because the devil is real.

241
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,000
They want you to believe in Mickey Mouse.

242
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,160
They want you to believe in every possible thing

243
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,140
to believe in because even the tooth fairy the tooth fairy of course yes the tooth fairy is very

244
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:52,420
real and uh because the church of the subgenius realizes that if you believe something's strong

245
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:58,840
enough then it becomes true so bob is a real god bob is a sex god too i want to point out at this

272
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:03,900


273
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:03,900


274
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:03,900

00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:03,900


276
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:03,900


277
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:03,900


278
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:03,900


279
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:03,900


280
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:03,900


281
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:03,900


282
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:03,900


283
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,520
拥抱

284
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:10,520


285
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:10,520


286
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:10,520


287
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:10,680
um

288
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,120
ride

289
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,140
up

290
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,500
high

291
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:12,500


292
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,720
sometimes

293
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:14,960
fair fiancé

294
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,800
up

295
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,200
And I'll admit that some of them were pretty good

296
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,720
But their progressive country style

297
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,300
Just makes us old-timers just sit around and smile

298
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,800
Because we know that it all started with Bob

299
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,980
Nobody's done it

300
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,660
Like Bob

301
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,160
No, nobody's done it

302
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,820
Like Bob

303
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,180
He's a living legend

304
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,440
And if his life was measured

305
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,520
He'd be the greatest of them all

306
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,900
Oh, yeah

307
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,960
Oh, yeah

308
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,720
When you hear those fiddles

309
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,700
Play inside my soul

310
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,240
Them old Bob Wills fiddles

311
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,060
Will make you wanna cry

312
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,260
And they'll make you wanna dance

313
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,200
As only Bob Wills used to do

314
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,460
When you hear those fiddles playing

315
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:45,960
You'll hear them playing

316
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,600
And the shoes keep walking

317
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,580
Back to you

318
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,100
He put old San Antone on the map

319
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,820
With a beautiful song about a rose

320
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:05,140
And he was a-playing western swing

321
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,180
Before Waylon and Willie could counter-tone

322
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,160
From his birthplace in Turkey, Texas

323
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,740
To his last days in Old Cowtown

324
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,600
He built a music legend

325
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,920
That will never, never be put down

326
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,020
Nobody's done it

327
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,960
Like Bob

328
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,300
No, nobody's done it

329
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,140
Like Bob

330
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,940
No, nobody's done it

331
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,880
Like Bob Wills fiddles

332
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,560
And if his life was measured

333
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:57,760
He'd be the greatest of them all

334
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,560
And if his life was measured

335
00:17:59,560 --> 00:17:59,560


336
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,280
And if his life was measured

337
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,280


338
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:08,740
And he's still trying to do it like Bob Wills fiddles

339
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,700
Oh, what a beautiful, beautiful thing.

340
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,560
Don't you agree?

341
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,480
Major Bill there and friends.

342
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,460
Now you kids settle down.

343
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,180
Restrict your shenanigans to the rumpus room.

344
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,220
Major Bill and Gene Hensley there.

345
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,100
A beautiful thing.

346
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,380
They did refine their shenanigans to the rumpus room.

347
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,900
Papa Joe Mama.

348
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,020
Hello, friends and welcome.

349
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,540
The Sun.

350
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:45,940
Persona.

351
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,740
A very petrified, very

352
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:49,740


353
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,520
And there are no вопрос over the Quitter so to say

354
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,920
It has to go back to the fundamental idea of self- wonder.

355
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,300
Right now that our sun tends to be mixed with many other DNA

356
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,760
So male plants are labeled as three and both working together

357
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,440
ls lyriciden

358
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,600
subject to giving up and then kill each other.

359
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:14,660
Yeah, that's true.

360
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,180
Using the Pl mandated to cameo all alone.

361
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:15,540
life is equal single life isn't it

362
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:21,400
women in their own blood. Now, what about the subgenies, you say? Well, we're all in this

363
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,900
together now, you say? Right? Wrong! We've got a lifeguard, someone to toss us a lifesaver. That

364
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:33,520
life preserver is none other than J.R. Bob Dobbs, and the rope that connects us to his salvation is

365
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,400
slack. The only way you're going to be able to reach Bob Dobbs and stay afloat is to have enough

366
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,400
slack on your lifeline. Now, friends, what does it take to have enough slack? For one thing,

367
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,920
you should always remember who you are working for. Now, the pinks, they think they're going to

368
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:55,360
retire for the conspiracy, and the conspiracy is going to protect them. Oh, they have a rude

369
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,160
awakening in store for them now, don't they? It will begin as a small conflict, a police action,

370
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,680
if you will. Then it will expand and grow and engulf the Persian Gulf. Next you'll know they'll

371
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,120
be knocking at your door and ringing on your telephone. Guess who gets an all-expense paid

372
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,220
trip to the Mediterranean?

373
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,800
They don't call it Club Med for nothing. The MAD stands for medical, because that's where you're

374
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,260
going to wind up. But the real fun doesn't even start until the bombs start going off in your

375
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:28,060
very own neighborhood. Oh, sure, at first it'll only be a local terrorist or two, so it won't be

376
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,460
as if you're being blown to bits by strangers. But then again, what difference does it make when

377
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,040
you're flying through air with the greatest of ease, eh? Besides, it's only a matter of time

378
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,000
before it begins to rain bombs from the heavens. You won't be able to step outside without getting

379
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,280
an instant flashback.

380
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,340
Frank, what?

381
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:59,440
Friends, this is rather that self- waisted segue.

382
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,060
Can you tell me if I point theve into your character head

383
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,460
just to be видимooked over a random Earth quality orbeter?

384
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:07,560
Huh?

385
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,380
Later, had I heard talk, he might be up one hard timebag!

386
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,480
countryside with typical efficiency. They'll round up the pinks like cattle. Death will take a

387
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,420
holiday. The lucky ones will die quick. The unlucky ones will die slow. And the moron majority won't

388
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:28,340
die at all. They'll be put in plastic bags and freeze-dried for convenient interplanetary

389
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:33,680
self-service space snacks. Oh, don't you believe the conspiracy lies that pinks don't taste good?

390
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:39,220
They may not have good taste, but they damn sure taste good. This is just a plain and simple fact

391
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:44,480
you must take on faith, for even Bob Dobbs does not suggest that you eat pinks before X-Day.

392
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:50,160
Lick pinks, now that's all right, but eat them. Taboo! They're a dessert to be savored, to be

393
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,120
saved, something to look forward to, something to gloat over as we float over to our promised land

394
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,860
beyond the stars. And we gotta keep them now fresh, don't we? Oh, yesiree, you probably think

395
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:05,340
that a pink can't be freeze-dried and then thaw back to life, but you're wrong. You're talking

396
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,080
about a conspiracy technology there, folks, but we're talking about the same

397
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,740
brains that can go traveling through light years and instantaneous folding of space. Do you think

398
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,860
that the minds that contain the wisdom of the universe would allow the pinks to escape life

399
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:25,220
with nothing more than a freeze burn? Why, that only measures 265 candles on the agony scale.

400
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,260
Why, getting sliced to death by paper cuts earns less candles than that, and after all the pinks

401
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:35,380
have done to you, you're willing to send them off with a mere million paper cuts? Have you no human

402
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,060
dignity? Have you at long last surrendered all symbolism to the world? You're not a human, you're

403
00:22:45,880 --> 00:23:00,320
already a white yelp and gradually you'll catch on in the dark with a

404
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:08,140
fistful of fake that'll Whoop Slay.

405
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:08,640
Thank you, sir.

406
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:08,840
Bottom of aisle, please.

407
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,600
Biblical prophecy is coming to fruition.

408
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,220
At long last, the exes will come forth to wreak Bob's revenge.

409
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,120
For lo, these many years of yearning, burning, and churning

410
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,000
amongst the pseudo-suitable substance some say sucks.

411
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,940
Let my people go.

412
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,160
Swing low, sweet chariots of fire.

413
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,000
They're coming to take us away, ha ha.

414
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,700
Yea, the end is nigh.

415
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,040
So eat, drink, and be merry.

416
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,060
For tomorrow, they die.

417
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,320
Praise Bob.

418
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:38,820
Amen.

419
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,740
Oh, thank you so much, Papa Joe Mama.

420
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,380
The greatest of the subgenius radio preachers.

421
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,100
True preacher.

422
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,000
Ah, fine.

423
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,940
I got an interesting letter from his agent here, Papa Prell,

424
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,060
which I think I'll read to you.

425
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,180
It says, in fact, he wrote this war.

426
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,760
He says, here's the special bonus sermon.

427
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,320
It's another war rant.

428
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,680
I actually did it before the war.

429
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,560
So in a way, I was relieved to see,

430
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,960
we actually did go to war.

431
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,220
I would hate to waste all the effort.

432
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,920
By the way, your war rant was something else.

433
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,320
I'm just glad a recruiter officer wasn't nearby when I heard it.

434
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,860
I would have gone out and joined.

435
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,140
Yes, sir, them words of wisdom brought out the John Wayne in me.

436
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,620
I think at long last you deserve to be knighted

437
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,240
to honor an honorary Prell family member.

438
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,580
Ivan Prell.

439
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,420
Kinda has a ring to it.

440
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,460
And he goes on,

441
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,920
actually, now that everyone has joined the bandwagon about the war,

442
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,140
I'm beginning to have doubts.

443
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,780
I wish they would stage more protests and demonstrations

444
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,800
so I could feel secure in my old warmonger ways.

445
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,940
Even the news is egging it on.

446
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,400
Now if I see Jane Fonda come out in support of the conflict,

447
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,160
that's gonna be the last straw and I'll join the Iraq army.

448
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,300
Besides, both my latest girlfriends just dumped me

449
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,180
and I'm in the mood to kill some Americans.

450
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,220
And now they have women in the US armed forces.

451
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,720
That justice will be all the more poetic.

452
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,380
What am I saying?

453
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,180
I forgot your mail is monitored.

454
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,400
Thank God I didn't start talking about the nuclear bomb.

455
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,780
I'm located.

456
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,360
I could have ruined everything.

457
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,800
It's really hard to do, Papa Prell.

458
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,020
But it's real easy to do...

459
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,220
Sodom's Much Vaunted Berms.

460
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,120
That's right, dear friends.

461
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,320
Sodom's Much Vaunted Berms.

462
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,580
I'm not gonna let you forget about Sodom's Much Vaunted Berms.

463
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:35,620
As a matter of fact, the Christian religion usually is very far from what Christ actually thought.

464
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,560
And what he did, he...

465
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,620
He did it in a way that would detest you and your whole monetary approach to things

466
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,500
and your foolish things.

467
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,300
Just because you think it's true, it's gotta be true.

468
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:57,140
Because you parrot something you read in the Bible or you learned in some half-baked divinity school

469
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,240
that you attended if you ever did attend one.

470
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,380
That makes it true?

471
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,240
No, it doesn't make it true.

472
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,700
You don't talk about ghosts.

473
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,500
All you try to do is go into an argument.

474
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,640
I'm not trying to...

475
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,620
Like a man calls up and he says that he has seen ghosts.

476
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,300
Yes, I do.

477
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,460
And you immediately start saying, oh no, you couldn't, you must be crazy, you're hallucinating.

478
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,200
I don't want to hear that kind of baloney.

479
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,080
Demons.

480
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,460
I asked you about demons.

481
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,920
What's the answer?

482
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,380
I don't know what they are.

483
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,060
You don't?

484
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,180
You're just pretending you know.

485
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,000
But you say that's what Christ said, that it's true.

486
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:31,920
No, no.

487
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,640
Don't you realize that you're completely mixed up as far as what Jesus really...

488
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,420
But no, sir, sir.

489
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,700
You know what Jesus said?

490
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,520
Sir, these are not...

491
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,520
Anything I can do, you can do.

492
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,440
These are not...

493
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:50,140
If you're trying to talk to an uninformed people like you who make a god out of this

494
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,020
great soul, we're all a part of God.

495
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,100
Don't you know that, you fool?

496
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,340
You're having great time showing off.

497
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,200
All right.

498
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,400
And you've got, I don't know whether anybody's listening or not, but if they are, they're

499
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,620
sending in money and all, boy, you're going to be a great man.

500
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:06,620


501
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:06,620


502
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:06,620


503
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:06,620


504
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:06,620


505
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:06,620


506
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,020
Isn't that great?

507
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,180
You should let her speak.

508
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,180
I'll let her speak.

509
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,380
If you will be quiet.

510
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,200
Instead of giving them all an argument and trying to tell them how to live their lives.

511
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,060
Arch, Arch.

512
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,640
You don't know how to live their lives.

513
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,340
You don't even know how to live your own life.

514
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,840
No deformities, no imperfections.

515
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,280
She is a norm.

516
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,720
All norms are our enemies.

517
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,800
Kill her now for what she's done to our kind.

518
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,560
No, why?

519
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,180
Why must we always destroy beauty?

520
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,600
Why kill her now?

521
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:36,600


522
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:36,600


523
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:36,600


524
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:36,600


525
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:36,600


526
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:36,600


527
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:36,600


528
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:36,600


529
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:36,600


530
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:36,600


531
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,080
Why kill another creature because it is not in our image?

532
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,460
Kill her.

533
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,620
It is the law.

534
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,380
All norms must die.

535
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,960
They are our enemies.

536
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,280
Can you possibly visualize the passing of these few precious minutes?

537
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,420
My man is a giant.

538
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,020
He likes to eat fresh boys on toast.

539
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:05,560
It was most embarrassing because when he opened his mouth to try, only strange sounds came

540
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,060
out.

541
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,780
Arch, Arch, Arch.

542
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,020
And he couldn't even whistle because he couldn't pucker his lips.

543
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:33,680
Our bodies contain atoms made billions of years ago in the fiery core of a supernova

544
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,080
star.

545
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,580
A drop of dew on the surface of the star is the best thing that can happen to a star.

546
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:36,580


547
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,920
A diamond, a blue, a diamond, a butterfly and all other life forms are made of the

548
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,340
same matter as stars and planets.

549
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,560
Yeah, that's what they all say.

550
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,640
Five, four, three, two, one, zero.

551
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,580
One important way to save your life is to know that you are a human being.

552
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:12,420
human beings differ from all other living things is that we can ask questions. Questions about

553
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:18,780
ourselves and questions about the other planets and the stars that lie invisibly beyond the known

554
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:27,100
universe. Stars such as post office box. Well, I'm going to give the post office box once again.

555
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:34,440
Or you can write for free information from that man standing right over there behind you,

556
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:49,200
J.R. Bob Dobbs. That's post office box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 www.subgenius.com.

557
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:58,440
And all we'll send you is free information about Saddam's much vaunted berms.

558
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,900
Uh, those last few bunch of clips there came in from Reverend Nick Nolan,

559
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:11,360
it says here on the cassette from Brentwood, British Columbia, far away. And you know,

560
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,180
those little lines may show up again someday in some better world.

561
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:26,120
I send the angel of the Lord. I send right now power. I move back the foul spirits of opposition,

562
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,920
the lying spirits, the binding spirits. I speak authority to you in the name of Jesus Christ.

563
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,960
Don't ask any questions. Just do as I say. All right.

564
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,160
We're pretty sure he's a psychopath. Now, how do we spot him?

565
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,660
Well, if he's wearing a Napoleon hat, it's easy.

566
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,520
Otherwise they come in all sizes and shapes. 11 year old girls, 80 year old men.

567
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,480
Yeah, they all look perfectly normal.

568
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,720
I keep telling you, this is a sick and perverted nation.

569
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,400
All the time.

570
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,720
And nobody wants to listen to me.

571
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,480
Nobody wants to hear about Bob.

572
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,140
Nobody, I try tell everybody what's going on.

573
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,800
They won't listen to me.

574
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,580
Well, I'll tell you the truth, I can't stand it anymore, Bob.

575
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,580
Bob.

576
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,240
Bob.

577
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,920
Bob.

578
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,620
Bob, take care of me, Bob.

579
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,260
Just do away with them all.

580
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,660
I don't want them anymore.

581
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,840
They hold a problem and illusion in my mind after all.

582
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,420
They don't love you, Bob.

583
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,880
They don't love you like I do.

584
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,240
The fist and the fear behind it.

585
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,120
It's not just the wars and the awards that win them.

586
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,500
It's not just the dull and empty distaste for a smothered culture

587
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,820
that expires all around you in pools of its own wastes.

588
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,520
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu.

589
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,080
It's not just the child zombies

590
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,420
that bring you to the end of the world.

591
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,740
It's not just the people who murdered their mediocrity parents

592
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,800
and then cruise the streets with bloody feet.

593
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,020
It's not just those starry old vex on the park benches

594
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,820
with looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars

595
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,420
of Belsen and Auschwitz.

596
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,420
It's not just the anesthesiologist for knee heat.

597
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,580
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses

598
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,940
that grope and clutch all around you.

599
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,400
It's not just the diamonds

600
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,560
and the nanobones for Wotan.

601
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,400
It's not just the broken headlights,

602
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,860
snapped antenna and human excrement on your car hood.

603
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,840
It's not just that the old ways were best.

604
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,180
It's not just the bastardization and perversion

605
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,460
of every honest means of self-expression.

606
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,120
It's not just the Kiliganja on the dark side of the bush.

607
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,860
It's not just the penoid snipers

608
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,380
locking and loading on every high-rise car.

609
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:34,640
It's not just the blue-collar-pinked rooftop.

610
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,820
It's not just the wide-screen technicolor corporate daisy chain

611
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,940
that has defiled the entire planet.

612
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,520
It's not just Mongo in the Congo

613
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,820
with fa-fa-fals the size of basketballs.

614
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,420
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness.

615
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,340
It's not just the indignity of having to work

616
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,180
for some bland, non-entity son of a bitch

617
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,560
who thinks workers are property.

618
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,360
It's not just the blue-collar-pinked rooftop.

619
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:04,360


620
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:04,360


621
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,380
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil.

622
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,480
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature

623
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,140
without realizing that nature is an open-ditch latrine in midsummer.

624
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,780
It's not just some asshole with a pipe

625
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,780
and a thing I know more than you do dog grin all over his homogenized face.

626
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,340
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented,

627
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,180
devolving world that you certainly never made.

628
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,740
It's not just the doorway to doom.

629
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,600
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

630
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,920
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max.

631
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,100
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.

632
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,980
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum-show.

633
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,280
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.

634
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,980
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.

635
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,000
Shout salvation and fight in Jesus, you'll need to rise precious early.

636
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,440
You sinner there, if you want to diddle the almighty Bob, not off.

637
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,360
He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

638
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,780
In his back pocket. Just you try.

639
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,520
Ah, yes.

640
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:21,080
Dear friends, that was G. Gordon Gordon himself.

641
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,540
One of his rare spoken pieces.

642
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,400
Don't always run.

643
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,400
Soon I can flip my show tape over.

644
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,560
Off his masking tape.

645
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,740
And we'll visit.

646
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,520
The world of KPFA.

647
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,700
With puzzling evidence.

648
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,880
Dr. Howell.

649
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,400
And in this case, Papa Joe Mama.

650
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,940
I hope Bob is it.

651
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,720
That live is on his phone right now.

652
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,440
You guys hear me right now?

653
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,660
We want Bob!

654
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,940
We want Bob!

655
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,000
We want Bob!

656
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You are ever since been born black mass of jigs and jing-jangs.

657
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,720
Haunted by people.

658
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,600
And by the convulsionary sense of not having been.

659
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,400
Or being all that I might have been of you meant to be coming.

660
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,960
A wailing like a man.

661
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,220
That innocence which I could not defend like a woman.

662
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,240
Lo, you there, Catherine Carberry.

663
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,820
And thank movies from the innermost depths of my still-attried heart.

664
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,400
Wherein the days of your youth are ever mixed in mine.

665
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,400
Now, ere the compline hour of being alone at hands itself.

666
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,340
And a puff or so before we yield our spiritus to the wind.

667
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,120
For it is to you.

668
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,300
First born and first fruit of woe.

669
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,880
To me, branded sheep.

670
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,440
Pick of the waster paper basket.

671
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,120
Are the tremors of thundering, alluring dog-style.

672
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,120
You alone.

673
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,640
Wind-blasted tree of the knowledge of beautiful and devil.

674
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,140
I, clothed upon with a mitch war.

675
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,460
And shimmering like the Horaceans.

676
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,520
Astrid by dynamo and erogus.

677
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,880
The child of Milford's father, the spirit.

678
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:17,380
To me, unseen blusher in an obscene coal hole.

679
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,500
Hey, somebody.

680
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,920
Of course you're gonna win this war.

681
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,120
How can it be anything other than a total and complete annihilation of the enemy?

682
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,680
Yeah, that's it.

683
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,360
Yeah, yeah.

684
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,560
What, what he said, yeah.

685
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,320
Swim in your own boat.

686
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:36,200
I can't believe that you would even suggest that we would win this war.

687
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,620
How could you not win this war?

688
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,380
It's the most...

689
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,000
What are you suggesting?

690
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,240
That we're going into war, intending on losing or something?

691
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:49,880
I can't believe that we're actually having people fight if we're not intending on...

692
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,560
I mean, this is just...

693
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,460
This is unbelievable.

694
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,520
What are we paying the military for?

695
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,380
This is just...

696
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,200
It's 30 billion dollars if we don't even buy a shot.

697
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,860
I don't understand why there's but to do and die.

698
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,120
Okay, folks.

699
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,100
It's time for war.

700
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:03,960
Oh, no!

701
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:03,960


702
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,340
No!

703
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:04,960
No!

704
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,480
No!

705
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:06,640
No!

706
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,160
No!

707
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,260
No!

708
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:08,800


709
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:08,920


710
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,100
No!

711
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,260
No!

712
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:10,500
No!

713
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:10,800
No!

714
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,140


715
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,140


716
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,180


717
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,180


718
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,180


719
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,180


720
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,500
No!

721
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,140
No!

722
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:12,300


723
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,800
No!

724
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,160
This morning will not be...

725
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,460
Only good mutual sympathy that

726
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:35,640
I have heard over the last years.

727
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,080
I've wanted to be...

728
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:46,000
I have a huge life to live, honey.

729
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,700
Give a guy a break.

730
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,580
Really, sir.

731
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,740
I must insist.

732
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,580
It's just an old family tradition.

733
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,540
It's the way we are.

734
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,280
It's not really how we mean to be.

735
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,160
Spare me the poisonous barbs, Major.

736
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,840
Warning, warning.

737
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,740
Running out of room.

738
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,400
I can't find...

739
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,100
You were my battlefield survival and radio electronic contact manual.

740
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,320
I say, sir, that my days at Oxford were legendary.

741
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,380
Those contacts stimulate me sexually.

742
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,240
Legend, something that is usually untrue.

743
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:27,020
Well, the origin of the legend is something that many scholars have been exploring for many, many years.

744
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,480
After all, legends have, in legend, been legendary.

745
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,720
For example, the legend of Eli and the blind jackass.

746
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,640
As told in the Book of Paul, chapter 7, verse 22.

747
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,280
The next...

748
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,580
The math is mythical, as will the end of the world.

749
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,380
But what is the basis of this mythical mishmash?

750
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,140
Is there in fact truth to this old, fusty legend?

751
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:01,300
Or is it really a discarded relic stinking upon the dust heap of history?

752
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,020
Of course, if enough people believe in it, it will become true.

753
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,020
You believe in a depression, and you become depressed.

754
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,440
You live in a recession, and you become depressed.

755
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,580
You make your own reality, man.

756
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,920
The country doesn't feel...

757
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,700
My country hurts.

758
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,760
My country tis of thee, a sweet land of liberty.

759
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,820
That's right, Billy.

760
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,980
And remember, Jesus loves you.

761
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,080
You must always place your hand over your heart when you say that, son.

762
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,360
That's right.

763
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,080
In the old days, people loved America.

764
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,240
You know, when I was a little girl,

765
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,540
everyone believed in evolution,

766
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,020
and everyone believed in the Lord Jesus.

767
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,780
Well, that was back in the days when the Lord Jesus Christ believed in you.

768
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,540
I hope you like this story, boys and girls.

769
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,160
If you would like a free picture of me,

770
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,200
as well as a free gift,

771
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,800
write to Aunt Bertha,

772
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,280
Box 1,

773
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,880
Dial a Story,

774
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,380
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

775
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,020
Goodbye now, boys and girls.

776
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,120
Bye.

777
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:18,020
We'll rush you that order, along with your free gallon of Aunt Bertha's syrup.

778
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,780
I always use it.

779
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,620
That's Aunt Bertha, as for it, by name.

780
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,440
I was working for Aunt Bertha out in Tartuga 29.

781
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,660
Yeah, I heard Aunt Bertha doesn't even pay the minimum wage, man.

782
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,360
Cleaning up the skin.

783
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,400
It's a rip-off.

784
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,620
They got her on income tax evasion.

785
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,520
It was a difficult...

786
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,700
You got a choice in the world.

787
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,140
Yeah, you could be a Bobby or a stub.

788
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,480
I found that down here at the station one night, and I thought to myself, yeah, Bobby or stub.

789
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,500
Yeah.

790
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,100
Yeah.

791
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,200
Yeah, that's you.

792
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,060
We've had a lot of Bobby Stubs show up lately, and it's been a constant.

793
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,320
Yeah, I remember Bob Stubbs.

794
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,200
He was back in, uh, at Dartmouth.

795
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,220
He was one of the best people on the, uh, machine gun team.

796
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,160
He was a great athlete.

797
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:55,940
It was a tragedy.

798
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,340
I...

799
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,380
One of the worst duties I ever had to perform was to bury all those...

800
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,560
those innocent boys and girls Stubs in the desert sands.

801
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,280
Yeah, but if you don't, uh, bury your Stubs...

802
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,900
You mean those A1 mortars mounted piggyback on .50 caliber machine guns didn't save them all?

803
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,520
Well, I'm afraid not.

804
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:10,940
You see...

805
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,560
I had an experiment.

806
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,080
It comes a time when every young boy or...

807
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,440
or girl's life, that it's time to bury those Stubs and, uh...

808
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,860
uh, and get on with the business of living.

809
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:25,280
But scientists discovered that by covering the Stubs with some strange new protoplasm...

810
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,720
Incoming!

811
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,960
They were able to resurrect the Stubs into a new form of life that...

812
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,340
Boy, my Stub resurrects just hearing about it.

813
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,600
It wasn't enough just to simply bring them back to life.

814
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,120
These Stubs had a mission.

815
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,320
Yes, millions of years ago, guns belonged to Stubba's owners rolling into the earth.

816
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,440
Because these Stubs used GI that were determined to win the war.

817
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,060
So these Stubs were not content to be buried.

818
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:44,060


819
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,340
They wanted revenge.

820
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,380
And they got it.

821
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,600
Here comes another one!

822
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,600
What scientists didn't count on, however, was the difficulty in controlling these Stubs

823
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,380
once they were resurrected from the grave.

824
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,040
We're having electrical interference down here, ladies and gentlemen.

825
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,940
It's part of the barrage.

826
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,380
We hope we're going to be able to continue bringing our program to you, but sit tight.

827
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,140
Stubs, unfortunately, do not have eyes or ears.

828
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,720
They cannot tell who is the enemy and who is the friend.

829
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,320
They're disgusting little blind rigorous...

830
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,040
And several instances say they were actually documented as attacking the donor of the Stubs.

831
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,040


832
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,040


833
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,040


834
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,040


835
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,040


836
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,800
Oh, they're horrible little glowing organs.

837
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,640
When these Stubs get on the rampage, one cannot predict how they will act.

838
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,600
Sometimes they turn on their very own donor, organ donor.

839
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,300
Of course, the worst thing that can happen is to turn on the piano donor or the harpsichord

840
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,900
donor, but the organ donor is bad enough.

841
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:38,280
And speaking of organs, later on in this program, we're going to tell you, as promised before,

842
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:42,560
just how you can see your own brain through a simple scientific experiment that can be

843
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,300
performed at home.

844
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,040
The electrical interference is a very important part of the program.

845
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,040


846
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,040


847
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,040


848
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,040


849
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,040


850
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,040


851
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,320
It's called the retroencephalogram recyclerama.

852
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,340
It's complete and 3D.

853
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,720
Warren Horace Donovan Enterprises, Inc.

854
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,020
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

855
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,060
That's what we need to beat the wind.

856
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:55,740
Beat the...

857
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,360
Yeah, beat the pants off the Iraqis.

858
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,060
Enormous trousers.

859
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,720
Now we're not going to get anywhere by trying to get a dollar.

860
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,560
We're going to bash the bloated buttocks of the butcher of Baghdad, Saddam Hussein.

861
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,660
You know there's mallops on end, Tony.

862
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,940
It's self-touching, it's not...

863
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,120
But we don't want to go below the belt.

864
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:11,620
We don't mean to.

865
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,020
America fights fear.

866
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,020


867
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,020


868
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,020


869
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,020


870
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,020


871
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,020


872
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:18,100
And reminds me of the prostitute that wanted to deliver a prize below the belt, but we

873
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:18,800
wouldn't permit that.

874
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,020
It's not on the radio.

875
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,480
Victory through fair power.

876
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,140
Of course, the fairs have been going up.

877
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,820
It's a pity Lyndon isn't around to see this one.

878
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,200
Yeah, sorry, yeah.

879
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,020
I will return.

880
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:35,540
And now it's like Superman and things happen really neat and fast and everything.

881
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,040
Look, bullets just bounce off.

882
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,100
Maybe this war isn't going to be so bad after all.

883
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:39,980
Oh, looky there.

884
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,220
What's that up in the sky?

885
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,680
You see the bird.

886
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,780
It is some sort of aircraft.

887
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,000
It's a bird.

888
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:44,920
It is a plane.

889
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,280
It is Super USA Man.

890
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,040
And he does not look too happy.

891
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:55,980
Yes, it's Superman, strange visitor to another planet with powers and abilities far beyond

892
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,240
those of mortal men.

893
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:04,360
Superman, who can change the course of mighty rivers, then steal in his bare hands, and

894
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:10,160
who, disguised as Glark Brent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper,

895
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,000
fights a never-ending battle against truth, just like the great American soldier.

896
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000


897
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000


898
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000


899
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000


900
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000


901
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000


902
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000


903
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000


904
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000


905
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000


906
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000


907
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000


908
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000


909
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000


910
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000


911
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,040
And the American way.

912
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,960
Oh, ho, no, Lois.

913
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,460
You're not going to scoop me again on this big story.

914
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,920
Oh, Vin, really?

915
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,960
Sometimes I think you're such a win.

916
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,360
Ha, ha, ha.

917
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,800
If she only knew.

918
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,980
Well, Perry, I guess we both have tickets on the steamer to Iraq, the latest trouble

919
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,340
spot.

920
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,920
And I guess the planet is going to be right there with the coverage.

921
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:43,980
Well, Perry, I guess we both have tickets on the steamer to Iraq, the latest trouble

922
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:44,060
spot.

923
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:44,060


924
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,100
And I'm worried about sending you over there.

925
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,100
The fact of the matter is, I think Lois is more of a man for the job.

926
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,640
But Mr. White, don't argue with me.

927
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:56,420
Luxuriating in the golden light in San Francisco, I still don't see what this is going to do

928
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:56,780
to...

929
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,100
Maybe I should use my X-rated vision to check up on Lois.

930
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,100
Oh, wow.

931
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,100
Jimmy, use your Superman beamer.

932
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,220
Zee, zee, zee, zee.

933
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,400
Look, up in the sky.

934
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,160
It's a bird.

935
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:11,860
It's a plane.

936
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,300
It's...

937
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,320
Oh, no.

938
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:19,580
Ha, ha.

939
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,920
Superman, so good of you to join us.

940
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,520
Just in time for my latest invention.

941
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,020
Ha, ha.

942
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:24,500
I promise...

943
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:24,840
Hold on.

944
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,040
Let me bare my chest so these bullets can bounce off.

945
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,420
It won't do you any good, Superman.

946
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,120
Ha, ha.

947
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,100
I'm afraid I have my special Kryptonite.

948
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,520
Oh, no.

949
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:33,780
Here, have a try.

950
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:34,640
Oh, blacking out.

951
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:34,640


952
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:34,640


953
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:34,640


954
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:34,640


955
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,120
Zee, zee, zee, zee.

956
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,700
Oh, no.

957
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,200
Blacking out.

958
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:42,860
Lois must reach switch to cut off Kryptonite field.

959
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:43,960
It won't do you any good, Superman.

960
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,600
Ha, ha, ha.

961
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,140
After all, I thought of everything.

962
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:52,000
It's only unconditional coincidence that allowed you to beat me and boil my plants

963
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,460
in the past.

964
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:52,820
Ha, ha.

965
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:53,960
All right, Luthor.

966
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,900
You've got me.

967
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,400
Good.

968
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,480
At long last, I have the Man of Steel at my very beckoning.

969
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,320
First, you must answer to my every whim.

970
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:04,900
All right.

971
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,520
What are your other demands?

972
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,220
Got to keep him talking until I can get out of range of this red K.

973
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,160
First, I want a shrubbery.

974
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:12,880
Yes, a shrubbery.

975
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:13,520
Ha, ha, ha.

976
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:13,940
And I want to have a little bit of a taste of the red K.

977
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:13,940


978
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:13,940


979
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,160
And I want it right here now.

980
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,420
And it must be of Kryptonite red.

981
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,660
And that's the joke.

982
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,220
You have to go to Krypton to get it.

983
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:20,820
Ha, ha, ha.

984
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,600
But Krypton doesn't exist except as billions and billions of gigatons of glowish, greening

985
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:25,840
rock.

986
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,520
At last.

987
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,740
You see the irony of my plan.

988
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,500
Ha, ha, ha.

989
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,620
But the only way I could get to Krypton was to fly backwards around the Earth until I

990
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:36,040
threw up and found myself back in time on my original home planet.

991
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,020
Only I know that he knows about the alternative universe.

992
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,140
And there he can get the Krypton that he needs.

993
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,920
Maybe that was in the vest pocket universe on the square earth.

994
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:43,920


995
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:43,920


996
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,600
There's no air planet of bizarro like that.

997
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,820
When he tries to go to the alternate universe, I'll have my special clone follow him.

998
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,840
Oh, not that tiny deformed imp, Mr. Mixadelplic.

999
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,560
But he's reading my thoughts.

1000
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,920
All right, Superman, this time you're indeed a de-poo-poo.

1001
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,820
It's really neat when they do that, you know.

1002
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,040
And I'm just waiting in the airport and you put a quarter in these TVs and they play these

1003
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,260
old Superman movies.

1004
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,400
If I can just make sure that my hairpin hits that lever, I think I can deactivate as Krypton

1005
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:10,640
arrived.

1006
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,960
Gee, Miss Lane.

1007
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,700
Do you think that would do any good?

1008
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:13,900
Oh, I think it would.

1009
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,120
We've got to try, Jimmy. It's the only thing we've got left.

1010
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,320
You know, I've noticed something about all these bad guys and blowhards.

1011
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,200
They may talk tough, but when you get right down to it, they're just a big cream puff.

1012
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:30,120
Well, Jimmy, I really hate to ask you to do this, but you think maybe you can go over there and knock them on the chin?

1013
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,780
Oh, you mean I have to do that? That's the kind of stuff Superman gets involved in.

1014
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,720
Oh, here he is.

1015
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:42,180
He must be the alternative universe Superman. He must have beckoned out with them at the Super Race.

1016
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:50,620
No, I'm one of the super robots who just recently escaped from Clark's closet, along with his 80-year collection of skin mags.

1017
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,640
I've been double-crossed.

1018
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,520
This is terrible, but this time I'm going to get even. Just you wait and see, Superman.

1019
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,660
Why am I laughing? This is terrible.

1020
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,380
Oh, boy, it feels great to be out of the range of that red cake.

1021
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,220
How come he does that?

1022
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,840
Fortunately, I got my special Luthor mobile. It'll fly me out of here quicker than the speed of light.

1023
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,260
I'm going to have to get my own Luthor.

1024
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,080
Hold on, Lois. I have to see a man about a car.

1025
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,320
What a car.

1026
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,720
Clark Kent, what are you doing here now? You just missed Superman again.

1027
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,780
Oh, sorry, Lois. I'm looking for my clothes. They seem to have burned off my body when Superman went over.

1028
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:39,640
You're never here in time to have helped us. We could have been killed by Lex Luthor.

1029
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,300
Oh, is that who that was?

1030
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,760
I saw him going by like a bat out of, uh, well, pardon my French.

1031
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,220
You're such a wimp, Kent.

1032
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,940
If she only knew.

1033
00:49:51,620 --> 00:50:00,800
Yes, it is another deep and dark, dreary day here in the fair downtown metropolis of the Daily Planet.

1034
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,260
And it is a daily day.

1035
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,660
Got a Tomahawk down here, sir. Want to buy a Tomahawk? Got a long-range cruise missile.

1036
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,940
Got a couple in the car here. Got a Tomahawk. You'll need it.

1037
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:08,920
Do you sell at a discount?

1038
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,020
Uh, yeah.

1039
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,180
More than quantity.

1040
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,300
You buy like, uh, five or more. It's air-to-air.

1041
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,840
How many would it take to take out the entire Iraqi fleet?

1042
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,900
Um, uh, a couple tow rockets for medium, uh, support and...

1043
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,740
Look at those tow-headed little guys.

1044
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:27,060
I might want to order one or two extra, just in case they give us a hard time.

1045
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:36,040
Now, I'm not expecting any trouble out of these boys, but if they're really serious about prodding us in anything other than, uh, well, three-day war, we may have to get tough.

1046
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,580
I've got the nuclear arms standing by.

1047
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,240
Yeah.

1048
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:40,660
That'll be tough, Art.

1049
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:46,100
Uh, yes, the, uh, nuclear option. I, uh, um, it is regrettable, but it is an option.

1050
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:46,120
It's a great man, man.

1051
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:56,820
Ladies and gentlemen, what we have going on here in the Middle East is a situation that is filling biblical prophecy from 2,000 years ago.

1052
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,160
You dumb chief.

1053
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:04,880
No, ladies, Sheila and Pat will point this out. Sheila, that's a delicious cake you provided, by the way.

1054
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,060
I'm gonna have to add another point.

1055
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:10,960
It's, uh, really delicious, and we're going to share that recipe with our viewers at home here very very soon.

1056
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,480
Can't wait.

1057
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:21,160
But unfortunately, uh, Sheila, we have a real difficult problem here in the Middle East, because, you see, those who bless Israel will be blessed.

1058
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:36,060
Uh, but those that curse Israel will be cursed, and Saddam Hussein, whose name begins with an H like Hitler, and whose name sounds insane like someone who's insane, is definitely cursing Israel.

1059
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:39,860
And so we have, uh, what we call an obligation to hell.

1060
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:44,220
It sounds like, uh, you know, in those cities of the plain, uh, Sodom and Gomorrah.

1061
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:51,920
We have decided to send a good percentage of the money that you send at that toll-free number at the bottom of your screen.

1062
00:51:52,040 --> 00:52:03,600
And you will just pledge that money immediately, because, see, friends, the anti-times are coming, and the anti-Christ that is Satan, as personified by Sodom and Zed in the book of Revelation, is here.

1063
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:09,300
And contrary to what most people think, Satan just is not going to wear a little red outfit.

1064
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,220
that he's not going to be carrying a fish for.

1065
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,260
He's going to look like a real person,

1066
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,720
perhaps someone you know and trust.

1067
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,080
Maybe even a televangelist

1068
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,980
who's always on the verge of constant laughter.

1069
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,060
So please, send those pledges now.

1070
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,100
You haven't seen any suspicious people

1071
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,720
hanging around lately, have you?

1072
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:32,340
Well, if you have, it might be the boy from below.

1073
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,260
The man from the basement.

1074
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,200
I mean, the sub-basement.

1075
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,140
Oh, that's right.

1076
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:40,640
They have been seen to crawl out at these times and days,

1077
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,680
and sometimes at the end of times.

1078
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,160
Some call them gremlins,

1079
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,360
others call them little devils,

1080
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,760
but we know them as anti-bots.

1081
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,840
Let's see what's on the radio, huh?

1082
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,340
Uh, yeah, let's see if...

1083
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,640
Those guys aren't doing that funny show.

1084
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,360
Is that supposed to be some kind of a joke?

1085
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:58,940
There's no fun in being funny anymore.

1086
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,120
Things are too serious.

1087
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,420
As we stand here on the brink of nuclear Armageddon,

1088
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,140
how can even someone think about it?

1089
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,000
Yeah, and Armageddon's sick of it anyway.

1090
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,320
Why don't they just drop it and get it over with?

1091
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,840
In my book,

1092
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:14,940
One American Life is worth all the lives in all of Iraq.

1093
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,120
I urge that we use the atomic option

1094
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,840
if it can be used efficiently,

1095
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,400
and I urge that we do so now.

1096
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,740
My constituents agree with me wholeheartedly

1097
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,480
so we can achieve a severe and lasting glassy surface

1098
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,020
on former Baghdad.

1099
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,280
Hello, caller.

1100
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,160
How is it?

1101
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,000
Hi.

1102
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,200
Hi.

1103
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:36,880
I'm calling from the...

1104
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,920
Oh, my God.

1105
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,300
Oh, you guys all want just seven...

1106
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,220
Second prize.

1107
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,260
Dopey callers.

1108
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:43,600
Prize?

1109
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:44,520
Yeah.

1110
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,700
Do you even have to answer the riddle?

1111
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,380
I don't want to hear that.

1112
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:47,940
Hey, uh...

1113
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,140
Hey, what does Saddam Hussein and his father have in common?

1114
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:54,160
Neither knew enough to pull out in time.

1115
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,300
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1116
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:55,880
Brr.

1117
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,560
Hey, uh, why does it cost only half the usual amount

1118
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,020
to train an Iraqi pilot?

1119
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,840
Because he only has to be taught to take off.

1120
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1121
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:05,720
Brr.

1122
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,160
Brr.

1123
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:06,400
Brr.

1124
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:06,780
Brr.

1125
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:07,280
Brr.

1126
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,580
Oh, yes.

1127
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,620
And, uh...

1128
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,540
Hey, uh, what do Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Baghdad have in common?

1129
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,580
Nothing yet.

1130
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,100
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1131
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:18,600
What?

1132
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,220
What?

1133
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,360
What?

1134
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,460
What is Israel's new national anthem?

1135
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,680
Onward, Christian soldiers!

1136
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,800
Okay, here we go.

1137
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,080
Here we go.

1138
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:35,480
From the block.

1139
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,860
Now, you won't see any...

1140
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:37,120
You won't see any...

1141
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:37,120


1142
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,900
B61's used either. That's a nuclear bomb.

1143
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,700
Careful, that B61 is flying around your head.

1144
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,900
I think you want some of that stuff.

1145
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:46,260
Daniel logged in a lot of time around that log cabin.

1146
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,580
Now the M46 torpedoes are fired.

1147
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,840
But we're going to deny that the log cabin has anything to do with our response.

1148
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,040
We're going to deny linkage to those Lincoln logs

1149
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,840
and those things that are linked together

1150
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,040
in the tumultuous tapestry of the Middle Eastern situation.

1151
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:06,100
You know, recent history has shown that the frontier actually existed in America.

1152
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,620
Oh, man.

1153
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,080
Oh, man.

1154
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:17,760
And, friends, you too can achieve achievingness

1155
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,700
by writing for the free information available from the Church of the Subgenius,

00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:35,000

1160
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:56,040
You hear about the newest Iraqi bumper sticker?

1161
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:59,440
If you can read this, Allah will pluck your eyes out.

1162
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:36,780
You hear about the newest Iraqi bumper sticker?

1163

Thank you.
