The subgenius.

22
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,260
Power of the one.

23
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,920
Power of the one.

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,800
I hope she can rest now, but she's dangerously near to mental collapse herself.

25
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,880
Definitely am.

26
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,640
Oh, I think so.

27
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,020
Good heavens, what's that?

28
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,700
And man.

29
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,180
Superior to the creatures only in his cunning.

30
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,760
Except for sub-man, seen here.

31
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,660
Who is superior only in his slack.

32
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,880
Stone jungle.

33
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,540
Yes, a man-made jungle.

34
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,880
Natives live there?

35
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,160
Yes, they live and they work there.

36
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,460
Why?

37
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,440
Order.

38
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,380
Help them to concentrate their efforts, get things done in a hurry, save time.

39
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,740
Save time? Why?

40
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,660
Darling, you're asking me a question all the sages haven't been able to answer.

41
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,240
As the 21st century began, human evolution was at a turning point.

42
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,920
Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fastest reproduced in creation,

43
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:53,920


44
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:53,920


45
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,360
was a process that favored the noblest traits of man.

46
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,300
And so, the most advanced of the most advanced, the most advanced of the most advanced,

47
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:00,300


48
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,280
now began to favor different traits.

49
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,460
Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent.

50
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,360
But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction.

51
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,840
A dumbing down.

52
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,940
How did this happen?

53
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,460
Evolution does not necessarily reward intelligence.

54
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:28,200
With no natural predators to thin the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most

55
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,560
and left the intelligent to become an endangered species.

56
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,660
I'm sure it's only a glitch.

57
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,180
A temporary setback.

58
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,200
You call this a glitch?

59
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,440
Oh, oh.

60
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,240
Hello, Angela.

61
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,880
Three pound, please.

62
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,980
No can do.

63
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,120
It just turns me on.

64
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,400
God, you girls are so great.

65
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,660
I mean, I just, I love to be with intelligent women.

66
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,580
Smart is so sexy.

67
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,020
I know.

68
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,400
Sometimes I could just think of something, and he could just get me.

69
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,320
So horny.

70
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,840
Yeah, well, a mind is a terrible thing to waste.

71
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,000
I get bored so easily.

72
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,120
Yep.

73
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,440
And you need lots of stimulation, Bobby.

74
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,860
Bob.

75
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,440
What?

76
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,500
Bob, save some for me.

77
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,420
Don't worry.

78
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,580
Present the unit, please.

79
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,820
Pleasure Unit 736.

80
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,340
It's, uh, uh, 7...

81
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,400
Unit 736 is welcome here.

82
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,480
Enter 736 and go to the first roving room.

83
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:49,820
I'm going to the first one.

84
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,020
What?

85
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,160
Oh.

86
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,160


87
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,520
You don't know the rules?

88
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,300
No.

89
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,300
I don't know.

90
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:58,800
Oh.

91
00:05:59,680 --> 00:05:59,700
Oh.

92
00:05:59,720 --> 00:05:59,740
Oh.

93
00:05:59,760 --> 00:05:59,780
No.

94
00:05:59,800 --> 00:05:59,820
Oh.

95
00:05:59,840 --> 00:05:59,860
Oh.

96
00:05:59,880 --> 00:05:59,900
Oh.

97
00:05:59,920 --> 00:05:59,940
Oh.

98
00:05:59,960 --> 00:05:59,980
Oh.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,020
Oh.

100
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,060
Oh.

101
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,100
Oh.

102
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,140
Oh.

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,180
Oh.

104
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,220
Oh.

105
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,080
Oh.

106
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:05,540
Oh.

107
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,480
Oh.

108
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,240
Oh.

109
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,520
Do the sexy bob now.

110
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,640
Oh, yeah.

111
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,640
Do the sexy bob.

112
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,200
Come on, JoJo.

113
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,500
Do the sexy bob.

114
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,660
Get groovy.

115
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,220
Get slap.

116
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,920
Do the sexy bob.

117
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,640
Come on, JoJo.

118
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,480
Bunk it now.

119
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,420
Do the sexy bob now.

120
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,400
Do the sexy bob now.

121
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,460
Yes, it's a little known fact that Bob Dobbs is actually a sex god.

122
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:54,760
A sex idol for millions of people all around the planet and throughout the universe.

123
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,780
He listens to music that sound like this.

124
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,260
This sort of music gives Bob the virility and the stamina that it takes to live up

125
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,380
to being a sex god.

126
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,260
A sex god.

127
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,540
Let's listen to a little more and see what it does for you.

128
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,700
This abrupt change in tempo is important and crucial to this particular style of music

129
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,220
and its unique effect.

130
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,360
Well, I'm afraid that's all we can give you of that kind of music because Bob Dobbs is

131
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,960
just not good for untrained human minds to hear too much of that sort of stuff because

132
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,800
it's too darn powerful, as Bob says.

133
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:53,840
So, back to another portion of another listening sequence of another time and day in somewhere

134
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,060
else, USA.

135
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,160
Bob and Connie really enjoy life.

136
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,200
Bob, can't you see me?

137
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,980
Can't you see me smiling?

138
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,340
Bob, can't you see me smiling?

139
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,400
Can't you hear me?

140
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,920
Can't you hear the madness?

141
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,940
Bob, can't you see me?

142
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,360
Can't you hear me?

143
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,960
Bob, can't you take me?

144
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,600
Fill a box of money?

145
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,440
Bob, where's the money?

146
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,460
Bob, where's the money?

147
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,020
Beach party?

148
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,480
It's not a beach party.

149
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,160
It's a subgenius beach party.

150
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,840
Subgenius beach party.

151
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,320
Subgenius beach party.

152
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,340
Where can I play my section?

153
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,120
Subgenius beach party.

154
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,980
Subgenius beach party.

155
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,840
Subgenius beach party.

156
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,360
Subgenius beach party.

157
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,160
Subgenius beach party.

158
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,020
Subgenius beach party.

159
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,900
Subgenius beach party.

160
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:54,920


161
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,820
Subgenius beach party.

162
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,540
Subgenius beach party.

163
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,120
Subgenius beach party.

164
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,260
Subgenius beach party.

165
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,640
Subgenius beach party.

166
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,000
Subgenius beach party.

167
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,520
Subgenius beach party.

168
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,380
Subgenius beach party.

169
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,440
Subgenius beach party.

170
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,960
Uh, Doctors?

171
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,320
Uh, Dr. Fred?

172
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,320


173
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,000
Bob, but here's Bob

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,640
himself. Random bird.

175
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,720
Straight belief. Well, not that.

176
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,680
Here's Bob.

177
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,180
It's the expression

178
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,080
on their little faces

179
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,780
I like. Yeah.

180
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,140
A sort of cross between fear

181
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,120
and awe. They don't know whether

182
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,660
to laugh, cry, or wet their pants.

183
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,660
Yeah.

184
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,740
Now that is what I call

185
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,600
belief.

186
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,220
Things looked bleak for

187
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,180
Joe, but they were even worse for

188
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,180
mankind. As Joe and Rita

189
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,180
lay dormant, the years passed

190
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,080
and mankind became

191
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,120
stupider at a frightening

192
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,620
rate.

193
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,900
Some

194
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,860
had high hopes that genetic

195
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,960
engineering would correct this trend

196
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,120
in evolution. But sadly,

197
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,260
the greatest minds and resources

198
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,000
were focused on conquering

199
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,160
hair loss and prolonging

200
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,140
erections.

201
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,020
Meanwhile,

202
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,060
the population exploded

203
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,900
and intelligence continued

204
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,020
to decline until humanity

205
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,060
was incapable of solving even

206
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,460
its most basic problems,

207
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,880
like garbage, which had been

208
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,000
stacked for centuries with no plan

209
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
whatsoever, leading to the

210
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,680
great garbage avalanche of

211
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,480
2,505.

212
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,380
I'd buy that for a dollar.

213
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,040
Please put down your weapon.

214
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,860
You have 20 seconds

215
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,560
to comply.

216
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,620
Yes, Bob.

217
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:40,880
Yes, sir, Bob.

218
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,180
I think you'd better do what he says, Mr. Kenny.

219
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,680
Okay.

220
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,600
It's down.

221
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,300
I threw it down.

222
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,000
Bob.

223
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,160
Bob.

224
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,040
You now have 15 seconds to comply.

225
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,780
Bob, I dropped the...

226
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,780
Direct violation of

227
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,620
I dropped the weapon.

228
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,960
Section 9.

229
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,740
You now have five seconds to comply.

230
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,100
I dropped the record, Bob.

231
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,220
I put the record down, Bob.

232
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,700
...authorizing the physical force.

233
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,800
No, Bob!

234
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,440
No!

235
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,340
No!

236
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:10,940
No!

237
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:11,520
No!

238
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,100
Say, why does that eagle attack me?

239
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,780
He's been trained to recognize

240
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,020
and attack Americans.

241
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,100
The anti-American eagle.

242
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,000
It's diabolical.

243
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,840
I'd just like to ask,

244
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,000
purely out of academic interest,

245
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,240
you were sure I was going to survive,

246
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,800
were you?

247
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,840
I was quite confident.

248
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:36,960
I was quite confident.

249
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,480
I was quite confident.

250
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:38,480


251
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,680
Now, tell me...

252
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,980
What would have happened if you hadn't saved him?

253
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,520
Yes.

254
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,560
The sun would not have risen.

255
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,880
The sun would not have risen.

256
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,960
Then what would have happened?

257
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,040
A mere ball of flaming gas would have illuminated the world.

258
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,800
All right, I'm not stupid.

259
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,420
You're saying that humans need fantasies to make life bearable.

260
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,000
No.

261
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,740
Humans need fantasy to be...

262
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,220
human.

263
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,200
To be the place where the falling angel meets the rising ape.

264
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,400
With tooth fairies,

265
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,840
hog fathers.

266
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,100
Yes.

267
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,780
As practice, you have to start out learning to believe the little lies.

268
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,180
So we can believe the big ones?

269
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,480
Yes.

270
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,900
Justice, mercy, duty, that sort of thing.

271
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,620
They're not the same at all.

272
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,880
You think so?

273
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,720
Then take the universe and the universe.

274
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,900
And grind it down to the finest powder.

275
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,660
And sieve it through the finest sieve.

276
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,980
And then show me one atom of justice.

277
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
One molecule of mercy.

278
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,940
And yet...

279
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,000
You try to act as if there is some ideal order in the world.

280
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,600
As if there is some...

281
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,820
Some rightness in the universe by which it may be judged.

282
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,700
But people have got to believe that.

283
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,760
What's the point?

284
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,720
You need to believe in things that aren't true.

285
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,240
How else can they become?

286
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Praise Bob.

287
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,860
And praise Slack, my friends.

288
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,100
How else...

289
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,900
Don't, Mr. Flint!

290
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,760
You will destroy the potential of all of mankind.

291
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,560
Organized for good.

292
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,360
Not for my good, Dr. Wolf.

293
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,960
Mr. Flint!

294
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,120
It would mean an end for all time to poverty, disease, doubt and frustration.

295
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,860
Mr. Flint, we have the power to do away with excessive heat and cold.

296
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,360
To turn wastelands into gardens of Eden.

297
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,860
All I have to do is take a bite of your apple, gentlemen.

298
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,260
No thanks.

299
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,800
No, Mr. Flint!

300
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,560
Mr. Flint!

301
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,400
Mr. Flint!

302
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:56,580
No!

303
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,620
Ours would be a perfect world.

304
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,380
Why?

305
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,340
Because it's your idea of perfection, gentlemen, not mine.

306
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,180
You give away everything for us today.

307
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:09,600
Tampa, boo us to rot!

308
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,460
Good work, by mytons.

309
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:12,740
Let's send back the only man who made it to the bottom.

310
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:12,740


311
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:12,740


312
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:12,740


313
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:12,740


314
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:12,740


315
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,700
Slack Estrea, with the demo!

316
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,120
The baby boomers.

317
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,780
They did their best...

318
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:25,240
And they sold out like the rest to the man elimin JI HE.

319
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,600
They sold out to the man.

320
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,340
To the man.

321
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,880
Because there's a boot stomping on your face forever

322
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,320
Because there is a boot stomping on your face forever

323
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,880
And if you try to defeat the man

324
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,840
He will beat you, he will beat you at your own game

325
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,320
Minimum wage is going up

326
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,700
So now that you can fill it up

327
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,920
Go to work, go to work

328
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:25,800
You will get beat down by your boss at your job

329
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,740
Because there is a boot stomping on your face forever

330
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,320
Because there is a big boot stomping on your face forever

331
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:44,900
And if you try to defeat the man

332
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,860
He will beat you, he will beat you at your own game

333
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,880
Because there is a boot stomping on your face forever

334
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,020
And if you try to defeat the man

335
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:03,760
He will beat you, he will beat you at your own game

336
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,940
Because there is a...

337
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,320
Oh, my marks

338
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,620
It stomps, it stomps on your face, it stomps hard.

339
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,320
It's ultimately determined by its material forces of production.

340
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,300
You're a slave to the man.

341
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:42,440
The baby boomers sold us out, and now that we must do without a career, a career, we

342
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,700
will get beat down by our boss.

343
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:53,280
Because there is a boot stomping up and down upon your face.

344
00:16:53,300 --> 00:17:00,220
Because there is a big boot stomping up and down upon your face.

345
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:13,880
And if you try to defeat the man, he will beat you, he will beat you at your own game.

346
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,760
Because there is a boot stomping up and down upon your face.

347
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,280
Because there is a big boot stomping up and down upon your face.

348
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,720
Friends, that was sent to us by the Slackestra.

349
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,560
I wish I could tell you more about them.

350
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,580
But now, the normal news.

351
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,860
From PR News in Washington, I'm sifting through the rubble of PR News.

352
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,380
Has Republicans turned violent early this morning?

353
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,920
Police in Connecticut say the new Congress tried to rob customers.

354
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,360
Representative John Boehner of Ohio wreaked havoc in parts of the northeastern U.S.

355
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,120
Survivors were killed when Governor Mike Easley tore through a mobile home community.

356
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,380
They were apparently angry that President Bush is to ban women from public places.

357
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,980
President Bush is experiencing tremendous growth.

358
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,620
Mr. Bush wants to expand.

359
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,640
The government now says it can legally ban women in public places.

360
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,780
The cabinet said it was crashing.

361
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,820
People with helmets with scarves that cover PR News in The Hague.

362
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,520
PR News.

363
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:23,900
PR.

364
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,440
This is PR News.

365
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:25,880
PR.

366
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,220
Figures from Wall Street.

367
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,820
One, one, two, three, three, four, four, nine, nine.

368
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,000
Hundreds of people had to be rescued from PR News in Washington.

369
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:43,400
More fighting in the Mexican crisis today when American troops participated in a joint raid with Mexican nationals against rebel rocket positions in Acapulco.

370
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,720
Now this.

371
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,960
Red alert.

372
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,260
Red alert.

373
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,520
Red alert.

374
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,900
You crossed the border.

375
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,060
That's my line of debt.

376
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,860
You haven't dismantled your MX stockpile.

377
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,780
Pakistan is threatening my border.

378
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,860
That's it, buster.

379
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,500
No more military aid.

380
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,380
Nuke them.

381
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,340
Get them before they get you.

382
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,140
Another quality home game from Butler Brothers.

383
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:17,220
This is a Bulldada news update because the world of the normals is just Bulldada.

384
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,060
That is correct, dear friends.

385
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,460
Yes, yes, yes.

386
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,020
We're back.

387
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,820
This is the first live show we've done in quite some time.

388
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,620
I fear.

389
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,120
And there is fear in the land.

390
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,060
But not too much here where we are.

391
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,900
Except for the fact that we had planned a live show.

392
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,500
A live show with lonesome cowboy Dave.

393
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,500
But it's like three degrees outside.

394
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,320
And there is no Dave coming here.

395
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,800
So we told him to call in.

396
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,920
But the phones aren't working tonight.

397
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,180
No one can call in.

398
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,960
We've been told by Tommy Fox at the management.

399
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,480
The management friends.

400
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,600
He said that something broke.

401
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,900
Something broke.

402
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,460
Something broken.

403
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,240
Something new.

404
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,420
Something new.

405
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:19,420


406
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,340
Something borrowed.

407
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,320
Something true.

408
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,920
And Dave can't call in.

409
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,200
But Princess We can.

410
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,820
And then there's the false things also, you know.

411
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,780
And we really can do the subgenius news.

412
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,720
There's quite a bit of news to catch up on.

413
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,120
But first I should tell you what I've been playing.

414
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,440
First I'll tell you what I am playing.

415
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,480
What's in the background.

416
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,700
This background music is by lonesome cowboy Dave.

417
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,120
We'll just have to let that fill in.

418
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:45,800
But.

419
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,820
I think.

420
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,160
Just John did the titles for the bulldog news update.

421
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,800
We've been listening to a lot of movie clips that I pulled myself.

422
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,500
I've been watching a lot of movies and pulling audio.

423
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,080
Ripping the audio out of it.

424
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,180
You might say our man Flint with it.

425
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,960
The perfect world was represented.

426
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,020
Robocop.

427
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,980
I'm sure many of you recognized Tarzan's New York Adventure.

428
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,180
God, man.

429
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,320
I watched several of those Tarzan movies.

430
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,340
I watched a lot of movies on the intro webs.

431
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:27,980
And I can see why they kind of quit showing those Johnny Waz Muller Tarzan movies.

432
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,660
They're sizzling.

433
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,420
TV.

434
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,360
Well, there's the sexy aspect.

435
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,420
But then there's an insulting aspect that I'd rather not go into right now.

436
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,220
Makes fun of chimpanzees for one thing.

437
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,740
Anyway.

438
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,680
That song.

439
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,860
Baby Boomers was sent to us by someone called Slack.

440
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,300
S.A.

441
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,620
Stra.

442
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,060
Oh, we heard a little bit of clips from the movie Hogwatch.

443
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:59,300
A British production of a Terry Pratchett Christmas show starring Death and Bob.

444
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,620
Oh, there's a couple of Bob songs there from Glass Madness.

445
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,980
From the 1981 subgenius album Bob Songs 1.

446
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,900
Glass Madness and also some Doctors for Bob.

447
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,820
Some soundtrack from Idiocracy.

448
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,540
That's a really funny movie.

449
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:18,940
That.

450
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,120
Apparently Fox.

451
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,820
When it was first made by Mike Judge about a year ago.

452
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,380
Fox thought it was a little too close to reality.

453
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,880
And said, well, let's show it in seven cities for a week and then close it down.

454
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,060
Nobody's going to want to watch this.

455
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,420
And.

456
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,300
But it like his previous movie Office Space.

457
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,940
I think that we'll find people quoting Idiocracy.

458
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,420
And actually they're already living Idiocracy.

459
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,640
So what's the point of quoting it?

460
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,060
And thanks also to Maynard Brainard for some intro clips.

461
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:01,060
And of course, Fernanda Nettily Murr and Nora Preff will be coming up when I run out of news to tell you.

462
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,660
You may not have read this in the conspiracy news.

463
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:17,800
But Robert Anton Wilson, the great writer, died on January 11th of this year.

464
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,920
That may be old news.

465
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,640
To some of you.

466
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,120
But I've been surprised how many people read it for the first time on subgenius.com.

467
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:32,500
Robert Anton Wilson was a writer of everything from philosophy to sci-fi and humor books.

468
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,140
He wrote the Illuminatus trilogy with Robert Shea.

469
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,300
Which is why we are right where we are sitting now.

470
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,400
And his death was expected.

471
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,900
He was suffering from remorse.

472
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,860
Nude polio.

473
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,820
He had beat childhood polio.

474
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,000
But it came back.

475
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,580
And anyway, he has joined Bob on the saucers.

476
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,040
Although Bob is still alive.

477
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,360
In the realm that those guys party on, you can hardly tell which it might be.

478
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,380
We also had, well, we had some good news and then some bad news about Reverend Magdalene.

479
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:18,900
To refresh your memory, Reverend Magdalene had her child taken away from her by a court in small town.

480
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,120
New York State.

481
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,700
Because she is a subgenius, essentially.

482
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:29,020
Her husband, or ex-husband, had sued for child support.

483
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:39,400
And won on the basis that this judge suddenly decided that the Church of the Subgenius was a bad religion that a child shouldn't be raised in.

484
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:47,920
Well, in January, the new judge, after the first one, got too much bad PR for religious persecution.

485
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,280
And said, it's the Church of the Subgenius.

486
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,980
Then, a new judge came and heard the stuff.

487
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:02,920
And six months later, announced that it's true, the Church of the Subgenius, it really is just art.

488
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,180
But it's bad art.

489
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,380
And bad for a child.

490
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:11,840
And so, but nonetheless, the mom could have custody, half custody of the kid again.

491
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,640
But, just when we were putting on our party hats, we started to feel stupid.

492
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,640
Because, uh, the...

493
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:24,900
The other party's lawyers put out a stay.

494
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,140
And now the way it sits, the child is still stuck with his human father.

495
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,500
And separated from his subgenius mom.

496
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,160
Until an appellate court hears it at their first chance, five months from now, in May.

497
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:48,500
The good news is, when five judges who aren't from that small town hear what happened, there's not a bad chance that...

498
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,360
She might get full custody, we'll see.

499
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,260
Hold her breath.

500
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,780
Friends, it's interesting.

501
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,640
It's kind of like hearing about the Salem witch hunts.

502
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,880
In just the wrong place and time.

503
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,860
Of modern America.

504
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,300
What other news in subgenius land?

505
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,820
An old book, a subgenius book that's been out of print for a long time, is back in print.

506
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,280
Yay!

507
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,300
Revelation X.

508
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,860
The, uh, uh, Bobapacra phone.

509
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,500
Not to be confused with the new book, Subgenius, uh, Cyclepedia of Slack, the Boblyagraphon.

510
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,140
Uh, actually I get it kind of mixed up myself.

511
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,360
Anyway, Revelation X is out again.

512
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:37,720
It is possible that I might someday make a dime from saying that on the air.

513
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,720
I just want to make you sure you know that.

514
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,040
It is a subgenius book.

515
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,780
But it's nice to see that back in stores.

516
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,560
Actually, some real scary stuff happened with that.

517
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,720
Our, we got this new publisher.

518
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:48,980
Right?

519
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,960
Thunder's Mouth Press.

520
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,860
We got a new editor.

521
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:58,580
Well, right after Bob, uh, he, right after he bought our two books, and Bob told him to repent, quit his job, and slack off,

522
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,440
this editor did what Bob said and quit his job.

523
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,420
Leaving us terrified that we wouldn't have a friendly editor there anymore.

524
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:10,620
Uh, luckily he was replaced by somebody who was an old friend of our first late editor.

525
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,600
Tim, the great site Tim McGinnis.

526
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:18,700
Anyway, then the next bad news was that the distributor of almost all small print books,

527
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:18,700


528
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,940
press books, in other words, everything that's not coming from the big conglomerates like

529
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,720
Time Warner, Viacom, and so forth, went bankrupt.

530
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,780
That was our distributor.

531
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,940
Went bankrupt.

532
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,980
The good news is, uh, our book publishing company was bought by another book publishing

533
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,920
company that is its own distributor.

534
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,960
And so, you see friends, little by little, the conspiracy really honestly is, I've been

535
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,340
watching this happen my whole showbiz life.

536
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:48,700
And I'm not going to lie.

537
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:48,700


538
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,500
They've been carving away at every small distributor and small publisher and small

539
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:00,140
radio station and small anything so that they can Walmart the whole world.

540
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:06,780
90% is not enough for the conspiracy because then there's a chance that Bob might win.

541
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,580
No, sir.

542
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,860
They've got to have it all.

543
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,720
In the end, there can be only one.

544
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,740
In the end, that's what they say.

545
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:17,500
And we say in the end there can be only umpteen billion.

546
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,860
How's that?

547
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:28,220
Um, next, this weekend coming up, uh, Winterstar, uh, the ACE, ACE here in Cleveland, Association

548
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:34,160
of Consciousness Exploration, Association for Consciousness Exploration, I should say.

549
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:42,420
ACE is, uh, doing Winterstar, which is, if you're interested in consciousness-ness-ness-ness-ness,

550
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,860
then that might be fun to check out.

551
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,320
It's the best.

552
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,300
It's the perfect midwinter getaway.

553
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:57,960
Uh, there's, uh, information about that if you need it on subgenius.com or roseandcomet.com.

554
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:05,060
I just finished a new DVD of, uh, Tripadelica, Psychedelio, Groovalicious, Droopy, Colory,

555
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,820
Mixy video for that specific festival.

556
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:14,780
Sort of like a Grateful Dead light show, but, uh, actually with a lot more variety.

557
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,620
Mm-hmm.

558
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,000
Uh, uh, Tex Day is coming up.

559
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,980
Not X Day.

560
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,980
That is also coming up July 5th.

561
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,680
The world ends this year, July 5th, into the 10th X Day, uh, Waitation, I guess you might

562
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:28,940
say.

563
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,900
But before that, there's a little rehearsal outside of Austin, Texas, Texas at Dragon's

564
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,220
Wild Ranch, the weekend of May 5th, called Tex Day.

565
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,920
Uh, and, uh, so forth and so on.

566
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,460
Friends, what other news do we have here?

567
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,600
Robert Antleman?

568
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
Sam Wilson died, right?

569
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,660
He's still partying, you know that.

570
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,720
Uh, Revelation X is out.

571
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:59,880
Reverend Magdalene still has no child because she joined the wrong, um, funny church.

572
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:06,200
I guess it's OK to raise a kid in the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster or other ridiculous

573
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,900
churches, such as the Church of Jesus Christ, for instance, but if it's the Church of Bob

574
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,880
Dobbs, uh, uh.

575
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,560
It might, somebody might.

576
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,460
some kid might accidentally see a picture of Bob.

577
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,680
And you know what Bob looks like?

578
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,740
He looks like a smiling man.

579
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,300
God forbid that a child be raised in a religion

580
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,220
that focuses on an image of a smiling man

581
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,720
rather than a religion that, for instance,

582
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,380
might focus on a dying man of some kind.

583
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,560
But, you know, Bob ain't going to die for your sins.

584
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,640
We've said that a million, billion, hundred trillion times.

585
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,580
He does, however, bring an excuse for your sins

586
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:52,100
and an excuse for why you should expect everything

587
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:57,480
to be just and right and true and fair for you.

588
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,980
I've decided, friends, for a while now,

589
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,740
we've been saying, oh, it's not fair,

590
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,060
but that's just the way of life.

591
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,820
Well, I've decided, why should that be?

592
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,840
Are we always going to put up with the world being imperfect?

593
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,620
Well, it's not.

594
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


595
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


596
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


597
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,320
Yeah, that's slack.

598
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,620
But think about it.

599
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,640
Washing the dishes.

600
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,640
Why do we have to do it every day?

601
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,680
Just because we mess them up every day?

602
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,200
Yeah, I know.

603
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,440
There's some logical reason.

604
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,220
Picking our noses.

605
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,280
Why do the boogs build up

606
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,660
even after we've gone to so much trouble

607
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,960
to clean our nice noses with Kleenexes and so forth?

608
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,520
This is the list of injustices and unfairnesses.

609
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,820
Why must we do anything we don't want to do?

610
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,980
And I'm sure you'll have a million answers for that.

611
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,440
Many good answers.

612
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,920
But I'm not interested in those.

613
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,380
I'm interested in the world 10 billion years from now.

614
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,180
I might not live to see that day 10 billion years from now.

615
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,780
There might not even be people to accomplish this.

616
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,440
But friends, sooner or later, sooner or later,

617
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,700
why can we not have that perfect world of utter slack

618
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,620
where you can eat as much ice cream?

619
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,040
As you want without worry of fatness?

620
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,880
You know what I'm saying?

621
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:20,840
No, I'm saying.

622
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,540
No, I'm saying.

623
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,040
No, I'm saying.

624
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,480
No, I'm saying.

625
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,840
No, I'm saying.

626
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,640
How come we can't have Halloween every day, my friends?

627
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,700
Halloween where we can wear...

628
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,140
Where we don't have to wear that mask.

629
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,960
Halloween is the one day the subgeniuses can take off their masks

630
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,280
and the normals have to put one on.

631
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,140
But why can't every day be Halloween for us?

632
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:42,480
Yeah.

633
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:42,960
But fine.

634
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,720
Well, you can say, well, why are you worried, Reverend Stang?

635
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,300
Bob prophesied that the world ends July 5th this year,

636
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,040
or some year, sometime.

637
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,240
Maybe it's July 5th, if we really knew what days these were

638
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,080
and what calendars we're working from.

639
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:03,140
But I'm just saying, just in case,

640
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:09,160
we should start working towards the erasure of everything inconvenient now.

641
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,280
And we don't have to work real hard at it

642
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,940
because that would itself be rather...

643
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,040
Very inconvenient, don't you think?

644
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:14,540
Yes.

645
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,460
And...

646
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:16,980
Rather.

647
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
I'm feeling more convenient

648
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,280
because I finished teaching the history of the Church of the Subgenius

649
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,580
the first 100 years.

650
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,020
That took a lot out of me.

651
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:32,020
And caused us to play reruns from the 80s for a long time.

652
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,360
Only the Cleveland audience missed those.

653
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,780
And what else did my notes say here?

654
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,880
We've got...

655
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:40,980
Hal.

656
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,060
Oh, Hal's book.

657
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,780
Dr. Hal.

658
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,360
Robbins has a book out.

659
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,600
Robbins, by the way, is spelled with one B.

660
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,280
And it's an ABC of dinosaurs.

661
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,300
I don't know if that is the actual title.

662
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,760
I'll bring it next week or some week and we'll read poems from it.

663
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,180
Because there's poems about dinosaurs written by Hal

664
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,240
and color illustrations,

665
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:09,160
which is really the main point of any dinosaur book by Dr. Hal.

666
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,120
The Hal fans should know about that.

667
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,480
Just...

668
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,860
If you're interested in that,

669
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,760
look up Hal Robbins

670
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,340
or askdrhal.com.

671
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,620
That's askdrhal.com.

672
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,280
One word.

673
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,920
I'm sure everything is on there.

674
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,140
Oh, and the final news.

675
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,580
We'll give you a little preview of this.

676
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,820
The Amino Acids have a new album coming out.

677
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,620
It's not out yet.

678
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,400
It'll be out in June.

679
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,320
It's called...

680
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,540
Humanity Will Fall Like Pins.

681
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,140
Now, you have to say it in that sort of...

682
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,120
crazy person way.

683
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,080
Humanity will fall like pins.

684
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,240
I was providing contrast, dear.

685
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,220
Oh, that's fine.

686
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,820
Anyway, it's...

687
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,560
Thank you, Princess.

688
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,160
It is the...

689
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,180
Well, it's said in the same way as that old Warner Brothers cartoon guy

690
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,940
that would say,

691
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,340
No one will ever know.

692
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,640
And anyway, I'm going to play...

693
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,520
a cut here

694
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,300
from Humanity Will Fall Like Pins.

695
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,580
I believe this is cut eight.

696
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,100
Gamma Ray Harryhausen.

697
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,960
guitar solo

698
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,960
guitar solo

699
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,900
guitar solo

700
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,080
guitar solo

701
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:36,180
guitar solo

702
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:36,820
guitar solo

703
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,020
guitar solo

704
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,240
guitar solo

705
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,440
guitar solo

706
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:38,440


707
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:38,440


708
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:38,440


709
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,480
Oh, yes, baby!

710
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,300
How to Start Controlling Others

711
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,680
and Stop Caring for Yourself

715
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,000
Your problem? You've lost sight

716
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,720
of your own life, and you may

717
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,500
find yourself no more.

718
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,540
Mental. I needed help.

719
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,400
I sat down for four months

720
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,640
to help me support myself while I wrote

721
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,660
No More. What do I put in it?

722
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,880
The Persian Gulf War, the breakdown of

723
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,420
communism in the Soviet Union,

724
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,140
and the Hill-Thomas hearings.

725
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,660
I can't remember the name. Based on shame,

726
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,280
fear, guilt, and dishonesty.

727
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,600
Issues and problems.

728
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,440
Handcuffs. Owning my power.

729
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,300
I wanted to go deeper and get high.

730
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,820
Soon, I subscribed to two

731
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,780
popular beliefs.

732
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,860
I stopped thinking. I didn't know how it had

733
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,880
happened. I didn't know what had

734
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,520
happened. I thought I was going crazy.

735
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,240
My life started working again.

736
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,700
Just taking up the slack.

737
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,400
Understanding and information.

738
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,700
Slack can be

739
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,100
profound.

740
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,840
A message from the President of the

741
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,820
United States, George W.

742
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,700
Terror. Good morning. This weekend

743
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,940
we commemorate Bob Day.

744
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,900
Today when America honors every man and woman

745
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,480
who has worn the uniform of Bob.

746
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,780
People who stepped forward to serve a

747
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,140
cause larger than themselves.

748
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,000
One freedom that defines our way of life

749
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,840
is the freedom to choose our leaders at the

750
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,820
ballot box. We saw that

751
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,780
freedom earlier this week when millions

752
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,760
of Americans went to the polls to cast

753
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,760
their votes for Bob. But one thing

754
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,700
has not changed. Do not confuse

755
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,840
the workings of American democracy with

756
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,200
a lack of American democracy.

757
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,620
I look forward to listening to ideas

758
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,820
from Bob. Bob is a proven leader who

759
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,760
has served six presidents, four Republicans

760
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,900
and two Democrats. And he has shown

761
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,740
that he is an agent of change. Bob

762
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,960
replaces six presidents, four Republicans

763
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,860
and two Democrats. America is

764
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,740
safer and the world is more secure because

765
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,960
of the leadership of Bob. And I am

766
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,500
deeply grateful for his service.

767
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,680
Clear. Clear. And I pledge to

768
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,940
party.

769
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,360
Hello, man.

770
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,100
And now...

771
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,300
And now I find myself in

772
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,740
Indianapolis, Indiana.

773
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,420
I return to

774
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,760
my home. Hey!

775
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,280
A beautiful time to return home.

776
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,220
Who are you, mister? My old hammock

777
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,040
is there. So?

778
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,320
Here. My old pipe.

779
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,420
I haven't smoked it in

780
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,820
years. Mary didn't like it.

781
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,880
But now she's gone.

782
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,680
What do you want in my kitchen?

783
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,560
Do the pipe.

784
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,120
Now I'll have time.

785
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,480
Now I'll have lots of time.

786
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,240
Time to smoke and smoke

787
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,560
and smoke and rest.

788
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,100
My hammock.

789
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,480
Light the pipe.

790
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,960
So nice.

791
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,900
Ah, relax.

792
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,340
I've got all

793
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,280
the time in the world. The rest

794
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,020
of my life.

795
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,160
The birds. Yeah? How red

796
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,280
the sky. How soft those clouds.

797
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,320
So lovely. So lovely.

798
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,220
By the authority vested in me by

799
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,520
the state of California,

800
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,060
I pronounce this man Bob.

801
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,280
Whoa. Whoa.

802
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,320
Good.

803
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,900
They're good.

804
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,120
You fool.

805
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,200
You idiot. You fool.

806
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,140
You idiot. No. Don't.

807
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,240
Don't.

808
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,240
The secret of X-Day.

809
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,300
The secret of

810
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,280
X-Day. Am

811
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,160
I evil? I, I

812
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,240
don't know, my son. All my life

813
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,120
I've been a little man. Happy little

814
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,180
fella. But in the

815
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,800
dressing room. I, uh,

816
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,320
I don't understand. Did you ever hear of X-Day?

817
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,160
No. You mean

818
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,340
yes, yes, a chance to

819
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,760
grow to normal size.

820
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,300
Please, please, please let him

821
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,440
do it. Just what does this X-Day

822
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,200
look like?

823
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,000
Uh, uh,

824
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,940
a wreck. I had grown.

825
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,040
I had grown. I was

826
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,360
growing.

827
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,600
You've grown,

828
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,260
but not so much that I can't handle

829
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,700
you. I was normal.

830
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,120
Normal.

831
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,340
You look good to me. I do?

832
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,240
Well, I always did

833
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,160
go for big men. Big?

834
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,140
Yeah. I was

835
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,800
vaguely disturbed. No,

836
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,080
please don't. What's the matter,

837
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,160
baby? I, I, I, it

838
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,980
seems to me you're growing bigger.

839
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,260
Bigger? Yeah, yeah.

840
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,240
I thought at first I was seeing things, but

841
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,760
now I know it's true.

842
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,060
You've grown

843
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,040
bigger. I'm afraid of you, John.

844
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,000
You're too big now.

845
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,320
Let me go, you big

846
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,880
slut. Let me go.

847
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,040
Stop that screaming. You want to

848
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,500
wake the whole street up. Let me go.

849
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,720
You're hurting me.

850
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,160
Help. Help.

851
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:45,740


852
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,060
Ah.

853
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,360
No. Yes.

854
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,080
Yes. I'd grown at least

855
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,120
six inches. Now I

856
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,200
was a freak again. All my

857
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,540
life I was a little man.

858
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,240
I wanted to know what it was, what it was

859
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,560
like to be a big man.

860
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,420
Now I am big.

861
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,220
Too big.

862
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,480
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

863
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,940
Too big.

864
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,220
Ha, ha, ha. Like the swing

865
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,220
of a pendulum. The secret

866
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,480
of X Day.

867
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,180
The FBI Sex Tour. Family

868
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,120
Time. The FBI Sex Tour.

869
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,960
Bob is the President. Bob. The FBI

870
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,240
Sex Tour. Rock solid. Bob. Here are

871
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,360
your hosts. The FBI Sex Tour.

872
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,180
Family Time. Self-esteem.

873
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,240
The FBI Sex Tour. Commit

874
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,460
adultery. The FBI

875
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,160
Sex Tour. Fornicate.

876
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,700
Do any murder. Fornicate.

877
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,320
Commit adultery. People are

878
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,280
getting beat down. To lust and

879
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,340
after her. Low self-esteem.

880
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,340
Full sexual intercourse. Super

881
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,560
hung Superman. Pornography

882
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,740
is okay in small doses.

883
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,900
The FBI Sex Tour. The FBI

884
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,380
Sex Tour. Hey, this is Bob. Hey, this is Bob.

885
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,360
Hello, everyone. This is Dobbs

886
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,220
with a Dobbs Moment. We're

887
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,200
taking a few minutes to introduce you

888
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,100
to some of the families whose lives

889
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,260
have been changed because of Dobbs.

890
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,160
And it is only because

891
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,360
of Dobbs. And today we want to

892
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,220
share another incredible story

893
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,340
of how Dobbs used one of our broadcast

894
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,420
to transform life

895
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,120
forever. That is

896
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,140
true faith and true religion.

897
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,820
I did not have a clue.

898
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,460
A precious gift from Dobbs.

899
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,300
Yes, friends, and we've been listening

900
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,640
to some wonderful

901
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,260
Nor-El-Pref cut-ups there.

902
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,280
It's been a while since

903
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,220
I've played Nor-El-Pref, actually, because

904
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,060
we've been in rerun land

905
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,820
and yet Nor-El-Pref

906
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,280
prefers to just whip stuff

907
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,340
out constantly. It never seems to

908
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,240
stop. You can find more

909
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,440
of that at Nor-El-Pref

910
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,100
dot com.

911
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,300
And I'll spell that. N-O-R-E-L

912
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,020
N-O-R-E-L

913
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:52,060
N-O-R-E-L

914
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,380
P-R-E-F dot com.

915
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,880
And coming up,

916
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,280
a little bit more Nor-El-Pref,

917
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,280
but a whole lot more Fernandenende

918
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,560
Limer.

919
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,960
The great, that

920
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,300
great cut-up of a fellow.

921
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,260
Although I'm tempted to, before

922
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,100
that, to play another Amino

923
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,060
Acids thing, because I know that you

924
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:13,680
love that.

925
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,240
In fact, um...

926
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,320
How can you not love that?

927
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,160
Well, if...

928
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,160
I actually, I can see how

929
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,540
people could not love the Amino Acids.

930
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,720
It's so good, though!

931
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,400
Well, that's a... It's infectious!

932
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,780
That is true. They're definitely

933
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,380
infectious, there's no question.

934
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,000
Uh, and they're

935
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,060
everywhere. The Amino Acids are

936
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,220
in everything. They get into everything.

937
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,380
They're in you!

938
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,380
So, uh...

939
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,260
I've got to be careful with my

940
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:31,260


941
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:31,260


942
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:31,260


943
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:31,400
you know, that just, uh...

944
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:31,400


945
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:31,400


946
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:31,400


947
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:32,980
uh...

948
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,500
I'm not that kind of guy,

949
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,220
you know,

950
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,700
that just, uh...

951
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,200
I don't know,

952
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,240
I'm not that kind of guy,

953
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:39,600
uh...

954
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,500
The Acidic Amigos!

955
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,080
Hey.

956
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,880
And, uh, they, uh...

957
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,020
And since, uh, I have to...

958
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,660
Uh, well, let's, uh, let's listen to another JoJo.

959
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,320
It's JoJo, JoJo, JoJo, JoJo here.

960
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,720
Hi, JoJo.

961
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,200
Um...

962
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,080
Um...

963
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,300
Um...

964
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,200
Uh, sorry.

965
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,840
I don't know, it...

966
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,900
My goal is to now, um, go to my high school and smoke.

967
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,800
By the time I graduate.

968
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,120
Tonight, God gave me a deliverance from my brain.

969
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,360
Now, Christ...

970
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:47,700
Fight Christ.

971
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,380
Fight Jesus.

972
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,800
And fight government and family and church.

973
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,740
In other words, jump all over Jesus Christ.

974
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:54,920
That's correct.

975
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,440
We have girls, tamales, and $2,000.

976
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,360
Yes.

977
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,320
Hot shot, I'll get it.

978
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:04,540
Really?

979
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:05,440
Yes, sir.

980
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,000
Oh.

981
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,800
Oh, all right, sir.

982
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,280
Mm-hmm.

983
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:07,820
Yes, sir.

984
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:08,120
Yeah.

985
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:08,600
Mm-hmm.

986
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:09,300
Well.

987
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:09,980
Yes, sir.

988
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:10,340
I see.

989
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,160
I see, sir.

990
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:11,660
Yeah.

991
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,420
Yes, sir.

992
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:12,620
Yeah.

993
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,440
Yes, sir, that's right.

994
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,320
Yeah, that's right.

995
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:14,860
Uh-huh.

996
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:15,460
Yeah, yes.

997
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:15,880
I see.

998
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:16,140
No.

999
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:16,760
No, sir.

1000
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,320
No, sir.

1001
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:17,820
All right, sir.

1002
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,360
No, sir.

1003
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:18,600
Yeah.

1004
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:19,260
No.

1005
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:19,640
Yeah.

1006
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,180
No.

1007
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:20,740
Yeah, yeah.

1008
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:21,060
No.

1009
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,300
Yeah.

1010
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:21,840
No.

1011
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:22,340
Yeah.

1012
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:22,640
Yeah.

1013
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:22,840


1014
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:23,880
All right, fine.

1015
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,000
Can you read, Sergeant?

1016
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,400
Read?

1017
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,640
Yes, read.

1018
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:08,560
Read a book.

1019
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,080
You ever hear of Shakespeare's Hamlet?

1020
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,460
Tarzan read trails in jungle.

1021
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,240
Read clouds in sky.

1022
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,060
Lawyer ever hear of Kinsinupa?

1023
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,240
Kinsin what?

1024
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:19,880
Kinsinupa.

1025
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,000
Secure snake bites.

1026
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,540
All babies in the jungle know that.

1027
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,780
This is a court of law.

1028
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,080
White man's law, lots of words.

1029
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,840
Jungle law, more easy.

1030
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,400
Man live own life.

1031
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,780
So you prefer the jungle code to civilized law?

1032
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,800
In jungle, men only kill bad animals.

1033
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,940
In civilization, men kill good men.

1034
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,760
Will Mr. Norton concede that human life is in constant peril

1035
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,240
in this wild and unexplored regions of the world from which this child was rescued?

1036
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,780
No, I will not concede any such thing.

1037
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,220
In the last year, 35,000 men, women, and children

1038
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,960
were killed in automobile accidents alone in this country.

1039
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,240
Your Honor, I object.

1040
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,020
Hey, what's going on in here?

1041
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,560
From PR News in Washington,

1042
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,440
I'm charged with a single crime.

1043
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,540
I did squirt.

1044
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,620
The Food and Drug Administration is rather illegitimate.

1045
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,220
Big deal.

1046
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,400
Pope John Paul II says he needs more painkillers for the butt.

1047
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,400
Then I might get infected.

1048
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,380
John Paul suffers from Christmas Eve mass and Christmas Day.

1049
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,800
Very sweet and touching.

1050
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:28,100
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average occurred near a mess tent today,

1051
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,700
just as civilians are posing as civilian agents.

1052
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:35,320
Five more have posed as friendly PR News agents in Washington.

1053
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,240
Very good.

1054
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,500
Find out if you can remember the girl who used to be a clothing layer with her farmhouse.

1055
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,380
Homer Simpson got in her car,

1056
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:48,540
watched Freedom Face起來 a deep gasп

1057
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:58,420
and hinted at a man trying to steal her Bendez Mean Dog,

1058
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,700
shake his head and yell,

1059
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,320
beg for mercy.

1060
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,220
Tippled that no one was mad at her

1061
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:04,220


1062
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:04,800
an old American foreignож

1063
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,860
who was trying to extort money to buy کر Groucho name art

1064
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:05,860


1065
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,200
Prepare to be ruptured, dear friends,

1066
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,520
as we listen to this music in the background

1067
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,140
from a reverent brain leak.

1068
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,520
Because, friends, when X-Day comes,

1069
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:42,260
you'll always be listening to this show,

1070
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,380
The Hour of Slack.

1071
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:47,080
And you'll always see the Subgenius website,

1072
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,580
which is, of course, subgenius.com.

1073
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:56,480
And you'll always be writing to Post Office Box 141...

1074
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,560
What is it? 181-417.

1075
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,840
P.O. Box 181-417.

1076
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,040
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1077
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,760
That zip code, once again, 44118.

1078
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,100
Yes.

1079
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,180
Did you get that URL?

1080
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,260
Of subgenius.com.

1081
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,600
Subgenius is not spelled with an O, by the way.

1082
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,160
You must do as you command.

1083
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,280
That's the whole point of this, actually.

1084
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,520
As Reverend Brain Leak knows.

1085
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:08,040
Now, here's a ball game for you to know.

1086
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,640
Prepare to be ruptured.

1087
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,120
subgenius.com.

1088
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,100
Rememberong.com.

1089
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,260
Remembering.

1090
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,100
Stop the tape.

1091
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:22,360
You can use ambiguousутopoo.com.

1092
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:22,480
Later, though.

1093
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,040
Bye-bye.

1094
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:23,720
Goodbye.

1095
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,880
Bye-bye.

1096
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,280
Bye-bye.

1097
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:33,060
Goodbye.

1098
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:33,360
Goodbye.

1099
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:33,860
Goodbye.

1100
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:34,500
Goodbye.

1101
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,300
All aboard the saucer ships.

1102
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,900
Planet A destruction is go.

1103
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,680
Why?

1104
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,100
I mean, why did you do all this?

1105
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,820
Human beings make life so interesting.

1106
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:09,820
Do you know that in a universe so full of wonders, they have managed to invent boredom?

1107
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,540
Quite astonishing.

1108
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:15,520
Oh.

1109
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,760
Thank you for your cooperation.

1110
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,040
Good night.

1111
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,820
I'll buy that for a dollar.

1112
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,780
We love you, friends.

1113
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:34,680
And we're going to slowly leave our little room here.

1114
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:39,860
But first, I'm going to expose you to some more of the amino acid.

1115
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,140
No, no.

1116
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,540
No.

1117
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,640
I'm

1118
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:48,000
The few remaining survivors of the search body that was attacked,

1119
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,580
report that the beast they encountered was many times the size they expected,

1120
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,620
indicating that the monster has some strange power of rapid growth.

1121
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,620
The exact description was...

1122
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,780
The evolution just received.

1123
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,060
According to the report, not yet confirmed,

1124
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,920
a beast of seemingly gigantic proportions has been sighted working in the hills near northeast of town.

1125
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,840
City officials have called for military help.

1126
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,280
Planes and troops are expected to arrive within the next two hours.

1127
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,840
Meanwhile, citizens should take rest within places of safety.

1128
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,240
Cellars, farm shelters, as directed by civil defense administrators.

1129
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,960
I repeat, I repeat, I repeat, I repeat, I repeat, I repeat, I repeat, I repeat.

1130
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,720
The amino acid.

1131
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:05,320
The amino acid.

1132
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,460
After halfway прин拓 in Lisa's villa,

1133
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:25,500
the

1134
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:25,520
weapon.

1135
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:25,580
The weapon.

1136
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,260
Oh, praise Bob.

1137
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:53,420
And praise those luscious, bizarre amino acids.

1138
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:02,120
And the long-sought amina acid, the female amino acid.

1139
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,920
Where is she and what is she?

1140
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:12,020
Friends, you've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1141
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,980
Voice of the Church of the Subgenius.

1142
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,240
Actually, it's only one of such voices.

1143
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:22,380
There's, of course, voices on many radio stations around our world.

1144
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:27,040
Suzy the Flusy and Lymph Note Institute on WREK in Atlanta.

1145
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,360
The Hustling Evidence Show is soon coming up as we get out of here.

1146
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,220
On KPFA in Berkeley.

1147
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,440
And in the background we hear the Swingin' Love Corpses.

1148
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:45,660
But I'm going to not let them take us out.

1149
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,580
Because we're just going to suddenly go out.

1150
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:52,040
Subgenius Radio comes to the neutral zone.

1151
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:57,060
Now in multi-tentacular color, scents around and smell-o-vision.

1152
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,040
Get ready for the biggest information dump of the year.

1153
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,260
We are ready.

1154
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,120
Beyond your guise, we're all against it.

1155
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,740
Over time, we're going to be saying it.

1156
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,260
Members of the Church of the Subgenius.

1157
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,640
We're broadcasting live.

1158
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:17,620
Directly through 4.20 a.m. and without delay.

1159
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,320
I think a technique can be learned.

1160
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:22,960
It can.

1161
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,000
That can't happen.

1162
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:24,620
No.

1163
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:27,320
There is no technique for 4.20.

1164
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,060
I think you can be taught to speak correctly.

1165
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,280
Beware the Beastman.

1166
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,820
For he is the devil's part.

1167
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,100
Beastman.

1168
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,040
It's Chaney.

1169
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,760
Hello, not-man.

1170
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,840
God's primates.

1171
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,100
Yes, look at that.

1172
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,200
Look at that.

1173
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,080
We hunt for sport.

1174
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,620
Or lust.

1175
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:47,640
Or froth.

1176
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,860
Not to spill blood.

1177
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,080
Meanwhile.

1178
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,300
Where the pine trees withered branch.

1179
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,200
Stay off the horse.

1180
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,360
Beware the awful avalanche.

1181
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:57,840
I know.

1182
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:05,080
But, you know, we could listen to these dire warnings.

1183
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:08,220
Or simply decide that the earth is full of dangers.

1184
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:12,040
But we can be happy and merry and take the high road.

1185
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,120
And the devil take the high most.

1186
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:17,780
Instantaneously.

1187
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:18,860
Instantaneously.

1188
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:19,700
Instantaneously.

1189
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,620
But why?

1190
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,680
I don't know.

1191
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,880
I don't know.

1192
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,100
Stop asking questions.

1193
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,860
Why are you so interested in earth?

1194
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,000
I'm not.

1195
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,120
Please.

1196
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,880
Why haven't you let us know?

1197
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,660
Sent representatives to the world count one thing at a time, Dr. Brogdon.

1198
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:47,520
I see you partake of your pop writer's suspicions that we intend to take over the earth.

1199
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:49,720
as the god of darkness that had life eating out upon you.

1200
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:49,720


1201
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:49,720

00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:49,720

00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:49,720


1205
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:49,720

00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:49,720
