1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,480
This is Doug Smith, radio operator. I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,820
You're a joke! A dirty joke from one end of this town to the other!

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,120
The Self-Genius Power of Self-Genius

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:29,100
This is an urgent public service bulletin from your police department.

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,260
A dangerous killer beast is at large. You are asked to remain indoors.

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,520
This is an urgent public service bulletin to all citizens.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,340
This whole thing is cockeyed.

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,420
Friends, we bid a fond farewell to the great Maynard G. Krebs.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,840
Goodbye, Bob.

10
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,260
Knowing her fate, Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth.

11
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,180
On board were the Twelve.

12
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,620
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician, and the other self-genius.

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:28,880
The Self-Genius!

14
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,240
Power of Self-Genius!

15
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:31,260
What?

16
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,320
Slack's back with his spicy crispy Slackjack sandwich.

17
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,220
A spicy crispy Slack with fresh lettuce and tomato.

18
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,520
Only at Slack in the Box restaurants.

19
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,560
Doug Smith, Bob. Doug Smith, Bob.

20
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,580
Doug Smith, Bob. Doug Smith, Bob.

21
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,080
Doug Smith, Bob. Doug Smith, Bob.

22
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,060
Doug Smith, Bob. Doug Smith, Bob.

23
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,020
Doug Smith, Bob. Doug Smith, Bob.

24
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,060
Doug Smith, Bob. Doug Smith, Bob. Doug Smith, Bob.

25
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,480
I'm looking the soup in your soul of Slack since I can't understand what you're saying.

26
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,040
You can't understand what you're saying.

27
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,300
We cannot understand what you're saying.

28
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,000
Price Bob, Price Bob, it's not glass Bob.

29
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,400
From PR news in Washington, I'm sentenced to life in prison for funding Bob.

30
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,520
President Bush envisions as many as 180 people returning to Beijing.

31
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,140
At least 21 people have been ordered to stay on their medication.

32
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,160
On Wall Street, 86105564.

33
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,180
A new study finds that most people with schizophrenia are meeting in Vienna and they've expressed concern about PR news in Washington.

34
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,380
For 14 hours, Rudy Wells and his team of highly trained specialists painstakingly labor over the battered and broken body of Bobby.

35
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,660
How do you feel?

36
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,640
You're now faster, stronger, more durable than you ever were.

37
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,540
Just what did you guys do to me?

38
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,040
I don't want any part of any of it. I'm getting out of here.

39
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,760
Stay in your bed.

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,980
Wild man, wild man, this will stop him.

41
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,600
Then.

42
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,380
I didn't think we'd ever stop him.

43
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,140
How do you feel?

44
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,620
I'm stronger, faster, better.

45
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,000
But you left out one thing. I'm not a man anymore.

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,780
I'm afraid.

47
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,040
I'm afraid.

48
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,520
Personal diary.

49
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,760
I'm afraid.

50
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,500
But somebody ought to Moon Pie her.

51
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,620
What's the problem, boy?

52
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,780
I've been busting my hump all week for that withered old clam, and all I got was fifty cents!

53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,780
Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money.

54
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,680
Really?

55
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,540
Nah.

56
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,040
Dad, I've done everything I could and I've only got thirty-five bucks!

57
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,020
I am through with working! Working is for chumps.

58
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,740
Son, I'm proud of you! I was twice your age before I figured that out!

59
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,080
From PR News in Washington I'm found in home.

60
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,120


61
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,120


62
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,120


63
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,560
roads and other sites. The massive Bush administration is now grappling with two

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,200
Japanese tourists after an assassination attempt on William Rehnquist. Homeland Security Secretary

65
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,240
Michael Chertoff says corpses will be home. The third fire in more than a week in Paris

66
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,600
is blamed for at least 14 deaths. Authorities suspect PR News in Washington.

67
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,340
And the water gonna come and I have no place to stay.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,660
Well, all that night I sat on the lever and the moon.

69
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,640
Well, all that night I sat on the lever and the moon.

70
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,620
Thinking about my baby and my happy home.

71
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,680
If it keeps on raining, the lever's going to break.

72
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,600
If it keeps on raining, the lever's going to break.

73
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,100
Can you hear me?

74
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,160
Can you guys believe how this guy ripped off Led Zeppelin?

75
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,280
Yeah, it's remarkable what goes on in this country nowadays.

76
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,600
People come up with some idea and claim that they invented the idea,

77
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,280
when in reality the idea was pre-invented.

78
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,120
Well, you would think that...

79
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,300
Well, by the Ministry of Culture, anyway.

80
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,940
I mean, what has happened to the trademark laws and copyright laws in this country?

81
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,460
It's back to the Ministry of Culture.

82
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,140
A singer can rip off a famous rock band like Led Zeppelin.

83
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,780
He's probably made...

84
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,160
He's probably made $25 dollars off of this thing.

85
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,740
Well, did you hear about...

86
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,520
This guy was involved with Robert Plant in a sexually deviant manner.

87
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:43,460
He was paid off under the table and beside the table by some sort of Rosicrucian, I guess it was,

88
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,720
from the Legal Defense Department.

89
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,780
They call them legal aides.

90
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,000
And I guess they're all condemned to hell for their...

91
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,200
Do you think that...

92
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,560
All witches are condemned to hell, too.

93
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,440
Yeah, but who does the condemning?

94
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,100
I'd like to know.

95
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,340
God.

96
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:58,960
Is God?

97
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,700
God.

98
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,060
Well, there's one particular God.

99
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,020
Let's put it that way.

100
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,440
Oh, so he is the one in particular that's responsible for all this placebo mess and this garbage.

101
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,980
Well, there's the one that does the hell stuff and there's probably another one that doesn't.

102
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,380
So how many God, God, God, Gods would you say there is?

103
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:16,880
None.

104
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,340
None.

105
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,540
But I was told to say that by the Spirit.

106
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,460
I was seized up and told in the Spirit to go out and preach the word of no God at all.

107
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,300
The guy in the movie Wise Blood.

108
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,280
I was taught by an elderly Bolshevik.

109
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:32,800
I got wise...

110
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,080
Oh, no, that was the crazy guy that said that.

111
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,760
Well, he was...

112
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,700
Yeah, that was the elderly Bolshevik.

113
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,160
The hero said,

114
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,080
I am not a preacher.

115
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,520
I'm a festerer of wounds.

116
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,520
I'm a rubber of salt in the eyes of man.

117
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,920
Well, I had to face it.

118
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,080
I'm a preacher, all right.

119
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,380
I'm a preacher of Bob's word.

120
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,060
I'm an undergrown pubish, Stan.

121
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,780
What shall I do?

122
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,740
Send $30.

123
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,920
I've polished the bump many times.

124
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,100
Send $30 to J.R. Bob Doves.

125
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,080
I bet you never actually...

126
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,020
You never actually did that, did you, Dave?

127
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,540
No, and I wonder...

128
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,600
I've seen that he would have been left behind if the exodus had come as promised on July 5th, 1998,

129
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,640
which may still be happening anytime.

130
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,420
Have you heard the phosphorescent rumors?

131
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:09,920
What?

132
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:18,400
That they're going around picking up subgena individually rather than this mass rupture that you had, you know, hoped to make a couple bucks off of.

133
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:25,440
I think they've been taking body parts individually, like your hair, my memory, Princess Wee's morals.

134
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,240
No, just kidding.

135
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,080
We have...

136
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,060
We have to throw in that...

137
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,320
We have to get those gags in somehow before we're gagged.

138
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,440
Well, thank God I don't...

139
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,040
I still don't have any gonads to speak of.

140
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,400
I just wanted to make that perfectly...

141
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,560
Did you really have to gonad there?

142
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,560
I mean, come on.

143
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,700
God, God, God, God, God.

144
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,880
That's the German word, you know, but we can't say the Arabic word.

145
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,060
God, God, God, God.

146
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,140
Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah.

147
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,020
We can't say that one.

148
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,160
How come God spoke German, Stan?

149
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,080
I'd like to know about some of this evangelical stuff.

150
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,840
So that we wouldn't be able to understand what he was saying.

151
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,400
Yeah, I think...

152
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,800
Yes, what is the...

153
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,380
If you're off something...

154
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:07,480
Well, we have some collages coming up that condemn the administration's foot dragging

155
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,260
as it dragged its feet off the rowboat through the waters of all the cities that have been flooded.

156
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,100
It sounds like a body dredging or something.

157
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,920
This is really hurricane season.

158
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,560
You know, the next hurricane is supposed to hit Phoenix, Arizona.

159
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,920
And there's one in China.

160
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,940
Somewhere in China, they're dealing with a typhoon.

161
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,780
Well, I heard...

162
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:27,780


163
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,760
The sixth one to come up after they go into the Omega, you know, the Alpha Omega cycle,

164
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,620
where they use Greek letters instead of funny names like Rita and Jane and stuff like that,

165
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,980
is scheduled to hit Denver on November the 7th.

166
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,940
That's where the eye will cross in the great, bolded, mile-high city of Denver.

167
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,220
For crying out loud.

168
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:44,840
Loud.

169
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,820
Praise Bob.

170
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,500
Praise Bob.

171
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,940
I think we have something about that coming up.

172
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:57,720
My daughter called me from Los Angeles to inform me that she was driving straight into one of those giant 24,000-acre Los Angeles farms.

173
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,200
Oh, Santa Ana.

174
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,880
Yeah, and I got interested in that, and I found this report from...

175
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,880
I'll go through this real swiftly, but to September 12th,

176
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,440
horror and disbelief swept through the greater Hollywood area this afternoon

177
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,320
as a minor power outage turned the city into a virtual war zone,

178
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,400
and local residents struggled to deal with the devastating aftermath.

179
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,120
Traffic lights fell dark.

180
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,420
Local gyms and sushi restaurants were without power for nearly...

181
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,300
30 minutes, and many businesses were illuminated only by the light of the sun and its blistering 78-degree heat.

182
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,420
Sugar in the raw? Are you kidding me?

183
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,800
sobbed local homosexual and avid salsa dancer Enrique Santoro.

184
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,200
I'm on a South Beach diet, and my insulin levels are going to go crazy if I use this.

185
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,560
Why isn't the rest of the country doing something?

186
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,660
At least 2,000 refugees, the majority of them beautiful,

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,300
will travel in a bus convoy to Beverly Hills starting this evening,

188
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,500
and will be sheltered in the...

189
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,040
8-year-old Spago on North Cannon,

190
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,520
where soft omelets with confit bacon and Hudson Valley foie gras

191
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,820
will be airlifted in by the National Guard.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,780
Well, it sounds like paradise staying, but let's get real here.

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,060
Halliburton still was given the Los Angeles Reconstruction Contract.

194
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,700
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Halliburton and them will be cleaning up.

195
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,280
They'll get the big money off of these things.

196
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,080
And not cleaning the swimming pools, and, you know, the sushi restaurants will be running again their way.

197
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,920
I mean, come on, man. Nobody escapes the iron fist.

198
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,760
Nobody escapes the tender little baby booty that's filled with...

199
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,980
All this is not anointing me. It's not...

200
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,920
The other thing was...

201
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,020
Well, this is the sad part about all this.

202
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,920
The mayor of Hollywood, Johnny Grant, told a group of embedded reporters

203
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,140
at a Cuckoo Roo chicken restaurant on Larchmont that, quote,

204
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,280
The scope and scale of this disaster is almost too much to comprehend.

205
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,900
Local car washes are at a standstill.

206
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,640
The tram tour at Universal Studios has been on hold for almost an hour now,

207
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,160
and I've been waiting for a rotisserie leg and thigh with a side of green beans

208
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,780
for upwards of a year.

209
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,740
In 15 minutes, this is truly our tsunami.

210
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,560
Jeez, man, you're putting up the barbed wire in Topanga Canyon.

211
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,040
Yep.

212
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,840
And all of those poor, those poor Los Angelinos.

213
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,560
I feel so bad.

214
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,480
Listen to this.

215
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,780
Listen.

216
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,600
Okay.

217
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,540
A group of chickens masturbating.

218
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:21,940
Geese.

219
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,600
Geese.

220
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,420
Can the geese masturbate?

221
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:25,560
Two.

222
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:25,980
One.

223
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,240
Two.

224
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,060
Three.

225
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,180
Two.

226
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,180


227
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,040
This geese aren't bad.

228
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,560
That's honking.

229
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,920
Yes.

230
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,920
You can honk along.

231
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,640
That is.

232
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,620
Ha, ha.

233
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,640
Ha, ha.

234
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,120
Ha, ha.

235
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,100
Honk, honk.

236
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,700
Honk.

237
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,800
Ha, ha.

238
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,500
Ha, ha.

239
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:54,820
Hoo.

240
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,540
Honk.

241
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:56,880
Honk.

242
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,680
Honk.

243
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:57,780


244
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:57,780


245
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:57,780


246
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:57,780


247
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:57,780


248
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,940
The mid-goose does the Mick Jagger dance.

249
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,680
I know that.

250
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,200
He has to lift the legs up a little bit, you know, and he put his one wing on his leg.

251
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,480
Oh, where's my...

252
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,800
Get the coxcomb going, yeah.

253
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,080
Where's my script of the devastatingly cool...

254
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,960
Stang, you're spontaneously among us.

255
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,620
You're not supposed to use a script or refer to any written pieces of paper.

256
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,000
Well, I have to because I have to say the credits, which is all Fernand and Andy Lee

257
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,460
Murr and Norrell Preff did pretty much everything.

258
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,700
And there's no sense in trying to tell people which part of what those two guys did, but

259
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,680
they did almost everything.

260
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,160
Well, who sampled the geeks?

261
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,740
That is hilarious and wonderful.

262
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,480
I don't know.

263
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,140
There was a...

264
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,220
We had some Beatles.

265
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:43,560
We had the Beatle Barkers did some of our background music there, and that was Kansas

266
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,700
Joe, by the way, doing the levee.

267
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,580
Now, he was involved in the...

268
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,540
When the levee breaks.

269
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,440
Ripped off the Led Zeppelin.

270
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,060
Oh, he was involved in ripping the legs off the Zeppels, or the Zeppelay there.

271
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,440
Yeah.

272
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,640
The brazen ripofferage.

273
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,840
Now, I'm going to play this devastating collage in a second here.

274
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,420
Can I ask you a question first?

275
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:04,800
Sure.

276
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,020
Because you're smart, and you remember things.

277
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,640
I forgot one.

278
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,400
Ontology recapitulates ontology.

279
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,160
What does that mean?

280
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:15,780
What?

281
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,000
I forgot.

282
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,320
Ontology recapitulates ontology.

283
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,380
Oh, I can tell you, but I'm not going to because it's too boring and it's all bogus, academic

284
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,660
bull pooey anyway.

285
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,180
I'll show you.

286
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,160
I'll show you.

287
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,320
I'll show you.

288
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,080
Okay.

289
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,080


290
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,060
It's a med speak.

291
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,620
Okay, here's the devastating collage, friends, by Phineas Snarko posted this, and it was

292
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,380
by Stephen McQuillan.

293
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,480
I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.

294
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,780
They'd anticipate a serious storm.

295
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,560
These levees got breached, and as a result, much of New Orleans is flooded.

296
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,300
He didn't think...

297
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,620
I don't think anybody had anticipated that.

298
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,040
Liar.

299
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,940
Saturday before the storm hit.

300
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:04,960
If we had a direct hit of a Category 4 or 5, and maybe even a Category 3, we would be

301
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,900
totally inundated with water.

302
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,320
We couldn't pump it all out.

303
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,620
I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.

304
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,400
The levees in Jefferson Parish, with the tidal surge that is presently forecast, will be

305
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:15,700
top.

306
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,000
We can expect our community to be significantly underwater, and for a number of days.

307
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,380
I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.

308
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,020
This is a city...

309
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,860
This is a city built on the coast, in an area that has hurricanes, and is built below

310
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,760
sea levels, and that is a super.

311
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,040
People have talked for years about whether it makes sense to have a city like that.

312
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,280
I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.

313
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,720
It looks like Hurricane Sluggo is headed right for us here in America's wetlands.

314
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,360
That's right.

315
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,000
And since New Orleans is below sea level, if a hurricane hit us directly, it could push

316
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,320
the water over the levees and fill it to the top.

317
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,220
Let's act now, before it's too late.

318
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,200
Theテレ e succes is already just behind us guys.

319
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,200


320
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,200


321
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,480
We going nowhere yet break.

322
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,800
My God God.

323
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,240
Blah blah blah blah blah blah, yeah yeah yeah yah yeah yah.

324
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,000
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

325
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,080
Guys.

326
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,680
clothes isэт.

327
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:19,680


328
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,180
Like you're doing.

329
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,140
Something else ish.

330
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,100
Good morning, America, how are you?

331
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,040
Wake up!

332
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,840
Say, don't you know me?

333
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,020
I'm your native son.

334
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,260
I'm the city of New Orleans.

335
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,260
I'll be gone when the day is done.

336
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,800
New Orleans is sacred land and I don't want to swim.

337
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,740
If it keeps on raining, that is going to break.

338
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,760
I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.

339
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,620
When the levee breaks, I have no place to stay.

340
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,580
Welcome to New Orleans.

341
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,940
Federal, state, and local governments are working side by side to sustain lives

342
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:06,960
by ensuring adequate food, water, shelter, and medical supplies for survivors and dedicated citizens.

343
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,480
Our dislocated citizens.

344
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,960
At that time, he was making a big deal about telling the nation that the convention center had been secured.

345
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,060
FEMA's moving supplies and equipment into the hardest hit areas.

346
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,220
All they had done is Geraldo Rivera actually reported on Fox.

347
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,320
The only thing they could do was they locked people in.

348
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,860
This is it. This is it. No sugarcoating. No political spin. No Republicans or Democrats.

349
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,320
People suffering. Let them go. Let them out of here.

350
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,900
Let them walk over this damn interstate and let them out of here.

351
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,820
I want to get some perspective here because earlier today the images were...

352
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:36,900
That is perspective.

353
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,520
Hang on a second.

354
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,200
That is all the perspective you need.

355
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,080
Hang on a second.

356
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,620
Anyone who walks up out of that city now is turned around.

357
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,980
I don't know, man. I don't... Let them walk the hell out of here.

358
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,620
Let them get on that interstate and walk out.

359
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,740
To the Walmart on the other side of the river.

360
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,360
To some other town. Some place where you can help them.

361
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,200
All you got here is thousands and thousands of people six days later.

362
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,000
Same clothes.

363
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,600
What do you think they're going to the bathroom?

364
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,640
They don't wash their hands. They don't wash their face. These babies.

365
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,500
There are so many babies here.

366
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,280
What the hell?

367
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,860
Come on and rescue me.

368
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,220
Six feet of water in the streets of Louisiana.

369
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,640
You simply get chills every time you see these poor individuals. So many of these people.

370
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,860
They're trying to wash us away.

371
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,000
They are so poor.

372
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,400
They're trying to wash us away.

373
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,600
They are so poor.

374
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,100
Some people got lost in the flood.

375
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,260
And they are so black.

376
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,440
Some people got away on the rain.

377
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,400
I'm white. And I'm alright.

378
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,900
I said white! I'm alright!

379
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,380
George Bush doesn't care about black people.

380
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,520
Here's Barbara Bush.

381
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:48,260
So many of the people in the arenas here, you know, were underprivileged anyway.

382
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,900
This is working very well for them.

383
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,140
They're being drawn to careers of service when the manpower of government is stretched thin.

384
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,860
We headed down to finally bring presidential leadership to the disaster zone.

385
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,340
President come down.

386
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,480
President's a little fat man.

387
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,580
He made a shame.

388
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,740
What the river has done.

389
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,200
This poor cracker's lame.

390
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,080
Out of the rubbles of Trent Lott's house,

391
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,740
he's had lost his entire house,

392
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,840
there's going to be a fantastic house.

393
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,300
And I'm looking forward to sitting on the porch.

394
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,620
Michael Cherdoff.

395
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,420
The Secretary of Homeland Security.

396
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,660
Sounds like he doesn't know what's been going on at the convention center in New Orleans for the past two days.

397
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,700
I have not heard a report of thousands of people in the convention center who don't have food and water.

398
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,140
Michael Brown, nominated to the post by President Bush,

399
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,820
director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency,

400
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,300
and director of the retarded mismanagement of Hurricane Katrina.

401
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,260
Confirmation hearings for this guy were 42 minutes long.

402
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,440
And only five senators showed up.

403
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,780
Hey there, people.

404
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,300
I'm Michael Brown.

405
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,800
Every person in that convention center.

406
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,720
We just learned about that today.

407
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,200
Sir, you're not telling me...

408
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,460
...that there are bodies that are there.

409
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:02,780
Sir, you're not telling me you just learned that the folks at the convention center didn't have food and water until today, are you?

410
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,960
You had no idea they were completely cut off?

411
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,720
Uh-uh.

412
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,740
The federal government did not even know about the convention center people until today.

413
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,300
You just found out about it today.

414
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,660
Don't you guys watch television?

415
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,240
Don't you guys listen to the radio?

416
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,320
I'm George W. Bush.

417
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,360
Disrupting communications.

418
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,060
And I approve this message.

419
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,560
Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job.

420
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,000
Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job.

421
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,620
The FEMA directors are complaining.

422
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,780
Although, Blackie, quite frankly, I've seen you in better shape.

423
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,700
Tell me more!

424
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,620
George Bush ain't a gold digger.

425
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,280
I'm in need.

426
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,240
But he ain't okay with no broke niggas.

427
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,880
I got a .

428
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,500
George Bush don't like...

429
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,020
Black people.

430
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,820
Katrina exposed serious problems in our response capability to the federal government.

431
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,980
And the federal government didn't do its job.

432
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,420
And I take responsibility for what went wrong.

433
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,220
Are we incapable of dealing with a severe attack or another severe storm?

434
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,580
It's in our national interest that we find out exactly what went on and what went wrong.

435
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,860
From PR News in Washington, I'm before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

436
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:15,960
And I'm in the midst of a very serious attack.

437
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:15,960


438
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:15,960


439
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,600
President Bush says...

440
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,300
Mr. Bush says...

441
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,220
I'm not going to save lives.

442
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:28,080
The Federal Emergency Management Agency says it will remain controlled by Iraqi insurgents.

443
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,120
On Wall Street 666.

444
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,240
Municipal utility workers are being blamed for yesterday's PR news.

445
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,380
This is the FEMA rap.

446
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,460
Disaster. It can happen anywhere.

447
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,580
But we got a few tips so you can be prepared for floods, tornadoes, or even a quake.

448
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,160
You gotta be ready so your heart don't break.

449
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,240
Disaster prep is your responsibility.

450
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,940
And mitigation is important to our agency.

451
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,500
People helping people is what we do.

452
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,980
And FEMA is there to help see you through.

453
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,560
When disaster strikes, we are at our best.

454
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,320
But we're ready all the time because disasters don't rest.

455
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:07,980
Alright.

456
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,420
That was for real.

457
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,440
Amidst all this...

458
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,620
Smells, did you get a sense that there was more crack?

459
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,560
I was struck people blame President Bush.

460
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,580
Blame President Bush.

461
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,720
He's the same guy that was on 9-11 with the white folks.

462
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,440
He hasn't changed.

463
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,200
The white folks.

464
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:23,840
The white folks.

465
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,240
They are blaming President Bush.

466
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,360
They told me directly.

467
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,780
They're blaming President Bush.

468
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,980
George Bush haunted by New Orleans to the last day of his presidency.

469
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,440
There are such low expectations.

470
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,500
Tell me something I don't know.

471
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,460
Expectations are so bad right now.

472
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,500
There are 10,000 dead bodies there that this is actually, Howard, going to be a win for President Bush.

473
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:41,740
A good one.

474
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,840
Right. It's going to be much better.

475
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,440
Amidst all this...

476
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,320
So now I'm supposed to roll over like an old bitch dog getting my belly scratched?

477
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,760
Yeah.

478
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,160
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but don't you think a man with your talent,

479
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,600
that your first obligation is to your gift?

480
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,900
Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?

481
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,120
What would that be, son?

482
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,280
I don't know exactly.

483
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,520
But I do know what you're doing with that drink.

484
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,860
You're cutting yourself off from your gift and from Audrey and from your fellow man

485
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,600
and from everything your art is about.

486
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,800
I don't know, son.

487
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,320
I'm building a levee.

488
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,940
Gulp by gulp.

489
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,200
Brick by brick.

490
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,460
Putting up a levee to keep that raging river of manure from lapping at my door.

491
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,300
So anyway, Bush is in trouble.

492
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,840
Bush is in trouble.

493
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,840
Bush is in trouble.

494
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,760
And he can't enter me.

495
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,780
Creepy little Bush is in trouble.

496
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,140
Devil Bill O'Reilly.

497
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,780
Eww!

498
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,580
Ha ha ha ha ha.

499
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

500
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:42,600
Okay?

501
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,980
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, O'Reilly's.

502
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,920
Ha ha ha ha ha.

503
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,600
Propaganda.

504
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,360
Propaganda.

505
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:47,700
You know it.

506
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,100
You know it.

507
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,480
You know it.

508
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:48,840
You know it.

509
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:48,960
You know it.

510
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,220
Creepy.

511
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:49,840
Nuts.

512
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,760
O'Reilly's.

513
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,200
You know.

514
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,520
Me.

515
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,540
Propaganda.

516
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,860
Now this is great.

517
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,600
Propaganda.

518
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,740
Ha ha ha ha ha.

519
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:55,980
Uh.

520
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:56,460
Um.

521
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,720
How screwed up.

522
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,200
Um.

523
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,060
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

524
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:00,900
Right.

525
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,500
Terrorism.

526
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,040
With affection.

527
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,320
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

528
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,260
O'Reilly's.

529
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,520
Creep.

530
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:04,720
Creep.

531
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:04,960
Creep.

532
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,680
Some weeks ago, Pat Robertson made a mistake in calling for the assassination.

533
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,200
Calling for the assassination of Bill O'Reilly.

534
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,120
Absolutely.

535
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,380
Most Americans loathe Pat Robertson.

536
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,260
They loathe me.

537
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,580
And, and that's the truth.

538
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,760
Creepy little bushes in trouble.

539
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,840
And, and that's the truth.

540
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,080
Well, that's what's happening.

541
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,520
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

542
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,260
Put it up.

543
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,940
Turn America into a secular progressive jihad.

544
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,600
Hey, hey, turn it like a refugee.

545
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,140
Talk to me like a refugee.

546
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,520
You're a.

547
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:38,660


548
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,520
But it's sad to.

549
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,300
Turn you like a refugee.

550
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,980
Talk to me like a refugee.

551
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,080
Oh, baby, it's sad to.

552
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,980
Turn you like a refugee.

553
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,560
Talk to me like a refugee.

554
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,540
Oh.

555
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,060
The Denver Metro area has been recognized by two federal agents.

556
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,320
President Bush says it's just the debris from Hurricane Katrina.

557
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,800
The nation also needs to be hit by the storm.

558
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,420
Our nation joins with them to pray for sorrow.

559
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,700
He's charged with sexual assault.

560
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,360
Crime of violence, attempted murder, false imprisonment, and other counts.

561
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,080
U.S. Marshals say ventilation ducts.

562
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,900
Ha ha ha.

563
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,380
In sports, Rockies from Arizona tonight at 7, 12, 30, and 2.

564
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,680
News gets brought to you by.

565
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,580
The victims of Hurricane Katrina.

566
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,380
Denver police hit and killed a four-year-old boy over the weekend.

567
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:24,980
What's next?

568
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,220
PU.com.

569
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,140
I'm Barbara Bush and I urge you to cook yourself.

570
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,980
Barbara Bush kills one person every hour of every day.

571
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,680
And I urge you to cook yourself.

572
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,820
I urge you to get skin cancer.

573
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:46,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm ordered to pay restitution totaling $134 as well as fines.

574
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,840
Residents of an area of New Orleans may cause more damage to production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico.

575
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,880
And we share that dream.

576
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,240
Just before the close on Wall Street for 10-5-4-7-6-4-4,

577
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,040
North Korea has pledged to give up its nuclear PR news program in Washington.

578
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,600
Ah Bush.

579
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,620
Ah Bush.

580
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,640
Ah Bush.

581
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,320
Ah Bush.

582
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:07,820
Ah Bush.

583
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,800
Bush.

584
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,220
Bush.

585
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:09,380
Bush.

586
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:09,480
Bush.

587
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:09,540
Bush.

588
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:09,580
Bush.

589
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:09,580


590
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:09,580


591
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:09,580


592
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:09,580


593
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:09,580


594
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:09,580


595
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:09,580


596
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:09,580


597
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,240
We would like to have a marriage abolished.

598
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,680
I just wish Katrina had only hit Bush.

599
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,280
From PR News in Washington, I'm from Paris.

600
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,340
The federal emergency has ordered tens of thousands of Katrina evacuees.

601
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,480
An agency's spokeswoman says the agency says the agency's spokeswoman approved hundreds

602
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,860
of dollars too hastily.

603
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,080
On Wall Street, 10-10-4-4-5-5-20.

604
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:36,740
French police have been recruiting terrorist insurgents to fight PR News in Washington.

605
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,660
I am the president of the United States.

606
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:37,660


607
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:37,660


608
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:37,660


609
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,060
I know about religion.

610
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,840
I know about religion.

611
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,920
He's down in my heart.

612
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:57,840
The head imam, Pat Robertson, has issued a fatwa against the president of Venezuela.

613
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,640
Where all the guppies come from.

614
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,980
It's time to play the blame game.

615
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,220
Blame.

616
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,280
Let's see how much time we can waste doing this before Lisa comes back.

617
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,100
Right in the middle of when we were supposed to start doing the blame game.

618
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,080
Who's Lisa?

619
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,860
Actually, that gives me a chance to give credits where credits are due.

620
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,480
We don't know who did the L.A. News thing that I read.

621
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,040
But it was signed by Joshua Gates.

622
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,180
Actor and victim.

623
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,080
Victim.

624
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,400
And posted by Bike Painter.

625
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,900
That first criminal incompetence collage was by Steve.

626
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,460
And all the rest were by Fernand and Andy Lemur who does PR News.

627
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,800
And also Norel Pref.

628
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,880
That's spelled N-O-R-E-L-P-R-E-F dot com.

629
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,880
Where you can get that and also his heavy confetti, heavy confetti-ish music.

630
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,880
Well, pref is also the Croatian word for fart.

631
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,480
Which you're not allowed to say.

632
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,240
No.

633
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,920
But you can believe in such a thing.

634
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,520
You don't have to reiterate it.

635
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,560
That was a stinky thing to say.

636
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,920
Hey, I think it's time to play the blame game.

637
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,240
Blame game.

638
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,320
See you later.

639
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,180
Bye.

640
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,220
Bye.

641
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:19,540


642
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:19,540


643
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:19,540


644
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:19,540


645
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:19,540


646
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:19,540


647
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,380
Bye.

648
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:20,800
Bye.

649
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,340
Bye.

650
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:21,800
Bye.

651
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,220
Bye.

652
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,240
Bye.

653
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:57,660
That was Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Princess We Are Dough.

654
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:57,760
Dough.

655
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,100
I'd like to thank everyone here of the Academy that made these wonderful boots for me

656
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:09,600
and this very, very stylish armpit gatherer that's keeping me from moving here off the stage.

657
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,720
And to you, the Reverend Ivan Stang, producer of these artifacts,

658
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,580
and you, the lovely Miss We Are Princess, I must say, Princess We Are Dough,

659
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,440
thank you for the royal romping.

660
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,160
I've been, well, I've not yet recovered,

661
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,480
but...

662
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,520
When I do, I promise I'll ride those ships.

663
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:37,520
I'll ride those axing damn freaking ships off into the blue cosmos.

664
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:45,500
One day, Bob's words will be in my brain, buzzing the back of my vertebrae.

665
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,740
Hey, did you know I had a really, really funny erectile tissue?

666
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,700
Or not, it's called a cartilage, actually.

667
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,480
No, I didn't.

668
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,980
Everybody has one about his day.

669
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,280
Is it really funny?

670
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,940
No, it's not any funnier than any of the rest of yours.

671
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,700
It's pretty much the same.

672
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:07,160
Speaking of funny birthdays and the October subgenius holidays...

673
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,380
What is the October birthmark for these funny people, too, Stang?

674
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:17,940
Well, here at Cleveland's beautiful WCSB station studios,

675
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,220
it's October 2nd.

676
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,700
It's probably not when most people hear this, but...

677
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:23,880
Come on.

678
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,660
The great Reverend Numo...

679
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,460
Come on.

680
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:27,460


681
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:27,460


682
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:27,460


683
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:27,460


684
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:27,460


685
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:27,460


686
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:27,460


687
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:27,460


688
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:27,460


689
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:27,460


690
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:27,460


691
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:27,460


692
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:38,500
And he puts together a subgenius calendar, which every month it lists the birthdays and

693
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,340
the special holidays.

694
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,860
We missed yesterday's Dissension of the Lawyers Day.

695
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,580
St. Red Fox's birthday is today.

696
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,060
Today we have all salivated.

697
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,260
St. Red Fox.

698
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,720
St. Red Fox.

699
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,020
Tomorrow, St. Gomer, which I presume means Gomer Pyle.

700
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,380
Of course.

701
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,260
And by a weird coincidence, I have a...

702
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,360
song by

703
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,640
Gomer Pyle. I have

704
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,840
some pictures of Gomer Pyle

705
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,840
in the bathtub. The lattice of coincidence is just

706
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,980
beyond... Well, it is a coincidence because it's also the

707
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,620
birthday of

708
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,120
Gumby and Frank Sinatra

709
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,660
and another song I had

710
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,200
queued up was a song

711
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,840
about Gumby by

712
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,160
Frank Sinatra Jr. How old is Frank

713
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,420
Gumby now? This is way too messed up.

714
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,100
Well, I mean, synchronistically, how...

715
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,060
The original Frank Sinatra? No, the

716
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,820
Gumby version. He is,

717
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,720
is, she is, it is. How many years now

718
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,760
has Gumby been riding the train? Well, Gumby

719
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,680
started shooting in Dallas in the

720
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,720
60s. He's been a heroin addict since the

721
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,560
60s? He started shooting...

722
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,980
Or he was born. Art Clokey

723
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,100
gave birth

724
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,680
to Gumby

725
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,980
in, I believe, in Dallas.

726
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,540
Was that an intro? Well, a guy named

727
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,460
Foggy actually shot that

728
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,980
stop action of that claymation.

729
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,280
I often wondered...

730
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,280
You know, back in those

731
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,280
days, they had to shoot

732
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,560
Kodachrome, which was

733
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,520
an ASA of 25, which meant

734
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,360
you had to have really bright lights.

735
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,720
And I've worked with claymation

736
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,560
and that stuff kind of sags

737
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,440
and goops up and melts under those

738
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,420
bright lights and also gives you terrible

739
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,480
skin diseases. So I

740
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,160
often wondered, how did they keep

741
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,340
Gumby hard? Hard enough

742
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,240
to model. Is that what

743
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,580
Pokey was there for? Unlike Ickthorish,

744
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,040
Gumby had no wings of

745
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,880
wax which to burn under the heat of the sun.

746
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,620
Who was Gumby's all-body

747
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:25,620


748
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,500
fluffer?

749
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,660
Full sunlight, though, because his nature

750
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,440
begins to drift and change like a

751
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,500
werewolf. Did you know that,

752
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,440
Stan? Of course you did. Yes, of course.

753
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,260
It indicates a possibility of where

754
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,420
his name came from. Well, I'm not

755
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,240
going to read off the entire

756
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,600
list of everybody who has a holiday

757
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,400
in October, but these

758
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,200
are reasons why you can celebrate

759
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,500
and fornicate as if

760
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,400
your very heart depended on it. Because

761
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,320
these people were born in this month.

762
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,900
St. Buster Keaton,

763
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,620
St. Genghis Khan,

764
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,440
Sawny Bean, I think Dr. Sinister there

765
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,220
would probably be into Sawny Bean.

766
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,140
He was in the same similar business.

767
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,340
St. Groucho Marx, who should be a subgenius.

768
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,100
St. Madeline Murray O'Hare, the

769
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,120
obnoxious great atheist.

770
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,560
The queen of no-god-is.

771
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,860
Sid Vicious and Nenslow,

772
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,720
St. Nenslow, share birthdays.

773
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,320
They both killed each other on the same night.

774
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,900
Alan Turing, who

775
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,300
both Emma Peel and

776
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,760
Lindy England.

777
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,240
Now, isn't that ironically bizarre?

778
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,920
Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis,

779
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,260
on the other hand.

780
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:26,760
On the same day.

781
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,160
St. Richelieu, St. Barbarella,

782
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,420
Timothy Leary, Janis Joplin.

783
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,140
The day to be

784
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,460
named later is the 25th.

785
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:39,360
And

786
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,620
the 31st, Halloween,

787
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,760
is also the birthday of

788
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,000
St. Bob Crane.

789
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,080
It is mandatory, friends, that you must

790
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,040
have a seance for Bob

791
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,620
Crane on that night. It's also

792
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,960
pater nostril. And also don't forget

793
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,980
to take nylon stocking

794
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,140
and tie off your testicular vesicles

795
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,120
as tightly as you possibly can

796
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,240
on Robert Crane's birthday night.

797
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:02,920
That's right.

798
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,660
Is that what happened?

799
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,300
Well, they fell off before

800
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,580
he actually fell out. And that's why

801
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,140
he became a Rosicrucian.

802
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,300
Well, he wasn't initiated.

803
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,060
He was kind of rubbed the wrong way.

804
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,640
What? Got rubbed the wrong way?

805
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,460
The rubber bands were applied.

806
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,660
It turned black

807
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,200
and fell off. But,

808
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,900
quote, he could still use it.

809
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,440
Unquote.

810
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,920
Of course he could use it.

811
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,620
As what?

812
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,100
Speaking of tool using,

813
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,180
it was recently

814
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,720
gorillas have been

815
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,480
that's the

816
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,720
species name is gorilla

817
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,600
gorilla, has been

818
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,620
observed using tools,

819
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,000
simple tools like sticks, AK-47s.

820
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,800
Yeah. They've been driving

821
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,160
4x4s for years now.

822
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,600
Simple tools. Golf carts,

823
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,940
linoleum rug beaters,

824
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,940
golf carts,

825
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,840
instant eggs,

826
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,400
which you all just plug into your

827
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,020
necro wave or your

828
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,700
munition thing.

829
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,880
And also in the news, the third

830
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,760
of the rich space tourists

831
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,180
took off today.

832
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,520
$20 million for an 11-day cruise

833
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,680
from the Cosmodrome in

834
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,640
Kazakhstan, seen here on slide

835
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,120
three, via Soyuz

836
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,700
to the space lab.

837
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,860
And the rich guy

838
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,160
gets to

839
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,680
come back after 11 days with the

840
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,340
other, the Russian and the American

841
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,740
astronauts have to stay there in

842
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,420
that smelly box for six months.

843
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,840
This is what this is what it's like

844
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,980
when you become the commercial

845
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,820
piker nations of the world rather

846
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,300
than the industrial military

847
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,340
fornicators.

848
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,740
Well, I'm sure we have that to

849
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,580
look forward to.

850
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,640
They work their way now.

851
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,760
You and me will be caddying

852
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,620
for Chinese millionaires in the Grand

853
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,000
Canyon.

854
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,320
No way around it.

855
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,340
No way around it.

856
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,700
I know that sounds harsh, but think

857
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,940
about it. Yeah, that's if we're

858
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,160
lucky.

859
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,880
We won't even be able to afford one

860
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
of them damn new Nigerian.

861
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,240
Or 2007 Sun Tours or whatever

862
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,560
they are. It's going to take GM's

863
00:34:59,560 --> 00:34:59,720
place.

864
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,520
I remember the first nostril

865
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:03,880
sound.

866
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,760
The waves were so dense I could

867
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,700
hardly stand up when

868
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,880
I grew to be a man.

869
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,960
I later understood

870
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,600
the meaning of these dense nasal

871
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,120
waves.

872
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,700
Are you a member of the are

873
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:16,960
you?

874
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,080
Well, occasionally I

875
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,640
have been a member over the time of

876
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,100
my life.

877
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,480
Do you know the secret shake?

878
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,820
Well, you know, the secret nose

879
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,260
blow.

880
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,800
By nature of being secret, I can't

881
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,460
really say.

882
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,760
Oh, well, then you're really one of

883
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,640
the inner circle.

884
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,920
You're not a square, that's for sure.

885
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,660
Princess Sweet, taking advantage of

886
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,040
your expertise, do you think I should

887
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,260
play that Jim, the Jim Neighbors or

888
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,340
Gomer Pyle song?

889
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,320
Sounds a lot more like Gomer than

890
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,640
Jim.

891
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,140
How about the Orgon Pylon song?

892
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,060
We could extricate Jim's neighbors

893
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,600
and kill everything, you know, just

894
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,580
for the pure Bush like hell of it.

895
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,000
You know? Here.

896
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,920
Listen, listen to the spirit of

897
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,160
things.

898
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,080
Listen at this.

899
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,140
Go Gomer.

900
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,440
We're walking down the street one

901
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,600
day said, Hey there, my lady.

902
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,540
You sure look good to me and I'd

903
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,100
like to make you my baby.

904
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,200
Actually, I don't know that this

905
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,780
is Gomer.

906
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,180
What's he thought?

907
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,000
It sounds like he tried to make

908
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,760
both Reynolds his bitch one time.

909
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,440
That's a weird story.

910
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,880
Hollywood, everybody knows that

911
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,920
screenwriters guilt.

912
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,940
They were having a meeting.

913
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,960
It was on.

914
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,480
A corner of Sunset and they were

915
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,360
there and there's a bar below

916
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,820
there and I'll debar.

917
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,120
Tenders and everybody in town

918
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,100
knows about this man.

919
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,940
Are you talk?

920
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,420
Are you talking gossip about Jim?

921
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,060
I tell you, Jim, the actor and

922
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,720
singer Jim neighbors to put a love

923
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,540
love thing on.

924
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,640
But we're all heterosexual.

925
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,860
I what?

926
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,400
What do you call a dog monster?

927
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,200
I don't blame him a bit.

928
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,880
One of the sex God, but Jim

929
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,940
Neighbors is a sex. God.

930
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,860
You got a pile is a subgenius.

931
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,520
No, you got to remember back in

932
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,080
the day, man.

933
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,320
I'm not an educated sailor.

934
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,360
I didn't go too far in school.

935
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,180
But I can count and read and write

936
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,980
and tell a horse from a mute.

937
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,340
But trying to judge a woman,

938
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,620
boys, it's bound to bring you fear.

939
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,920
There's many different kinds of

940
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,560
girls, but they all got the same

941
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,340
size of years.

942
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,860
Yeah, be just grab them and go to

943
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,240
town.

944
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,320
Oh, oh, sorry there.

945
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,920
Are you saying Jim neighbors had

946
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,160
an he said he had an educated

947
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:36,960
phallus?

948
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,680
I first thought he himself actually

949
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,640
was like them.

950
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,760
They're educated fellas.

951
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,520
He was saying he has an educated

952
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,040
phallus and that's why he's

953
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,940
everybody's neighbors.

954
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,900
Come on, man.

955
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,000
It's not a real joke.

956
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,900
It's not even joke, but it's

957
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,340
what's the worst, the meanest,

958
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:54,640
worst.

959
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,220
Thing that you can call up a pink,

960
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,820
a human mediocrity that moves in next

961
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,700
door to you that starts with an N.

962
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,200
Mm.

963
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,540
Nosey neighbor knows neighbor,

964
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,380
neighbor, neighbor.

965
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,720
You know,

966
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,280
how long have you been a member of

967
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,800
the nasal forces, Linda?

968
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,540
And the nasal forces?

969
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:18,960
Yes.

970
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,540
How long have you been a member of the

971
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,240
nasal forces?

972
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,120
Your tattoo is fading and I think you're

973
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,780
trying to have Pucker fire way in.

974
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,000
I have.

975
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,000


976
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,040
Let's put this guy back in his

977
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,400
seat.

978
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,040
This is a good one.

979
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,560
I'm going to turn around now.

980
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,440
Turn around.

981
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,200
Turn around.

982
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,020
Oh, I like that.

983
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,840
Now turn around again.

984
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,460
Now, put your leg up here.

985
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,260
I'm getting dizzy now.

986
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,580
Now, this is not a circus act.

987
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,580
Just show me some.

988
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,240
Okay.

989
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:36,640
Yeah.

990
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,900
Oh, wait.

991
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,060
I'm in the wrong house.

992
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,340
What does this nasal pornography have

993
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,340
to do with the word Bob?

994
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
Or then the fight, the good fight

995
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,420
against the bad conspiracy.

996
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,500
Bob loved having his sinuses

997
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,200
frisked with sputum from many, many

998
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,140
different clients.

999
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,760
There were ladies of all ages who were

1000
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:54,760


1001
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:01,860
the night there were the dogs of war there were the winds of the evening that catapulted bob into

1002
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:08,640
his things that broke the wind in condition the wind a great breaker of winds they called him

1003
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,260
the cracker of all cheeks

1004
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:19,520
he was a fully blown man i mean fully grown when he realized his mission here

1005
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:27,900
he was a pilot light to those around him those who saw enough every every emission from this

1006
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:36,120
great emission area was a what we now call a lubrifart a preparatory emission thanks to mr

1007
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:43,180
sister to pave the way for a greater and thicker chunk of knowledge to emerge i don't understand

1008
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:48,140
though how so many different people can understand the different tone values and the strange rasping

1009
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,260
sounds and make sense

1010
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,020
out of it i

1011
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:55,040
i just can't to me it just sounds like an elderly uh... traveling salesman cracking wind with his

1020
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,500

1023
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:55,980
dang it

1024
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:03,740

1025
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,860

1030
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:42,060
well some would say why don't you shut up and listen to it but that's not what we do on this show shutting up is not an option

1031
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:48,480
now we must just gabble and garble on and on until it's just all done

1032
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,820
well now i do have uh songs coming up

00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,400
uh collaboration on the gumby theme which was actually done

1036
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,860
seriously and with no tongue in cheek

1037
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,780

The furry hair.

1057
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,680
Oh, but the kind, the kind.

1058
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,320
The ones with the very coarse, coarse brillo pad on your heads.

1059
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,840
And on your arms, and on your necks, and on your legs.

1060
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,120
On your feet, and your ears.

1061
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,300
Yeah, you with...

1062
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,300
Oh, wait.

1063
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,560
You're actually a piece of shaved metal.

1064
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,820
Well, thank you very much for joining the Tonal Parade.

1065
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,480
Gleam, gleam.

1066
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,320
One of the many things we have to see when the...

1067
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,220
When the flannel goes down, when the handle...

1068
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,600
When the...

1069
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:50,980
He was once a little green dab of clay.

1070
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,740
Gumby, but you should see what Gumby can do today.

1071
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,640
Gumby, he can walk into any boat.

1072
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,160
With his pony pal, Pokey.

1073
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:08,440
He too.

1074
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,800
And he'll find fun where there's none.

1075
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,460
If you'd like him to.

1076
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,620
And if he likes, he can change into something new.

1077
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,160
You know, this song really sucks, I guess.

1078
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,000
You know, Stank, when I used to sing that song, I was living in Bensonhurst.

1079
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,400
They'd sing me that song while I was a kid.

1080
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,380
I got beat up every day, you know?

1081
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,480
You know what I'm saying?

1082
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:34,500
Hey, Stank.

1083
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1084
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:35,560
Yo, Stank.

1085
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,140
I was living in Bensonhurst.

1086
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:37,980
I grew up in Bensonhurst.

1087
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:38,160


1088
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,060
And I was walking down the street, you know, singing that snappy song.

1089
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,400
Be snapping my fingers and so forth, you know?

1090
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,180
And a guy come up and kick my ass all over the place, you know?

1091
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,940
Up and down a boy walk all the way to Canarsie Park.

1092
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,860
I wouldn't blame you.

1093
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,500
What the hell's up with that?

1094
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,180
I wouldn't blame you.

1095
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,440
I wouldn't blame him either.

1096
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,680
As long as we have to wear this strange foreskin on the top of our heads.

1097
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,140
It smells horrible.

1098
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,500
Ah, don't mind the smell.

1099
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,520
Soon we'll be through that veil of innoxious gases.

1100
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,480
Excuse me.

1101
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,060
Gases.

1102
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,440
And we'll be through the gaseous walls.

1103
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:08,940
And everything will be...

1104
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,520
Oh, ah, we're in the wrong area.

1105
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,520
Geez, oh my.

1106
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,220
Oh, there's the usher over there.

1107
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,260
Uh, ma'am?

1108
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:15,940
Sir, ma'am?

1109
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,200
Ma'am, sir?

1110
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,940
Yes, yes, ma'am, sir, that's me.

1111
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,040
I'd like to know how the hell out of here.

1112
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:21,740
Get...

1113
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:22,780
Well, uh...

1114
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,440
Can I get out, please?

1115
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,520
Yes, um, just, uh, keep following the yellow brick road and pretty soon you'll get there.

1116
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,780
Follow that wafting smell of, uh, burning garbage.

1117
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,460
That's the fop from Bob's pipe.

1118
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,860
It's burning garbage and a vomit stain.

1119
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,560
That's not a yellow brick road at all.

1120
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,800
Follow that smell of garbage from Bob's pipe.

1121
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,020
It is a yellow brick road.

1122
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,140
It's a smell of garbage.

1123
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:38,600
It's a smell that...

1124
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,380
Just keep believing it's a yellow brick road and it'll become a yellow brick road.

1125
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,700
I can't do anything with my belief system.

1126
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,040
I'm going to have to report on what I see.

1127
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:47,560
I'm an observer.

1128
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,240
Yes.

1129
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:49,580
Yes.

1130
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:53,720
Yes.

1131
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,520
Yes.

1132
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:09,520


1133
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,700
Yes.

1134
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,240
Yes.

1135
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:18,280


1136
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,800
No.

1137
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,760
No.

1138
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,760


1139
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,760


1140
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,760


1141
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,760


1142
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,760


1143
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,760


1144
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,760


1145
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,760


1146
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,760


1147
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,760


1148
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,760


1149
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,760


1150
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,760


1151
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,760


1152
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,800
No.

1153
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:32,800


1154
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:32,800


1155
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:32,800


1156
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:32,800


1157
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:32,800


1158
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:32,800


1159
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:32,800


1160
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:32,800


1161
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:32,800


1162
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:32,800


1163
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:32,800


1164
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:32,800


1165
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:32,800


1166
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:32,800


1167
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:32,840
No.

1168
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:32,840


1169
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:32,840


1170
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:32,840


1171
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:32,840


1172
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:32,840


1173
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:32,840


1174
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:32,840


1175
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,620
No.

1176
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:33,620


1177
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:33,620


1178
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:33,620


1179
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:33,620


1180
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:33,620


1181
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:33,620


1182
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:33,620


1183
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:33,620


1184
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,280
No.

1185
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,300
And his greatsies eat shit in

1186
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,820
And jackdaws like smoking

1187
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,800
Piss your money away

1188
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,340
There won't be no rainy day

1189
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,960
And Bob will sell you all the sun

1190
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,380
He's unlike with Joe the one

1191
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,140
But he ain't no man

1192
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,920
He ain't no God

1193
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,120
I don't wanna walk the streets

1194
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,380
The path Bob's tried

1195
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,140
He ain't no man

1196
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,900
He ain't no God

1197
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,020
I don't wanna walk the path

1198
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,340
Bob's tried

1199
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,940
At his desk in Dallas

1200
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,500
When Jackdaw sits smoking

1201
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,920
Behind his mirrored windows

1202
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,100
When Jackdaw sits smoking

1203
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,920
Let up your pipe

1204
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,600
Let go the smoke

1205
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,420
This is smack

1206
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,160
It ain't no joke

1207
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,820
Crispy to Bob

1208
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,680
Lift up your chain

1209
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,200
And you will pay to know what you think

1210
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,000
But he ain't no man

1211
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,840
He ain't no God

1212
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,500
I don't wanna walk the path

1213
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,360
Bob's tried

1214
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,100
He ain't no man

1215
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,900
He ain't no God

1216
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,500
I don't wanna walk the path

1217
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,340
Bob's tried

1218
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,880
On the stage in Frisco

1219
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,440
When Jackdaw's face smoking

1220
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,240
With eight bullets in his hand man

1221
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,400
Jackdaw's face smoking

1222
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,040
Throw your strings

1223
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,800
Put them to use

1224
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,220
Bob will be your best excuse

1225
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,000
Bob for me

1226
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,780
And Bob for you

1227
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,120
No matter what

1228
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,320
A little thumbs or two

1229
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,180
But he ain't no man

1230
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,000
He ain't no God

1231
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,720
I don't wanna walk the path

1232
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,500
Bob's tried

1233
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,260
He ain't no man

1234
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,120
He ain't no God

1235
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,860
I don't wanna walk the path

1236
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,260
Fuck

1237
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:07,360
Fuck

1238
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,140
Tickets for the

1239
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:30,680
Dobbs bar

1240
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,020
Thank you

1241
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,080
Oh yes here's my ticket

1242
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,360
That was Lost Souls Incorporated

1243
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,940
You don't want to

1244
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,080
Lost Souls Incorporated

1245
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,460
Themselves friends from the

1246
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,340
Unreleased subgenius

1247
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,980
Album The Hairs

1248
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,820
In Bob's Ears

1249
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,360
I think the Lost Souls

1250
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,860
Were part of the

1251
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,680
Babashanti

1252
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,400
Sect

1253
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,640
They're a sect of the Babashanti

1254
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,660
Or the Babadreds

1255
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,300
The dread cult

1256
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,380
The Babadreds

1257
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,660
And like herring they communicate

1258
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,820
With each other via a high

1259
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,600
Pitched raspberry like sound

1260
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,760
Emitted from their anuses

1261
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,680
Well yes of course it goes along with the

1262
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,580
High pitched sounds emitted from their anuses

1263
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,800
Which came first the smoke or the

1264
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,120
Sound

1265
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,040
The herring which came first

1266
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,260
But you don't want to tread the path

1267
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,740
That Bob tried

1268
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,600
Actually the herring's not even breathing hard

1269
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,180
Well let's give it a little poke here

1270
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,200
Hey wait a minute

1271
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,100
We can forget this herring

1272
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,660
We gotta get back on the path to Bob

1273
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,420
Smoke on there baby

1274
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,860
Bob try

1275
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,120
That feels terrible

1276
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,580
What's happening to my

1277
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,160
Just follow the trail

1278
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,260
The trail of cotter pins and jello

1279
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,400
I'm trying look they're falling apart

1280
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,660
It's up to you Dave

1281
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:52,820
The jello is slippery and the cotter pins

1282
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,100
Must find Bob

1283
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,100
Keep on saying keep smoking this

1284
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,180
And look at the cotter pins as the jello molds fold

1285
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,560
And I can't keep my eyes focused on that

1286
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:01,940
Pipe

1287
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,780
In the distance with all this confusion

1288
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,260
And what's that

1289
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,120
Why

1290
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,040
I don't know

1291
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,960
It's some sort of suspense sound

1292
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,820
Made by an orchestra or some group of people with instruments

1293
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:14,380
That usually means something terrible is about to happen

1294
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,340
It could happen

1295
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,980
Look there's a cave and there's a sign that says

1296
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,680
Don't enter monster inside

1297
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,780
Oh man let's go

1298
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,360
What a set up couldn't it have been a little bit more subtle

1299
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,380
If we don't go in there everything will have to stop now

1300
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:27,700
Well we don't have to necessarily

1301
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,960
We can like wait around and be scared before we go

1302
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,300
Somebody has to go in there and get killed

1303
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:31,780
Alright

1304
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,540
Otherwise what have we got

1305
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,340
Do we have any ethnic people we can send in there

1306
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,480
So the rest of the white people

1307
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,320
Yeah yeah well first

1308
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,180
But eventually

1309
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,880
Eventually you're probably going to have to get killed

1310
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,000
Oh yeah there's nobody else

1311
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,140
And I'll have to save her

1312
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,660
Well you could also sacrifice her to elude

1313
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,000
Well it's not one of those

1314
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,700
No no no

1315
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,600
Somebody has to save her

1316
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,440
Not a virgin yeah

1317
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,020
We don't have a show

1318
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:52,940
Yeah not a virgin

1319
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:53,720
But anyway okay

1320
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,780
What do I do

1321
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:55,500
What

1322
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,180
Well why ask

1323
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,100
Go in the cave where it says the monster

1324
00:51:59,100 --> 00:51:59,600
Okay

1325
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,760
I don't have to do anything but be coerced into having my head ripped off

1326
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,000
Alright I'll just

1327
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,620
Wait look

1328
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,980
A pair of brand new shiny booties

1329
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,980
Look they've got little points on the end of them

1330
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,980
I don't have to do anything for any of you people

1331
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,460
I believe in a new Dobbs

1332
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,420
I believe in a new word

1333
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:22,240
Fool you've fallen directly into my trap

1334
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,980
What an idiot

1335
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,520
But I knew he would do it

1336
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,280
He's so simple minded

1337
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,600
The sub geniusest

1338
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,540
Don't look at me now

1339
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,060
Such piddling earth fools

1340
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:33,780
Who are you

1341
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,520
What are you

1342
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,600
I am the true Ivan Stang

1343
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,220
Oh you don't look like the true Ivan Stang you look like a

1344
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:43,800
Master of the mimeograph

1345
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,940
The cassette tape deck

1346
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,780
You're a falsified profiteer

1347
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:52,600
Under 80's forms of fanzine publication in college radio shows

1348
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,740
Oh no

1349
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,580
Why are you laughing while I'm in 80's

1350
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,800
What's so freaking funny

1351
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:06,120
I am so much cooler than Steven Spielberg

1352
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:09,000
And his ilk though they may be

1353
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,500
Wealthy

1354
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,040
Tall

1355
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:11,700
Rich

1356
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,280
Intelligent

1357
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,620
Educated

1358
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,160
And other useless things

1359
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,540
They do not have Bob

1360
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,660
Now do they

1361
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,680
Yes but you are as useless as they are

1362
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,480
And I possess Bob

1363
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,800
Bob is mine

1364
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,240
Yes yes it's possible

1365
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,120
To own Bob

1366
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,820
Why not

1367
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,300
Why not

1368
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,520
Did I not serve him long enough

1369
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,680
Sweating under his grip

1370
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,540
In that dank cave in Tibet

1371
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,440
As he instructed me

1372
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,640
The so called initiation

1373
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,940
I'm still hurting and sore down there from that

1374
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:49,340
Yes I've paid enough

1375
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:53,640
And now I Stang shall rule Dobstown

1376
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,380
In my iron pinky

1377
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,700
I'm a stinky

1378
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,220
Master

1379
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:04,180
Master there are these forms from the uniform code ministry

1380
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,220
Oh those again

1381
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,440
There are these forms of the torturing forms

1382
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,100
Remember if you are going to torture this victim

1383
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,740
You will have to sign this release

1384
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,560
And this release here

1385
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:19,020
And I hereby swear that the strange activities

1386
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,680
Created on the back of this man's skull

1387
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,340
Although they may emit the nauseous gases and

1388
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:24,540
Impropriate

1389
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,180
Don't you know we have a rubber stamp for this

1390
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,080
Of another cosmos

1391
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,560
This is ridiculous

1392
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,400
Move right on to this document

1393
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:30,880
This is professional

1394
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,840
There's nothing professional about this

1395
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,360
I understand sire but it all must be

1396
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:35,980
Oh wait no

1397
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,500
What is this

1398
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,600
Could it be that he has returned

1399
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,020
Is it truly

1400
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:45,920
Is it truly Bob himself come to destroy me

1401
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,460
Ladies and gentlemen this is Bob

1402
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,720
My guest today is Bob

1403
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,660
The art of positive persuasion

1404
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,740
Bob is a writer

1405
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:54,320
Bob is also a staunch supporter and a defender of the world

1406
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:54,320


1407
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,740
Stereotypical fast walking slick talking sales guy

1408
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,240
You know the one who sort of sticks their hand out

1409
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,120
And glad hands and back hands and slaps hands and shakes hands

1410
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,840
Bob thanks for being my guest

1411
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,580
And he is somebody that practices what he preaches

1412
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:07,900
Give

1413
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,540
You can see Bob's heart come right through it

1414
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,480
Bob this is what I like most about Bob

1415
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,780
It's giving just so darn wonderful

1416
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,280
Now you're in a position

1417
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,500
And is it something that I can do effectively

1418
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,280
In a five or ten minute time frame

1419
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,100
Oh absolutely

1420
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,200
It's a one on one

1421
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,140
In a group

1422
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:24,720
In a party

1423
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,380
In a most people think is worthless

1424
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:27,840
Well it is

1425
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,540
If we're doing this correctly

1426
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,700
Now get this

1427
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,000
We're being you know pushy or obnoxious

1428
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,280
And it always blows me away

1429
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,760
Bob you talk about

1430
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,640

Feel good

1433
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,520
You're out of line

1434
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,240
I've got ten of them in my arsenal

1435
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,320
You should devour

1436
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:45,660
Absolutely

1437
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,000
And you should devour it again and again and again

1438
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,900
Thirty seconds

1439
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,300
They're not necessarily ready for it yet

1440
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:51,920
Big shot

1441
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,080
Flies in the face

1442
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,460
They find this person's pain

1443
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,160
You know

1444
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,700

00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,960
Let's make them feel good

1446
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,020

1447
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,960
Bob you know Bob

1448
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,400
Absolutely a tremendous tremendous look

1449
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,580
We're gonna talk to Bob

1450
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,000
Hi this is Jack Trout

1451
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,140
Author of Trout on Trout

1452
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,560
You're listening to Bob

00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,900
And you can contact Bob at www.bob.com

1454

Could go on for days and days and days

1456
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,040
Now

1457
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:20,580
Feel good

1458
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,360
Feel to the rim and

1459
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,220
That's wonderful

1460
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:24,960
Come see me

1461
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,160
Right

1462
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,220
It may be time to consider right

1463
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,340
Alright Bob I'm gonna put you on the spot

1464
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,860
Well Bob thank you so much

1465
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:33,680
Bob's

1466
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,460
My findings are that he is a catatrophre

1467
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,300
I can't believe it I just can't

1468
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,900
You know in a way they're better off than we are

1469
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,260
There's no sense there's no feel

1470
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:46,560
Bob's

1471
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:05,440
I don't know what we're talking about

1472
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,580
Bob's

1473
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:11,380
I'm not saying he's a catatrophre

1474
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,400
I'm just saying it's a misogynist

1475
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:12,460
I can't believe it

1476
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:12,460


1477
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:12,800
I'm sorry I'm gonna call an ambulance

1478
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:12,800


1479
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:12,800


1480
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:12,800


1481
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:12,900
Bob's

1482
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,460
What's your name

1483
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,480
Bob's

1484
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,020
Bob's

1485
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,020


1486
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,020


1487
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,020


1488
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,020


1489
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,020


1490
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,020


1491
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,020


1492
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,020


1493
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,020


1494
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,020


1495
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,360
Bob's

1496
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,100
remove her breasts and memories

1497
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:18,980
and flip the laths and windows.

1498
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,960
I've blocked that completely out.

1499
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,040
Shout at the fruit trees in the yard.

1500
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,840
There's too many crows and ravens

1501
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,260
and things flying around my head.

1502
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,320
Kids, you've been listening to

1503
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,920
the subgenius

1504
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,160
radio ministry hour of slack.

1505
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,480
I feel like my mind

1506
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,280
has been corrupted by something

1507
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,300
much smaller than myself.

1508
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,380
Episode number

1509
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,960
one thousand

1510
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,380
and fifteen.

1511
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,040
The violent shows

1512
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,600
may be episodic.

1513
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,960
For more information

1514
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,180
on the church of the subgenius

1515
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,340
feel free to visit

1516
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:59,880
www.subgenius.com

1517
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,140
For more

1518
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,320
disinformation on the

1519
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,780
church of the subgenius.

1520
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:07,020
I could give the P.O. box, but nobody ever

1521
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,460
writes to hour of slack.

1522
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,480
That's where the disinformation comes from, right?

1523
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,500
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1524
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,820
Some people would rather

1525
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,360
get the disinformation.

1526
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,080
Then the information at the

1527
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,160
what other address?

1528
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,440
Do you prefer the disinformation?

1529
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:24,960
Perhaps they like to be

1530
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,020
Well, part of the game is figuring out which is

1531
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:29,420
the info and which is the disinfo.

1532
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,180
It's all a game, isn't it?

1533
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,800
Is it dis or is it dat?

1534
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,860
Is it a blind girl as she picked up her hammer?

1535
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,960
And these fine

1536
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,100
dat recordings are brought to you

1537
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,160
by the subgenius foundation.

1538
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,220
Now that's what I call sound.

1539
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,080
And recorded at the studios of

1540
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,640
WCSB.

1541
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,460
And at the studios,

1542
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,540
which probably means the computers,

1543
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,600
of Reverend Norrell Preff

1544
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,800
and the great

1545
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,520
Fernanda Nandi

1546
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,220
Lemur.

1547
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,320
Under the watchful gaze of Hector Berlioz

1548
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,420
in a lady's undergarment

1549
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,720
singing to the Norway Polka

1550
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,840
Chorus. Ladies and gentlemen,

1551
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,600
this is his finest

1552
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,000
...

1553
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,820
And now,

1554
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:15,380
and now,

1555
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,900
this.

1556
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,720
Quit your job.

1557
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,080
Slack off.

1558
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,860
What a day, what a day.

1559
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,700
Oh, it's a hot flying day.

1560
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,620
If I don't find heaven funny, you're going to give me back my money.

1561
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,600
It's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1562
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:59,460
Well, it's a damn good day to be talking to my Savior.

1563
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:02,340
It's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1564
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,220
We got a lot of bread to break.

1565
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,120
We're going to walk out on the lake.

1566
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,000
It's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1567
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,840
And it's a damn good day to go to heaven.

1568
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:17,520
And it's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1569
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:22,280
He keeps the rain off my back and he fills me full of slack.

1570
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,340
It's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1571
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,080
Oh, what a day.

1572
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,940
It's a damn good day, what a day.

1573
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,680
Oh, it's a hot flying day.

1574
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:37,480
If I don't find heaven funny, you're going to give me back my money.

1575
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,860
It's a damn good day to talk.

1576
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:40,220
It's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1577
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:45,200
Hey, I remember one night in this card game in Vegas.

1578
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,900
I was down to my last dollar bill.

1579
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,700
And Bob blew into town, laid four aces down,

1580
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,500
and made away that night with a kill.

1581
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:00,140
Yeah, and now my eyes are open and I'm walking on the water.

1582
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,980
Got a roll of cash as big as my hand.

1583
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,700
I got a guarantee for slack.

1584
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,400
Triple money back.

1585
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,760
More joy than I can.

1586
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,140
I'm going to stand.

1587
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:15,020
Yeah, and when I get to heaven, I'm shouting hallelujah.

1588
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:17,660
And the angels, they have carried me away.

1589
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,560
Oh, what a joy I will share.

1590
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,120
I won't need my underwear.

1591
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,100
What a damn good, damn good day.

1592
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:28,020
Yeah, and now I'm on my knees.

1593
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,880
The Spirit is upon me.

1594
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,460
And the angels, they join up with me to sing.

1595
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,220
Well, I began to sing.

1596
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,020
Bob will tune the old six string.

1597
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,700
And he'll play it in his own special way.

1598
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,620
Oh, what a day.

1599
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,640
What a day.

1600
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,220
It's a damn good day.

1601
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,220
What a day.

1602
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,860
Oh, it's a high-flying day.

1603
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,620
If I don't find heaven funny, you're going to triple back my money.

1604
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,520
It's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1605
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:58,280
Oh, what a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1606
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:01,940
Oh, it's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1607
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,420
That was Reverend John.

1608
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,280
Reverend John.

1609
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:09,980
From the American Radio Network.

1610
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:10,340
The album.

1611
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:10,700
The album.

1612
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:11,900
Bob.

1613
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:12,940
Ears.

1614
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:13,860
Precious.

1615
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:14,340
Bow.
